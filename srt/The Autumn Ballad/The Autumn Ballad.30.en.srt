=Episode 30=

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,239
Before the incident,

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,440
only the chef, Mr. Ding,

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,199
had brought food while visiting him.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,959
Sir,

22
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,120
I think something is fishy

23
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,160
about the whole thing.

24
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,480
What is it?

25
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,959
I'm not sure either.

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,839
The whole incident developed

27
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,599
in a very hasty and smooth way.

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,040
The late Marqius' case

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,199
was already closed
four years ago by yourself.

30
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,480
How is the case reopened?

31
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,040
Mr. Zhan's case is
linked to my father's case.

32
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,680
If I don't see to it,

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,360
I might miss the truth.

34
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,800
Whatever lead it may be,

35
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,399
I'd rather be wrong

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,600
than overlook it.

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,640
(Ding Residence)

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,720
He just died not long ago.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,559
An arrow from the Firewood Office.

40
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:48,880
No.

41
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,039
We fell into a trap.

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,559
Let's go.

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,399
Lord Liang.

44
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,639
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,320
Sir,

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,440
it's a crossbow bolt
from the Firewood Office.

47
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,199
Liang Yi.

48
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,360
You murdered an imperial chef.

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,880
What are you planning?

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,119
Yuan Lang,

51
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,720
I underestimated you.

52
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,360
Arrest him.

53
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,720
Sir!

54
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,715
(Ding Residence)

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Split up and pursue!

56
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,080
Yes!

57
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,800
Go!

58
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,199
Stop right there!

59
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,720
Song Jin, go!

60
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
He's here! Go!

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,239
Your Majesty,

62
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,959
we found this letter
where Mr. Ding lived.

63
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,320
This is Liang Yi's handwriting.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,959
For the past month,

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,760
Mr. Ding and Liang Yi have been
contacting each other via letters.

66
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,399
It's all black and white.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,359
Liang Yi couldn't bribe Mr. Ding,

68
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
so he threatened him
with torture by the Firewood Office

69
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,200
and ordered Mr. Ding

70
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,720
to temper with Your Majesty's food.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
Fortunately, Mr. Ding was grateful
for Your Majesty's kindness.

72
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,679
He knew Liang Yi would kill him
if he refused to help.

73
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,839
He refused to do Liang Yi's bidding

74
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,720
and sacrificed himself to expose him.

75
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,000
Yesterday,

76
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Mr. Ding requested a
meeting with Liang Yi

77
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,119
and informed

78
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,559
the Main Administrative Office beforehand.

79
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,119
I led my men there

80
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,000
but we were too late.

81
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,079
Mr. Ding was murdered.

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
We caught Liang Yi red-handed

83
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,679
at the crime scene.

84
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,799
However, he managed to escape.

85
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,279
Liang Yi has been serving me for years.

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,279
He's always been loyal.

87
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,799
Your Majesty sees
the goodness in people.

88
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,200
But I've been investigating
Liang Yi for months.

89
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,440
I have the evidence.

90
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,200
The officers in this list

91
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,440
are contacts Liang Yi
secretly established

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,679
over the years.

93
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,480
General He?

94
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,559
Liang Yi used his position
to monitor the officers.

95
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,880
He used the He family's
misconducts against civilian women

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,679
as leverage.

97
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,679
Thus, General He agreed
to work with Liang Yi.

98
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,359
And afterward,

99
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,279
the core members
of the Northern Army of Dashuo

100
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,040
were arrested one after another.

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,839
The records are
available in the archive.

102
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,559
Liang Yi abused Your Majesty's trust

103
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
and his rank

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,559
to manipulate the Imperial Court
and eliminate dissidents.

105
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,079
He committed countless crimes.

106
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,640
It's horrifying.

107
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:22,399
I suspect

108
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,200
Liang Yi thinks he's
lost Your Majesty's favor

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,559
after the Main Administrative Office
was reinvigorated,

110
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,079
so he started plotting
a contingency plan

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,119
to serve a different master.

112
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,480
The Crown Prince's birth mother,
Noble Consort Guo,

113
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,799
is very close with
Marquis Weiyuan's family.

114
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,359
With this relationship,

115
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,799
Liang Yi earned
the Crown Prince's trust easily.

116
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,799
His Highness is a kind person.

117
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,200
He is not as scheming as Liang Yi.

118
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,880
Liang Yi controls the Crown Prince

119
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,799
and commands the officers.

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,079
He even controls the Northern Army
of the He family.

121
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,880
He might as well rule the country.

122
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,559
I want Liang Yi captured alive.

123
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,160
I'll get the answer out of him.

124
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,600
Hurry up! Faster!

126
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,040
Quick!

127
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,480
(Sealed on the 15th of the seventh month
of the 27th year of Chengzhao era)

128
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,082
(Firewood Office)

129
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,520
(Liang Residence)

130
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,160
Stop!

131
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,000
Housekeeper.

132
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,472
(Plain Feathers)

133
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,520
Order from Official Yuan!

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,520
The Liang family

135
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,080
is related to Liang Yi's treachery.

136
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,119
Until the case is closed,

137
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,799
no one must leave this house!

138
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,520
All the supplies

139
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,479
will be transported
by the Main Administrative Office.

140
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,520
If anyone of them breaks the rule,

141
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,880
the whole family shall be executed!

142
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,280
Take them to
the Main Administrative Office's prison!

143
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,679
Guard this place!

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,840
Yes!

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,479
Sir,

146
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,280
we've confiscated all the records
of the Firewood Office.

147
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:21,640
They are being guarded.

148
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,280
Congratulations on your success.

149
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,359
Don't celebrate so soon.

150
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,640
Liang Yi is full of tricks.

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,719
Now that he's on the run,

152
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,200
he might stir up more trouble.

153
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,200
Sir,

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,080
the Firewood Office is no more.

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Even if Liang Yi is alive,

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,799
he's nothing but a wanted fugitive.

157
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,159
Do not underestimate him.

158
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:40,679
He's a capable person.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,599
We cannot let our guard down until

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,039
he is arrested.

161
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,400
However,

162
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
I'm more worried about

163
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,039
the mastermind
who set the plans for Liang Yi.

164
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,599
We know nothing

165
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,679
of this person.

166
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,880
I've had several battles of wits
with Liang Yi

167
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,200
and still couldn't take him down.

168
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,320
But this mastermind
struck him down in one go.

169
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,760
Using Ding to frame Liang Yi
wasn't a smart one.

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,919
How did he know Liang Yi

171
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,359
would show up there?

172
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,599
Sir,

173
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,520
even the smartest

174
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,440
makes mistakes,

175
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,760
so does Liang Yi.

176
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,039
I doubt Liang Yi wasn't aware

177
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,960
of the threat.

178
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,599
He was aware of it,

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
but the mastermind had a way

180
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,000
to make Liang Yi go there.

181
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,960
The intelligence of this mastermind

182
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,640
is beyond the two of us.

183
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,479
Are you saying

184
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,320
it's best that we don't

185
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
get involved in the mastermind's plans?

186
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,581
(Qiu Residence)

187
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,400
Treason?

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,119
First Sister-in-law,
you must be mistaken.

189
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,400
It was an order from the Imperial Court.

190
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,840
The manor was sealed right before us.

191
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,359
Rumors are all over the city,

192
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,119
how can I be mistaken?

193
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,039
Everything in the Imperial Court

194
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,960
could change over night.

195
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,479
Is Lord Liang's case

196
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,039
going to be put us in danger too?

197
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,119
Don't worry.

198
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,880
We were pardoned by His Majesty.

199
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,400
We barely had
interactions with Lord Liang.

200
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,159
We have nothing to do with this.

201
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,840
Yan,

202
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,880
how lucky is she.

203
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,479
When she left,

204
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,919
I thought she was ignorant.

205
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,280
She gave up her luxurious life
as a noblewoman

206
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,400
for a life of a wanderer.

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,760
Now, she got lucky
and is out of harm's way.

208
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,599
It's best not to get caught up in this.

209
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,760
I'll pray at
the ancestral shrine tomorrow.

210
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:29,280
May our ancestors watch over
the Qiu family

211
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,239
and Lord Liang.

212
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
Thank you, Official Qin.

213
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,119
At ease.

214
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,840
Our country values the trades

215
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,039
with merchants of Northern Liang.

216
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,039
You were attacked by bandits
inside our borders.

217
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,119
The Imperial Court
will see that it is taken care of.

218
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,520
Now,

219
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,599
the northern trade route
has guards and patrol.

220
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,760
Have no worries
the next time you travel here.

221
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,320
The businesses of Dashuo
have been waiting for these goods.

222
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,119
If there's nothing else,

223
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,200
I must take my leave.

224
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,880
By the rules,

225
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,640
you need to check the inventory.

226
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,119
If any items are missing,

227
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,400
I'll report to the Imperial Court

228
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:06,400
and compensate you.

229
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,159
It's just a few crates.

230
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,919
The things are all here.

231
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:18,799
I must go now.

232
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,440
Take them away.

233
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,039
Hold on.

234
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,479
Let's not take any chances
just to save some time.

235
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,280
Check the inventory.

236
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,919
We wouldn't want more trouble afterward.

237
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
If everything is set,

238
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,159
we only need your signature
on the paperwork

239
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,080
to close the case.

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,599
I know everything about my merchandise.

241
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,719
I know nothing is missing.

242
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,880
Where should I leave my signature?

243
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:44,080
Beixue.

244
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,840
Follow me.

245
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,599
Thank you.

246
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,239
Qin Xuan, you came back from work.

247
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,880
I heard it was a great feat.

248
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,239
I made some food for you

249
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,280
to celebrate your success.

250
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:24,799
You just came back from the suburb,

251
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,760
so you haven't heard about
what happened in the city.

252
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,200
I'll tell you the whole story.

253
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,119
Never mind.

254
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,799
Go home after finishing the food.

255
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,840
It's about Lord Liang.

256
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,840
Don't you want to know?

257
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,239
What happened to Liang Yi?

258
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,000
They said Lord Liang killed
the imperial chef

259
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,919
and was involved in treason.

260
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,320
He's a wanted fugitive in the city.

261
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,799
Impossible!

262
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,760
This is nonsense!

263
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,599
It's true.

264
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,440
The Main Administrative Office raided
the Firewood Office.

265
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,559
The Marquis Residence was sealed off.

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,080
Official Yuan was hunting down Lord Liang.

267
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,840
Anyone will tell you the same.

268
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,919
Why would I lie to you?

269
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,919
I'm glad Qiu Yan is gone.

270
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:13,039
But Liang Yi will never
betray his country.

271
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,280
Yuan Lang must have set him up.

272
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,000
A wanted fugitive...

273
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,679
He hasn't been captured.

274
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,320
No.

275
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,159
I must find Liang Yi
before Yuan Lang does.

276
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,479
Miss,

277
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,799
are the people with hat

278
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,880
from Northern Liang?

279
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,000
Mozhou is at the borders
of Dashuo and Northern Liang.

280
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,159
Many merchants of Northern Liang
come here to trade.

281
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,119
Back in the Capital, I've heard stories

282
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,520
about how hideous and rude

283
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
the people of Northern Liang were.

284
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,400
But now that I've seen them,

285
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,320
it's just that the men are wearing

286
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,640
a weird hat

287
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,960
and the women have a giant ring

288
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
on their index fingers.

289
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,559
Other than that, they look just like us.

290
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,159
Which elderly lady from the manor
made up stories

291
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,799
about the people of
our neighboring countries?

292
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,679
Northern Liang is right next
to our country,

293
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,880
it's normal the people
look just like us.

294
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:13,119
But their customs and behaviors

295
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,280
are a little different.

296
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,479
Back at the manor,

297
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,200
I've only heard stories.

298
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,760
Thank you for bringing me along
so I can widen my view

299
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,159
and see the truth with my eyes.

300
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,239
Miss,

301
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,000
there seems to be a wedding up ahead.

302
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:27,919
Let's check it out.

303
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,239
Let's go.

304
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:30,840
Great!

305
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Wonderful!

306
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:42,960
Yeah!

307
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:44,679
Wedding candy.

308
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:45,760
We have the same custom!

309
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,320
Indeed.

310
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,119
Yes!

311
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,559
Sir,

312
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,000
why aren't the couple wearing

313
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,880
a matching color?

314
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,479
Ladies, you must be foreigners.

315
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,320
It's our custom here

316
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,440
that if two people
from different countries get married,

317
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,000
they can wear traditional clothes from

318
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:04,919
their home countries.

319
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,039
See? Red represents joy in Dashuo,

320
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,960
but for the people of Northern Liang,

321
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,239
it's the color white.

322
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:16,080
Great!

323
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,880
The women of Northern Liang

324
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,919
have worn a thumb ring
since they are little.

325
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,320
When they get married,

326
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,840
the groom will take the ring

327
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:24,960
to symbolize the end of maidenhood.

328
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,359
It's also a coming-of-age ceremony for them.

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,799
Great!

330
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:35,359
What are you looking at?

331
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,880
Great!

332
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,919
This is a petal of the Anling blossom.

333
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,359
I saw this at the marketplace.

334
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,719
The merchant told me

335
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,679
the petal is an ingredient

336
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,000
of a special poison.

337
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,799
This is used during
a wedding in Northern Liang.

338
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,880
Its meaning is that
whoever breaks the vow

339
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,320
is as good as poisoned

340
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,880
and shall die a horrible death.

341
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,960
The people of Northern Liang
are indeed a tough bunch.

342
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,719
Wonderful!

343
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,599
This looks nice.

344
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,839
Miss, look at that.

345
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,839
It's beautiful.

346
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
Sir, how much is this?

347
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,599
Just ten copper coins.

348
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,680
Browse around.

349
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,239
I can lower the price if you're buying.

350
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,800
How so?

351
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,640
To capture the Inspector
of the Firewood Office,

352
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,000
there are checkpoints

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,920
all around the city.

354
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,160
They check

355
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,680
all of your crates and chests.

356
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:41,680
I thought Lord Liang was His Majesty's

357
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,400
trusted officer.

358
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,439
How is he a wanted criminal now?

359
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,199
Trust?

360
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,319
He tried to assassinate His Majesty.

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
The Main Administrative Office
caught him in the act.

362
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,119
They caught him.

363
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,560
Qingdai, let's leave.

364
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,479
Thank you, sir.

365
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:00,342
(Royal Academy)

366
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,439
Has Liang Yi come to you?

367
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,719
No.

368
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,479
If Liang Yi comes to you,

369
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,920
make him stay and find an opening

370
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,199
to notify me.

371
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,680
I can't follow that order.

372
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,479
Why not?

373
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,319
You promised me

374
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,400
you would make me Lord Liang's wife.

375
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,280
Now, Lord Liang is wanted for treason.

376
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,040
His entire family will be punished.

377
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,439
There is no turning back from this.

378
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,479
Do you want me to marry a dead man?

379
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,760
You got it all wrong.

380
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,319
I was merely ordered
to take him into custody.

381
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,239
It's not me

382
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,040
who wants him dead.

383
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:33,599
Does it

384
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,839
really matter?

385
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,079
We don't even know for sure
Lord Liang would be safe.

386
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm afraid this partnership can't last.

387
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,199
I beg to differ, Miss Xiaoxiao.

388
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,680
You must work with me.

389
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,719
That is the only way

390
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,400
to keep Liang Yi alive.

391
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:57,944
(I can bring down
Liang Yi of the Firewood Office)

392
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,530
(However, I require the cooperation
of the Main Administrative Office.)

393
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,951
(If you are interested,
await the execution of my plan.)

394
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
Someone set up a murder

395
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,839
to lure Liang Yi in.

396
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,400
I merely made use of the opportunity.

397
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,280
But it seems

398
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,839
the mastermind behind this

399
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,439
wants Liang Yi to be
doomed beyond redemption.

400
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,400
Liang Yi got away,

401
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,839
they won't give up so easily.

402
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,280
His Majesty ordered me

403
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,319
to capture Liang Yi alive.

404
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,319
If the Main Administrative Office
can arrest him,

405
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,160
he may yet live.

406
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,920
He might have a chance
to clear his name.

407
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,959
But if Liang Yi

408
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,239
falls into the mastermind's trap,

409
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,280
it will surely

410
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,319
be the end of him.

411
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,280
Sir, what took you so long?

412
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,439
You knew I was coming.

413
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,400
Official Yuan raided
the entire Firewood Office.

414
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,719
All of your hideouts

415
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,520
are no longer safe.

416
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,599
So, this is the first place
that came to mind.

417
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,000
There is nowhere safe in this city.

418
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,079
However, someone came to me

419
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,800
and prepared a safer place

420
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
for you.

421
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,599
Waiter!

422
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:38,839
So long!

423
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,040
Come here again!

424
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,560
Come inside.

425
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,239
This is an abandoned warehouse
of the Ministry of War.

426
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,800
No one has come in years.

427
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,479
It's under the jurisdiction
of the Ministry of War.

428
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,319
People from the Main Administrative Office

429
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,160
wouldn't dare search this place.

430
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,719
Thanks.

431
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,239
We're old friends.

432
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,280
Don't mention it.

433
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,319
Where is Song Jin?

434
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,719
Where is he?

435
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,760
To help me escape,

436
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,839
he sacrificed himself.

437
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,599
Stop standing there.

438
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:10,839
You must be thirsty.

439
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,520
Have some water.

440
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,319
What do you plan to do next?

441
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,400
Follow the lead of that dead chef.

442
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,599
What can I do for you?

443
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:46,920
Nothing.

444
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,319
Yuan Lang knows we are close.

445
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,760
If you helped me,

446
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,319
he would surely know.

447
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,000
Yao Gai.

448
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:57,839
Follow Liang Yi's order.

449
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,040
Run a background check on Mr. Ding
and his contacts.

450
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,079
Yes.

451
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,280
I heard that

452
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,520
Qiu Yan left.

453
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,599
We agreed

454
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,000
not to contact each other.

455
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,839
But given the circumstances,

456
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
I hope she never comes back.

457
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,359
(Sir,)

458
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,439
(when are you going to confess)

459
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,079
(to Madam Su?)

460
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,400
(You should)

461
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,760
(strike while the iron is hot)

462
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,160
(before regrets strike back.)

463
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,439
(Shut it!)

464
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:12,319
(Sorry!)

465
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,239
(-It's true!)
(-Shut it!)

466
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,359
(I'll teach you a lesson!)

467
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,319
(I'm being honest.)

468
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,439
(Sir, I'm sorry.)

469
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:22,205
(Memorial Tablet of Song Jin,
a beloved friend)

470
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,160
(Over the years,)

471
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,359
(you've kept yourself)

472
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,880
(to the Firewood Office)

473
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,280
(for your father and your ambition,)

474
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,119
(but you've never been happy.)

475
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:35,880
(Don't forget,)

476
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,520
(your father's last wish)

477
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,800
(is for you to stay out of)

478
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,920
(the struggles of the Imperial Court.)

479
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,760
(Sir!)

480
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,319
(I beg of you!)

481
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,319
(Don't avenge me!)

482
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,680
(Just stay alive!)

483
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:03,199
Here, miss.

484
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,640
Miss Yan didn't come back here

485
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,359
just to have tea.

486
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,880
But I know nothing

487
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
about Liang Yi's whereabouts.

488
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,280
Besides,

489
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,160
the Capital is crawling

490
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,520
with soldiers who want to capture him.

491
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,040
Even if he escaped alive,

492
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,800
he wouldn't stay in the city.

493
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,400
Right?

494
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,079
Yao Gai.

495
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,680
I didn't come

496
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,880
without knowing the risks.

497
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,800
He's been framed,

498
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,239
so he wouldn't just run away

499
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:37,800
and live in hiding
for the rest of his life.

500
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,560
If he wants to stay and investigate,

501
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,599
he can only trust you
since the residence

502
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,760
and Firewood Office are off-limit.

503
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,920
Yao Gai, I understand your concern.

504
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,560
But please understand,

505
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,680
was I your benefactor

506
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,000
or was it Liang Yi?

507
00:26:56,154 --> 00:27:01,904
(Main Administrative Office)

508
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,000
(Normally speaking,)

509
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,239
(Mr. Ding was working in the palace,)

510
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,920
(so there should be
detailed files about him.)

511
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,599
But there is no record of his life

512
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,839
before he started working here.

513
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,560
He has no friends in the Capital.

514
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,400
And most importantly,

515
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,439
the related evidence

516
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,040
is locked up inside
the Main Administrative Office's storeroom.

517
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,177
(For Ding Tixiang's eyes only)

518
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:22,489
(For Ding Tixiang's eyes only)

519
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,000
Sir, what brings you back?

520
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm here for the evidence.

521
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,079
You could have let me know,

522
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,520
I could take care of it.

523
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:48,760
Never mind.

524
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,400
I'll get it.

525
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,520
The morgue should be secured.

526
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,719
Why is the door wide open?

527
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,520
Where is the guard?

528
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,319
It's my mistake.

529
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,000
Sorry.

530
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:11,880
Keep watch.

531
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,560
Yes.

532
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,959
Great!

533
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,040
(As Loyal As A Subject)
(As Pure As Snow)

534
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:12,079
Marvelous!

535
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,880
Splendid!

536
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,119
Great!

537
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:52,280
Splendid!

538
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,000
It's me!

539
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,040
Who is after you?

540
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,079
I don't know.

541
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,479
Judging by the look,

542
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,880
they don't work
for the Main Administrative Office.

543
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:37,160
Splendid!

544
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:47,800
Spectacular!

545
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,359
What?

546
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:50,319
Hey.

547
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:56,599
Great!

548
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,719
Splendid!

549
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:12,236
(Memorial Tablet of Song Jin,
a beloved friend)

550
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,640
I'm alright.

551
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,239
I asked Yao Gai to escort
Qingdai back to the Qiu Residence.

552
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,599
Good.

553
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,040
It's not safe here.

554
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,280
Did you find this

555
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,599
at the Main Administrative Office?

556
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,000
They are fake letters.

557
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,280
I can't learn anything from it.

558
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,000
However,

559
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,119
when I was leaving
the Main Administrative Office,

560
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,800
I accidentally

561
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,120
found Mr. Ding's body.

562
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,199
I learned something new there.

563
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,080
What is it?

564
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,600
I smelled a weird rotting scent

565
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,239
from his body.

566
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,959
It was similar to the scent
on my father's body

567
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:19,919
when he died six years ago.

568
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,800
It smelled like rust.

569
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,080
I didn't notice it

570
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,840
during the funeral.

571
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,399
I thought hot weather
accelerated the decomposing.

572
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,199
But I found the same scent

573
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:33,000
on Mr. Ding's body.

574
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
I've seen plenty of bodies
at the Firewood Office.

575
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,520
I've never known anything like it.

576
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,919
It smelled like rust?

577
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It sounds like the symptom
from a poison

578
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,199
used in Northern Liang.

579
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
A poison from Northern Liang?

580
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,439
After I left, I went to

581
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,360
the borders of Northern Liang and Dashuo.

582
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,479
That's where I learned

583
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:56,239
about a Northern Liang herb

584
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,959
known as the Anling blossom.

585
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,280
Its petal is used to make

586
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,600
the Anling poison.

587
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,479
Those poisoned will
die after passing out.

588
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,719
But there won't be

589
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,399
other signs of poisoning.

590
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,280
In the next few days
after the person deceased,

591
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,919
there will be a rotting scent
that's similar to rust.

592
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:20,560
The bones will turn
greenish black over time.

593
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,320
It seemed like Mr. Ding
died from an arrow,

594
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,439
but the arrow didn't
hit his vital organs,

595
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:30,800
and there wasn't too much bleeding.

596
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,760
If he died from poisoning,

597
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,040
then it'd all make sense.

598
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,439
Does it mean

599
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,679
your father probably didn't die

600
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,959
from Duke Lu's arrow?

601
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,199
Indeed.

602
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,719
All of these indicate

603
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,399
rumors about my father's death
being part of a plot

604
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,120
were not entirely false.

605
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,239
But six years ago, Yuan Lang
was stationed elsewhere.

606
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,800
He couldn't have known
the secrets behind it.

607
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,280
If Yuan Lang uses this

608
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,479
to set me up and frame me,

609
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,639
he will need someone
to provide information.

610
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,360
As far as I know,

611
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,840
the Anling blossoms
only grow in Northern Liang.

612
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,399
The process of making the poison
is extremely complex.

613
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,360
Only a person from Northern Liang
would know how to use this poison.

614
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,639
Is Yuan Lang working
with the forces of Northern Liang

615
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,600
just to bring you down?

616
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,199
But my memory of the scent alone

617
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,919
is not enough to prove
what killed my father.

618
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:43,639
We have no proof.

619
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
This is all just speculation.

620
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,840
But your father was
buried six years ago,

621
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,439
how do we confirm it?

622
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:50,840
We shall exhume his remains.

623
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,439
You said the Anling blossoms

624
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:54,159
slowly turned the bones greenish-black.

625
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,479
We can check the color of his bones

626
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,600
to see if my father died of the poison.

627
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,479
Are you really going
to dig out your father's remains?

628
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This is far more
complicated than we think.

629
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,000
It concerns the fate of two nations.

630
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,439
We need absolute proof

631
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,360
to determine the next move.

632
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,800
As for my duty as a son,

633
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,000
I hope my father will understand.

634
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,000
Song Jin, get some hot water.

635
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,399
If you feel upset,

636
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,159
you can tell me.

637
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,919
Lately, I've been thinking

638
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:39,000
about my childhood with him.

639
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,919
He came to our family when he was six.

640
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,399
He followed me.

641
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,000
Do you know

642
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,479
Song Jin was afraid of bugs
when he was little.

643
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
He wouldn't even hurt an ant.

644
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,760
For the past six years,

645
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,479
he had lived a life

646
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,439
of violence and killing with me.

647
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,879
I almost forgot

648
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,800
he was actually

649
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,679
the most gentle

650
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,199
and kindest of all.

651
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,840
You too.

652
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,159
I chose my path.

653
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,239
What about him?

654
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,360
His only path is to be a loyal servant.

655
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,719
If you, Song Jin, and I

656
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,080
all left half a month ago,

657
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,040
what would

658
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,600
our life be

659
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,879
at this moment?

660
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,719
I thought about it.

661
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,199
The two of us

662
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,560
wouldn't need a house.

663
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,679
We'd spend the night

664
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,520
at whichever inn we arrived.

665
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,159
We would write down everything
about the local customs

666
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,679
and write storytelling scripts
with those ideas for a living.

667
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,120
Then, we'd move on to the next place.

668
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,320
I've been to
the northern frontier of Dashuo.

669
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,879
If we go south from there,

670
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,719
we'll reach the end of Yazhou.

671
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,000
That place is called
the edge of the world.

672
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
It's getting late.

673
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,879
Let's call it a day.

674
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,439
Qiu Yan.

675
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,479
I'm sorry.

676
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,399
I only want you to be safe.

677
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,320
Qingdai.

678
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:17,639
Third Young Lady.

679
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,199
When did you come back?

680
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,919
I came back last night.

681
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,360
It was already late in the night,

682
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,479
so I didn't inform you.

683
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,320
Where is my sister?

684
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,159
Sorry, Third Young Lady.

685
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:33,479
I can't disclose her whereabouts now.

686
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:36,959
Sure. I understand.

687
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,199
Who are you?

688
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,040
Why did you tie me up?

689
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:10,040
Did Liang Yi ask you to take me away?

690
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,600
Qin Xuan.

691
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,959
Two of my trusted fellow officers
are going to south area.

692
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,560
They are taking you there as well.

693
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,199
I have relatives in south area.

694
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,479
They will take care of you.

695
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,840
Qin Xuan, stop the cart.

696
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,439
Stop!

697
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,120
Qiu Yan!

698
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,439
Stay out of Liang Yi's investigation.

699
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,080
Qin Xuan, how could you do this?

700
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,159
Qiu Yan!

701
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,120
I know.

702
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,719
I know he saved you and your family.

703
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,399
You want to stay out of honor.

704
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,879
But this time,

705
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,679
it's beyond you to help.

706
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:41,679
Don't worry.

707
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,719
Liang Yi is very capable.

708
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,479
He'll live.

709
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,199
You don't get it.

710
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,199
I only came back for one reason,

711
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,199
it's because I love him.

712
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:53,479
So why did you leave him?

713
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:55,600
I don't want Liang Yi

714
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:58,479
to give up his ambition because of me.

715
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,360
I don't want to give up my wish

716
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,679
for his career.

717
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,159
I thought

718
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:05,120
nothing was

719
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,199
more important than
freedom and the future.

720
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,159
But now you realize you are wrong,

721
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,040
am I right?

722
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,199
I heard about his case
at the border of Northern Liang.

723
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,120
I thought I wouldn't see him again.

724
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,719
That thought scared me.

725
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,919
I had never been so scared before.

726
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,840
I can't live without him.
