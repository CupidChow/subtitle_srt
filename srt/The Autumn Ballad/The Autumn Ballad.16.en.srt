=Episode 16=

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,400
Do you think your legitimate mother

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,440
was the world's most noble
and gentle woman?

20
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:48,160
I bet you never knew

21
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,279
that she was actually

22
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,239
having an affair

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,440
with a monk.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,480
You're making this up.

25
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,199
No, I am not.

26
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,199
You have seen the monk too.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,040
It's Master Zhenyan from Mount Taiying.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,880
Second Madam visited him every month.

29
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,000
To discuss Buddhist texts, she said.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,919
To pray or to consecrate something,
she said.

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,559
God knows if it was true.

32
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:19,600
I followed her to Taiying Temple
twice or thrice

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,800
and I could already notice the chemistry
between them.

34
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,559
My mother passed away

35
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,559
and she couldn't defend herself.

36
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,479
And so you sullied her name
with an accusation.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,479
Let me ask you then.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,559
Master Zhenyan has a jade piece.

39
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,839
Have you seen it?

40
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,479
Han had one too.

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,199
It matches with the one

42
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,639
Master Zhenyan has.

43
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,360
She rarely took it out

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
but there was one time, I saw her

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,279
staring at the jade.

46
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,000
Greetings, Madam.

47
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,880
Tell me then.

48
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,119
If that romantic keepsake

49
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,800
isn't a solid proof, what is?

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,440
You're lying.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,119
If what you said was true,

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,759
you would have told father already.

53
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,479
I'm not an idiot.

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,320
We suffered for so many years in Yuezhou

55
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:33,119
and now, 
we can finally live comfortably here.

56
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,679
Han was kind to me too

57
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,839
and she had no son.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,399
If I told your father

59
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,199
and he expelled her in a fit of rage,

60
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,559
he might marry someone younger or prettier

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
and when she brought him
another son or daughter,

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,320
then your brother

63
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,240
wouldn't be the only son
of the second chamber.

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,240
I don't want a bad deal.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,559
Second Young Lady.

66
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,800
Yan'er.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,000
You're back.

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,160
If you stop causing more trouble,

69
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,000
my mother and I

70
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:20,160
will pretend nothing happened back then.

71
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,839
Father,

72
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,239
I have a question.

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
What again this time?

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,079
I'm looking for the jade piece
left by my mother.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,040
Have you seen it?

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
What jade piece?

77
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,359
A broken piece
with a Qilin engraved on it.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,320
Your mother did not
have a jade piece like that.

79
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,079
Who told you so?

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,239
I found this in my mother's room.

81
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,559
Why did you lie,

82
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,320
father?

83
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,320
So it was you who broke this jade.

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,160
Because you know
the secret this jade hides.

85
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,920
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

86
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,799
My mother's jade piece

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,519
is the other half of the jade
Master Zhenyan from Taiying Temple

88
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,600
carries.

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,920
Therefore,

90
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,880
you thought my mother cheated on you
with Master Zhenyan.

91
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,160
And you colluded with Old Madam

92
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,440
to poison my mother.

93
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:34,799
Ridiculous!

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
First, you suspected Old Madam,

95
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,320
now, you're suspecting me.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,760
You just won't stop
until you have suspected

97
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,559
everyone in the Qiu Residence.

98
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,799
I don't want to suspect you

99
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,720
but this is the only explanation
I can come up with.

100
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,880
Only you

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,679
could convince Old Madam to help you.

102
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
(And only you)

103
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,119
(could force that dark yellow poison)

104
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,679
(down my mother's gullet.)

105
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,480
(And you waited by her side)

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,040
(and watched her die to poison.)

107
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,679
(I found some red safflower residues)

108
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,920
(under my mother's bed.)

109
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,559
(You must have left them when you
fed my mother poison)

110
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,760
(forcefully.)

111
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
(You tried to remove your trace)

112
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,160
(but you overlooked that few spots
below the bed.)

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,519
(Just a few red safflower residues)

114
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,640
(and one broken jade)

115
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,239
are enough for you to accuse

116
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,000
your father of poisoning your mother?

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
Of course, I know

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,440
how insufficient they are.

119
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,359
I just want to tell you

120
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,880
if those

121
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,239
were the reasons why you thought

122
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,519
my mother was consorting
with Master Zhenyan,

123
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,920
then you have failed her.

124
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,720
Because there was no one in this world

125
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,559
she loved more than you.

126
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,419
(May my husband's wish come true,
and lead a happy and safe life.)

127
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,799
She loved you so deeply

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
but you thought she committed

129
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,079
adultery

130
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,079
because of two jade pieces.

131
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,640
You failed

132
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,880
the deep love she gave you.

133
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,760
Father,

134
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,720
if you ever feel a tad remorseful,

135
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,640
surrender yourself
to the Fengjing Prefecture.

136
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you done?

137
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,359
You still won't believe me.

138
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,519
Come with me to the Taiying Temple

139
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,359
and let's confront Master Zhenyan.

140
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,079
Zhenyan is dead.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,720
Yan'er.

142
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,600
I told you

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,200
not to cause any more troubles

144
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,799
once you're back.

145
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,920
But no, you defy me.

146
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,239
Someone!

147
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,079
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,079
Lock her inside the firewood room.

149
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,359
No one can let her out

150
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,959
without my permission.

151
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,760
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,480
Father,

153
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,839
it truly was you?

154
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,160
Qiu Yi, it was you all along?

155
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,679
Qiu Yi, why wouldn't you trust
my mother?

156
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,640
Qiu Yi, it was you all along?

157
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:16,040
Why wouldn't you trust her?

158
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:26,970
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Mother
in the Qiu Family, Han Ruogu)

159
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,320
Great timing.

160
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,799
Give this to Qiu Yan.

161
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,719
Tell her it's a thank-you gift.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
Also, ask

163
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,239
how she is doing now.

164
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,799
I can't.

165
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,880
Something bad

166
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,440
happened to the Qiu family.

167
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,080
What happened?

168
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,200
I got news from the Imperial Palace.

169
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,320
His Majesty read a memorandum
this morning

170
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,760
and he was infuriated.

171
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,479
He then asked Yuan Lang
to confiscate Qiu's assets.

172
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
The Main Administrative Office
must be over there

173
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,919
raiding them.

174
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:13,760
Sir,

175
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,280
His Majesty didn't run

176
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,359
this raid through us.

177
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,039
We weren't aware of it at all.

178
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,159
Is His Majesty...

179
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,679
I don't know what the Qiu family
committed this time

180
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,359
but I am close to them.

181
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,039
It's normal that His Majesty
doesn't trust me.

182
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,799
Lord Liang.

183
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
Eunuch Liu.

184
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,400
His Majesty said he wouldn't
see anyone today.

185
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,520
Please return.

186
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,799
Also, heed my advice, Lord Liang.

187
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Do not meddle

188
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,679
in this matter.

189
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,856
(Qiu Residence)

190
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,640
Sir, Liang Yi entered
the Imperial Palace

191
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,280
but His Majesty
did not grant him an audience.

192
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,359
Before Liang Yi rose to power,

193
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,919
raiding house was what we did best.

194
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,760
Show no mercy later.

195
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,039
Don't let me see
you have gotten all rusty.

196
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:06,840
Yes, sir.

197
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,400
As per His Majesty ordained,

198
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,639
the Firewood Office will work with

199
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,320
Main Administrative Office 
to raid the Qiu Residence.

200
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,000
Eunuch Liu, wait.

201
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,000
Lord Liang, please return.

202
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,599
Thank you for your advice, Eunuch Liu,

203
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,599
but can you inform Her Highness

204
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,640
that I request an audience?

205
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,840
I...

206
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,000
Your Highness,

207
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,239
what did Qiu Yi do wrong?

208
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,280
Politics do not concern
the Imperial Harem.

209
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,640
As the leader of the Imperial Harem,

210
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,640
I am no exception.

211
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
However, I did hear that this morning,

212
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,159
His Majesty summoned
Minister Lin Changzhi alone

213
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,640
from the Ministry of Works.

214
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
And then, His Majesty ordered

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,359
a raid on the Qiu family.

216
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh,

217
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,719
the Main Administrative Office
is in charge of it.

218
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,359
Your Highness,
raiding the minister's residence

219
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,000
has always been
the Firewood Office's duty.

220
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,119
Is His Majesty afraid of a potential
conflict of interest?

221
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,200
I know your ethics

222
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,880
very well.

223
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,599
But the one being raided now

224
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,760
is the family you're due to marry.

225
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,599
His Majesty just doesn't want

226
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,479
to put you in a difficult position.

227
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,760
His Majesty is being considerate.

228
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,200
Please understand this.

229
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,320
Your Highness,

230
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,159
serving His Majesty takes priority
over private sentiment.

231
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,719
As a minister, Qiu Yi

232
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,719
was employed by His Majesty,
yet he remains disloyal.

233
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:54,960
I don't want to marry someone

234
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
from a family like this.

235
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,400
I wish to withdraw this marriage
arrangement with the Qiu family

236
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,520
and I hope Your Highness
can grant me my wish.

237
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,520
That way, I can serve His Majesty

238
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,760
with utmost loyalty.

239
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,119
Search everything!

240
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:17,520
Go.

241
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,719
Check everything.

242
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,320
Yes, sir.

243
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,280
Mother, have some tea.

244
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,799
Old Madam, Second Master.

245
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,679
Official Yuan
of the Main Administrative Office

246
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,159
came to deliver a royal decree.

247
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,000
Lord Liang from the Firewood Office
is here too.

248
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,479
What's the panic for?

249
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,280
Invite them in.

250
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,960
Their squads

251
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,479
barged in before I could come here

252
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,000
to inform you.

253
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,239
Come.

254
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
Come with me.

255
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,599
Hurry.

256
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,080
Come!

257
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,599
Come!

258
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,039
Stop dallying!

259
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,400
Come!

260
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,440
Come with me.

261
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,280
Lift me up.

262
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,559
Hurry.

263
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,359
Come down.

264
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,119
Come down.

265
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,479
Let go of me!

266
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,239
Come with me.

267
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,320
Come.

268
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,960
Why capture me? Let go of me.

269
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,840
Come.

270
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,760
What are you doing?

271
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,640
Come with me.

272
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
What are you doing? Come!

273
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,520
Come.

274
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Give me my silver back.

275
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,880
Come!

276
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,880
Come!

277
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,599
Let go of me.

278
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,359
Come with me.

279
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,239
Come.

280
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,840
Hurry up!

281
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,919
- Hurry.
- Back off.

282
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,679
Go now.

283
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,159
Come.

284
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,159
Quick.

285
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,200
Hurry.

286
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:51,880
Come with me.

287
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,840
Hurry up.

288
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,799
Here too.

289
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,039
Come out now.

290
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:04,719
Don't.

291
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,599
Mother!

292
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,880
- Rong'er.
- Mother!

293
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,640
Come.

294
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,760
Old Madam Qiu.

295
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,559
Main Administrative Office
and Firewood Office

296
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,919
are tasked with raiding the Qiu family.

297
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,960
I hope you can understand.

298
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,440
Old Madam,

299
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,039
you sure are someone with experience.

300
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,960
You remain calm and collected.

301
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,320
Having lived through several decades,

302
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,440
I might not have seen this
but I certainly have heard of it.

303
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,000
But today, it's our turn.

304
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,119
We have a few loose ends here and there

305
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,520
but we have been working
for the Imperial Court for generations.

306
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,479
We have not committed heinous crimes.

307
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,359
Two officials came here to deliver
a royal decree.

308
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,559
As the head of this family,

309
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,400
I shall accept it
with pride and decorum.

310
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,599
Yan'er.

311
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,239
Why are you here?

312
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,159
There's no time for a tantrum.

313
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,039
Something big happened.

314
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,440
Leave with Qiu Min now.

315
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,599
Father, come with us.

316
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,599
I'm a minister. I cannot run away.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,799
They are raiding our house.

318
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,200
Leave now.

319
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,840
A raid?

320
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:29,799
Search this place!

321
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,000
If you don't go now, it'll be too late.

322
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,679
Go!

323
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,679
- Go!
- Father.

324
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:34,599
Father.

325
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,799
- Hurry up, Min'er.
- Come with us.

326
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,520
Go.

327
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,320
Hurry.

328
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,479
That way. Go!

329
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,080
Father!

330
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:41,840
Hurry.

331
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,239
- Hurry up!
- Father.

332
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,000
Sir, as per your request,

333
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,840
we left an opening
for the second chamber.

334
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,559
Qiu Min and Qiu Yan already snuck out.

335
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,080
Send someone to follow them.

336
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,039
Noted.

337
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,719
Liang, what brought you here?

338
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Where are the Qiu sisters?

339
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,239
I invited a few poetry pals
to this vacation house.

340
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,799
I have not met Qiu Yan and Qiu Min.

341
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,599
I merely said the Qiu sisters.

342
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,239
How do you know it's them?

343
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,440
Search this place.

344
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,479
Stop.

345
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,039
Liang Yi, like I said,

346
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,880
the Qiu sisters are not here.

347
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,440
This is the Duke Ying Residence.

348
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,719
You might need to reconsider

349
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,359
what you're doing here.

350
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,359
The Firewood Office
is conducting its business.

351
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,159
Qin Xuan, let me make myself clear.

352
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,679
Do not make the Duke Ying Residence

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,479
carry the crime of protecting fugitives.

354
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,559
Search!

355
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,479
Search.

356
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,400
Liang Yi.

357
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,760
Enough already.

358
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,119
Move aside.

359
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,000
Move aside!

360
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,920
Liang Yi.

361
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,400
I know you're doing your duty

362
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,680
but Qiu Yan and Qiu Min suffer
collateral damage.

363
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,280
Letting them go isn't a big deal, is it?

364
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,599
Don't you care about
the memories we share?

365
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,359
You can disregard the royal decree

366
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,239
but I can't.

367
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,479
You know how serious this implies

368
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,319
and yet, you're doing it.

369
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,400
Can't you tell right from wrong?

370
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,520
The royal decree is the law.

371
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,560
Song Jin.

372
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,400
Carry Mr. Qin away.

373
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:37,719
You...

374
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,359
Come.

375
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:39,760
Sir.

376
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Liang Yi.

377
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,040
Qiu Yan.

378
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,000
Be gentle!

379
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,359
Qiu Yan!

380
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:44,800
Sir.

381
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,839
Song Jin.

382
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,119
Let's go.

383
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,719
As per His Majesty ordained,

384
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,719
Qiu Yi, Vice Minister of Works, will
step down due to suspicion of crimes.

385
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
All men in his residence will be sent
to the Main Administrative Office

386
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,479
while all women will be sent
to the Royal Academy.

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The nature of his crime will only
be determined once the investigation

388
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,079
concludes.

389
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,479
That is all.

390
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,599
You may rise.

391
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,160
Sir.

392
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,319
I am not one of the Qiu family.

393
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:44,680
Qiu...

394
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,560
The Fourth Madam kidnapped me.

395
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,640
For many years, I had to call them
my parents.

396
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,680
I despise them utterly.

397
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,800
Please right my name, sir.

398
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,319
Di'er. What are you on about?

399
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,520
- Come back here!
- Qiu Di.

400
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,160
Shut up.

401
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,760
I raised you for 18 years.

402
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,560
Fourth Madam.

403
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,560
Our lives are at stake here.

404
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,160
If you do care about me,

405
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,920
tell them the truth.

406
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,400
Qiu Di, shut up.

407
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
You are my son.

408
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,040
You are the son 
of Forth Master of Qiu family.

409
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,160
You are the eldest grandson
of the Qiu family.

410
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,199
The Qiu family will be eradicated soon.

411
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,079
Stop dragging me down with you.

412
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,640
Qiu Di.

413
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,560
If you won't say it,

414
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,000
I will.

415
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,239
Father.

416
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,560
No, Qiu Hong.

417
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,400
Your wife gave birth to a daughter.

418
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
She was afraid you would divorce her

419
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,719
so she kidnapped me to be your son.

420
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:49,479
Oh,

421
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,920
your daughter is growing up by the
wonton dumplings stall

422
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,800
outside of Heming Building.

423
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,959
Please investigate this matter, sir.

424
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,199
Is what he said true?

425
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:11,800
My lord.

426
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,319
My lord, it's not like that.

427
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,719
- Listen to...
- When I was born,

428
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,760
everyone said I was strong and healthy,

429
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,079
unlike a newborn baby.

430
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,680
That's because I'm one month older

431
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,439
than her daughter.

432
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,160
Shut up!

433
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,479
Let go of me!

434
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,280
You dirty wench.

435
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,319
You lied to me all these years!

436
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,239
I...

437
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,199
- I will
- My lord.

438
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,239
punish you.

439
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:38,760
My lord.

440
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:40,719
No need.

441
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,680
Qiu Di.

442
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,239
Mi!

443
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:13,959
Mi!

444
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,160
Mi!

445
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,920
Back off!

446
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,800
Mi!

447
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,079
Mi!

448
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,079
She killed herself out of shame.

449
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
It has nothing to do with me.

450
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,520
I will investigate this matter further.

451
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,199
Carry her away.

452
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:04,520
My lord.

453
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,520
Sir, Qiu Yi is here.

454
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,239
Qiu Yi.

455
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,199
Where are your two daughters?

456
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:17,680
Speak now!

457
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,439
- Violence is uncalled for!
- Stop.

458
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,800
Official Qiu is a scholar.

459
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,280
He can't take a beating like this.

460
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,880
Besides, Official Qiu and I are colleagues.

461
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
I won't subject him
to something like this.

462
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,319
But His Majesty

463
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,079
wants the entire Qiu family.

464
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,880
Please don't make it more difficult,
Official Qiu.

465
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:40,640
Official Yuan.

466
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,520
You can beat me to death here

467
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,520
and I still don't know where they are.

468
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,079
If you don't tell me now,

469
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,280
you will when you arrive
at the Main Administrative Office.

470
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,760
Two Qiu young ladies escaped.

471
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,640
Someone must have shirked on his duty.

472
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,239
Jiang Yun.

473
00:22:59,239 --> 00:22:59,680
Yes, sir.

474
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,560
Find out the truth.

475
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,560
Official Yuan.

476
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,920
Qiu Yan and Qiu Min are here.

477
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
They never escaped.

478
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,359
Yan'er.

479
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,040
As reliable as always, Lord Liang.

480
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,400
If I didn't bring them here,

481
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,199
you would complain

482
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,400
to His Majesty
that I was being impartial,

483
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,680
wouldn't you?

484
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,880
Official Qiu can defend himself 
in the court

485
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,800
but I have nowhere to turn to.

486
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,599
Send the men
to the Main Administrative Office,

487
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and the women to the Royal Academy.

488
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,280
Dismiss the servants.

489
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,239
Yes, sir.

490
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:22,680
Go.

491
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:25,920
Hurry up.

492
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,920
Rong'er.

493
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,439
Rong'er.

494
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
What are you doing?

495
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:36,640
Rong'er.

496
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,599
Carry them away.

497
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,119
Go.

498
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,280
Come.

499
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,560
Hurry up.

500
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:05,920
Come.

501
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,560
Rong'er.

502
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,079
Hurry up.

503
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,079
My lord!

504
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,599
My lord!

505
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:05,561
(Royal Academy)

506
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:13,000
Greetings, sirs.

507
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,079
How should I deal with them?

508
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,680
Well...

509
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,839
Let Lord Liang decide.

510
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,680
After all,

511
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,719
Lord Liang's future wife is among them.

512
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,239
I beg your pardon, Official Yuan.

513
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
Before I was told
to raid the Qiu family,

514
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,239
Noble Consort Guo was generous enough

515
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,079
to annul the marriage agreement
between the Qiu family and me.

516
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
I have nothing to do

517
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,160
with these criminals.

518
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,560
How decisive and heartless of you,
Lord Liang.

519
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,359
How hard it is to sever ties

520
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,239
with criminals?

521
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,839
It comes so naturally.

522
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,920
In that case,

523
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,199
since the Qiu ladies
all look so beautiful,

524
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,959
we should...

525
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,160
All the more reason to subject them
to hard labor.

526
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,880
- Ms. Wang.
- Liang Yi.

527
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,319
You were all sincere and whatnot

528
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,000
when you asked for my sister's hand.

529
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:03,000
And now, to please His Majesty,

530
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,920
you turned us in.

531
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,479
I have never seen anyone

532
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,160
as heartless as you.

533
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,319
You owe my sister an explanation today.

534
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,239
Blame your father for messing it up.

535
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,719
I finally rose to this position

536
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,319
and you think I will let your family
ruin it for me?

537
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,280
Whoever gets in my way

538
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:18,239
will be kicked away.

539
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,599
What are you laughing at?

540
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,839
I laughed
because I never learned my lesson.

541
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,280
I laughed because I misjudged you.

542
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,199
And now, I end up like

543
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,560
Mr. Zhao and Yueying.

544
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:32,920
Right.

545
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,479
You're just a selfish person

546
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,880
who chases after fame and glory.

547
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,719
I'm glad you understand now.

548
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:40,839
Song Jin.

549
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,719
Carry her away.

550
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:43,920
Lord Liang,

551
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,719
considering our past,

552
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,479
please have mercy on Qiu Yan.

553
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,800
You still want to

554
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,599
be fed and be pampered
like a young lady?

555
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
In your dreams.

556
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,560
Ms. Wang.

557
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,880
Show them to the backyard.

558
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:08,439
Noted.

559
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,439
Come with me.

560
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,239
Let's go.

561
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,199
What is this dilapidated place?

562
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,479
Is it even inhabitable?

563
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,239
It stinks!

564
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,079
It's so dirty.

565
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,359
How can we live here?

566
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,119
Careful.

567
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,719
You blew up the dust.

568
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
You're in the Royal Academy now.

569
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:26,680
Get off your high horse

570
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,880
and get changed.

571
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,119
New costumes,

572
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,640
new lifestyle.

573
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,560
What are you waiting for?

574
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,040
You don't understand a word?

575
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,000
Get changed.

576
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,719
I don't have the time to dally around.

577
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,800
The clothes are on the floor

578
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,000
and if you don't go out,

579
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,880
we can't get changed.

580
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,560
Where are we again?

581
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:53,959
The Royal Academy.

582
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
This is not a convent.

583
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,719
Do not

584
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,199
cover yourself up.

585
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,479
Get changed.

586
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,760
Thank you.

587
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,520
How may I address you?

588
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:07,319
Mr. Wang.

589
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:08,839
Wang Shun.

590
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:11,239
Mr. Wang, please

591
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:12,800
take good care of us.

592
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,400
I will.

593
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,400
Pick your clothes now.

594
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,160
Come, Min'er.

595
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,760
Are you all right?

596
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:30,800
I'm fine.

597
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,599
Qiu Ying.

598
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,439
Wait.

599
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:36,000
What? You think I'm blind?

600
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,439
Why did you stretch your leg out?

601
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,680
You think you're a mantis?

602
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,920
Or perhaps you want to take a beating
for your first day?

603
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,079
Are you all right, miss?

604
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm fine.

605
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,000
Just so you know,

606
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:50,640
from now on,

607
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,119
you're the property
of the Royal Academy.

608
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,839
If you're bruised or injured,

609
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,040
I have to answer to the superior.

610
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,880
Ms. Wang is feeling merciful today.

611
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,359
She said you don't have to work today.

612
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,920
So be nice and stay here.

613
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,199
If any of you cause a scene again,

614
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,079
I'll punish you.

615
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,839
All right. Get changed now.

616
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,640
Let's go.

617
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,760
Min'er. Come.

618
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,000
This one is clean.

619
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,599
The clothes are so dirty.

620
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,599
The blanket is so dirty.

621
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,920
How should I do this?

622
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,400
We have nothing. How are we supposed
to do this?

623
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,520
- Qiu Yan.
- For you.

624
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,839
Qiu Yan, bring me some blankets.

625
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,079
Okay.

626
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,599
Is this...

627
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,280
Is this a blanket?

628
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,560
I would rather go to the front yard

629
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:42,880
and be a courtesan.

630
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,560
Our image is ruined already anyway.

631
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,239
It's so dirty.

632
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,239
Qiu Ying, we only have a blanket.

633
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,119
Thanks to the second chamber,

634
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,199
we all have to deal with this.

635
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:02,319
And you still want to sleep comfortably.

636
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:05,000
My father was framed.

637
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,920
I don't care.

638
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,640
Qiu Yi must have stepped out of line

639
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,400
and crossed someone.

640
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,760
Only Qiu Yi

641
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,640
works as a government official anyway.

642
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,640
I barely have a day
of a comfortable life

643
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
and now, the entire family
is in shamble.

644
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,800
Oh, Mi.

645
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:22,079
You died for nothing.

646
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,719
Third Aunt.

647
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,199
- When my father was here...
- Qiu Yan.

648
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,800
It's fine.

649
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,119
Everyone is just upset.

650
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,880
Min, stop your sanctimonious act.

651
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,920
You're the reason why the man
from the Firewood Office

652
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,040
subjected us to this.

653
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:37,319
Her Highness 
arranged the marriage for me...

654
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,119
In my opinion,

655
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:40,880
the second chamber is just cursed.

656
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,040
Even Second Aunt died too.

657
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:44,719
Indeed.

658
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,560
The second chamber brings bad luck.

659
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,880
And none of you can escape from this.

660
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,959
We will live, eat, and see each other
every day.

661
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,560
Maybe one day, you'll die here too.

662
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,719
Enough, Yan'er.

663
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:55,719
You don't want

664
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,319
us to sleep comfortably?

665
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,160
Fine.

666
00:32:58,479 --> 00:32:59,760
None of you gets to sleep.

667
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:00,760
Today.

668
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,040
What are you doing, Yan'er?

669
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,800
None of you will sleep.

670
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,280
You...

671
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,359
How dare you.

672
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:08,920
Among the second chamber, one was sick,

673
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
another was a criminal.

674
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,119
How many times have you tried
to drag the entire family with you?

675
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,400
Yes, and you're next, Third Aunt.

676
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,760
You...

677
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,800
Shut up!

678
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,800
We just became servants

679
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,920
and you forgot how to be
a respected elder.

680
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,199
We're all slaves here.

681
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,359
Who cares about that anymore?

682
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,280
Yes,

683
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
the Qiu family is having a crisis now

684
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,439
but that doesn't mean we can
lose our pride.

685
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,000
We're in the Royal Academy now.

686
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,439
We will be tainted as it is.
Who cares about pride?

687
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,599
Fine.

688
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,479
Argue then.

689
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:55,160
Argue till I die from anger

690
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,000
and you can argue
for as long as you want.

691
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,079
Tidy everything up now.

692
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,320
Here.

693
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,399
Third Aunt, my legs are numb.

694
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,040
My legs are numb.

695
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:51,800
I don't even have a pillow.

696
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,040
Neither do I.

697
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
Let me lie on it for a bit longer.

698
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,439
Let me lie on it for a bit longer.

699
00:34:58,439 --> 00:34:59,560
What should we do?

700
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,600
How can I sleep like this?

701
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,819
(Royal Academy)

702
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,120
You're here, godmother.

703
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,280
I am Wang of the Royal Academy.

704
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,000
Call me Ms. Wang.

705
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,919
Greetings, Ms. Wang.

706
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,479
That girl in the shade.

707
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,520
You'll be carrying water in the backyard
from now on.

708
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,159
You can use some sunlight.

709
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,320
And that girl who is swatting bugs away.

710
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,040
You'll be cleaning
the toilet bucket now.

711
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:19,360
Plenty of flies there for you.

712
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:21,919
I won't do it.

713
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,959
Even my maid

714
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,639
never did
something dirty like that before.

715
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,600
What is this tantrum?

716
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,639
If you won't clean the buckets,

717
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,879
the officials
won't be able to relieve themselves.

718
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,639
You still think you're the Young Lady
of the Qiu family?

719
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,919
Remember this.

720
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
If you're here,

721
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,080
you accept your fate.

722
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,159
You spent half your life
living comfortably.

723
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,919
You're already more fortunate than most.

724
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,280
The three of you are obedient.

725
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,639
Go wash the clothes in the laundry room.

726
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,040
See you, Ms. Wang.

727
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,040
That's settled then.

728
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,840
The three of you will do the laundry.

729
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,639
You three, go clean the toilet buckets.

730
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,600
And you two bring the one in the shade

731
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,760
to carry water.

732
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,120
Why are you standing still?

733
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,959
Work now!

734
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,959
Yes, sir.

735
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,120
Where is the laundry room?

736
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,800
Are you asking me? Use your eyes.

737
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,080
Here.

738
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,600
Madam.

739
00:37:23,385 --> 00:37:26,240
(Main Administrative Office)

740
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,651
(Main Administrative Office)

741
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:32,600
Sir.

742
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,600
Your three brothers already told me

743
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,760
what you did.

744
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:47,639
Official Yuan,

745
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,320
you fabricated all these testimonies

746
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,600
to incriminate me?

747
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Check

748
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,399
if they are the handwriting
of your brothers.

749
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:14,480
(Qiu Ning)

750
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,720
(Qiu Xian)

751
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,754
(Qiu Hong)

752
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:23,919
You...

753
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,159
You forced them.

754
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,399
Forced?

755
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:34,280
Your brothers are so spoiled.

756
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,000
All of them are spineless.

757
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,639
There are a few counterfeit silver notes
under Qiu Ning's box.

758
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,040
I just yelled a bit and he confessed.

759
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,040
Qiu Hong is a sturdy man

760
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,080
but one flogging after,
he gets on his knees.

761
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,000
My eldest brother won't betray me.

762
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,439
You mean the one
who follows a healthy lifestyle?

763
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,639
Deprive him of one night's sleep

764
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,320
and he enumerates your crimes

765
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,280
the next day with black eyes.

766
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,120
Your brothers really sold you out.

767
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:08,120
Corruption, embezzlement,
abusing your position...

768
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,040
Whatever crime you can think of,

769
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,560
they did it for you.

770
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,479
Official Yuan.

771
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,639
I never commit those deeds.

772
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,560
I know you're innocent, Official Qiu.

773
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,320
During the public hearing happening
in three days,

774
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,520
tell everyone that Liang Yi told you
to commit those crimes.

775
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,679
And then, you'll be safe and sound.

776
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,959
Or else,
considering the gravity of the crimes,

777
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,919
your mother and your daughters

778
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:37,800
won't just be slaving away
in the Royal Academy.

779
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,639
Slow down.

780
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,639
Careful.

781
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Just a bit further.

782
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,840
Done.

783
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,000
Here.

784
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,800
This spot.

785
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:08,800
My hands hurt.

786
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,320
Come, Mei'er.

787
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:11,840
Let's do it together.

788
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,000
Min'er. Hang it properly.

789
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:24,600
Come.

790
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,520
It must be nice
to hang clothes over there.

791
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,000
We have to toil.

792
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:32,760
All right. Stop complaining.

793
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:33,959
Get back to work.

794
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:35,919
First Madam, I'm tired.

795
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Are you all right?

796
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,639
Yan.

797
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,520
Come, Mei'er.

798
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:55,439
We

799
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,639
got lucky.

800
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,159
Our work isn't as tough.

801
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:11,080
Ms. Wang.

802
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,000
Ms. Wang.

803
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,159
Go back to your work.

804
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,639
Qiu Yan.

805
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,320
Mr. Qin asked me
to give you this letter.

806
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,959
I have worked here
for more than a decade.

807
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,159
I can count all the loyal gentlemen
like him

808
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:31,520
with my fingers.

809
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,760
Forget how much he spent.

810
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
It's hard enough as it is

811
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,360
to ask favors after favors

812
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,280
in order to get this letter to me.

813
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Read the letter carefully.

814
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:48,702
(To: Qiu Yan)

815
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,879
(At this point,)

816
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,320
(I am willing to abandon my family,
filial piety,)

817
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,639
(and my career to get you
out of the Royal Academy.)

818
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,000
(We will go somewhere far away)

819
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
(where no one can find us.)

820
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,000
(Wait for me,)

821
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:03,679
(Qiu Yan.)

822
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:06,399
(In that case,)

823
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,040
(I can get Min'er out of here too.)

824
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,600
If I were you,

825
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,080
I would cut ties with him the moment

826
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:20,800
we entered the Royal Academy.

827
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,199
You think you're doing this for him

828
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,439
but you're just hurting him.

829
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,679
But shouldn't you be worried
that it might affect him?

830
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,199
If it's consensual,

831
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,280
it's not a burden.

832
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,959
He knows of my current situation.

833
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,360
I don't have to make the decision for him.

834
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,159
Sir, the Main Administrative Office kept

835
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:57,080
the interrogation of the Qiu family
as a secret.

836
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,199
Even our informant
couldn't find anything useful.

837
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,919
We still don't know what crime

838
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,479
Official Qiu committed.

839
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:04,360
Whatever the crime is,

840
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,199
the Qiu family is innocent.

841
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:07,879
Yuan Lang did this for me.

842
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
So he is behind

843
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:11,159
the entire incident.

844
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,399
We did run a background check on Qiu Yi.

845
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,040
He started his position several years
ago. He's cautious

846
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,360
and never did anything illegal.

847
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,520
Soon after I had a marriage arrangement
with the Qiu family,

848
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,439
the Qiu Residence was raided.

849
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,679
How uncanny.

850
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,159
Yuan Lang has always wanted
to find my weakness.

851
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,600
He couldn't

852
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:27,760
so he tried to use the Qiu family.

853
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,639
We can't let the Main Administrative Office
be the only body

854
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,639
investigating this.

855
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,360
Knowing Yuan Lang,

856
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,439
he will find something to frame you.

857
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,600
I will request an audience
with the Noble Consort now.

858
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:40,800
With her assistance,

859
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,679
maybe I can be the juror

860
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:44,399
in Qiu Yi's case.

861
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:46,439
Old Madam.

862
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:47,919
Old Madam.

863
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,439
Do you want some water?

864
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,479
Well...

865
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,800
Some buns perhaps?

866
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,399
You're risking your health here.
