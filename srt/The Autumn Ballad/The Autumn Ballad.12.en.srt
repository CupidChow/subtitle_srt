=Episode 12=

18
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:41,400
(Qiu Residence)
So the only possibility

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
for the fake money

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,120
is that it's Third Uncle's personal stash.

21
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,959
Of course,

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,239
Third Uncle has common sense.

23
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,160
That's why he agreed
to put up an act with me.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,760
No... No.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,839
Absolutely not.

26
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,360
You want me to lose face

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,400
in front of so many people.

28
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,520
You're getting back at me
over a personal grudge.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,479
You're right. It's personal.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,399
You were hoping that I'd die along
with my dead husband.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,639
Now,

32
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,800
it wasn't easy for me

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
to have something on you.

34
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,000
Of course, I'm not going
to miss this opportunity.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,320
You... You... You...

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,759
Just blame yourself
for committing a crime

37
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,839
and let me have something on you.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
I don't care if you're willing
to cooperate with me.

39
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,080
I won't keep your visit

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,279
to Wanyan House a secret.

41
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,160
You can't save your reputation
no matter what you do.

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,279
Third Uncle, you brought
the fake notes here.

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,919
Even if someone swapped
the cash notes in between,

44
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,639
you'll be questioned

45
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,199
as long as we can't find
who swapped them.

46
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:42,279
Third Uncle, you've read so many books.

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,440
Don't tell me you don't understand
this principle.

48
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:51,279
I made Third Uncle mention the medicine

49
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,720
to lure the culprit out.

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,919
So that Madam Xu reveals herself.

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,919
As for the medicine,

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,440
it's just ordinary well water.

53
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,679
What?

54
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,759
Madam Xu,

55
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,520
if Wanyan House has such medicine,

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,320
why should I investigate it

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,119
with a jade pendant?

58
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,720
But it was urgent,

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,080
and you had no time to think.

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,279
Even if you were suspicious,

61
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,639
you'd never take the risk

62
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,759
of being exposed.

63
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,039
Old Madam,

64
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,360
I found these cash notes
in Madam Xu's room.

65
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,440
Madam Xu,

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,440
what else can you say now?

67
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,600
Nothing.

68
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,199
I'll just accept any punishment.

69
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
Nothing?

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
Madam Xu,

71
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,679
you've been working here
for so many years.

72
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,559
Why did you do such a thing

73
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,080
to the Qiu family?

74
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,199
Old Madam,

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,399
I'll always remember

76
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,960
your kindness to me.

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,320
Just a word from you,

78
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,600
my life is yours.

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
But Second Master...

80
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,240
He caused the death of my only son!

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,240
I...

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,720
He must pay

83
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,959
for the evil deeds he had done!

84
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,279
I couldn't care so much

85
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,839
about implicating the Qiu family along.

86
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,600
Xu Song...

87
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,640
That's...

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,480
He brought it upon himself.

89
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,440
If you didn't frame him,

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,600
he wouldn't have died around age 20.

91
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,079
Wait a minute.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,920
Didn't your son die from an accident?

93
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,959
As masters,

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,079
everything you say is right.

95
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,880
For the sake of our years
of relationship,

96
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,959
I'll listen

97
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,920
if you're willing to tell me.

98
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:20,799
Old Madam,

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
it's fate.

100
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,000
I've served you all my life.

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Yet, I betrayed my own master.

102
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,959
It's fate.

103
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,160
You refuse to tell
when I gave you a chance.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,760
Fine.

105
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,440
Take her to the backyard.

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,359
Report this to the authority
tomorrow morning!

107
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,600
Yes, Old Madam.

108
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,519
Qiu Yi,

109
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
hand over the cash notes to
the Ministry of Revenue tomorrow morning.

110
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,839
Bring the matters of donation
to a conclusion.

111
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,640
Yes, Mother.

112
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,320
Second Master, all these

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,519
are from Madam Xu's room.

114
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,839
You can leave now.

115
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,519
Yes, Sir.

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,880
Are you still worried

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,239
about Madam Xu and Xu Song?

118
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,920
These are Xu Song's belongings.

119
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,640
He could have
achieved something in life.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
Eight years ago,

121
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,399
I saw him work hard and love reading.

122
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,079
I wanted to give him a chance.

123
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,519
So I pulled some strings

124
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,880
and recommended him to Imperial College.

125
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't expect

126
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,359
after six months,

127
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,920
the registrar of the Imperial College

128
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,000
told me that Xu Song

129
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,200
cheated during the examination.

130
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,959
According to the rules,
he should've been expelled.

131
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,559
But Xu Song said

132
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,200
the students colluded with the registrar

133
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,000
to pick on him.

134
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,559
But you didn't believe Xu Song.

135
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,760
All the students in the Imperial College

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,679
come from prominent families.

137
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,799
It's impossible for everyone

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,679
to frame a commoner like him.

139
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,720
There was no reason to do that.

140
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:26,040
I have been an official for many years
and have never been partial.

141
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,000
I won't go against my principle

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,519
for a servant.

143
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,840
I thought Xu Song
would turn over a new leaf

144
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,520
after he's expelled
from the Imperial College.

145
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,799
But I didn't expect him

146
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,440
to give up on himself.

147
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,239
Father,

148
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,359
these books were torn up

149
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,479
and glued back together.

150
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,679
You said Xu Song was a hard worker

151
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,039
and loved reading.

152
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,679
How could someone

153
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,679
who loves reading destroy books?

154
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Every student at the Imperial College
is from a prestigious family.

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,159
But Xu Song

156
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,479
was a servant.

157
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,799
He was no doubt the odd one

158
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
at a place like the Imperial College.

159
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,799
It's human nature to discriminate
against those who are different.

160
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,000
The more diligent and outstanding
Xu Song was,

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,320
the more they hated him.

162
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
Those people will only see

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,359
Xu Song as someone
who didn't know his place.

164
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,880
They saw him as a mad person

165
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,679
trying to change his background
by studying hard.

166
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,559
Our country has been established
for a hundred years.

167
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,159
How can they recommend talents

168
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
to the imperial court if the students

169
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,799
of Imperial College worship the rich
and trample on the poor?

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,960
You were into an aristocratic family.

171
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
Everything goes smoothly in your life.

172
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,520
You'll naturally see happy faces.

173
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Flattering the rich and oppressing
the poor happens regardless of status.

174
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:08,919
You didn't see it, that's all.

175
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,440
Yan'er, you're indeed attentive.

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,799
You could deduce Xu Song's situation
back then

177
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,080
from an old book.

178
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,200
When Rong'er had nothing to do,

179
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,679
he'd like to pick on me for fun.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,919
His biggest pleasure
was tearing my books.

181
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,280
I glued them the way Xu Song did.

182
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,679
I've overlooked my household.

183
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Yan'er,

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,239
tell me if such things happen again.

185
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,080
I'll stand up for you.

186
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,400
It's already in the past.

187
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,239
Yan'er, it's getting late.

188
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,359
Get some rest.

189
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,280
Leave us.

190
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,080
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

191
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,159
Second Master.

192
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,559
I didn't dote on you for nothing.

193
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:35,200
About Xu Song,

194
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,919
I've wrongfully blamed him.

195
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,200
Second Master.

196
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,919
Madam Xu,

197
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,320
I feel guilty towards Xu Song

198
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
and you.

199
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:10,960
Song'er,

200
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,000
did you hear that?

201
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,440
Did you hear that?

202
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,159
But why did you...

203
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
Why did you only find out now?

204
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,320
It's already too late.

205
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,080
It's too late!

206
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,520
Even if you apologize
thousands of times,

207
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,039
Song'er will never come back.

208
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,919
He treated you as his benefactor

209
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,520
and worshipped you like Bodhisattva.

210
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,159
But why didn't you...

211
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,400
Why didn't you let him explain?

212
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,679
Before he passed, he asked me

213
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,599
why you gave him hope

214
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,359
and destroyed it again.

215
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,239
Now, you're apologizing.

216
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,320
Song'er can't come back anymore!

217
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
I'll never forgive you.

218
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,640
Song'er won't forgive you either.

219
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,559
Madam Xu,

220
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,640
I don't expect you can forgive me.

221
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,520
I can let it go if you hate me

222
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,440
and try to frame me.

223
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,359
However,

224
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,039
you shouldn't have implicated
the Qiu family.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,239
Go back to your hometown tomorrow.

226
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,039
Don't ever

227
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,200
show yourself in front of
the Qiu family again.

228
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,200
Second Master,

229
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,479
it's already seven o'clock.

230
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,400
There are many mosquitoes in the summer.

231
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,320
Did the maid

232
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,599
light the incense
in Old Madam's room yet?

233
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,880
Yi,

234
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,119
after I leave,

235
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,080
you must take good care of Old Madam.

236
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,599
Look at you.

237
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,280
What's the use of your brain?

238
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,119
You can't brew Emei Snow Bud
with boiling water!

239
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,280
Again?

240
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,799
After Madam Xu left,

241
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,080
Old Madam had been unhappy.

242
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,760
She'd find faults in anyone
who serves her.

243
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Let's not get involved. Let's go.

244
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,840
Old Madam, it's my fault
for not teaching her well.

245
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,960
Didn't this maid do just fine

246
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,400
when she was under Madam Xu?

247
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,919
Why is she like this
when she's under you?

248
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,719
Yes, Old Madam.

249
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,000
Old Madam,

250
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,640
I heard some gossip

251
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,880
from the servant lately.

252
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:28,919
I don't think I should hide it from you.

253
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:32,200
Quickly now.

254
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,760
It's not the time
to put on airs and graces.

255
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,479
Move!

256
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:44,679
Go in!

257
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,119
Old Madam,

258
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,799
please show mercy.

259
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,039
Think of...

260
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:03,400
For the sake

261
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,479
of your grandson, Di'er,

262
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,479
please show mercy.

263
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,479
Please, Old Madam.

264
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,719
Old Madam.

265
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,959
You have the nerve to talk.

266
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,520
The Qiu family can never tolerate this.

267
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,359
Whether you take your own life,

268
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,000
we'd still acknowledge you
as the daughter-in-law.

269
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,040
Or you can pack up and leave

270
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,560
after we give you a repudiation letter.

271
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,040
Old Madam,

272
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:35,760
if you...

273
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,640
If you didn't encourage your son

274
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,479
to repudiate me,

275
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,359
why should I do such a thing?

276
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,880
One of the seven types of grounds
is failing to bear children.

277
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,239
You failed to bear a son.

278
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,880
That's your fate.

279
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,839
I can't bear a son?

280
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,680
Why didn't you ask

281
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,520
your precious, promiscuous son

282
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,599
that he was the impotent one?

283
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,800
Drag her away!

284
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,400
Yes, Old Madam.

285
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:15,959
You wouldn't dare!

286
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,640
Old Madam,

287
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,359
don't belittle others.

288
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,760
I already knew this day would come.

289
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,160
All these years,

290
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,920
I've been collecting

291
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,239
scandals of the Qiu family.

292
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
If you leave me no way out,

293
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,479
don't blame me

294
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,400
for exposing everything.

295
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,199
What a joke.

296
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,119
The Qiu family

297
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,640
has nothing to hide.

298
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,400
Old Madam,

299
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,959
you've kept the secret

300
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,599
of the second chamber
for more than ten years.

301
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,239
Have you forgotten about this?

302
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,000
If I expose this matter,

303
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,319
even if the whole Qiu family

304
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,560
is executed and property confiscated,

305
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,719
it's still considered
a light punishment.

306
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,000
Qiu Min,

307
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,160
Did you tell Old Madam
about Fourth Aunt?

308
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,160
I didn't tell her first.

309
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,880
I don't know how Old Madam found out.

310
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,719
If you've decided not to say anything,

311
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,640
what can they do to you?

312
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,959
I've already told you

313
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,920
the consequences of this matter.

314
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,920
Qiu Yan, I wanted to keep it
a secret too.

315
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:04,000
But when Old Madam started asking,

316
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,439
I couldn't keep it a secret anymore.

317
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,599
Min!

318
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,479
Remember,

319
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,479
I'll always be your Fourth Aunt

320
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,719
in this house.

321
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,319
Why did Old Madam let her go?

322
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,959
Old Madam watched Qiu Di grow up.

323
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,560
Maybe Old Madam considers
her relationship with him.

324
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,319
Well, as long nothing happens.

325
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,800
Why do you still sneak out
after the case was solved?

326
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,640
We'd be done for
if the family finds out.

327
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,839
It'll only count

328
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,680
if Father ordered that I can't go out.

329
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,719
Since he forgets to give the order,

330
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:48,680
it's not my fault, then.

331
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,719
I heard Lu's Crime Investigation's
new book is out.

332
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,719
The ups and downs of the cases
are interesting.

333
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,079
I must buy it today.

334
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,199
Or else, I'll have to ask someone
to copy it again.

335
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,000
Second Young Lady, look!

336
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,760
The paper kite looks beautiful.

337
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,239
Qingdai, wait here.

338
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:17,640
All right.

339
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:28,719
Lord Liang,

340
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,560
what a coincidence.

341
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,719
Song Jin, leave us.

342
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,079
Lord Liang, my...

343
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:39,640
I heard you found the culprit
in Qiu Residence.

344
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,560
Is that a compliment?

345
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:44,719
No, a sarcasm.

346
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
I knew it.

347
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,239
The almighty Lord Liang

348
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,400
would never lower himself
to praise anyone.

349
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm here to ask

350
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,959
if you found a new way
to unlock this shackle?

351
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,640
Not yet.

352
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,560
I've been looking
at this shackle at home.

353
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,880
The more I look at it,
the more it looks like a bracelet.

354
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,079
You and I have one each.

355
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,920
If someone else sees it,

356
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,119
they'll think it's a love token.

357
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,359
It'll be hard to explain, then.

358
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,839
Lord Liang, you're going
to marry my sister, right?

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,239
What if she misunderstands?

360
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,959
Qiu Min is at the Qiu Residence all day.

361
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,199
How would she see it?

362
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,959
You're just scared Qin Xuan
would get it wrong.

363
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm doing this for your sake.

364
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:21,839
She's here.

365
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,839
Are you here to see Ping'er off?

366
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,599
Just pretend I'm here for tea.

367
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,479
How was she sentenced?

368
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,079
She'll be exiled to Yazhou.

369
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,640
This is your last chance.

370
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,920
Tell her the truth

371
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,959
about her Father.

372
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,439
Otherwise, she'll hate you for life.

373
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,160
What are you looking at? Move quickly!

374
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,719
Someone once told me

375
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,479
that if one stops hating,

376
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,800
it means they've given up.

377
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:06,719
Ping'er is alive

378
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,640
because of her resentment.

379
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,680
Just let her continue hating.

380
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,560
To go to a place like Yazhou,

381
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,560
hate

382
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,680
can keep her alive.

383
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,359
Hate is useless.

384
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,199
Do you have anywhere else to go

385
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,479
if you don't go home?

386
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
You say hate is useless.

387
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
But I'll still hate

388
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,160
because

389
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,359
if we no longer hate,

390
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,040
that means we've given up.

391
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,160
You look at a loss

392
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
after returning from the tea house.

393
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,599
It turns out he still remembers.

394
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,680
What did you say?

395
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,719
All right.

396
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,959
Let's go to the bookstore.

397
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,119
All right.

398
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,479
- Sir.
- Miss.

399
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,160
Are you here to buy books?

400
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,640
Sir, has the Lu's Crime Investigation
arrived yet?

401
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,800
My apologies. A customer came by

402
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,319
and placed an order
on all investigative books in my shop.

403
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,119
Lu's Crime Investigation is one of them.

404
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:24,319
Can you let me read two chapters
before delivering them?

405
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,719
Just two chapters.

406
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,079
One chapter is fine too.

407
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,119
Miss, the customer is still waiting

408
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,199
for me to pack up his orders.

409
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,439
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,719
Sir, since he's still here,

411
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,520
can you let me in

412
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,280
so I can ask him
to make an exception for me?

413
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,680
If he refuses,

414
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,760
I'll give up, then.

415
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:43,920
Well...

416
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,359
All right, then.

417
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:00,880
I heard you've bought the collection
of Lu's Crime Investigation.

418
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:02,839
It's my fortune

419
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,160
to have the same hobby as you.

420
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,280
I was a bit late.

421
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:09,160
I wonder if you can lend it to me.

422
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,479
I don't mean to grab your book.

423
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,079
I just...

424
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,520
Since we have the same hobby,

425
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,599
I'm sure you can understand

426
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,199
the pain of waiting for the latest book.

427
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,760
I'd be happy to only read
the chapters' list.

428
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,239
I know this is abrupt.

429
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,040
But I hope you can let me read it
since we have the same hobby.

430
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,040
They say to wait for an opportunity.

431
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,040
I guess

432
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,560
I was waiting for you.

433
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,719
You?

434
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,920
Why didn't you say anything?

435
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,160
You made me rack my brain
for words to beg.

436
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
It's rare for you to beg me.

437
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,800
Of course, I want to hear more of it.

438
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,760
I bought these for you anyway.

439
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,479
Qingdai. Qingdai. Qingdai.

440
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,839
Coming.

441
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,280
Money.

442
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,680
What are you doing?

443
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,719
Even siblings have to be clear
with money.

444
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:17,920
I must pay you.

445
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,079
I bought every investigative book

446
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,239
in this bookshop.

447
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,839
This is not enough.

448
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,560
I...

449
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,079
I have a monthly allowance.
I can save them.

450
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,359
I'll collect as much as you've paid.

451
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,400
I've been going to every bookshop
in the city these few days.

452
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,719
I want to collect
all of the investigative books.

453
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:43,000
I want

454
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,599
to build a library for you.

455
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,199
So you won't get bored
even if you stay there all day.

456
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,920
I can't accept it for no reason.

457
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,079
How can I repay you

458
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,040
for such a big gift?

459
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:01,760
I think you should accept this money.

460
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,040
I don't want you to pay me.

461
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,439
If you insist on paying,

462
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,199
how

463
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,000
about you pay it with your lifetime?

464
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,280
Are you still worried
that I have no say at home?

465
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,520
Don't worry.

466
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:23,199
Be it the imperial examination
or the military,

467
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,839
I'll do my best to be an official.

468
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,280
So they'd have nothing to say.

469
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,199
If all fails,

470
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll just cut ties with my family.

471
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,920
I can understand

472
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,959
your parents' prejudice against me.

473
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,719
In their eyes,

474
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,880
I'm a woman who brought death
to my husband

475
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,280
and whose marriage was annulled.

476
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,959
They need some time to accept it.

477
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,079
Old Madam has promised me

478
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,199
that I'll make the call for my wedding.

479
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,800
There's no need to rush in our matters.

480
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,520
I don't want to see your relationship
with your family ruined.

481
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,319
I don't want to see you

482
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,079
do the things you don't like
because of me even more.

483
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:09,520
Take these back.

484
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,599
Qingdai, let's go home.

485
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,880
Qingdai!

486
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,760
I still have to pay you.

487
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,719
Someone once told me

488
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,400
if one no longer hates,

489
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,880
it means they've given up.

490
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,560
Why am I thinking about him?

491
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,040
(Everyone says I bring death upon
my husband,)

492
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,119
(and I ought to die for him.)

493
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,760
Let me ask you this, then.

494
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,199
What happens when a man
brings death upon his wife?

495
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,119
When a man is widowed,

496
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,280
it's considered unfilial

497
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,880
if he doesn't remarry.

498
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,520
It's the same scenario,
but the outcome is different

499
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,800
just because of a different gender.

500
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,239
But why should women be this worthless?

501
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:24,959
I want this one.

502
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
You want me to play a servant boy?

503
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,239
You just want to order me around.

504
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,479
Your Lordship wants to reenact the scene
at Heming Building.

505
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:35,119
Lord Liang, do remember

506
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:37,079
that we're working together.

507
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,920
Song Jin, what do you think?

508
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,680
Lord Liang.

509
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,560
(It wasn't easy)

510
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,439
(for me to climb out
of He Feng's coffin.)

511
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,640
I haven't lived my life yet.

512
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,319
I refuse to die

513
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,280
in this coffin.

514
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,719
It wasn't easy to stay alive.

515
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,520
I'll live well every day

516
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,719
and live better than them.

517
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:03,119
I want to show those who wanted me dead

518
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,359
that my life

519
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,000
is more precious than they think.

520
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,520
She has no shame.

521
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:19,750
(Imperial Workshop)

522
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

523
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:25,959
May I know why you've summoned me?

524
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,760
You've done a good job

525
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,000
at the Ministry of Works.

526
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,880
Now, you're overseeing the construction
of His Majesty's temple.

527
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,560
His Majesty even
complimented you yesterday.

528
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,479
It's our duty to be loyal

529
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,479
to the imperial court.

530
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,880
I know you have a daughter

531
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,839
by the name of Qiu Min

532
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,760
who's at marrying age.

533
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,439
At my birthday banquet,

534
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,479
I've met your concubine's daughter,
Qiu Yan.

535
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,920
She's quick-witted.

536
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,400
I'm fond of her.

537
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,479
Your wife can raise
a concubine's daughter

538
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,920
this well.

539
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,719
Then your legitimate daughter

540
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,839
must be exceptional.

541
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,560
Now, Marquis Weiyuan, Liang Yi

542
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,800
has taken a liking
to your legitimate daughter, Qiu Min.

543
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,079
I'd like to match-make the two.

544
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,000
I wonder what do you think about this.

545
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:28,358
(Liang Residence)

546
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,520
- Cui'er
- Young Master.

547
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,280
Get someone to move this.

548
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,160
Yes.

549
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:35,560
Mother, what are you doing?

550
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,880
Yi'er.

551
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,040
I went to the plaace today.

552
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:42,000
Her Highness bestowed these.

553
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:43,800
She told me

554
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,839
she had talked to the Qiu family

555
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,560
about your wedding.

556
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,680
Mother,

557
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,719
I told you no need to rush into this.

558
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:53,040
You agreed to this matter

559
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,359
in front of Her Highness.

560
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,119
How long are you going
to drag this matter?

561
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,560
I... I just don't want
to get married in a hurry

562
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,599
and end up wasting her time.

563
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,839
You always have a lot of excuses.

564
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,800
You were the one who picked her.

565
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,359
Now the gifts are here.

566
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,359
If you keep delaying it,

567
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,000
you don't have to answer me.

568
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,959
You can just enter the palace
and answer Her Highness.

569
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:19,760
Quickly now.

570
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,439
Carry these inside carefully.

571
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,000
Yes.

572
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:32,848
(Qiu Residence)

573
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,640
Do you call this young and promising?

574
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,520
If Min'er marries him,

575
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,520
her life will be worthless.

576
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,079
It'll be bright and sunny
when he's pleased with himself.

577
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,800
But the mood may change suddenly.

578
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:46,680
When he's in a bad mood,

579
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,319
won't he vent it on Min'er?

580
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,280
Han,

581
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,239
but the Noble Consort
did the matchmaking herself.

582
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:53,839
How...

583
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:55,920
How can I reject her?

584
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,800
Even if she's the Noble Consort,

585
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,239
she can't force marriage on anyone.

586
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,520
Han, I'll just be honest.

587
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,560
About the fake notes,

588
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,399
Marquis Weiyuan, Liang Yi
kept them under wraps.

589
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,600
I felt things to be amiss at the time.

590
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,639
Qiu Min, it's your choice.

591
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,879
No matter what the future holds,

592
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,959
you must face it alone.

593
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,159
You can't blame anyone.

594
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Not to mention for whose sake even more.

595
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
Father. Mother.

596
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,280
I'll marry him.

597
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,560
Sir, I've prepared the list.

598
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,760
Girls always like things

599
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,639
such as rouge, powders,

600
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,959
perfume pouch, perfume balls,
and jewelry.

601
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,879
I planned to get some men
from Firewood Office

602
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,120
to pull some carts over here.

603
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,520
Sir, stop worrying about this.

604
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
I'll go back
to Firewood Office tomorrow.

605
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,600
Even if I have to turn
the warehouse upside down,

606
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,760
I'll find the key

607
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,199
to unlock this shackle.

608
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,679
Go to Qiu Residence tomorrow

609
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,320
and ask Qiu Yan out.

610
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,760
Ask Qiu Yan out?

611
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:55,037
(Firewood Office)

612
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,520
Sir, Miss Qiu Yan is here.

613
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,560
Song Jin said you found a craftsman

614
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,479
who can unlock this shackle.

615
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:14,560
Do you want to unlock it that much?

616
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,199
Don't you want to?

617
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,800
You're going to my house
to propose marriage in a few days.

618
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,560
Won't it cause trouble
to leave it like this?

619
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,320
Where's the person to unlock this?

620
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,040
It can't be unlocked.

621
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,239
I wanted to see you
about something else.

622
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,959
Follow me.

623
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,439
Where are you taking me?

624
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:43,040
Here.

625
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,650
(Huaxiang Textile)

626
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,479
Why are you bringing me
to a fabric shop?

627
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,040
Just go inside.

628
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,520
I'll leave if you don't tell.

629
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,320
Wait.

630
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,479
My mom told me
to pick some gifts for Qiu Min's

631
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,679
betrothal presents to be sent over.

632
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,840
You're her sister.

633
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,239
I'm sure she likes
whatever that you like.

634
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,840
Really?

635
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,840
Yes.

636
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,439
Why didn't you say so?

637
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,639
You never approved
of my marriage with Qiu Min.

638
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,000
You put your guard on me
as if I was a thief.

639
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,040
I'm worried you won't help me

640
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,639
if I told you earlier.

641
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Well, thanks to you.

642
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:26,800
What Min'er likes are quite different
from what I like.

643
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,239
She likes crimson red

644
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,840
and light and thin fabrics.

645
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,040
Since she was a kid,

646
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,719
she has liked floral pattern fabric.

647
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,439
Let's pick these few.

648
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,080
My Lord, you're less likely to be wrong
if you buy these.

649
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,040
Miss, you sure have good taste.

650
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,800
These bolts of fabrics
are the shop's valuable ones.

651
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
It's especially supplied from Jiangnan.

652
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,280
You can't buy these anywhere else.

653
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,320
I'll have them all.

654
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,159
All right.

655
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,840
You're pretty easygoing today.

656
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,639
Just a few days ago, you said

657
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,600
as long as you're around,

658
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,239
you won't let me get what I want.

659
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,959
I didn't know why you wanted

660
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:09,959
to marry Qiu Min.

661
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,159
But after working
with you for a few days,

662
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,520
I find you're not that bad.

663
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,800
I trust you'll treat her well

664
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,199
since you've decided to marry her.

665
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:21,320
She's also willing
to accept your family's proposal.

666
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,040
As her sister,

667
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,239
what else can I say?

668
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,199
You like it?

669
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,199
Yes.

670
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,679
But Min'er doesn't like it.

671
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,760
This way, please.

672
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,320
Take a look. There are more upstairs.

673
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,320
The designs here are nice.

674
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,639
They look gorgeous.

675
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,280
Please come again.

676
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:36,679
This way, please.

677
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,600
Is this pretty?

678
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,760
I think Min'er will like this.

679
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,199
I'll look around for more.

680
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,560
Try it.

681
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,560
I don't know if Min'er will like this.

682
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,120
I can't decide on the things here.

683
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,800
Min'er has a lot of jewelry.

684
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,399
She'd stop wearing them
after a few times.

685
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,320
I can't guess
what kind of jewelry she likes.

686
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,280
Nice.

687
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:29,879
How about we look around again?

688
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,120
What if Min'er doesn't like this?

689
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,239
Jewelry is different from fabrics.

690
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,800
We should check out other shops.

691
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,679
You can check upstairs.

692
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,040
There are better ones upstairs.

693
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,360
Sir.

694
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,840
Sir.

695
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,239
The shops have delivered
the things you've wanted.

696
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,320
I've sent the furniture home

697
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,560
for Old Madam's approval.

698
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,959
Bring that to me.

699
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,320
This is for Qiu Yan.
Don't get it mixed up with the rest.

700
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,439
You can leave now.

701
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,320
Yes.

702
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,520
Why is there something for Miss Qiu Yan?

703
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,080
Didn't she help me pick the gifts
for Qiu Min before?

704
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,320
It's to thank her.

705
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,080
Sir,

706
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,600
you've changed.

707
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,159
You're ruined.

708
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,280
Didn't you say

709
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,159
Firewood Office doesn't need feelings
during investigation?

710
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:35,639
You said the marriage alliance
with the Qiu family

711
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:37,000
is nothing more than a political one.

712
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,840
It didn't matter what Qiu Min was like.

713
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,199
But now you bought the gifts yourself

714
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:45,120
and spend a lot
to please your sister-in-law.

715
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,520
You're behaving like Mr. Qin.

716
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,439
Am I not handling this
like an official matter?

717
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:55,879
Regardless of sincerity,

718
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,439
don't I have to use some means
to handle it carefully

719
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:01,360
since I'm marrying her?

720
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,879
(Isn't it a relationship too)

721
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,080
(when it's out of a plot?)

722
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,959
The love between a man and a woman
doesn't happen naturally.

723
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:08,639
Why is it worth praising

724
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,159
when it's for livelihood and ambition?

725
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,919
But when it comes to love,

726
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:15,239
why do girls have to wait

727
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,600
for bestowal from heaven?

728
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,000
Qiu Yan,

729
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,719
I have something to ask you.

730
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:50,000
Come with me.

731
00:42:58,919 --> 00:43:01,719
Qiu Yan, Marquis Weiyuan sent me

732
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,199
half of the betrothal price

733
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
in addition to the custom practice
and the Noble Consort's gifts.

734
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:10,040
I like everything he sent.

735
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:13,959
But it's strange.

736
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,479
How does Marquis Weiyuan

737
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:17,199
know what I like?

738
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,439
Liang Yi works at the Firewood Office.

739
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,760
Of course, he's well-informed.

740
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,840
Qiu Yan,

741
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:35,399
you investigated the case
with Lord Liang before

742
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:37,080
and have some contacts.

743
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:40,120
Now, I'm getting married.

744
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:44,399
I'd like to know
what kind of person he is.

745
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:47,439
He's

746
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,439
shrewd and ruthless.

747
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,959
He could turn against you in seconds.

748
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,879
He'd resort to any means
to have things done.

749
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,479
But

750
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,959
he's not a bad person.
