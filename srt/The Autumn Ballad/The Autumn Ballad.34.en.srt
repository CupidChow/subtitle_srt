=Episode 34=

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,599
﻿Liu Quan was executed this morning.

19
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:44,959
Around the same time,

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,879
Her Highness hung herself in the palace.

21
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:49,559
She left a letter

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,360
claiming she missed the late Emperor

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,919
and chose to follow him
to the afterlife.

24
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:54,919
The Crown Prince...

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,440
No.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,559
His Majesty

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,400
has ordered to hold a formal funeral
for Her Highness.

28
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,199
I got it.

29
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,240
You don't seem surprised at all.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
Are you here to ask that question?

31
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,440
Not me,

32
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,800
but I'm asking on behalf of His Majesty.

33
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,759
His Majesty wants to know

34
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,320
whether you are willing to
lead the Firewood Office.

35
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,919
His Majesty has always admired you.

36
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,399
He knows you've secretly

37
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,440
put the operations into motion.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,240
He says

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,320
as long as you are willing,

40
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,679
you will be reinstated immediately.

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,960
Of course,

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,559
if you want a different position,

43
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,199
feel free to ask.

44
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,320
His Majesty will consider it.

45
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,199
It seems the new Emperor

46
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,759
must not be underestimated.

47
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,000
However,

48
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,000
I plan to resign.

49
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,360
Liang Yi,

50
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,000
you can reply after thinking it through.

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,960
It's not only a great honor,

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
it's a great chance
to realize your ambition.

53
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,520
If you are determined to
implement reformation,

54
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,119
this is a great chance
for us to work on it together.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm afraid I must

56
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
let you down this time.

57
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Do you still hold a grudge
over Song Jing's death?

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,800
I've set aside my prejudice against you,

59
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,960
can't you let go of the grudge
for the sake

60
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,800
of the Imperial Court?

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
Song Jin's sacrifice

62
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,600
will never be forgotten.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,639
But all and all, it was Liu Quan
who set me up in the beginning.

64
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,800
I cannot eliminate
a loyal high-ranking officer

65
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,919
over my personal grudge.

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,440
So, why have you chosen this?

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I decided to resign

68
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,520
because the new Emperor will have

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,600
greater visions and ambitions.

70
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,080
The Imperial Court needs officers

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,360
who are honest and upright,
and sung by the people,

72
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,279
and not a man

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,880
whose name has been tarnished.

74
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,360
Relay my message to His Majesty.

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,080
Not only am I not going back,

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,279
I request for His Majesty
to disband it entirely.

77
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,639
My only wish for the future

78
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,240
is that the world no longer needs

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
an agency like the Firewood Office.

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,279
You're an honorable man.

81
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,480
I feel ashamed.

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,200
There's one more thing.

83
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,079
Go to the Baxia Village in Xiuwu County.

84
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Find a couple.

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,079
The man is called Zhao Mingli,
the woman is called Yueying.

86
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,200
Who are they?

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,399
The He family worked with me

88
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,359
because I had evidence against them.

89
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,320
The He family
ordered their servants

90
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,480
to get Zhao Mingli's
daughter killed.

91
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,440
Yueying is the key witness
of this murder.

92
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,720
I keep them hidden

93
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,559
so I can settle the score later on.

94
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,160
I understand.

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,519
I will bring the He family to justice

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,119
so the dead may rest in peace.

97
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,160
You have my thanks.

98
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
I was wrong about you

99
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,279
when I stood against you.

100
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,040
I apologize for that.

101
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,239
Official Yuan,

102
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,160
not at all.

103
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,239
Your job now is to become
His Majesty's aide

104
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,920
and bring a time of peace

105
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,239
to the people of Dashuo.

106
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,640
What?

107
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,239
You're resigning?

108
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,160
Yes.

109
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,160
What's wrong?

110
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,440
Do you find it odd?

111
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,600
But if you aren't an officer now,

112
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,160
what more can you do?

113
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,600
You told me

114
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,600
I could keep writing novels.

115
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,239
I was giving you
a word of encouragement.

116
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,480
I took it very seriously.

117
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,279
That makes us people
of the same occupation.

118
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,720
Not only that,

119
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,720
we are going to be partners.

120
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,279
What do you mean?

121
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,720
You want to see
what the world has to offer

122
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,440
and learn every curious story there is.

123
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,079
We'll do it together.

124
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,720
Are you sure?

125
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,440
Over the past few days,

126
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,839
I've been thinking about

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
traveling with you.

128
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,720
The Imperial Court doesn't

129
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,920
need me to push the reformation.

130
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,079
The only thing left
for me to do right now

131
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:37,160
is to keep you company.

132
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,640
Are you doing this on a whim?

133
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,399
Will you go back on your words?

134
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,600
I turned down His Majesty's offer,

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I can't go back now.

136
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,959
But,

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
what about your mother?

138
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,440
We can take her with us.

139
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,679
She loves you.

140
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,399
She will like our plans.

141
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,160
Are you saying...

142
00:06:59,119 --> 00:06:59,839
you don't want this?

143
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,799
I do!

144
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,519
I do!

145
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,279
I do.

146
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,600
You are far more likable now

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,679
than when we first met.

148
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,799
Well, I prefer being obnoxious.

00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:15,695
♪We fly wing to wing
beside the sea of mountains♪

171
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:21,255
♪Even if all creations go silent♪

172
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,640
We might not

173
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,359
come back for a few years to come.

174
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,320
So,

175
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,880
I came to bid all of the elders goodbye.

176
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,760
It's to widen your view of the world.

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,880
Stay safe on the road.

178
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,080
Yan'er,

179
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,880
take these

180
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,119
amulets with you.

181
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,359
Thank you, First Uncle.

182
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,159
I have some secret savings

183
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,679
for you to use on the road.

184
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,719
He is the Marquis Weiyuan,

185
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,559
he doesn't need your money.

186
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,080
Keep it.

187
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,159
Both of you, thanks.

188
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,280
Yan'er,

189
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,239
you could take me with you.

190
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,679
I'd like to check out the world

191
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,840
with Yan'er.

192
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,840
My lord,

193
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,359
your legs will fail you as soon as

194
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,400
you reach Mount Yanliu.

195
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,520
Qiu Yan,

196
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,080
keep this purse.

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,760
It's a keepsake.

198
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:15,799
Me too.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,159
You can keep mine as well.

200
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,520
Thank you, Qiu Mei and Qiu Ying.

201
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,159
Qiu Yan.

202
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,719
I'm already helping the First Madam
with bookkeeping.

203
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,000
She says

204
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
I can be in charge of the accounts

205
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,559
when I'm ready.

206
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,640
Don't worry,

207
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,359
I'll study hard

208
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
and become a scholar like our father.

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,679
I'll redeem our family name.

210
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,880
But,

211
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,760
I was too ignorant back then.

212
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,799
It's alright.

213
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,640
I understand.

214
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,039
You must learn to become

215
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,440
an outstanding and righteous person.

216
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,320
The future of the Qiu family

217
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,080
is on your shoulders now.

218
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,840
We are counting on you.

219
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,080
If you have any questions,

220
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,359
feel free to ask me.

221
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,320
I can be your teacher.

222
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,719
I know.

223
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,679
Where is Madam Liu?

224
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,440
Madam.

225
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,400
I said I wouldn't see you.

226
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,640
Why are you here?

227
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,159
You're leaving,

228
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,440
so touching words
are meaningless anyway.

229
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
I'm just a little disheartened.

230
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,640
I wasted years

231
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,640
raising a daughter.

232
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,640
Perhaps

233
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,960
I might never see her again.

234
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,039
You've always seen married daughters

235
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,799
as spilled water that can't be returned?

236
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,880
How am I a waste of your time?

237
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
I knew it!

238
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,919
You still hold a grudge against me!

239
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,559
That's not true.

240
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,799
I hated you,

241
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,159
but it's because you favored my brother.

242
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,960
But now, I'm the master

243
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,520
of my own destiny.

244
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,679
That hate has perished long ago.

245
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,200
Are you saying

246
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,080
you've forgiven me?

247
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,359
It doesn't matter as much now.

248
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,239
Madam.

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,919
We might not

250
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:43,640
have many chances to meet again
in the future.

251
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,640
But whatever the case is,

252
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,159
thank you for raising me.

253
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,679
As you had hoped,

254
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,039
I've earned a place for you
in the Qiu family.

255
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,400
Between you and I,

256
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,080
we are even.

257
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,760
I came here

258
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,359
to give a proper goodbye.

259
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,919
If you don't find me cold and heartless,

260
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,559
you can wish me good luck on the road.

261
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,280
Qiu Yan,

262
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,960
I know I hadn't treated you fairly
in the past,

263
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,440
but what choice did I have?

264
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,840
I know very well

265
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,599
how hard it is to be a woman.

266
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,679
All the pain and suffering
you went through,

267
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,840
I've experienced all of it.

268
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,719
I was in pain too,

269
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,679
but I made it through nonetheless.

270
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,080
I understand.

271
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,280
This is why someone must
make it out first.

272
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,840
Madam,

273
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,479
take care.

274
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,559
Do you still refuse to
call me your mother?

275
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,080
Godspeed.

276
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,400
Your body heals better

277
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,880
if you take a walk from time to time.

278
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,599
Be careful.

279
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,559
Maybe you should go inside.

280
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm alright.

281
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
You'll be the person

282
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,679
I'm worried about the most
after I leave.

283
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,640
The physician says
I'm making a good recovery.

284
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,520
I'll be fine after a month.

285
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,799
That is not what I meant.

286
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm talking about you and Qin Xuan.

287
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,599
Well, you have nothing to worry about.

288
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:28,559
What do you mean?

289
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,679
If I truly love him,

290
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,039
I should care for him

291
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,719
instead of being selfish all the time.

292
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,559
I thought my love for him
was purer than yours,

293
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,039
but I was just selfish.

294
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,119
After what happened,

295
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,239
I know he still cares about me.

296
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,159
That's all I need to know.

297
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,159
I can't trouble him anymore.

298
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,080
Are you

299
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,799
going to give up?

300
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:03,880
Let fate take its course.

301
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,039
After being at death's doorstep,

302
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,119
I've opened my eyes to many things.

303
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,440
I finally realized

304
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:19,080
what I care about the most
wasn't Qin Xuan,

305
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,559
it was you.

306
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:26,960
Do you remember

307
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,880
when you first came to our family,

308
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,359
I gave you a bottle of
osmanthus fragrance?

309
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,320
You asked me

310
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,119
why I would give you a present.

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
I told you, I want nothing.

312
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,520
Why are you giving me this?

313
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,159
It's because

314
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,559
I like you.

315
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,320
Liar!

316
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,679
You smile at me and call me your sister

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,840
because your mother wants you to do so.

318
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,119
You don't like me,

319
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,280
why must you pretend?

320
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Aren't you tired of it?

321
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,440
No.

322
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,960
I really like you.

323
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,880
I don't care who you are,

324
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,559
what you do, or what you say.

325
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
I remember.

326
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,320
I made you cry

327
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,479
and Qingdai had a fight with me.

328
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,959
But I wasn't lying back then.

329
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,520
I have a lot of sisters,

330
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,280
but they are actually my cousins.

331
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,400
But now, I have a real sister.

332
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,239
We are from different mothers,

333
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,400
we're not that close.

334
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,040
At that time,

335
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,079
I knew

336
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,560
you were different
from my other sisters.

337
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,920
Over the years,

338
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,160
I've envied you.

339
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,520
I almost forgot

340
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,400
that I used to like you.

341
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,719
I wanted to become who you are.

342
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,959
I looked down on you,

343
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
but at the same time,

344
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,400
I found your life brighter
than everyone else's.

345
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,439
I hate myself

346
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,280
for not having your courage
and strength.

347
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,479
I hate that you never
treated me with respect.

348
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,479
I'm sorry, I...

349
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,880
Don't apologize.

350
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,920
I hate myself for that too.

351
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:08,959
I didn't want to

352
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,400
live in your shadow.

353
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:17,479
I pray to have that one opportunity,

354
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,280
even just for once,

355
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,880
to outmatch you at something.

356
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,839
If mother could see you now,

357
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,400
she'd blame me for not keeping you safe.

358
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,359
I like who I am right now.

359
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,520
Qiu Yan, I want that flower.

360
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,760
This flower?

361
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,800
I certainly look better than you now.

362
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,599
I'm sorry, but your sister

363
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,319
must bid you goodbye now.

364
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,040
From now on,

365
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,439
you must take care of yourself.

366
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,000
Anywhere else?

367
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,680
You can head back first.

368
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,359
There's something

369
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,839
I want to see to personally.

370
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,119
Sure.

371
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,479
Stay safe.

372
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,040
I'll wait at home.

373
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:35,394
(Fengjing Prefecture)

374
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,239
Yuan Lang?

375
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:53,920
What do you want?

376
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,760
Use whatever identity you want.

377
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,079
Let's get down to business.

378
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,560
Hand over whatever you're
surrendering to

379
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,359
the Fengjing Prefecture.

380
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:05,800
I won't make it hard for you.

381
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:07,479
I have no idea

382
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,319
what you're saying.

383
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,280
You stole from my study
the evidence

384
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,119
of Lin Changzhi embezzling
the state funding.

385
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:14,965
(Case file of Lin Changzhi's corruption)

386
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,839
(Case file of Lin Changzhi's corruption)
I know

387
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,439
(Case file of Lin Changzhi's corruption)
you want to use it to bring me down.

388
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:21,119
You want to prove that
I covered up his misconduct

389
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,000
and set up your father.

390
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,599
I am responsible for
your father's death.

391
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,359
However, let me make this clear.

392
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,920
I only brought down your father

393
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,119
so I could take down Liang Yi.

394
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,439
I never thought your father

395
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,839
would die in a foreign land.

396
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,359
I know you hate me.

397
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,359
But with the new Emperor,

398
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,760
this is my chance to gain his favor.

399
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:47,239
I cannot miss this opportunity

400
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,199
because of my past mistakes.

401
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:50,359
You can make up

402
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,560
whatever righteous excuses you want.

403
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,119
I only know that my father died
because of you,

404
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,560
and I will avenge him.

405
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,719
I knew you wouldn't comply.

406
00:21:59,079 --> 00:21:59,719
What?

407
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,599
Do you want a fight?

408
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:03,479
That won't be necessary.

409
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,119
As I said,

410
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,599
I won't make it hard for you

411
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,560
because I respect Liang Yi.

412
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,560
I will make you hand over
the evidence on your own.

413
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,680
How so?

414
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,839
I know a secret about Liang Yi.

415
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:18,839
I've been pondering on the entire case
for the past few days.

416
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:22,000
I found two disconnecting dots.

417
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,239
I dispatched my men to investigate it.

418
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:26,839
To my surprise, I acquired
a new piece of information.

419
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,680
Do you know

420
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,800
who killed Liang Yi's father?

421
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,479
Fine.

422
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,719
I know what you want.

423
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:39,000
It seems you've learned
the secret as well.

424
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:41,839
Yes,

425
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,959
but I must pretend not knowing anything.

426
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,119
If Liang Yi ever finds out,

427
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,959
it'll be too much for him.

428
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,520
Now that you know
who has a stake in it,

429
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,760
that makes things easier.

430
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,239
Hand over the evidence,

431
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,959
and I'll take that secret to my grave.

432
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,560
It's fine if you choose otherwise.

433
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,439
Feel free to hand it over
to the Fengjing Prefecture.

434
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,239
You get to avenge your father.

435
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,920
As for me,

436
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:15,520
I get to watch Liang Yi
to spend the rest of his life in pain.

437
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,040
At least

438
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:19,040
my effort to bring him down
will be worth the while.

439
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,319
Wait.

440
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:41,160
(Main Administrative Office)

441
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,839
As decreed by His Majesty,

442
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,640
Yuan Lang of
the Main Administrative Office

443
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,959
has eradicated the spy from Northern Liang
that could have harmed the nation.

444
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,959
Such a feat is a great contribution
to the nation.

445
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,119
Yuan Lang shall be promoted as
the Minister of Civil Service Affairs,

446
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,560
effective immediately.

447
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,199
The end.

448
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,239
I am grateful for this promotion.

449
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,280
As decreed by His Majesty,

450
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:21,000
former Inspector of the Firewood Office,
Liang Yi

451
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
has committed the heinous crime
of murdering the late Emperor.

452
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,479
He was framed by the spy of Northern Liang.

453
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,280
As of now, the spy has been
captured and executed.

454
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,079
Liang Yi will be cleared
of all charges to correct

455
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,280
prior misunderstandings.

456
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,880
However, Liang Yi conspired
with fellow officials

457
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,000
to eradicate dissidents.

458
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,520
Such actions are a disgrace
to the Imperial Court and the people.

459
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Liang Yi will be stripped
of his title and rank

460
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:44,280
and serve as a deterrent to his crimes.

461
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,280
The Firewood Office will be disbanded

462
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:49,199
and its staff will be assigned
to the Main Administrative Office.

463
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,680
The end.

464
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,760
I have sinned, and I accept my fate.

465
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,319
Old Madam.

466
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,800
What brings you here?

467
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,239
I'm here to visit you.

468
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,239
Zhou told me

469
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,280
you hadn't stepped out of the house
the whole day.

470
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,400
We are leaving tomorrow.

471
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,839
I am exhausted from packing the luggage.

472
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,000
I want to have some time by myself.

473
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,199
Go back to your work.

474
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,199
Let me brew you some tea.

475
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,280
Never mind, I just brewed this.

476
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,800
I'll get you a new pot.

477
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,319
Never mind.

478
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,040
Let me help.

479
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:49,319
Old Madam, you must not
take your own life!

480
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,040
What is this nonsense?

481
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,400
The person Her Highness ordered

482
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:59,199
to have Liang Yi's father
killed by poison wasn't Mr. Zhan,

483
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,560
it was you.

484
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,199
How did you find out?

485
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,079
Judging by Her Highness's cruel demeanor,

486
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,920
Mr. Zhan wouldn't have lived this long

487
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,319
if he was the murderer.

488
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,160
The other person
who would have the chance

489
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,199
and was trusted by Her Highness

490
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:18,160
was none other than you.

491
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:21,880
You've always known Her Highness
was from Northern Liang.

492
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,280
Am I right?

493
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,760
I am the most heartless woman
in this entire world.

494
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,479
I murdered my husband
with my own hands.

495
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,400
Because of me, my son lived

496
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,520
a life of delusional hatred

497
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,839
after losing his father.

498
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,959
If you regretted it,

499
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,839
why did you bend to
Her Highness's coercion?

500
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,400
There was no coercion.

501
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,079
I did it willingly.

502
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,400
You didn't know the story.

503
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,199
Her Highness and I

504
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,199
lived within the tall walls
of that palace.

505
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,040
We were two young handmaids

506
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,959
and she worked her way up
to become the Noble Consort.

507
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,800
We had been through so much together.

508
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,439
Have you not thought
about Liang Yi's feelings?

509
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,359
He is your son.

510
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,959
How can he ever face this truth?

511
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,479
A person must be responsible
for everyone in her life.

512
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,599
This is simply overwhelming.

513
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,880
I wanted to keep Her Highness safe.

514
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,560
I had to become
a vile and heartless wife

515
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,800
and a cruel mother.

516
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,680
It pains me to do so,

517
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,880
but I'll never regret it.

518
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,040
If you knew all along,

519
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,359
why didn't you tell Liang Yi the truth?

520
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:57,880
I don't want him to suffer as I do.

521
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,520
I tell myself

522
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,199
I must

523
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:02,119
bury this secret to the end for him.

524
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,640
No secret can be kept forever.

525
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,000
He will know the truth someday!

526
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,160
He won't.

527
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,839
I'll have everything arranged.

528
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,199
What you need to do now

529
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,839
is to stay alive.

530
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:13,719
I can't do that!

531
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:14,439
You must!

532
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,160
You owe Liang Yi as much!

533
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,599
Old Madam!

534
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,239
I'll get the physician.

535
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:21,880
It's too late.

536
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,959
I've taken the Anling poison.

537
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,319
Old Madam!

538
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,359
Old Madam!

539
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,000
Old Madam!

540
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:30,839
Qiu Yan.

541
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,479
Old Madam.

542
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,880
You do not understand.

543
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,040
I am not a heartless killer.

544
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:44,160
Every day of my life
has been full of guilt and fear.

545
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,839
Every day is suffering.

546
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,640
I know

547
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,760
I will forever be a sinner

548
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,479
to my son.

549
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,719
When I watched you

550
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,079
pack your belongings

551
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,800
and getting ready
to live a peaceful life,

552
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,319
I felt that

553
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,760
I didn't deserve to have that life.

554
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,959
Old Madam, please.

555
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,839
You can only redeem yourself
when you live.

556
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,560
Dying won't change anything.

557
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,640
Old Madam!

558
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,359
It's too late.

559
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:23,479
You are the only one
who can keep Yi'er from the pain.

560
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,640
This is the end for me.

561
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,400
You must

562
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,520
let me end this suffering.

563

I heard you publish
detective novels here.

It's very important.

716
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:38,439
It's affecting

717
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:39,840
the sales number of your books.

718
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,199
There are rumors

saying the Evil-Purger

720
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,919
was an interrogator His Majesty

721

used to demote

the officials.

723
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:48,679
As you know,

724
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,520
the scholars are very nitpicking.

725
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:51,959
Because of the rumor,

726
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,560
people are not buying
your books anymore.

727
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,360
There is nothing I can do.

728
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,520
Maybe you should

729
00:39:56,879 --> 00:39:57,679
change the pen name.

730
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
You can stop selling the books,
but don't change the name.

That non-negotiable.

732
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:02,679
I don't understand.

733
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:03,919
Why the persistence?

734
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:06,439
Many go by multiple pen names.

735
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:07,679
How about this?

736
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
