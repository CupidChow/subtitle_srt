=Episode 11=

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,639
Sir.

19
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,919
The principal of
the Main Administrative Office said

20
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,319
that they'd be collecting the exhibits.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,239
They have an official decree.

22
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,199
The gatekeeper wasn't able to stop them.

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,440
Also...

24
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:49,080
What is it?

25
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,519
The gatekeeper said,

26
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,319
the Main Administrative
Office's new principal

27
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,559
is Yuan Lang.

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,000
He's back?

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,919
What should we do?

30
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,919
I'm afraid they'd be here any minute.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
I'll try and delay them.

32
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,000
You guys search.

33
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,320
Mr. Yuan.

34
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,600
Long time no see.

35
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,080
It wasn't that long.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,440
It was only 3 years,
2 months and 15 days.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,600
Mr. Yuan has incredible memory.

38
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,320
Very admirable.

39
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,279
Of course.

40
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,399
Since leaving the Capital,

41
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,679
I've been wanting
to reunite with you, Lord Liang.

42
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,320
Thanks to His Majesty's wisdom,

43
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,199
I'm finally able to fulfill the wish.

44
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,199
Congratulations on your reinstatement.

45
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,880
Song Jin, prepare tea.

46
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,098
(7, 4, 11, 5, 8)

47
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,440
Miss Qiu Yan, Mr. Qin.

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,279
Have you found it?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,399
Not yet. There are
too many kinds of stuff.

50
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,119
Please hurry.

51
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,639
I don't think my master
can delay much longer.

52
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,240
Alright.

53
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,559
Song Jin.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,279
The Main Administrative Office is
of the same rank as the Firewood Office.

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,639
Even if they have a decree,

56
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,759
must they be such a stickler for rules?

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,000
You two may not know this.

58
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,759
Although the Main Administrative Office
and Firewood Office

59
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,399
are both regulatory bodies
under the government,

60
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
the Main Administrative Office
was set up first.

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
Since my master
took over the Firewood Office,

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,839
we have been outperforming
the Main Administrative Office.

63
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,039
Three years ago,

64
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,559
the Main Administrative Office's principal,
Yuan Lang,

65
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,279
tried to snatch a case from us.

66
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,800
But my master found dirt on him
and reported it.

67
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,160
He was demoted and sent away.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,559
Since then, the Main Administrative Office
has been without their head.

69
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,399
struggling to recover.

70
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,440
So they have some bad blood.

71
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,559
Now that the emperor
has reinstated Yuan Lang,

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm afraid the whole Main Administrative Office
has their sight

73
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,000
set on finding fault with us.

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,919
This won't do.

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,728
(7, 4, 11, 5, 8)

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
It's going to take forever
to search through everything.

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
These numbers on the boxes.

78
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:53,000
(4)

79
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,600
(Wen, Yin, Zhi)
What do they represent?

80
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,440
Forget about it.
You need to hurry, Miss.

81
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,440
Song Jin, go and tell Liang Yi.

82
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,360
I need him to delay
for around 10 minutes.

83
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,880
Alright. Make haste.

84
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,080
Qin Xuan, look for boxes
that have the number 9.

85
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,399
Mr. Yuan, have some tea.

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,239
It's fine.

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,119
Who knows if the tea is poisonous?

88
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,279
You jest, Mr. Yuan.

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,279
Even if I'm without fear,

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,079
I wouldn't dare poison
a government official.

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,880
You've relished having things your way
in the Capital the last three years.

92
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,720
Colluding with others
and sabotaging your peers.

93
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,880
Is there really anything you won't do?

94
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,239
When you work for the government,

95
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,799
rumors and hearsay are unavoidable.

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,519
You should know that better than me.

97
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,799
Three years ago, you accused me
of something I didn't do.

98
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,440
Was that also a rumor?

99
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,399
The case has been closed.

100
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,399
There's no point talking about it.

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,160
How do you propose we settle the matter?

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,200
I was just kidding.

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,119
I'm only here
because I'm following orders.

104
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,279
(10 minutes.)
I hope

105
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,640
(10 minutes.)
you'll hand over the evidence.

106
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,239
There's no point in delaying.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,640
Of course.

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,480
But, it's been a while since we met.

109
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,640
It's not too much
to ask you to drink the tea first.

110
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,239
I know you're trying to buy time

111
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,440
to hide any clues

112
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,760
and investigate privately.

113
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,880
You want to compete
with the Main Administrative Office for credit.

114
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,320
It's too bad.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,040
I can't disobey orders.

116
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,839
Men, follow me!

117
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,320
Yes, sir.

118
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,239
Who dares to move?

119
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,959
Yuan Lang, considering
you were demoted for three years,

120
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm giving you some leeway.

121
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,959
You dared bring your men here
and caused a ruckus.

122
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,200
It's fine that you're following orders.

123
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,000
But you shouldn't have smashed the tea.

124
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,760
This is the Firewood Office.

125
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
You better think before you act.

126
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,679
Song Jin.

127
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,799
Take Mr. Yuan to the courtyard
and hand over the exhibits.

128
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,480
This way, Mr. Yuan.

129
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:24,880
Liang Yi.

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,760
All our grudges, old and new,

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,559
I will settle them with you, one by one.

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,760
(10, 8)

133
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,520
(Firewood Office)

134
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,991
(Firewood Office)

135
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,079
The confiscated items
from Wanyan House

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,308
were stored in separate boxes

137
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:04,480
(Qiu)
labeled by surnames.

138
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,760
The number on the box
represents the surname's strokes.

139
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,200
After knowing the pattern,

140
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,279
it wasn't that hard to find
the Qiu family's items.

141
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,679
Good thing you found it.

142
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,880
At least our efforts paid off.

143
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,399
Of course.

144
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,000
It was thanks to your help
in delaying them.

145
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,839
But...

146
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,480
That Main Administrative
Office's principal.

147
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,079
Will he report you to His Majesty

148
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,000
because you were uncooperative?

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
It's not a baseless accusation.

150
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,880
I was purposely delaying the operation.

151
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,559
You stormed the Imperial Park
because you were investigating a case.

152
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,480
Disciples of the state religion
were inciting trouble.

153
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
What a disgrace that is to the royals?

154
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,320
If His Majesty couldn't even see that

155
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
and decides to punish you,

156
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,519
that only shows his ignorance.

157
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,399
Qiu Yan.

158
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,200
Watch what you say.

159
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,519
I am merely

160
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,440
a whip His Majesty uses
to quell his many officials.

161
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,920
It feels familiar
after using it for some time.

162
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,079
But it has to be replaced periodically.

163
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,200
Otherwise, with time,

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
people would direct
their anger for the whip

165
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,239
towards the whip's master.

166
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,440
His Majesty reappointed Yuan Lang
as a warning to me.

167
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,279
He wants me to know
that I'm not the only whip

168
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,640
that can protect him
from threats and risks.

169
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,959
Liang Yi, it must be hard on you.

170
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,679
I chose this path myself.

171
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
I've known

172
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,559
what's coming.

173
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,119
I don't deserve to be pitied.

174
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,239
One more thing.

175
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,359
Don't ever say those things

176
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
anywhere else again.

177
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,280
Otherwise, the Firewood Office

178
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,080
will be the first to get you.

179
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:36,679
Understood.

180
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,400
It's late.

181
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,719
I'll get someone to escort you home.

182
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,840
So long, my lord.

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,039
Liang Yi, thank you

184
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,479
for protecting Qiu Yan today.

185
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,119
So long.

186
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,840
Liang Yi seems so impressive in public.

187
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,000
But no one sees his misery
behind the scenes.

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
Please wait here. I'll get the carriage.

189
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:26,919
What are you looking at?

190
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,760
This cuff has fine craftsmanship.

191
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,159
You can hardly tell it's not a bangle.

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,599
I don't think my family will notice.

193
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,799
You don't have to worry.

194
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,520
I'm not worried about that.

195
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm...

196
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,679
I'm angry that the cuff

197
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,880
isn't on me.

198
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,520
Are you jealous?

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,039
I get it.

200
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,080
Lord Liang is highly-skilled
and kills without mercy.

201
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,159
He's also charismatic and inspiring.

202
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,200
I know you're joking,

203
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
but I seriously...

204
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,080
Seriously what?

205
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,159
Seriously am jealous.

206
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,359
Jealous of?

207
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,880
Jealous that I'm not the one

208
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,479
braving dangers with you.

209
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,520
I have an idea.

210
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,239
My left hand has nothing.

211
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,200
If you feel bad,

212
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,000
you could go buy a pair
from a Tocharian.

213
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,080
You and I will have half each.

214
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,719
So I'll be wearing one half with you.

215
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Wearing a different half on each hand?
That's inappropriate.

216
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,200
You mean a man can
hug a different woman in each arm.

217
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,520
Why can't us women
have our feet in two boats?

218
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:33,679
I think

219
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,760
you're the only person in the world

220
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,919
who would say those words.

221
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,440
Miss, sir, the carriage is ready.

222
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:39,960
Please.

223
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,080
Yan'er.

224
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,640
You said someone from our household

225
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,119
is secretly visiting Wanyan House?

226
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,719
In the Capital,

227
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,960
fake notes is only sold
at Wanyan House.

228
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,919
Now, we only need to find
the owner of the jade pendant

229
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,880
to know who it is
that switched the fake notes.

230
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,799
This...

231
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,440
This is elder brother's pendant.

232
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,359
Isn't Elder Uncle
on a trip in Mount Lianyun?

233
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:31,719
That's...

234
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,520
(Qiu Residence)

235
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,725
(Qiu Residence)

236
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:57,359
Get closer.

237
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:00,119
Turn around.

238
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,840
Carry me into the house.

239
00:12:04,952 --> 00:12:06,840
(Qiu Xian, First Master of Qiu Family)

240
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,919
My lord!

241
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:12,960
My lord!

242
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,719
What happened to you?

243
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:20,599
Dear, I'm currently
researching on health care.

244
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,679
A classic describes,

245
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,359
a thousand steps a day
keep everything in balance.

246
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,599
Not one step more, not one step less.

247
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,919
My count for today has been filled.

248
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:38,559
Taking a step more
will cause my essence to leak.

249
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,200
Don't you realize the situation?

250
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,440
Old Madam is waiting for you.

251
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,760
What's the fuss?

252
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,599
Get in here, right now!

253
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,919
Put me down.

254
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,960
Your son, Qiu Xian,
is here to greet you.

255
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,400
You imbecile. On your knees!

256
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,200
You said you were going to the valley
to meditate in seclusion,

257
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,200
but in fact you went to
a shifty place like Wanyan House.

258
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,960
Dishonoring the family aside,

259
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,719
you almost caused the death
of your brother.

260
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,880
Old Madam.

261
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,520
My husband has done wrong.

262
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,159
Considering he's your son,

263
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,840
I hope you'll forgive him this one time.

264
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,960
Mother, Qiu Yi.

265
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,479
This has to be a misunderstanding.

266
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,679
As a spiritual man,

267
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,200
I swear I never left the mountain.

268
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,400
Let alone go to a place that is unclean

269
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,000
and out of tune.

270
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:39,719
I'd be ruining my own attainment.

271
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,119
Then why was your jade pendant

272
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,679
found in a safe at Wanyan House?

273
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,840
This...

274
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,320
This jade pendant is indeed mine.

275
00:13:56,479 --> 00:14:00,200
But I lost it when I returned
to the residence last year.

276
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:04,559
Someone probably picked it up.

277
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,119
Uncle.

278
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,559
You said you lost it
when you came home last year.

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,239
Why didn't you say anything?

280
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,559
Materialistic things like gold and jade

281
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,400
are not important to me.

282
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,159
If I had reported it,

283
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,440
the household would've been
turned upside down.

284
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,200
I thought it wasn't worth the trouble.

285
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,039
And so I kept quiet.

286
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,200
Old Madam, I can vouch for that.

287
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,400
At the time,

288
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,320
I was going to tell Madam Xu,

289
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,640
but Qiu Xian stopped me.

290
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,000
First Madam, you're First Master's wife.

291
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,000
You don't make a convincing alibi.

292
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,679
I...

293
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,520
Uncle.

294
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,080
You said you never left Mount Lianyun.

295
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,239
Can anybody vouch for you?

296
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,840
Well...

297
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,359
Normally, there are only

298
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,000
two or three monks
meditating by themselves.

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,080
How can they be my witness?

300
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,520
But since I'm innocent,
I have nothing to hide.

301
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,280
My heart of purity will be my witness.

302
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,960
If Elder Uncle is being truthful,

303
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,400
then all the male members
in the Qiu residence

304
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,919
can be suspects.

305
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,039
No.

306
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,479
Wanyan House
is a pricey establishment.

307
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,200
Even if the servants
of the Qiu family are paid well,

308
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,640
they're unlikely
to be able to afford a visit.

309
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,000
This leaves either
Third or Fourth Uncle,

310
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,320
who could've taken the jade pendant.

311
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,119
Why are you two

312
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,320
so sure that First Master
was speaking the truth?

313
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,359
What if he lied?

314
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,039
Here you are.

315
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,559
Father wrote some peace talismans
for each room.

316
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,599
He asked me to pass them to you two.

317
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,280
We hope that Uncle Qiu Yi and family
will be healthy and happy.

318
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,479
Thank you for the thoughtful gesture.

319
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,440
In the past,

320
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,559
you've always asked the servant
to pass it to us.

321
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,760
But you personally
delivered it this time.

322
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,719
What a surprise.

323
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,919
Qiu Yan.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,919
There have been misunderstandings
in the past and you were wronged.

325
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:36,960
I...

326
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,479
I wish to apologize to you.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,640
Qiu Mei, please don't.

328
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,520
Please stand up.

329
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,119
What do you mean by that, Qiu Mei?

330
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Father spends most of the time
meditating on Mount Lianyun.

331
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,479
He cares not for worldly matters.

332
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,119
I hope you'll spare my father.

333
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,479
Qiu Mei, you don't have to do this.

334
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,880
Qiu Yan and I have no reason
not to believe Elder Uncle.

335
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,520
Even if we believe him,

336
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
the fact is that Elder Uncle
couldn't provide proof

337
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,239
of him not setting foot
at Wanyan House.

338
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,719
There's nothing we can do.

339
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,400
Qiu Yan.

340
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,920
If you won't agree,

341
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,479
I will not get up.

342
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,920
Elder Uncle said
he had nothing to hide.

343
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,920
So why do you have to go this far?

344
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,520
You can kneel all you want.

345
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:32,391
(Moon-walking)

346
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,680
Why do you still have that?

347
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,760
Miss.

348
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,119
Where did you get the bangle?

349
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,680
Why haven't I seen it before?

350
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,479
I bought it on the street.

351
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,160
A lovely one.

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,479
Miss, take me along next time.

353
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,199
I want one too.

354
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
Will you?

355
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,880
Song Jin, you've gotten rusty.

356
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,319
If I was really good,

357
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
I'd have switched jobs.

358
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,640
Why would I stay and suffer with you?

359
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,199
Go on.

360
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,479
Madam.

361
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,520
What was that?

362
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
Song Jin has gotten rusty?

363
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,920
I asked him to help me
tidy up the scrolls.

364
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,239
But he created a mess instead.

365
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,400
Yi'er, did you get hurt again?

366
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm fine, Mother.

367
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,199
Mother, why did you come
to see me so late?

368
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,760
Can I not visit you without reason?

369
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,839
I hardly saw you around these days.

370
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,280
There's no one to talk to in the house.

371
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,280
I've failed as a son.

372
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,239
Yi'er, what is this?

373
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,040
A peace talisman. From a friend.

374
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,280
That's right.

375
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,400
You were never superstitious.
Who gave it to you?

376
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,599
A peer.

377
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Mother.

378
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,640
I still have some work to finish.

379
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,880
When I'm done in a few days,

380
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
I will spend all my time with you, okay?

381
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,760
I know you find me bothersome.

382
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,880
You wish you wouldn't have to go home.

383
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,719
Mother is always in my heart.

384
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,000
Rest early, Madam.

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,160
Have a good rest, Mother.

386
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,839
By the way, sir.

387
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,479
I checked the storeroom's inventory
this morning.

388
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,319
I noticed that we purchased
two gold handcuff keys.

389
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,800
I'll look again tomorrow.

390
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,400
The key has to be somewhere.

391
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,599
Never mind. It's no rush.

392
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,000
Do you think that girl

393
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,280
is able to find the thief at home?

394
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,319
Qiu Yan?

395
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,839
This case will most likely
be left hanging.

396
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,880
Qiu Yan, with her limited smarts,

397
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,640
can fool

398
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,400
the equally slow-witted Mr. Qin.

399
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,479
But the Qiu Family is a big,
prominent family.

400
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,920
She's trying to get the elders
to divulge who the thief is.

401
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,719
That's too big an ask.

402
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,599
Don't you think so, sir?

403
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,800
Did I say something wrong again?

404
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,719
It's cold.

405
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,040
Change it.

406
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
I told you many times.

407
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,920
The osmanthus fragrance Old Madam likes

408
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,040
is the kind that is faint and subtle.

409
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,160
This is strong enough
to drug mosquitoes.

410
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,359
Change it.

411
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,520
Yes, ma'am.

412
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,280
Madam Xu.

413
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Old Madam is not awake yet.

414
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,920
Once she's gotten changed,

415
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,000
I will inform you two.

416
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,800
Qiu Yan and I came here early

417
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,479
because we wanted to ask you something.

418
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,400
Okay. I'll answer what I know.

419
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,359
That day, you were present too

420
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,560
when Elder Uncle was being questioned.

421
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,000
In your opinion,

422
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,880
if someone had taken the pendant,

423
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
who do you think
is the most likely suspect?

424
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,880
There are so many people
in the household.

425
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,640
Although First Madam and I
oversee matters day and night,

426
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,640
it is hard to avoid
troublemakers altogether.

427
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,239
In Qiu Yi's residence...

428
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,239
Madam Xu.

429
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,760
I'm not asking about the servants.

430
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,400
Well...

431
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,160
It's not in my place to meddle
in my master's matters.

432
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,359
If the Qiu family is implicated
in the fake notes case,

433
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,800
neither you nor I
will be able to live in peace.

434
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,760
My lord, I urge you not to go.

435
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,160
Old Madam hasn't been
in a good mood lately.

436
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,040
If you go

437
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,319
and get stopped at Old Madam's,

438
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,640
you'll only be asking for trouble.

439
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,239
Do you mean I have to be stuck at home

440
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,839
so long as Qiu Yi and co
haven't found the culprit?

441
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,800
Qiu Yi wants a hand in everything,

442
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,719
so he even wants
to dictate when I eat, drink and fart?

443
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,359
Madam Kou.

444
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,719
Haven't you learned how Qiu Hong is?

445
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,359
If he wishes to go,

446
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:10,079
there's no point stopping him.

447
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
My wife knows me so well.

448
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,400
Dear, don't...

449
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,040
Young ladies, Madam Xu.

450
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,400
Fourth Master did indeed go out.

451
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,800
I followed him all the way

452
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,760
and saw him going to Yangliu Street.

453
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,319
While there,

454
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,119
he spent several minutes
in each of the shops.

455
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,319
He turned this way and that.

456
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,800
I got careless and lost sight of him.

457
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
You useless fool.

458
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,880
Yes.

459
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
I know I lost track of Fourth Master,

460
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,880
but I came across
another peculiar matter.

461
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,160
What is it?

462
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
When I came back,

463
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,719
I chanced upon Fourth Madam
leaving the residence by the side door.

464
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,000
She didn't take the carriage

465
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,079
and was heading towards
the west of the city.

466
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,760
Shaobing. Freshly baked shaobing!

467
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,160
(Wang's Clothing Store)

468
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,359
Come.

469

Alright, coming.

476
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,599
Boss.

477
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,359
How's business lately?

478
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,680
Not too bad.

479
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,880
Is your health okay?

480
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:36,959
Yes, I'm okay.

481
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,719
Coming right up.

482
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,409
(Heming Building.
Today's title, Story of Liu Yi)

483
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,000
Miss.

484
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,000
I've checked.

485
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,479
Fourth Madam supposedly comes often.

486
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,599
It doesn't matter what's playing,
she watches everything.

487
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,520
She doesn't ask for encore or give tips.

488
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,439
Every time she's here,

489
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,880
she'll sit in the vestibule facing
the street and drink tea.

490
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,520
That's because

491
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,719
she isn't here to watch the show.

492
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:32,599
That wonton stall has caught my eye.

493
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,479
The old couple are dressed shabbily,

494
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,719
but they make sure the daughter
is in her best frock.

495
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,839
She seems like a proper young lady.

497
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,680
Once Fourth Aunt leaves,

498
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,640
let's have some wontons.

499
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,703
(Sincerity)

500
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,319
Min'er.

501
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,040
Qiu Yan, did you find anything?

502
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,000
Come, we'll talk inside.

503
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,520
Okay.

504
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,160
Fourth Aunt only pretended
to watch shows in the city.

505
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,239
In fact, she was out visiting
a family of wonton sellers.

506
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:27,439
Not only was she watching
from the window,

507
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,319
she even asked the maid
to deliver silver to them.

508
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,560
If she was visiting relatives,

509
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,199
there's no need to be secretive.

510
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,079
Exactly.

511
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,599
This means there has to be

512
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,760
an unspeakable connection

513
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,560
between Fourth Madam
and the wonton stall.

514
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,680
After Fourth Aunt left,

515
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,079
I had a chat with the old couple.

516
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,319
I learned that they were
unrelated to Fourth Aunt.

517
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,640
The only connection
is that their daughter

518
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,479
shares the same birthday

519
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,880
as Qiu Di, Fourth Aunt's son.

520
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,640
Qiu Di left the prefecture to study
a year ago.

521
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,520
And it was this past year

522
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,839
that Fourth Aunt
started to go watch plays.

523
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,719
So their daughter
shares the same birthday

524
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,199
as Qiu Di.

525
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,599
What does that prove?

526
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,839
I heard from my mother

527
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,479
that Fourth Uncle
doted on Madam Kou in the past.

528
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:19,680
He was this close
to divorcing Fourth Aunt.

529
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,599
I heard about it too.

530
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,040
Later, Fourth Aunt gave birth to Qiu Di

531
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,520
and Old Madam was delighted.

532
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,599
She wouldn't let
Fourth Uncle divorce her.

533
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,920
Are you saying Qiu Di is...

534
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,560
Fourth Aunt is cunning
and knows how to mislead others.

535
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,119
Passing a fake as real.

536
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:41,359
That's not unheard of.

537
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,560
This is only my assumption.

538
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
I've asked Qingdai

539
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:47,520
to look for the midwife
who helped deliver Fourth Aunt's baby.

540
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,880
We can only confirm it
after hearing what she says.

541
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,640
Miss, I'm back.

542
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,599
Qingdai.

543
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,319
How did it go?

544
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,719
It was a mess.

545
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,160
The old lady has become feeble-minded.

546
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,839
I couldn't get
any clear answers from her.

547
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,199
When I mentioned Qiu Di's name,

548
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,239
the old lady mumbled something.

549
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,439
"Rest assured, Fourth Madam."

550
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:07,280
"I will take Qiu Di's secret
to the grave with me."

551
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,000
When I heard that,

552
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,800
I figured I had the answer I needed.

553
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,079
Hold on.

554
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,520
Where are you going?

555
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:17,439
Fourth Aunt deceived the Qiu family
by faking a descendant.

556
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
It's a failure as an in-law.

557
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,040
This is a huge matter.

558
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,239
I must inform Old Madam.

559
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,959
You know how big of a deal this is.

560
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,920
If Old Madam finds out,
she'll definitely lash out

561
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,599
and kick Fourth Aunt and Qiu Di
out of the family.

562
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,199
No, it won't end with kicking them out.

563
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,640
Who knows they might have to be drowned.

564
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,719
About this matter,

565
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,160
you need to keep it to yourself.

566
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,319
Are you telling me to keep it
from Fourth Uncle and Old Madam?

567
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,359
That's being unfilial.

568
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,599
I accepted

569
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,119
that you were trying
to help our parents.

570
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,000
So I told you everything

571
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,839
that I found out.

572
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Now, think carefully.

573
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,599
What wrong did Fourth Aunt do?

574
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,880
Back then, it was Fourth Uncle
that ignored her for a new woman.

575
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,079
He was going to make Madam Kou
the legal wife.

576
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,119
If Fourth Aunt wasn't
at risk of being divorced,

577
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,880
she wouldn't have lied to the family
and been separated from her own child.

578
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,599
But Fourth Uncle did that

579
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,439
because Fourth Aunt
wasn't able to have children.

580
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,599
If not being able to have children
is the fault of the wife,

581
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:14,719
then shouldn't Father
also divorce Mother?

582
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,839
These rules and etiquette

583
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,680
were tailored for the men.

584
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,239
Fourth Uncle took advantage of that

585
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,640
and gave Fourth Aunt a hard time,
doing only what pleased him.

586
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:29,400
She is also an involuntary member
of this big family.

587
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,079
I must say I admire her

588
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:33,479
for her bravery and self-preservation.

589
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:34,560
But...

590
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,560
When you were about to be buried
with He,

591
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,319
Fourth Aunt didn't try
to defend you in any way.

592
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,880
So why are you defending her now?

593
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,439
I am only being matter of fact.

594
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,599
If she never treated me well,
I wouldn't treat her well either.

595
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,560
But backstabbing?

596
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,439
I will never do that.
Neither should you.

597
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
You hear?

598
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,040
Since you made it clear,
I'll do as you say.

599
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,520
I can't be of any help to you.

600
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,959
I only annoy you.

601
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,119
It's better I leave.

602
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,680
But today is the last day
of the three-day deadline.

603
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,119
I hope you already have

604
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,560
a conclusion regarding the fake notes.

605
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,079
Was I too harsh on her?

606
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,920
I bet she'd cry alone in her room.

607
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,199
I think you should worry about
the matter at hand instead.

608
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,719
We thought Fourth Aunt was suspicious.

609
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,640
But our investigation proved otherwise.

610
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,439
We have no other leads.

611
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,800
Third Young Lady is right.

612
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,280
After tonight,

613
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,400
Old Madam will be breathing down
everyone's neck again tomorrow.

614
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,000
What will you do, Miss?

615
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,319
Who said there's no lead?

616
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,079
I think

617
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,920
we're actually getting closer
to the truth.

618
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,199
First Master, there you are.

619
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,239
I've looked everywhere for you.

620
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,959
Old Madam wants you

621
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,319
to go to the main hall.

622
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,520
She wants to talk to you.

623
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,959
Are there new findings
on the fake notes?

624
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,119
Second Young Lady said
that she'd found the thief.

625
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:31,000
Let's get going, master.

626
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,479
Old Madam is waiting.

627
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,760
No need to rush.

628
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,520
I just had lunch.

629
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,119
Moving in haste will affect
the spleen and stomach.

630
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,520
Slowly does it.

631
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,680
No need to rush.

632
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,119
Master, why don't I get someone
to carry you?

633
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:52,959
That will do.

634
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,319
Fugui.

635
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,400
Get over here.

636
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,119
Quick, carry First Master.

637
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,319
Be careful.

638
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,479
Slowly.

639
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,040
No need to rush.

640
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,079
Okay.

641
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,959
Old Madam, everyone is here.

642
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,319
Qiu Hong, it's only noon.

643
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,359
Have you already finished all the steps?

644
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:34,160
Staying still is growth.

645
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Moving is also growth.

646
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,880
Your son, Qiu Xian,
is here to greet you.

647
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:47,920
Alright.

648
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,800
Yan.

649
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:57,000
Old Madam.

650
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,920
Elder Uncle, Elder Aunt,
uncles and aunts.

651
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,880
I managed to find out who in the family
went to Wanyan House

652
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,119
and secretly exchanged fake notes.

653
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,880
Elder Uncle is innocent.

654
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,599
He's never been to Wanyan House.

655
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,040
And we believe that
just because he said so?

656
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,599
One thing is undeniable.

657
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,079
The jade pendant belonged to Qiu Xian.

658
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,079
I made the conclusion based on evidence.

659
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:24,680
Every year,

660
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,280
Elder Uncle would write peace
talismans for every family.

661
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,920
I noticed

662
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,160
that Uncle wrote the talismans

663
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,560
not with cinnabar,

664
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,599
but with madder.

665
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,520
Madder is not as vibrant as cinnabar.

666
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,160
Hence, it's not preferred
when writing talismans.

667
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,640
I only found out when I asked Father.

668
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,239
Elder Uncle was born with allergies.

669
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,880
That's right.

670
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,880
I can't stand medicinal herbs,

671
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,719
let alone smells

672
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:50,479
that are overly pungent.

673
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,079
From what I've gathered,

674
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,079
Wanyan House is not only enveloped
in thick fragrance,

675
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:59,160
it also contains lemongrass powder.

676
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,079
With allergies like Elder Uncle,

677
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,719
I'd guess that he'd swiftly faint

678
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,479
if he had stepped foot inside.

679
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,760
So I deduced,

680
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,399
Elder Uncle couldn't have gone
to Wanyan House.

681
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,239
If it's not Qiu Xian,

682
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,760
then it has to be Qiu Hong.

683
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,560
If you ask me,

684
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,239
Qiu Hong has always been unbridled,
taking interests

685
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,560
It's normal to lose track sometimes.

686
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,399
First Madam, I am playful, yes.

687
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,520
But I don't go about unchecked.

688
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:31,120
Using fake notes to frame Qiu Yi?

689
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,320
I would never do such a thing.

690
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,399
Fourth Uncle.

691
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Half a year ago,

692
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,600
you owed the bordello at Tianshui Alley

693
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,000
a thousand taels.

694
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,040
You secretly took Old Madam's
set of precious metalware

695
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,320
from the courtyard,

696
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
sold them and repaid the debt.

697
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,199
Is that right?

698
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,520
How did you know?

699
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,239
That's enough.

700
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,120
We will settle
the lost metalware another day.

701
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:00,879
Qiu Yan.

702
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,600
You said Qiu Hong is the one
who went to Wanyan House.

703
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
How can you prove it?

704
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,600
Old Madam.

705
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:09,360
Fourth Uncle has a record
and a motive.

706
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,239
But he's not the one
who went to Wanyan House.

707
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,120
I sent someone
to investigate the bordello.

708
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,360
Over the past year, Fourth Uncle
has been clocking in every night,

709
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,879
with only a few days of absence.

710
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,360
I then asked the servants

711
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,239
and learned that Fourth Uncle
had been sick those days.

712
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,399
He didn't leave the house.

713
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,760
Thus, Fourth Uncle did not have
the time to go to Wanyan House.

714
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,679
So it's not us,

715
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
nor Qiu Hong.

716
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,760
Could it be that a servant
went behind the master's back,

717
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,360
took the jade pendant

718
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,080
and disguised as the master outside?

719
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,080
First Aunt.

720
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,639
There is one person present today
who isn't clear of suspicion yet.

721
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:11,399
Second Young Lady, you better not
simply accuse without proof.

722
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,600
The whole household

723
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,679
knows very well that your Third Uncle
is honest and fair.

724
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,919
A man who buries himself in books

725
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,000
will never go to places
like Wanyan House.

726
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,840
That's right.

727
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,360
If Qiu Ning ever went
to that sort of place,

728
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,800
he'd probably only give
a slew of literary jargon.

729
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,199
What a joke that would be
if people heard?

730
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,719
I know

731
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,879
that the seniors

732
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,439
wouldn't believe
it could be Third Uncle.

733
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,159
I thought the same at first.

734
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,000
But after eliminating all possibilities,

735
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,639
the impossibility that's left

736
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,280
has to be the truth.

737
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,000
Fine.

738
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,520
If I...

739
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,760
I...

740
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,399
Qiu Ning, aren't you
supposed to be stoic?

741
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,840
Nonsense!

742
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,439
Qiu Ning, don't leave us
all hanging like that.

743
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Third Uncle.

744
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,800
The night of Jiazi of Bingzi month,

745
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:03,679
where were you?

746
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,439
I... I was home.

747
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,679
Or maybe I went to play chess
with colleagues.

748
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,000
That was a month ago.

749
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,479
How do you expect us to remember?

750
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,360
Since Third Uncle doesn't remember,

751
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,679
he is then unable to prove
that he didn't go to Wanyan House.

752
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,399
You. I...

753
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,679
You're twisting words!

754
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yan, let me ask you.

755
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,479
Do you have actual proof

756
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:25,600
that he was there?

757
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,760
Do you not know of
"innocent until proven guilty"?

758
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,639
Old Madam, forgive us
for taking our leave first.

759
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,800
Let's go.

760
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,280
Third Uncle,
if you leave this hall now,

761
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,679
no one will be able to protect you.

762
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,959
The imperial court is investigating
the fake notes case.

763
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,600
All those who've been to Wanyan House

764
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,600
will be brought to the Firewood Office
for questioning.

765
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,239
Say I report this
to the Firewood Office.

766
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:49,679
I'm afraid

767
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,439
the one questioning you then

768
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,120
will no longer be me.

769
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,000
You little cunning fox!

770
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,679
Are you wanting your uncle
to confess under duress?

771
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,000
Old Madam.

772
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,600
I think the fake notes

773
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,719
is the doing of Qiu Yi and his family.

774
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,399
Now they're trying to make
a brother be the scapegoat

775
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:09,000
and bear the blame.

776
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:10,159
Old Madam.

777
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,520
Please see that justice is upheld.

778
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:16,320
Imbeciles. A bunch of imbeciles!

779
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,959
I... I did go to Wanyan House.

780
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,000
Qiu Ning, did you really do it?

781
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,719
Qiu Ning.

782
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
How could you...

783
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:44,959
Qian, why are you also stuttering now?

784
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,280
I defended you in front of everyone.

785
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,239
But you played me for a fool.

786
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,000
How dare you lie to me?

787
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,239
Why did you do that?

788
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,360
Qiu Yi.

789
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,159
Who knows maybe Qiu Ning made a mistake.

790
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,120
It wasn't on purpose.

791
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,639
Come.

792
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,679
Come now, get up.

793
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,399
Qiu Ning.

794
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,520
First, hand over the real notes.

795
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,800
We can sort out the rest later.

796
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,360
I... I do have fake notes.

797
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,000
But I didn't use it

798
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,879
to replace real notes
from the family fund.

799
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,479
When I heard about the case,
I went to my room

800
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,879
and found all the fake notes was gone.

801
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,439
I'm sure someone switched out
my fake notes.

802
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,040
So who was it that replaced
your fake notes?

803
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,280
How... How should I know?

804
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,320
But...

805
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,000
But I have an idea.

806
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,639
The idea is... is...

807
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,280
Just spill it.

808
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,479
Mother, can I have some water?

809
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,199
In order to prevent customers

810
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,479
from obfuscating real or fake notes,

811
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:57,760
they are given a vial of potion.

812
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,199
The potion is colorless and odorless.

813
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,800
Putting a drop on the note

814
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,439
will make the note turn blue.

815
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,520
The fake notes is made from a material
that reacts with the potion.

816
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,479
If it gets onto the hand,
it will adhere for up to half a month.

817
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,679
So skin that has touched the fake notes

818
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,000
will also turn blue
if dabbed with the potion.

819
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,320
So what Third Uncle means

820
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,159
we can test with the potion to find out

821
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:24,120
who it was that touched the fake notes.

822
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,040
Yes.

823
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,919
Where is the potion?

824
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:30,199
It's in the bottom drawer
of a cupboard by the wall in my room.

825
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:30,919
I'll go get it.

826
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,800
You might have another trick
up your sleeve, Uncle.

827
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,879
I think it's better
for Madam Xu to get it.

828
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:35,919
Alright.

829
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:51,679
I can go get it by myself.

830
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,679
You two wait here.

831
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,760
Less hands, less mess.

832
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:55,399
Yes, ma'am.

833
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:34,040
Madam Xu.

834
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,760
You said you doted
on my father the most, right?

835
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,120
So why?

836
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,959
Only the person
who touched the fake notes

837
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,679
would be afraid to be found out
by the potion

838
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,000
and so discarded it.

839
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:52,719
Madam Xu

840
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,000
is the one
who switched out the fake notes.

841
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,600
How could it be?

842
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,159
Madam Xu has been
with Old Madam for years.

843
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,000
Old Madam taught her
all the ins and outs.

844
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:08,840
Fourth Uncle is right.

845
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,719
Madam Xu is a long-serving staff
in the residence.

846
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:15,040
She's the last person
we would ever suspect.

847
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,120
You were very meticulous.

848
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,320
But there was one thing
you failed to hide.

849
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,439
I'm talking about your composure.

850
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,959
You were so eager to make me
cast doubt on Fourth Uncle.

851
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,080
If someone had taken the pendant,

852
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:32,239
who do you think
is the most likely suspect?

853
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,919
Who else could it be?

854
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,840
It must be the unreliable Fourth Master.

855
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,080
Half a year ago,

856
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
he secretly took

857
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,439
Old Madam's precious metalware
from the storeroom

858
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,600
to be pawned

859
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,879
in order to pay his naughty debts.

860
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
(After eliminating Fourth Uncle,)

861
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,679
(you then led me to think
it was Fourth Aunt.)

862
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,000
Could it be that Qiu Hong

863
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,439
asked Fourth Madam to switch out

864
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,639
the remaining fake notes?

865
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:57,479
Now, you were the only piece
that I had neglected

866
00:42:57,479 --> 00:42:59,120
in my investigation.

867
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:00,719
You've been the housekeeper for years.

868
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:03,840
You have access
to easily switch out notes.

869
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,840
And you have the ability
to frame Qiu Rong.

870
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:09,320
So when I determined the culprit
wasn't Fourth Uncle,

871
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:11,040
I went behind your back

872
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,040
and looked for Third Uncle myself.

873
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,159
This means

874
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,159
you knew your Third Uncle isn't the one.

875
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:18,719
Yes.

876
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,919
I knew long ago

877
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:22,199
that Third Uncle
couldn't have stolen the fake notes.

878
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,560
Everyone knows this.

879
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,439
Third Aunt keeps
a tight leash on Third Uncle.

880
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,840
All financial dealings between them
and the family fund

881
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:32,760
are handled by Third Aunt.

882
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Hence, there's no way Third Uncle
would've given

883
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,959
fake notes to Third Aunt for repayment.

884
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:37,840
Because in doing so,

885
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,800
he wouldn't be able to explain

886
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
where the money came from.

887
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,719
So the only possibility

888
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,239
for the fake notes

889
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,639
is that it's Third Uncle's
personal stash.

890
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,800
Of course.

891
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:54,239
Third Uncle is sensible.

892
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:57,399
That's why he agreed
to put on the act with me.
