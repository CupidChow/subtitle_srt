=Episode 27=

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,040
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,720
These are the memorials
that have been piled up recently.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,279
Please go through them, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,199
A memorial from Yuan Lang.

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,959
Who is he going to accuse this time?

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,599
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,720
In the eyes of Official Yuan,

25
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,360
the entire court
is filled with problematic officials.

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,199
I cannot tell

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,000
who he is going to accuse today.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,639
Your tongue
is getting sharper and sharper.

29
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,119
I said something unnecessary again.

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Oh, this foul mouth of mine.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,440
I shall punish myself.

33
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,320
Take this.

34
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,320
Foul mouth.

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Outrageous!

36
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,559
Please do not be angry, Your Majesty.

37
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,479
Please quell your anger, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,919
P... Please calm down, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,479
Liu Quan!

40
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,399
You have nothing to do with this.

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,600
Bring the Empyrean Fairy...

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,320
No.

43
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,839
Bring me Qiu Min!

44
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,919
Don't let her get away!

45
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,479
Hurry!

47
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

48
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,559
Greetings, Your Majesty.

49
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,320
Your Majesty.

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,600
These are all lies and slanderous words

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,080
made up by Wang Shun
of the Royal Academy.

52
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,479
I am innocent, Your Majesty!

53
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,039
I knew you would deny it.

54
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,759
No worries.

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,479
We only need to have a granny
examine your body,

56
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,880
and we'll know
if your chastity is still intact.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Liu Quan.

58
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,080
Summon a few grannies.

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,800
Yes,

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,320
Your Majesty.

61
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,479
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,119
That won't be necessary.

63
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,919
I dare not deceive Your Majesty.

64
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,000
I am indeed no longer

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,440
a virgin.

66
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,119
Impersonating the Empyrean Fairy

67
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,240
is a serious crime.

68
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,199
You consecrated

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,360
His Majesty's Dengxian Pearl.

70
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,919
Does that not
render its powers worthless then?

71
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,080
Someone!

72
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:37,720
Wait!

73
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,639
My chastity was indeed still intact

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,039
when I consecrated the Dengxian Pearl.

75
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,320
Wang Shun's words
are but false accusations.

76
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,880
I only entrusted myself

77
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,559
to Qin Xuan yesterday.

78
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Your Majesty.

79
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,080
Every word I have said

80
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,199
is true.

81
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,080
Qiu Min

82
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,440
was indeed still a virgin yesterday.

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,440
Qin Xuan.

84
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,160
If memory serves me right,

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,639
you and Qiu Min are cousins.

86
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,919
Official Yuan.

87
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,279
Are you trying to say

88
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,639
that I have a close relationship
with Qiu Min,

89
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,279
and thus my words are not credible?

90
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,040
That is all right.

91
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,559
There are other witnesses.

92
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,200
Don't think that you can weasel
your way out of it

93
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,559
just by bribing a few peddlers.

94
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:29,040
Noble Consort Guo can testify for me.

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,200
Guo?

96
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,040
Your Majesty.

97
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,000
I did overhear their conversation

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,239
with my own ears,

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,320
and I saw the bloodstain

100
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,079
on the sheet with my own eyes.

101
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,239
I am certain.

102
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,679
Official Yuan.

103
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,920
Is there anything else
you do not understand?

104
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,440
Your Highness has been most clear.

105
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,200
I have no other questions.

106
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,920
This means

107
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,640
Qiu Min was indeed
still a virgin when she consecrated

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,399
the Dengxian Pearl.

109
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,559
Your Majesty.

110
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,119
The purpose
of the Empyrean Fairy's reincarnation

111
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:09,040
is to consecrate the Dengxian Pearl.

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,839
So long as she was still a virgin
when she performed the consecration,

113
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,959
the effects of the pearl
will not be affected.

114
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,839
As for what happens after that, well,

115
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,160
she may still have
the Empyrean Fairy's root of wisdom,

116
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
but she also has
the desires of an ordinary woman.

117
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,279
Moreover,

118
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,279
the Empyrean Fairy
is a goddess of passion and empathy.

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,839
Miss Qiu Min's behavior

120
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,359
may have been

121
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,720
immoral,

122
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,440
but it is understandable
for the vessel of the Empyrean Fairy.

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
I have not conducted
a thorough investigation

124
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,119
and have jumped to conclusions.

125
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,640
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

126
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,079
You carried out your role dutifully.

127
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,959
Your intention was kind.

128
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,160
But you are still as hasty as ever.

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,640
A year's worth of your salary
will be forfeited.

130
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,320
You may not be promoted within the year.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,079
Reflect and work on your temperament.

132
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,399
Thank you for your forgiveness, Your Majesty.

133
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,640
Leave us.

134
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,519
Your Majesty.

135
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,640
I did not inform Your Majesty

136
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
of this matter after I returned

137
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,720
because

138
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,079
I wanted to find the right chance

139
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,359
to appeal to Your Majesty
for this young couple's sake.

140
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,160
Since the Grand Preceptor has said so,

141
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,640
I would like to ask Your Majesty

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
to sanction their marriage.

143
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,640

144
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:29,760
Request permitted.

145
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,959

00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,760
I was finally able to help you for once.

173
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:39,493
♪Until we grow old and turn gray♪

174
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:41,413
♪The spring breeze has come♪

175

179
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,679
Congratulations.

180
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,119
Thank you.

181
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,440
Congratulations.

182
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,959
Please go inside.

183
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,119
Thank you.

184
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,920
Thank you.

185
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:01,760
Thank you. Please put it down here.

186
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,079
You're too generous.

187
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,079
Please go inside.

188
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:04,760
Congratulations.

189
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,640
Lead our guest inside.

190
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,160
Congratulations.

191
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,239
Thank you.

192
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,079
Thank you. Please leave it here.

193
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,119
You're too kind.

194
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,200
Please go inside.

195
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,239
Please go inside.

196
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,480
Congratulations, Madam.

197
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,519
Thank you.

198
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,399
Please head inside.

199
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,959
Su Yiwan
of the Marquis Weiyuan Residence

200
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,679
has come to congratulate
the Empyrean Fairy on behalf

201
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,880
of Lord Liang Yi for the marriage
sanctioned by His Majesty.

202
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,719
I am the female head of the Qiu Family.

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,559
Please give my thanks to Lord Liang.

204
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,039
If you have time,

205
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,119
please come
and visit us often, Madam Su.

206
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,359
May I give
the Empyrean Fairy my best wishes

207
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,880
in person?

208
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,479
Of course.

209
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Someone.

210
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,960
Lead Madam Su to Min'er's room.

211
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:03,679
Yes, Madam.

212
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,760
Madam.

213
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,520
Congratulations.

214
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,840
Thank you.

215
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,799
Times are different.

216
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,440
These are the only tea leaves
we have right now.

217
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,599
Please make do with this tea.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,799
I'll serve you with the finest tea

219
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,799
after marrying into
the Duke Ying Residence.

220
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,559
I'm not here for tea.

221
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,320
You are here to ask me
about what happened

222
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,719
when we were summoned
by His Majesty then?

223
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
That's already in the past.

224
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,320
I came to ask you

225
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,039
if what Wang Shun said

226
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,320
was indeed true.

227
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:23,760
After we were pardoned,

228
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,039
Qin Xuan
not only sent us food and clothing,

229
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,919
but he also ransomed

230
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,559
all of our servants that he could find.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,479
This must have been
Sister and Brother-in-law's kindness.

232
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,400
I don't know how I thank you.

233
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,880
We are in-laws now.

234
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,559
There is no need for such courteousness.

235
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:40,559
Indeed.

236
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,559
His Majesty sanctioned the marriage
between Xuan'er and Qiu Min himself.

237
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,320
It is clear that His Majesty
still favors the Qiu Family.

238
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,280
Mother.

239
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,400
Father.

240
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,880
Aunt.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,679
I feel a little restless.

242
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,159
I would like to go outside for some air.

243
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,559
All right.

244
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,559
Your parents and I will discuss
the arrangements for the wedding.

245
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,640
Go and take a stroll in the garden.

246
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,239
If so, give me a kiss.

247
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,320
What?

248
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,239
I have to become a nun

249
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,320
before I can experience

250
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,679
what it feels like to kiss a man.

251
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,559
Why should I suffer like this?

252
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,200
What's the matter?

253
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:53,919
Are you scared?

254
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,239
Cousin, you mustn't do this!

255
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,559
This concerns your reputation!

256
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,799
I'll stop teasing you.

257
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,760
I appreciate the thought.

258
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,159
Besides,

259
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,520
you should stop

260
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,679
calling me Cousin.

261
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,479
You sound like a Chinese opera actor.

262
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,400
(Just call me Qiu Yan.)

263
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,919
(Yan as in "sweet".)

264
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,679
Let me ask you this.

265
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Was what Wang Shun said really true?

266
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,400
Why didn't you tell me?

267
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,679
What would it matter if I told you?

268
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,200
I've cried and pleaded
with you many times.

269
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,799
But have you ever done anything for me?

270
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,440
You only think that I am weak.

271
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,679
It's not like that.

272
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,039
Have you forgotten?

273
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,880
Madam Liu was pushing me around.

274
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,520
When it was thundering, I went to you

275
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,719
and asked you to keep me company,

276
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,119
but you turned me away.

277
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,239
You're capable.

278
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,559
You're always out there
trying to make a future for yourself.

279
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,080
No, that's not right.

280
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,039
You did it for the Qiu Family.

281
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,440
You're the family's savior.

282
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,880
The hope of the family.

283
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,000
You're such a busy person.

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,960
You couldn't possibly have time for me!

285
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,599
Nothing else to say?

286
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,239
It was my fault...

287
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,119
Stop putting up this farce of yours!

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,799
Qiu Yan.

289
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,840
You shouldn't apologize to me.

290
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
You should congratulate me.

291
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,239
You didn't do anything wrong.

292
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,679
In fact, I should thank you.

293
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,840
Do you know?

294
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,239
I thought about taking my life

295
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,239
after he tainted me.

296
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,960
I slit my wrist with a piece of tile.

297
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
But I didn't die.

298
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,200
Do you know why?

299
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,880
I was discontent.

300
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,599
Why could you have everything

301
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,640
you wanted?

302
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,479
But I had

303
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,080
to suffer such humiliation!

304
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,039
All these years,

305
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,599
I watched how you held my mother's

306
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,520
and Qin Xuan's affections.

307
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,479
How you won the hearts
of those I cared for.

308
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,039
Do you know how much I envied you?

309
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,200
No.

310
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
I was jealous.

311
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,200
I did everything

312
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,039
for you and the Qiu Family,

313
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,599
and what do I have
to show for in the end?

314
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,400
You were the one who taught me.

315
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,880
Shame?

316
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,919
Scruples?

317
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,200
They are but fleeting things.

318
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,359
I've learned everything from you.

319
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,119
I can be even more ruthless.

320
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,799
Qiu Yan.

321
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,719
Do you want to hear

322
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,880
how I got Qin Xuan to become mine?

323
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,880
Not only did I lie
to him that you were dead,

324
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,159
but I drugged his wine as well.

325
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,559
With the aphrodisiac
from the Royal Academy.

326
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,960
I snuck some with me when I escaped.

327
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,239
Why wasn't I the one who died?

328
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,400
Qin Xuan, drink my cup.

329
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,359
I will have Qin Xuan.

330
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,479
I will reclaim everything I lost!

331
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,960
Qiu Yan.

332
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,159
Why do you pity me?

333
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,440
You didn't wrong me.

334
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,799
You should be happy for me.

335
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,719
Everything I have today

336
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,159
is all thanks to you.

337
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,559
Who's there?

338
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,559
Qiu Yan!

339
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,760
Why are you hitting me?

340
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,960
I'll teach you a lesson.

341
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,359
- I'll show you.
- Have you gone mad?

342
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:41,960
I'll teach you a lesson.

343
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,520
You must be crazy!

344
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,840
Get yourself treated!
Why are you whipping me?

345
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,080
Godmother!

346
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,280
Godmother! She's going to kill me!

347
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,039
Help me, Godmother!

348
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,000
She's going to kill me! Godmother!

349
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,719
Godmother!

350
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:01,320
Qiu Yan!

351
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,119
Qiu Yan!

352
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,400
What are you doing?

353
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,599
Why are you whipping Wang Shun?

354
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,280
Stop!

355
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,680
Are you crazy?

356
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,520
Lord Liang!

357
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:10,800
Look what Qiu Yan did!

358
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,839
She could've killed him!

359
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,920
Who are you calling Qiu Yan?

360
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,000
This is the Madam
of the Marquis Weiyuan Residence.

361
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:17,800
Wan'er.

362
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,319
You've vented your anger.

363
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,319
Leave the rest to me, all right?

364
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:25,959
Lord Liang,

365
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,880
there must be a misunderstanding.

366
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,599
Wang Shun introduced me

367
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,040
to a lady from the Royal Academy.

368
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,800
My Wan'er found out.

369
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,680
She got jealous.

370
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,040
Godmother,

371
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
I've never introduced a lady

372
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,040
to Lord Liang.

373
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,280
It was Qiu Yan.

374
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:41,719
She started whipping me
the moment she came in!

375
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,079
Let's talk at the Firewood Office.

376
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,839
Song Jin.

377
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:46,760
Take him with us.

378
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,040
Men!

379
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,959
Get him out of there.

380
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,839
W... Where are you taking me?

381
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,280
What are you guys doing?

382
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,359
Where are you taking me? Godmother!

383
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,359
Godmother, help me!

384
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,520
Godmother!

385
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,400
Godmother!

386
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,959
You were too reckless.

387
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,560
Why didn't you wait for me
to get there first?

388
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,880
The Royal Academy
is under government rule.

389
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
The guards here are well-trained.

390
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,839
Fortunately, one of them was my own,

391
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,040
and he notified me in time.

392
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:27,880
Does it hurt?

393
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,880
It's all right. Don't cry.

394
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,640
Miss Min is here.

395
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,520
Aunt Qin.

396
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,880
Uncle Qin.

397
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,280
We are discussing

398
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,760
the matter of your engagement.

399
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,239
Your father

400
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,239
will be returning to the capital soon.
We'll have the Duke Ying Residence

401
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,959
make a formal proposal
with the betrothal gifts then.

402
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:45,760
What do you think?

403
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,880
I will leave everything to my elders.

404
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,280
Now that this matter is settled,

405
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:52,239
we shall take our leave now.

406
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,199
Qin Xuan.

407
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,439
What's the matter?

408
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,119
Aunt.

409
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,920
Mother. Father.

410
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,520
I would like to have a word
with Qiu Min in private.

411
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,959
Both of you are engaged.

412
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,000
It is all right for you
to share a few words in private.

413
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,359
Your father and I
will wait for you at the carriage.

414
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,599
I was taking a walk
in the garden for air,

415
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,199
and I stumbled upon the courtyard
of the second chamber.

416
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,280
I heard everything

417
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
you told Qiu Yan.

418
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,760
You misunderstood, Qin Xuan.

419
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,520
I haven't even told you what I heard.

420
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,359
Yet, you are so sure

421
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,160
that I have misunderstood.

422
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,239
I heard every word loud and clear.

423
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,839
You exclaimed with such conviction

424
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,760
that you had drugged me,

425
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,959
and that was why I went...

426
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,640
to bed with you that day.

427
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,959
I thought

428
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,359
I had taken advantage of you.

429
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,839
I thought that it was my mistake

430
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,719
I had failed Qiu Yan and you.

431
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,479
I never expected

432
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
that you

433
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,839
who appear to be as docile as a lamb

434
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,439
would use such underhanded tactics

435
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,640
to set me up!

436
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:37,239
Qin Xuan.

437
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,280
Listen to me.

438
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,680
That's not true.

439
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,199
I...

440
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,040
Those were only lies I made up

441
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,199
to spite Qiu Yan.

442
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,119
Please let me explain...

443
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:47,880
Qiu Min.

444
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,880
When did you become so?

445
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,680
Lying without even blinking.

446
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,239
Qin Xuan...

447
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,000
I only did it

448
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,199
because I...

449
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:02,719
Enough.

450
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,439
If I hear

451
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,199
another word from you,

452
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:11,239
I will feel sick to my stomach.

453
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,160
Qin Xuan.

454
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,479
Listen to me, Qin Xuan!

455
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:16,000
Qin Xuan!

456
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,719
I cannot go against

457
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:24,760
His Majesty's orders.

458
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,880
After I return,

459
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,959
I will ask for a job
at the Ministry of War.

460
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,239
From this moment on,

461
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,000
you and I will go our separate ways.

462
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,280
We will be a couple in name only.

463
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,760
I will never touch you again.

464
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,319
Qin Xuan...

465
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,400
(Liang Residence)
I have to remind you again.

466
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,839
You really should not be so impulsive.

467
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,079
All right.

468
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,479
Sorry for the trouble.

469
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,680
Young Master.

470
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,160
Qiu Yan!

471
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,599
Qiu Yan,

472
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
you're the only one
who can help me now.

473
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,199
What do you want me to do?

474
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,160
You... You can explain it to Qin Xuan.

475
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,560
He always listens to you.

476
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,599
No matter how angry he is,

477
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,640
he will still hear you out.

478
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,680
Everything he heard was the truth.

479
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,719
What do I have to explain?

480
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,439
Qiu Yan.

481
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,599
I was taken advantage of.

482
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,079
Now, I've finally gotten together

483
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,479
with Qin Xuan.

484
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:53,040
If he hated me,

485
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:55,160
I would rather end my life here!

486
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,400
This is the Marquis Weiyuan Residence.

487
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,800
Don't come seeking death here.

488
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,000
Qiu Yan.

489
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,640
I know.

490
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:04,160
I know you and Qin Xuan are close.

491
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,719
But if you help me,

492
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,400
I will never come between

493
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,880
both of you again.

494
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,800
You can meet in private.

495
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,560
Even... Even if you should
carry his child someday,

496
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,000
we can claim it's my child,

497
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,079
and I will raise the child.

498
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
What nonsense are you blathering?

499
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,880
You yourself
have such deplorable thoughts,

500
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,839
but that doesn't mean
everyone else is the same!

501
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,160
Qiu Yan, I beg you.

502
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,760
Please help me!

503
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,680
When I remember

504
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,119
the cold, piercing look
in Qin Xuan's eyes

505
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,560
when he last spoke to me...

506
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,079
Please help me

507
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,479
this one time.

508
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,959
You did those horrible things.

509
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,800
But did you never think

510
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,400
that he would find out someday?

511
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,239
Now, he has found out.

512
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,160
You instantly lost all wits,

513
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,479
and you even spouted such absurd words.

514
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:52,199
You will never win his heart.

515
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,359
Since you have chosen this path,

516
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,959
you will have to follow it to the end.

517
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,760
If you want to win Qin Xuan's heart,

518
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,239
you have to rely on yourself.

519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,439
No one can help you.

520
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,239
Hold it, Qiu Yan!

521
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,199
Do you remember

522
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,359
my mother's last words to you?

523
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,160
I was the one
she was the most worried about.

524
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,839
I am her only biological daughter.

525
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:18,160
Didn't you promise her
you would look after me?

526
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,280
If you don't help me,

527
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
will you be able to face her?

528
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,079
Wan'er.

529
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,280
Mother is looking for you.

530
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,319
Go and see her.

531
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,160
Miss Qiu Min.

532
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,680
Please leave.

533
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,760
Please have some tea, Official Yuan.

534
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,640
You lured me

535
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,040
into Liang Yi's trap,

536
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:10,800
didn't you?

537
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I am innocent, Sir.

538
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,680
I was misled by Wang Shun too.

539
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,719
Even if I had set you up,

540
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
you interrogated Wang Shun yourself,

541
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,199
didn't you, Official Yuan?

542
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,680
You must have been able

543
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,680
to tell if he was lying.

544
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,839
Do you know

545
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,319
how much of a fool and disgrace

546
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,800
I made of myself before His Majesty?

547
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,400
It's all my fault.

548
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,040
I am terribly sorry, Sir.

549
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,319
That's not necessary.

550
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,959
How did Liang Yi see through my plans

551
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,199
and lead Noble Consort Guo
into the scene in advance?

552
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,280
Even if you hadn't told him,

553
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,560
did you not notice

554
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,520
anything odd about his actions sooner?

555
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,040
Ever since he took Qiu Yan
as his concubine,

556
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,719
he has distanced himself from me.

557
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:02,839
He hasn't allowed me
to be involved in many things as well.

558
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,040
This is as much as I can help you.

559
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,959
Why don't we cease

560
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,160
our cooperation now
if you are still unsatisfied?

561
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,839
Please do not be upset, Miss Xiaoxiao.

562
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,000
I lost my composure.

563
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:22,680
I will not go back

564
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,239
on my promise to you.

565
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,680
I shall take my leave now.

566
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,359
Goodbye, Official Yuan.

567
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:32,920
I shan't bother to see you out.

568
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,280
You guys go ahead.

569
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,520
I thought

570
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,560
you would never see me anymore.

571
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,359
I heard
you're joining the Ministry of War.

572
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,199
When?

573
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,640
Early next month.

574
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
Taking up a position in court

575
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,520
will mean a new start.

576
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:32,760
Do not dwell

577
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,719
on the past.

578
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,640
Is that all

579
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,400
you came to tell me?

580
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,400
Time slips away quietly,
no matter day or night.

581
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,560
Both of us should look forward.

582
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,680
If you want to look forward,

583
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,199
go ahead.

584
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,280
I can't.

585
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,800
I can never forgive

586
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,239
what Qiu Min did.

587
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,479
What exactly did she do

588
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:02,119
that was so unforgivable?

589
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,560
She plotted against me.

590
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,560
I did the same
during the Chuiwan Party as well.

591
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,920
I went to great lengths
so that I could meet you

592
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
at the Chuiwan Party.

593
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,439
Liang Yi was right back then.

594
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,119
Back then,

595
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,119
I had schemed and plotted

596
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,359
to earn your favor.

597
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:19,959
It's different.

598
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,439
You schemed against me

599
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,959
because you loved me.

600
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,520
Min'er did all of this

601
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,359
because she loved you too, didn't she?

602
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:31,199
It's not the same anyway.

603
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,560
At least you've never harmed another.

604
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,800
But she kept us apart.

605
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,160
If it weren't for her,

606
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,880
things wouldn't be like this
between us right now.

607
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,640
You're wrong.

608
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,280
Even without Qiu Min,

609
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
we would never be together.

610
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,479
Qin Xuan.

611
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,680
To this day, I must admit

612
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,959
that in the beginning,

613
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,400
I was in a desperate situation.

614
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,079
You treated me nicely.

615
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,319
I couldn't help but want to get closer.

616
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,000
I wanted to grab onto
that only opportunity.

617
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,520
I thought that was love too.

618
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,680
But I realized it wasn't.

619
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,760
Being moved and being in love
are different things.

620
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,119
Qiu Yan.

621
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,160
Is this necessary?

622
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,760
All just to make me forgive Qiu Min?

623
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,400
No.

624
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:28,239
I'm not saying this
to get you to forgive her.

625
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,319
You don't have to forgive

626
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,959
what Min'er did.

627
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,479
All of these

628
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,000
are my heartfelt words.

629
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,400
You know me.

630
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,640
If I still had feelings for you,

631
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,319
I wouldn't give up just like this.

632
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,520
Qin Xuan, do you know?

633
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,719
When Qiu Min told me

634
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:56,839
you two had gotten together,

635
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,560
I thought I would feel sad and hurt.

636
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,920
But the sadness left me
in a brief moment.

637
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,079
In my heart,

638
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,640
avenging my mother

639
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,880
and vindicating the Qiu Family

640
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,160
had always mattered more
than being with you.

641
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,239
Compared to what I want to do,

642
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,359
men, love,

643
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,560
I can give them all up.

644
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,400
Qin Xuan.

645
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,640
I'm sorry.

646
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,359
You regard me
as your most important one,

647
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,000
but I can't give you everything in return.

648
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,560
I understand.

649
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,359
I'll pay back what I owe you

650
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,959
in the next life.

651
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,439
Qiu Yan!

652
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,439
Look to the future.

653
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,919
♪Mountains and seas apart♪

654
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:22,638

00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:46,118

661
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,160
Do you regret it?

662
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,439
No.

663
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,479
Since I no longer have feelings for him,

664
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,800
I should not give him false hope.

665
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,680
You eavesdropped on us.

666
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,280
Is that so surprising?

667
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,000
This is what the Firewood Office does.

668
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,640
We spy and monitor officials.

669
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,520
It's only an occupational habit.

670
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,359
Are you surprised?

671
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,000
I've always been vindictive.

672
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,079
It's my nature.

673
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,199
Vindictive, are you?

674
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,160
Wait right there!

675
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,079
Sir.

676
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,040
This is the Ministry of War's official attire

677
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,439
Master had me deliver to you.

678
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,239
Master says

679
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,359
that everything is in order.

680
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,040
All that's left is for you
to take up the post.

681
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,199
Beixue, store these storytelling scripts

682
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,040
away.

683
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,560
Sir.

684
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,280
These are your most precious belongings.

685
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,679
I won't be needing them anymore.

686
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,859
(Qiu Residence)

687
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,679
It's already noon.

688
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,080
Why aren't they here yet?

689
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,120
They only reached Tong County yesterday.

690
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
It is a long journey.

691
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,800
It's normal
that they would be a little late.

692
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,919
First Sister-in-law is right.

693
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,280
However long of a wait will be worth it

694
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:50,600
so long as they return safely.

695
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,639
Well, it's not as if I can't wait.

696
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,520
I'm just anxious.

697
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
The carriage is here.

698
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
They are back.

699
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:18,993
(Qiu Residence)

700
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,719
My lord.

701
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,439
My lord.

702
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:32,719
You're back.

703
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,800
You wretched man.

704
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,199
You finally made it back.

705
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:35,719
You're home, my lord.

706
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,600
Where is Father? I don't see him.

707
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:38,439
My lord?

708
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,159
Where is my husband?

709
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,800
And Rong'er.

710
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,479
Answer me!

711
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:14,774
(Qiu Residence)

712
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,520

Sir Jin.

716
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,040
Madam.

717
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,000
The Qiu Family's men
have entered the city.

718
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,439
They should arrive
at the Qiu Residence soon.

719
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:58,159
Good.

720
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,159
Good. That's great.

721
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,159
But...

722
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,080
Official Qiu...

(Memorial Tablet

725
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,080
Mother.

726
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,520
I am unfilial.

727
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,560
I have returned late.

728
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,000
Qiu Yi caught heat illness

729
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:57,600
on our journey home.

730
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,560
He struggled to hold on,

731
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,800
but he couldn't make it back.

732
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,919
I am the eldest son of the Qiu Family.

733
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,320
Yet, I had devoted myself
to the cultivation

734
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,159
and neglected our family's matters.

735
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,879
I have no merit or virtue.

736
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:21,919
Rest assured, Mother.

(Memorial Tablet

738
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,159
From today onwards,

739
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,679
I will lead the Qiu Family well.

740
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,000
I will never let the Qiu Family
perish by my hands.

741
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,120
I... I...

742
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,760
I may not be able to speak properly,

743
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,560
but I've studied with Qiu Yi

744
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,439
since young.

745
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:48,320
Before, I had been too complacent

746
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,760
and only sought pleasure.

747
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,320
M... Mother,

748
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,040
I... I vow...

749
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,159
I will lead
the younger members of the family

750
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:58,080
to work hard and study diligently.

751
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,879
I will never indulge
in merry-making ever again.

752
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,479
Mother.

753
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,600
I may not have high aspirations

754
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,919
like my two brothers,

755
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,120
and I know...

756
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,120
you spoiled me the most.

757
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:32,600
I vow to quit gambling
and frequenting brothels.

758
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,879
I shan't become
the black sheep of the family.

759
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,679
I am an unfilial son!

760
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,520
Grandmother. Father.

761
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,120
Your unfilial descendent, Qiu Rong,

762
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,479
vows

763
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,040
to attain scholarly achievements,
earn a name for himself,

764
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,320
and restore the Qiu Family's honor.

765
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,120
If only you had known better sooner.

(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Father Qiu Yi)
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Mother, Old Madam)

767
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,639
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Father Qiu Yi)
We are father and daughter.

768
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:58,080
But for the most part,

769
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:02,520
we didn't understand each other.

770
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,679
We've always found

771
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,120
that saying another word
further was meaningless.

772
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,800
You think I wouldn't dare?

773
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,159
I...

774
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,000
You are a lady.

775
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,439
Since ancient times, marriage

776
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:21,000
has been decided by the parents
and arranged by the matchmaker.

777
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,120
He doesn't have any say in this.

778
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,159
I've always blamed him.

779
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,159
I thought
he was traditional-minded, pedantic,

780
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,479
and prideful.

781
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,040
He put the name and reputation

782
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,760
of the Qiu Family above all else.

783
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:37,600
But when our residence was raided,

784
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,560
(he told me to stop throwing a tantrum)

785
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,280
(and leave quickly.)

786
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,760
Yan'er.

787
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,239
Why are you here?

788
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,000
There's no time for a tantrum.

789
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,120
Something big happened.

790
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,399
Leave with your sister now.

791
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,520
Hurry.

792
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,840
(The first thought
that came to his mind...)

793
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,479
That way.

794
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:48,879
Go!

795
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:50,719
(was to protect Min'er and me.)

796
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,000
Go! Hurry!

797
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:56,120
I never thought

798
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,000
those would be
the last words he said to me.

799
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,520
Did you know?

800
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,199
The afternoon the day before the raid,

801
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,760
I thought it was him
who took my mother's life.

802
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:11,560
My mother's jade piece

803
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
is the other half of the jade
Master Zhenyan from Taiying Temple

804
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,040
carries.

805
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,800
Therefore,
you thought my mother cheated on you

806
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,639
with Master Zhenyan.

807
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,520
And you colluded

808
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,000
with Old Madam

809
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,280
to poison my mother.

810
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,320
Father, if you ever feel a tad remorseful,

811
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,120
surrender yourself
to the Fengjing Prefecture.

812
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,000
I always thought...

813
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:34,000
I thought...

814
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,479
After he came back,

815
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,760
I would tell him I was sorry.

816
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,840
"I was wrong to blame you, Father."

817
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,280
But he left just like that.

818
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,360
Up until he left,

819
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,520
he must have thought

820
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,719
that I still resented him.

821
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,280
I'll never get a chance to make up

822
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,439
for the words I said to him that night.

823
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:01,639
During this time...

824
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,919
All this time, I kept thinking.

825
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,000
I thought when my father

826
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,000
would surely see me in a new light

827
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,040
after he returned

828
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,040
and saw everything I had done.

829
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,679
He would definitely praise me.

830
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,879
He would say
that I was the pride of the Qiu Family.

831
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:22,199
He would be proud of me.

832
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,600
But I can't tell him that now.

833
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:31,000
And I'll never get to talk to him again.

834
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,679
Why didn't he come back with them?

835
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,600
Why?
