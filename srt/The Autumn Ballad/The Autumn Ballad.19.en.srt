Sorry.

00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,519
I know

20
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,519
you like me.

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,080
You told me once

22
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:06,239
I'm the most important person to you.

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,679

you're not mine.

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,600
I seduced you

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,639
because I needed you to save me.

27
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,679

it was all intentional.

00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,240
It was I who dragged you
into the same boat.

Yes, Lord Liang?

86
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,040
For the upcoming month,

87
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,959

(Ding Rong Banknotes, 100 taels)

89
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,200
Duly noted, sir.

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,480
I will make sure Miss Qiu
will not be overworked.

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,559
See you.

92
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,720
Sir. Sir.

93
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,079
I was retrieving your storytelling script
from the bookhouse

94
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,959
and I heard

95
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,320
that Miss Qiu Yan has now begun
entertaining customers.

96
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:32,799
I even heard

97
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,079
that Lord Liang spent a fortune
booking her schedule.

98
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,600
Sir, should you confront Lord Liang?

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,600
Sir?

100
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,519
It's fine.

101
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:57,200
Qiu Yan must be forced to entertain
customers.

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,359
Liang Yi booked her

103
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,160
to preserve her maidenhood.

104
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,720
Sir, you truly trust
Lord Liang this much?

105
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:15,519
Liang Yi will never take advantage
of someone.

106
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,760
Qiu Yan was forced to entertain guests

107
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,200
so Liang Yi booked her

108
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,000
to make sure no one could sully her.

109
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,600
This must be it.

110
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,239
So Liang Yi still has
an ounce of conscience.

111
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,359
He didn't leave the Qiu family
high and dry.

112
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,440
I hate myself

113
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,440
for not being able to do a thing

114
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,000
despite knowing her predicament.

115
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,239
Sir.

116
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,239
Qiu Yan, you're awake.

117
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:00,799
Eat something.

118
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,519
Min'er.

119
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,200
I was drunk yesterday.

120
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,519
Did I say something out of turn?

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,359
No, you were all right.

122
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,239
Good.

123
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,000
Ms. Wang came to congratulate us

124
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,160
and said Lord Liang spent
100 silver notes

125
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,200
to book your schedule.

126
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Should I offer my

127
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,239
congratulations too?

128
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,600
What do you mean?

129
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,760
You drank with Lord Liang last night

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,799
and you were all chummy with him.

131
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,000
I saw everything.

132
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:37,679
It's only been a few days

133
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,160
and you forgot about Qin Xuan already.

134
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,440
You never shed tears

135
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:43,720
for him even once.

136
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,480
Aren't you just playing
with their feelings?

137
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,200
I cut ties with Qin Xuan already.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,880
Just like you with Lord Liang.

139
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,440
What now?

140
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
I have to spend every day crying?

141
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,480
Right.

142
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,079
I thought you cut ties with Qin Xuan

143
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,160
to avoid implicating him.

144
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,880
You entertain guests so that
we can live better.

145
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,320
It's for survival.

146
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,160
Lord Liang booked you

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,679
to protect your maidenhood

148
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,959
but that was not

149
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,600
what I saw yesterday.

150
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,359
It was for...

151
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,799
If you want to say it was for show,

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
there was no one there watching you two.

153
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,160
I have to entertain the guests.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
Drinking and having fun is my job.

155
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:16,799
Right.

156
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,839
You're very good at seduction indeed.

157
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,679
Just one night and you managed
to make Lord Liang book you.

158
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,880
But

159
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,559
have you thought about what Qin Xuan

160
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,640
would feel about that?

161
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,679
You only think about yourself.

162
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,440
Now that Qin Xuan can't help you,

163
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:31,720
you discard him away.

164
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,880
You covet Lord Liang's
power and position.

165
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,679
Indeed.

166
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,440
I only plan for myself.

167
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,359
This is not your first day
knowing me anyway.

168
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,080
I will grovel to the rich and powerful.

169
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,119
I did it to Qin Xuan

170
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,239
and I'm doing it to Liang Yi.

171
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,119
Are you happy now?

172
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:43,640
You...

173
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,440
Qin Xuan deserves someone better.

174
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:08,327
(Firewood Office)

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,440
Hu Wan, a wood supplier.

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,080
Do you know why you're here?

177
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,640
Lord Liang, you just want to know more
about Qiu Yi's case.

178
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,280
Yes.

179
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,080
You should know very well

180
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,960
that I will not spill a word.

181
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,679
If you torture me,

182
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,320
Official Yuan will not
let you off the hook.

183
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Who said I would torture you?

184
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,919
This silver needle is as thin
as a strand of hair.

185
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,440
It will not leave a trace even when
it's inserted into your body.

186
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
This spot is between the heart
and the diaphragm.

187
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
It's protected by ribs

188
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,880
and under the ribs is our lungs.

189
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,039
Once I insert this silver needle

190
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,679
into your lungs,

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,919
the poison on it will make your lungs

192
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,119
shrink.

193
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
Three days later, your lungs

194
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,760
will only

195
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,080
be as big as a fist.

196
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
Pardon, a baby fist.

197
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
In these three days,

198
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,919
you'll look normal

199
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,919
while you watch yourself slowly getting

200
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,320
out of breath.

201
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,440
Have you seen those who are drowning?

202
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,760
You will be like them.

203
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,280
I'll confess!

204
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,719
I'll confess everything.

205
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,679
Write everything down.

206
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,479
The Imperial Court wishes
to build a temple.

207
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,960
Official Lin Changzhi
of the Ministry of Works

208
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,159
came to me to purchase woods.

209
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,880
He asked for a bribe several times

210
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,640
and I gave him all my money.

211
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Therefore, I could only supply
mediocre woods.

212
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,200
Halfway through the construction,

213
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,080
Official Qiu discovered the subpar quality
of the woods used.

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
He asked for the ledger.

215
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,479
Seeing the scandal
was about to break out,

216
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,559
Official Yuan came to me

217
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,479
and said as long as we accused Official Qiu

218
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,400
of embezzlement,

219
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,200
he would find a way to hide the bribe
in the Qiu Residence.

220
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,039
Once Qiu Yi is incriminated,

221
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Lin Changzhi and I

222
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,799
will walk out scot-free.

223
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,080
Enjoy the meal, sir.

224
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,080
Have a safe trip, sir.

225
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,159
Ms. Wang.

226
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,080
When will Miss Shi be done?

227
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,280
She promised to teach me how to sing.

228
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,200
I'm waiting for her.

229
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,960
A Minister of Works
is having a party here.

230
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,479
He spent a lot of money

231
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,960
so she won't be done until daybreak.

232
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,719
Which minister?

233
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,159
Official Lin Changzhi.

234
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,719
Your father's crime now

235
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,479
is that he embezzled

236
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,320
the money His Majesty allocated
for the construction of a temple.

237
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,880
The imperial merchant, Hu Wan,
is the testimony.

238
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,280
However, my recent investigation

239
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,559
shows that the memorandum to
impeach your father

240
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,039
was submitted by
the Minister of Works, Lin Changzhi.

241
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,960
He has a close relationship with Hu Wan.

242
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,760
Ms. Wang,

243
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,479
I would like to learn from Miss Shi.

244
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,799
Can you bring me to her?

245
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,960
You're booked by Lord Liang.

246
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I can't do this.

247
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,719
It's fine.

248
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,760
He's not here today.

249
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,840
He won't know a thing.

250
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,400
Even if he knows,

251
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,039
he won't reprimand me harshly.

252
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,520
Hu Wan

253
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,880
begged me

254
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,359
to treat you to this dinner,
Official Yuan.

255
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,719
He would pay for it.

256
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,719
But now, he's nowhere to be seen.

257
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,400
The Firewood Office summoned him.

258
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,919
That's why he's not here.

259
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,159
What should we do?

260
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,599
Why? You won't trust Hu Wan?

261
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,520
Hu Wan is spineless.

262
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,960
In the Firewood Office,

263
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:02,159
he will confess

264
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,080
everything.

265
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,799
He strikes with a sword but
I have a shield to defend myself.

266
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,239
I need him to confess everything.

267
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,719
All right. Enough.

268
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,599
Cheers.

269
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,000
Noble sir, sorry for the intrusion.

270
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,039
Didn't I tell you not to disturb us?

271
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
Ms. Wang told me

272
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,760
two educated gentlemen
graced us tonight.

273
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,919
I, Yan'er,

274
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,919
volunteer to come here to serve you
and learn a thing or two.

275
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,559
So anyone can serve us now?

276
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,039
We already have Miss Shi with us.

277
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,280
Bugger off.

278
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,119
Official Lin.

279
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,200
You ought not to turn

280
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,280
a willing woman away.

281
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,000
Yan'er.

282
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,159
Come in.

283
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,000
Lin, don't you recognize Miss Yan'er?

284
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,479
She just arrived here

285
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,840
so she's not fully trained
for anything musical.

286
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,679
By the way,

287
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,679
she's a descendant of your old friend.

288
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,760
Who?

289
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,280
The eldest daughter of Official Qiu Yi.

290
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,760
I have heard about your father.

291
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,320
It's a shame.

292
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
If you need

293
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
anything here,

294
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,239
just tell me.

295
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,159
Yan'er, come serve Official Lin a glass.

296
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,159
Uncle Lin,

297
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,479
you're my father's colleague

298
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,359
so you're half an uncle already.

299
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,080
Uncle? Just call me Brother Lin.

300
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:35,159
Call me Brother Lin.

301
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:40,919
Since you're willing to serve me,

302
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
make sure I'm satisfied then.

303
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,840
Isn't that right?

304
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,239
Come.

305
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,520
Drink more.

306
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,760
Official Lin. Excuse us.

307
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,359
Official Lin, drinking wine is so boring.

308
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
Why don't you tell me

309
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,280
about your temple construction business?

310
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,799
If it proves to be a fun tale,

311
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,520
I will drink more with you.

312
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,599
That's easy.

313
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,960
But you need to drink

314
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,039
after every sentence.

315
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:30,919
Sure.

316
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,200
That's a promise.

317
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,400
The temple His Majesty

318
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,200
wishes to build is a sophisticated one.

319
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,359
The wood in the main hall

320
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,679
will require top-grade gold Nanmu logs
from Mount Yungui.

321
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,840
What expensive logs!

322
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,640
Who supplies it in the Capital?

323
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,320
Hu...

324
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,520
I spoke a few sentences already.

325
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,520
You need to drink now.

326
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,119
Right.

327
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,919
Come.

328
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:03,799
Come.

329
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,880
Why cover your mouth?

330
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,200
Come.

331
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:09,960
Come.

332
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,520
Lord Liang, we're both colleagues.

333
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,559
We can talk like gentlemen.

334
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,599
Why the sudden violence?

335
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,039
Liang Yi.

336
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,039
Wait, Lord Liang.

337
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,479
You don't have the right to speak.
Get up!

338
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,239
Official Lin.

339
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,440
I booked Qiu Yan.

340
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:24,760
Why were you

341
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,159
touching her?

342
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,080
She volunteered to serve me.

343
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,000
It's not my problem.

344
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,479
- Wait.
- Lord Liang.

345
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,159
No.

346
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,840
Fancy seeing you here.

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,719
Lord Liang,

348
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,119
Miss Qiu Yan did come here
of her own volition.

349
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,159
The women in the Royal Academy

350
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,479
are all fickle-minded anyway.

351
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,159
Don't cross your colleague

352
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,479
for a trivial matter like this.

353
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,119
Lord Liang, I did this.

354
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,119
Come with me.

355
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,520
But Lord Liang!

356
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,119
Lord Liang.

357
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,320
Don't, Lord Liang.

358
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,840
Calm down now, Official Lin.

359
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:56,960
Let me serve you.

360
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,080
You're the best, Xiaoxiao.

361
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,440
What are you doing, Liang Yi?

362
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
What am I doing?

363
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,400
You're my woman.

364
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,319
Am I not allowed to be pissed

365
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,640
when I see you get intimate
with another man?

366
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,680
You booked me

367
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,359
because I'm Qiu Min's sister

368
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,599
and you don't want me
to be paraded around.

369
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,239
When did I become your woman?

370
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,880
Who said I booked you for Qiu Min?

371
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,520
So

372
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,760
Lord Liang,
you truly have feelings towards me?

373
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,160
I see then.

374
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,560
Please don't be mad at me.

375
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,959
They are so good at acting.

376
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,400
They left.

377
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,160
Lord Liang.

378
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,400
You did a great job pretending

379
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,479
you were green with jealousy.

380
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,680
I almost thought it was real.

381
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,839
What?

382
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,680
That fit of jealousy
wasn't entirely an act.

383
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,040
You truly think Liang Yi

384
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,479
was acting in front of us?

385
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:27,719
I thought Liang Yi took care

386
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,199
of Qiu Yan because of Qiu Min.

387
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,359
But judging from how concerned he was
regarding Qiu Yan,

388
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,560
it seems like he really likes her.

389
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,119
He can lie to everyone

390
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,599
but he can't lie to me.

391
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,640
Why did he ask for Qiu Min's hand then?

392
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,079
Because Qiu Min is the child
of a legal wife.

393
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,400
In a political marriage, the child of
a legal wife is more important.

394
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,760
But feelings, however,
don't care about all that.

395
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,680
Now,

396
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,760
looking back at all Liang Yi did,

397
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,000
he might seem heartless

398
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,359
but he was protecting the Qiu women.

399
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,239
He must be trying to protect Qiu Yan.

400
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,599
You said you could never leave
the Royal Academy

401
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,079
so you needed a plan for yourself.

402
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,680
You would rather be a courtesan

403
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,319
than be a servant forever. Fine.

404
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,680
I'll book you

405
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,439
and I will not skimp on the money.

406
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,000
It should be enough for you
and the other Qiu women

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,439
to live comfortably here.

408
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:12,400
So tell me now.

409
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,479
Why did you volunteer

410
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:14,839
to serve Lin Changzhi and Yuan Lang?

411
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,479
I was wondering

412
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,239
why you always meddled in my business,

413
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,760
why you always order me around.

414
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,439
Will you be content if I say
it's because you're Qiu Min's sister?

415
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,479
Also,

416
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,719
you know both of them

417
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:26,760
are the ones who ruined your family.

418
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,319
And yet, you're drinking with them.
Do you not feel disgusted?

419
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,760
Of course, I do!

420
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,640
It's precisely because

421
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,880
they framed my father

422
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,479
that I volunteered to drink
and entertain them.

423
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,000
You wanted to fish out info

424
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,160
about your father from Lin Changzhi?

425
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,079
Exactly.

426
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,520
If you didn't barge in

427
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,479
and ruin my plan,

428
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:46,920
I would have the answer now.

429
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,760
Foolish.

430
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,239
He's a sly fox.

431
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,479
You think you can outwit him?

432
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,760
Be the honey trap all you want

433
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,680
but he'll devour you whole
while leaving nothing to you.

434
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,880
What can I do then?

435
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,520
Sit tight and watch

436
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,439
while they

437
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,599
dine and have fun here?

438
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,439
Wait for the reliable Lord Liang

439
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,880
and be the caged bird
in the Royal Academy forever?

440
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,359
Like I said,

441
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,000
I will take care of your father's case.

442
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,319
But acting on your own

443
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,599
is very dangerous, all right?

444
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,760
When did you say you would
take care of my father's case?

445
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,160
After you got drunk last night.

446
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,920
Last night?

447
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,079
I can't even recall what I said

448
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,000
or what I did.

449
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
Let alone what you told me.

450
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,520
Then do you remember that last night,

451
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,680
you said you hated me?

452
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,520
This is Hu Wan's testimony,

453
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,319
the merchant who framed your father.

454
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:57,897
(Hu Wan, 18th of May,
Year 27 of Chengzhao)

455
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,680
Lin Changzhi worries that Hu Wan will
be taken away by the Firewood Office

456
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,000
and therefore, confess to his involvement
in Qiu Yi's case.

457
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,119
Why do you look so calm, sir?

458
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,479
I need Hu Wan

459
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,359
to confess everything to Liang Yi.

460
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:11,199
If he can sign on his testimony,
it's even better.

461
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,439
I submitted

462
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,839
the Qiu case to His Majesty

463
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,239
and let His Majesty decide the sentence.

464
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,319
If Liang Yi uses Hu Wan's testimony

465
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,520
to appeal for the Qiu family,

466
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,439
he's not just proving me wrong.

467
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,239
What are you doing?

468
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,439
Stay put.

469
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,959
I show it to you to prove

470
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,119
that I investigated your father's case.

471
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,000
I burn it

472
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,839
because it's useless now.

473
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,959
His Majesty has concluded the case.

474
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,760
If we make an appeal,

475
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,160
we're telling His Majesty
that he misjudged,

476
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,640
that he was led
by unscrupulous ministers.

477
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,920
His Majesty might set his eyes
on refining pill now

478
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,000
but he ascended to the throne
when he was young.

479
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,839
He has seen many things.

480
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,880
His arrogance will not

481
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,359
allow him to admit

482
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,719
he misjudged.

483
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,719
Making an appeal

484
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,359
will only lead His Majesty to think

485
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,760
I'm being impartial.

486
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,359
Worse, I might be accused of
colluding with criminals.

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,359
You're saying
that submitting the evidence

488
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
can't repeal our sentence,

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,599
it might even incriminate you?

490
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,479
All of us will be implicated.

491
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,901
(Royal Academy)

492
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,160
If Liang Yi submits the evidence,

493
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,760
I will say

494
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,119
that he bribed Hu Wan.

495
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,119
I will have Hu Wan killed

496
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,400
and say Liang Yi did it
to erase the evidence.

497
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,520
Liang Yi can defend himself all he wants

498
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,959
but he can never clear his name
in front of His Majesty.

499
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,760
Very cunning of Yuan Lang.

500
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,920
He calculated everything perfectly.

501
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
But he must have

502
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,760
slipped up somewhere.

503
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,959
There is another way.

504
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,319
But we

505
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
need to plan thoroughly.

506
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,719
How am I to know if this

507
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,119
is just an excuse for you
to buy more time?

508
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,000
Maybe you just want me

509
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
to stay in the Royal Academy

510
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,719
and stop causing more trouble.

511
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,839
Why do you still view me like that?

512
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,119
Fine.

513
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,959
I'm buying my time then.

514
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:56,680
All in all,

515
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,959
do not let this happen again.

516
00:22:58,959 --> 00:22:59,599
And remember,

517
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,359
I will visit you again tomorrow.

518
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,239
Dumb as a rock. Dumb as a rock.

519
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,000
You're dumb as a rock.

520
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,839
I'm relegated to a matchmaker now.

521
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,599
Lord Liang.

522
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,239
You're leaving now?

523
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,199
Sir. Sir.

524
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,880
How generous of you.

525
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,079
No such misunderstanding
will occur again tomorrow.

526
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,800
I will come here again tomorrow.

527
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes, sir.

528
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,319
Lord Liang.

529
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,565
(Royal Academy)

530
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,880
Min'er.

531
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,520
I heard you caught a cold.

532
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,239
Should I ask Ms. Wang
to find you a physician?

533
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,359
I'm fine.

534
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,280
Would you like to

535
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,280
move into my greenhouse?

536
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
The room in my greenhouse is empty.

537
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,920
It is not connected to the main chamber.

538
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,800
Qiu Yan.

539
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,880
You might think the greenhouse
is bigger and cleaner than this place.

540
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,000
Grander too.

541
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,599
But for me, this place is cleaner.

542
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,079
I will not visit those dirty places.

543
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
You're sick.

544
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,280
If we stay together,

545
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,599
I can take care of you.

546
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,959
Truth be told, I don't feel reassured

547
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,640
letting Madam Liu take care of you.

548
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,239
Madam Liu treats me very well.

549
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,000
Don't worry, Qiu Yan.

550
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,160
Min'er, I just think that...

551
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:26,959
Qiu Yan.

552
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,719
So I must go to the forecourt today?

553
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,359
Is it still negotiable?

554
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,880
Of course it's still negotiable.

555
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,959
Then I said I wouldn't go.

556
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,239
You always decide everything for me.

557
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,439
If it's negotiable,

558
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,199
then I'll tell you here squarely.

559
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,560
I would rather be admonished
by Madam Liu

560
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,880
than to walk into those places

561
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,239
with my body.

562
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,760
I bought you rosy herbal sweets.

563
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,400
It's good for your health.

564
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,112
(Rosy herbal sweets)

565
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,319
I couldn't drink a lot
with you today, sir.

566
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,359
But I'll make up for you next time.

567
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,760
Sure.

568
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,000
Come again, sir.

569
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay.

570
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
I'll come again.

571
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,199
Lord Liang.

572
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,760
I learn a new song.

573
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
I was thinking

574
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,839
maybe I could perform it next time

575
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,040
when Madam Jin invited me over.

576
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,760
Since you're already here, Lord Liang,

577
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,719
perhaps you can listen to it
on behalf of Madam Jin?

578
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,479
I shall not turn this
courteous invitation down.

579
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,479
Lord Liang, look.

580
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,880
I received so many flowers
on my shift today.

581
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,199
Who said you could take their flowers?

582
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,520
Qiu Yan,

583
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,880
you're doing this on purpose,
aren't you?

584
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,599
That's not what I meant.

585
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,640
Go accompany Miss Shi, sir.

586
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,359
I got so many flowers anyway.

587
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,040
I don't need any tipping today.

588
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,040
Stop.

589
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,439
I know you booked me, sir.

590
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,280
But according to the rules here,
I have to perform during my shift.

591
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,640
It's fine if you won't come

592
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,719
but I can't take flowers
from other men now?

593
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,319
That's not fair.

594
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,119
Do you want me or the flowers?

595
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,560
They smell so good.

596
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,760
Don't smell them.

597
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,640
Compared to the flowers,

598
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,599
of course, I want you more.

599
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,439
Lord Liang.

600
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,040
You can put me down now.

601
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,839
For your next visit, Lord Liang,

602
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,959
bring some

603
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,520
gold accessories.

604
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,760
That way, others will be convinced
that you're very fond of me.

605
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,479
This is...?

606
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Back then in Taiying Temple, I told you

607
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,439
I would give you a thank-you present.

608
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,719
One thing led to another

609
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,520
and I never had the chance.

610
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,319
I know

611
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,920
you're just thanking me

612
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,560
for giving you advice
on the bride price.

613
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,520
(Try it on.)

614
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:06,839
It looks good.

615
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,359
Was what you said to me last time true?

616
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,599
Do you like it?

617
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,800
I heard it from someone else.

618
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,239
I love it.

619
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,800
As long as it's more expensive
than a rouge,

620
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,000
I adore it.

621
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,079
What a beautiful jade necklace.

622
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,239
- I want to have one too.
- Let's go.

623
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,319
You sure learn very quickly how to be

624
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,920
jealous like all the other girls here.

625
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,400
Oh, Lord Liang,
can you put this on for me?

626
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:40,880
Done.

627
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:42,760
Lord Liang,

628
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,359
do I look better than Miss Shi?

629
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,280
None can compare

630
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,439
to your divine beauty.

631
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,359
Be convincing, at least.

632
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,520
I can never be as elegant

633
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,160
as Miss Shi.

634
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,520
I know you want to praise me
but you're overdoing it.

635
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:03,000
I never lie.

636
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,880
Enough already. She left.

637
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,079
I can't just act with you all the time.

638
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,640
I need to go out and ask for some dishes

639
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,640
while flaunting this jade necklace
you gave me.

640
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:19,280
That way, everyone can see

641
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,880
how much you adore me.

642
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,000
See you.

643
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,560
Thanks to Yan,

644
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,400
we can leave the rear court

645
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,319
and leave the hard labor behind.

646
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
As someone who has been through this,

647
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,640
heed my advice.

648
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,719
Do not

649
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:49,319
cross Shi Xiaoxiao in every regard.

650
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,400
First Sister-in-law is right.

651
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,319
If Lord Liang doesn't visit you
anymore one day,

652
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,359
she

653
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,160
will make you suffer.

654
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,760
Right. We'll spend the rest of our lives
here anyway.

655
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,160
We have to live with her.

656
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,000
Let's make peace with each other.

657
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,880
I didn't want to cross her either.

658
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,199
I treat her with all my respect.

659
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,640
She just wants to compete with me.

660
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,199
Don't worry.

661
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,479
I won't let her make our life worse.

662
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,479
First Aunt,

663
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,959
is Min'er feeling better now?

664
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,719
Same old.

665
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:25,160
But Madam Liu is taking care of her
in the rear court.

666
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,400
Her condition hasn't worsened.

667
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,560
When I visit her,

668
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,439
she won't talk to me.

669
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,560
Please take good care of her,
First Aunt.

670
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,439
You know

671
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,959
how unreliable Madam Liu is.

672
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,280
Noted.

673
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,920
You just lie around all-day

674
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,160
and won't work.

675
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,640
Do you think

676
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,119
you're still a Young Lady?

677
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,239
Madam, I really am feeling unwell.

678
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,000
Unwell?

679
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,839
Am I doing any better then?

680
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,880
My back is all sore from work.

681
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,359
Unlike you who pretend

682
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
to be sick.

683
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:24,000
My daughter is toiling hard for money
on the forecourt

684
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,920
but all her money goes to you,
a bottomless sinkhole.

685
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,719
Not only can you not work,

686
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:29,079
you keep complaining too.

687
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:39,719
I...

688
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,880
I brought the charcoal two days ago

689
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:43,400
and it's all gone now.

690
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,520
Get up.

691
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,959
Get up.

692
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,959
Bring me some charcoal
from the firewood room.

693
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:59,079
Madam, I am sick.

694
00:32:59,319 --> 00:32:59,800
Can

695
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,959
I do it tomorrow?

696
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,959
So tomorrow, you won't feel
like a princess anymore?

697
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:07,280
Hurry up now.

698
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,359
Stop finding an excuse.

699
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,119
I'll go now.

700
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,119
Hurry up.

701
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,919
Qiu Min.

702
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:36,879
Mr. Wang.

703
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,280
What are you doing here?

704
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,560
Madam Liu wants some charcoal.

705
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
How cruel of her

706
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,399
to ruin your dainty fingers
with hard labor like this.

707
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,719
They feel so much rougher

708
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,879
from when you just arrived here.

709
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,000
A beauty like you
working on such a menial task,

710
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,040
it must be tough on you.

711
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,600
Where are you going?

712
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,360
Mr. Wang.

713
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,120
What are you doing?

714
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,959
What am I doing?

715
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:20,439
We're alone in this
sequestered firewood room.

716
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,199
What do you think I want to do?

717
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:24,399
You can't possibly think

718
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:26,000
that I'm here to hear you recite poems

719
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,439
or talk about life?

720
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:35,560
You...

721
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,399
You have such a thin waist.

722
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,080
Don't come near me.

723
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,879
If you do, I'll scream.

724
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,560
Scream then.

725
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,439
Everyone is on the forecourt.

726
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,719
It's only you and me in the rear court.

727
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,600
Scream all you can

728
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,239
and no one can save you.

729
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,199
Just be a good girl.

730
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,199
Where can you go?

731
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,239
Qiu Yan.

732
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,919
You evil woman.

733
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,959
What's the matter?

734
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,320
You brought two of your sisters

735
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,520
to the forecourt as maids.

736
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,919
I didn't know
they were part of your plan.

737
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,879
Qiu Mei, what's going on?

738
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,919
We cleaned Miss Shi's room this morning.

739
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,439
She said she had rashes on her body

740
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,840
and accused us of sprinkling her duvet

741
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,919
with lily pollen.

742
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,959
The lily pollen

743
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,040
is still on my duvet.

744
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm allergic to lily pollen.

745
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,280
Everyone here knows that.

746
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,959
And yet, lily pollen appears

747
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,280
on the bed you two cleaned.

748
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,719
Both of you
must have done it on purpose.

749
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,000
Did Qiu Yan ask you to do that?

750
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,560
Qiu Yan, the rules here state

751
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:09,000
that every courtesan can compete fairly,

752
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,800
but they should never ruin
someone else's appearance.

753
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,399
Since they are your sisters,

754
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,439
explain now.

755
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,239
Qiu Mei and Qiu Ying are my sisters.

756
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,600
But if Miss Shi here insists

757
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,000
that I asked them to give you rashes,

758
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,360
and uses the duvet as the evidence,

759
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,800
no matter how hard I defend myself,
it will all be in vain.

760
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,719
Isn't that right?

761
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,080
Enough. You brought them here.

762
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:29,080
So if something goes awry,
you will be liable too.

763
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,840
Calm down, Miss Shi.

764
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,600
How can we appease you?

765
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,360
Ground them for half a month.

766
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,479
Also,

767
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,600
send them away

768
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
to the northeastern corner, inside
the room where we ground people.

769
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,879
Don't let them come to the forecourt.

770
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,199
They upset me.

771
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,040
Miss Shi, the room over there
is so far away.

772
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,919
And no one cleans that place either.

773
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,080
What about this?

774
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,080
I'll ground them in their own room.

775
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Ms. Wang, she's trying to harm me.

776
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Between her and I, only one

777
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:02,919
can work in this forecourt.

778
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,080
Miss Shi.

779
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:10,320
You heard her.

780
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,439
Yes.

781
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,520
Let's go.

782
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,080
Mother,

783
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,879
if I come to find you in the afterlife,

784
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,520
please don't abandon me.

785
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:24,399
(Was I wrong then?)

786
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,199
(You have always been this weak.)

787
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,600
(You run away from everything.)

788
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,280
(When are you going to change that?)

789
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,080
(You can change yourself.)

790
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,360
(Don't be this meek.)

791
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:34,879
(Don't lie to yourself anymore.)

792
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,000
(Don't use your lack of strength)

793
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,760
(as an excuse
to be afraid of everything.)

794
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,800
(You need to wake up now.)

795
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,600
(You're not)

796
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,080
(a delicate Young Lady anymore.)

797
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,560
(No one will pamper you.)

798
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,439
I can't die.

799
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,520
I can't die.

800
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:04,399
I can't die.

801
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,199
I can't die.

802
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,320
I have to be stronger than my sister.

803
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,639
I have to be stronger than my sister.

804
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,679
I can't die.

805
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,879
From now on,

806
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:41,879
the Qiu women

807
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,520
will stay in this yard.

808
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,280
Know your place

809
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,000
and don't cause any ruckus. You hear me?

810
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,120
Yes.

811
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,919
Go inside now.

812
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,600
Go.

813
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,280
We were living a bit more comfortably

814
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,000
and now, we're back to square one.

815
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,360
Aren't you the smart one?

816
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,000
Yet you let Shi Xiaoxiao bully you so
yesterday.

817
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:13,520
If you can't outplay her,

818
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,919
why cross her?

819
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,000
Qiu Yan, Qiu Ying is upset.

820
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,600
Please don't mind her.

821
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,040
I know.

822
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,600
Let's not stand still.

823
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:26,840
We should tidy up the place

824
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,320
or else, we won't have a place to sleep.

825
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,280
Let's go.

826
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,800
Enough.

827
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,040
Can you even sleep on this?

828
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,239
Clean it then.

829
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,760
Mother, cobweb.

830
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,000
This place is so dilapidated.

831
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,199
What on earth...

832
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,560
The informant from the Royal Academy

833
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,840
said that Qiu Yan and Miss Shi Xiaoxiao
had a quarrel.

834
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,280
Qiu Yan was evicted from the forecourt.

835
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,919
Liang Yi didn't come
to Qiu Yan's rescue?

836
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,520
Liang Yi left the Capital yesterday
on a business trip.

837
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:03,360
He'll be back in around two weeks

838
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,080
at least.

839
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:07,760
Once Liang Yi left, Qiu Yan got bullied.

840
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,320
Interesting.

841
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,899
(Royal Academy)

842
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,800
Ms. Wang.

843
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,840
What Qiu Yan can do, I can too.

844
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,600
I can sing. I can recite poems.

845
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:23,120
Let me entertain the guests too.

846
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,320
I don't want to live
in that rickety place.

847
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:27,560
Quiet. Go back to your room now.

848
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,280
Otherwise, I'll punish you.

849
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:30,600
Ms. Wang.

850
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,879
Wang Shun!

851
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,080
Have a seat, sir.

852
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Yes, godmother?

853
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,479
Bring her back to her room.

854
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,120
You're causing trouble again,
aren't you?

855
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,600
Come with me.

856
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,239
Wait.

857
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,760
Sir.

858
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:48,879
Ms. Wang.

859
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:51,719
I wish to speak with Miss Qiu Ying.

860
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:56,239
We shall give you privacy.
