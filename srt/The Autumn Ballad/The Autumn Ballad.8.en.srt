18
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,360
Don't thrash about.

19
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,080
It hurts.

20
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,680
See?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,160
You wouldn't have to suffer

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,279
if you didn't commit thievery.

23
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,559
Serve you right.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
If I didn't feign unconscious,

25
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,480
I'm sure she would beat me to death.

26
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,559
Your sister

27
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,519
is too busy groveling 
to Second Madam now.

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,839
She won't care about us.

29
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,960
Why is she here?

30
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,880
Send her away.

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,399
Why are you here?

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
This is Jade Ointment, a precious item
from the vassal states.

33
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,880
One spoonful each time,

34
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,759
three times per day.
Apply it to the wound

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,399
and he will recover in a few days.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,279
Madam, please give this to Rong'er.

37
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't need her thing.

38
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,679
You heard him.

39
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,600
He doesn't want your thing.

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,720
Miss, I know you want
to gain the favor of the powerful now.

41
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,639
But your brother is a thief

42
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,160
and I'm his mother.

43
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,160
We're not who you're looking for.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,919
If you don't want it, Madam,
feel free to give it to someone else.

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,919
Madam, if you do care about Rong'er,

46
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,600
be more strict.

47
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,759
If he didn't steal something to impress
a woman,

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,399
he wouldn't be punished like this.

49
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,880
Who do you

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,199
think you are now?

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,279
How dare you lecture your mother!

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,800
It's still a precious thing nonetheless.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
I'm not an idiot.

54
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:44,440
(Waves of Snow)

55
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,399
Sorry.

56
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,000
How should you compensate me then?

57
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,839
Qin Xuan?

58
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,160
Why are you here?

59
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,720
I can't let you take the risk alone.

60
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,679
Since you decided to venture out
and investigate,

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
I have to protect you.

62
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,520
After all, we are both involved.

63
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,639
But you snuck out.

64
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,080
If your family finds out,

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
it will make the matter worse.

66
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,399
No bother.

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,559
I just have to apologize.

68
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,839
Don't worry.

69
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm their favorite.

70
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,320
My father let his emotion get
the best of him that day.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,959
Normally, they spoil me.

72

(As Loyal As A Subject, Waves of Snow)

73
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:21,480
Where's Qingdai?

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,279
This trip is dangerous.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,880
I don't want to drag anyone in.

76
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,200
If I didn't come here,

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,279
you would just venture out

78
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,279
all alone then?

79
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,839
Good thing you're here then.

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,600
What's your plan then?

81
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,679
Where do we begin?

82
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:42,480
Have you eaten?

83
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,640
The wonton dumplings here are
even better than my home chef's.

84
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,440
If others hear this,

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,600
they will think that that's all
the son of Duke Ying cares about.

86
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,200
We have eaten. Time is of the essence.

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,279
Let's begin now.

88
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,440
I

89

(Ding Rong Banknotes, 100 taels)

90
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,839
found this fake silver note
in the Qiu Residence.

91
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,239
The quality of this note is so similar
to the real one.

92
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:18,719
(Ding Rong Banknotes, 100 taels)

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,640
It's way better than normal fake notes.

94
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,239
Indeed.

95
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,000
I believe

96
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,440
we should locate the source
of this fake note.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
According to the law,

98
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,720
printing fake notes is akin
to committing fraud against the Emperor.

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
The whole clan will be beheaded.

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,959
Knowing its gravity,

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,880
the seller won't distribute this
to any strangers.

102
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,160
If we can find the seller,

103
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
we can find out

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,559
who in the Qiu family bought
the fake note.

105
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,239
Right.

106
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
In the Capital,

107
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,000
the west market is the most crowded.

108
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,440
That place has all sorts of people.

109
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,200
We should gather info there.

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,720
- No need...
- Mister.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,720
Two bowls of wonton dumplings, please.

112
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,239
Okay.

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,519
Let's pay the bill.

114
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:57,880
Mister.

115
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,359
Okay.

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
I brought you here for

117
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,519
one, to eat the wonton dumplings,

118
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,000
and two, to investigate.

119
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,720
Investigate?

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,079
I see.

121
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,200
This place disguises itself
as a wonton dumpling restaurant

122
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,720
but it is secretly

123
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,200
distributing fake silver notes.

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,799
No.

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,279
Tell me.

126
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,480
If you have a fake note,

127
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,799
will you use it in the west market?

128
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,920
Those small hawkers

129
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,720
handle coins and change a lot.

130
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,600
They rarely handle a silver note.

131
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,720
If I whip out this note
that's worth 100 taels,

132
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,399
none of them will take it.

133
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,440
Exactly.

134
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,559
If you want to use this fake note,

135
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,440
you have to use it

136
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,399
where transactions are made
with silver notes like this.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
If you have to use several notes,
the better.

138
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,200
Mixing real and fake notes together

139
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,359
is the best way to hide your track.

140
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,239
Didn't you say we should stay?

141
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,359
This is the most famous gambling house
in the Capital.

142
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:07,708
(Ruyi Gambling House)

143
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,480
It opens between 9 PM to 11 PM

144
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,200
and closes at 7 AM to 9 AM.

145
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,359
You know everything.

146
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,200
I feel so useless here.

147
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,839
A good warrior fight prepared.

148
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,239
I have asked a gambling addict
in my home before coming here.

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,359
Let's not dally and go in.

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,519
Who said we should go inside?

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,239
Then...

152
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,520
(Ruyi Gambling House)

153
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,197
(Prosperity)

154
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,279
Mister, the pay is here.

155
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,320
Okay.

156
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,720
Mister.

157
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,640
Can I ask something?

158
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,720
Go ahead.

159
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,399
Do you know if this gambling house

160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,239
has ever apprehended any clients
who used fake notes?

161
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,160
Oh, that

162
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,720
is very common.

163
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,000
It happens once or twice per month.

164
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,519
It's always those gamblers
who lose everything

165
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,200
but want to come back.

166
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,399
Mister,

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm sure many gamblers visit your stall

168
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,079
for wonton dumplings.

169
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,679
Yes.

170
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,239
Can we

171
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,920
talk to any one of them?

172
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,880
Any one of them?

173
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:13,145
(Joss paper store)

174
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,440
This is the biggest

175
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
fake notes distributor in the Capital.

176
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,079
They are backed by someone
who works in the Fengjing Prefecture.

177
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:19,858
(Joss paper store)

178
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,720
A joss paper store.

179
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,720
What a great cover.

180
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,519
Backed by the Fengjing Prefecture too?

181
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,000
No wonder they fear nothing.

182
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,160
I don't know why you two
want to come here

183
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
but please

184
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,679
don't do anything rash.

185
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,200
Especially don't let anyone know
I show you this place.

186
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,840
Thank you and don't worry.

187
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,280
Sorry.

188
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,679
My friend here told me

189
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,000
that I shouldn't pay you.

190
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,760
You...

191
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,760
If we pay you, you'll use the money
to gamble more.

192
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,119
We have talked to the owner
of the wonton dumpling stall.

193
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,159
For a year,

194
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,000
you can have two bowls
of wonton dumplings every day for free.

195
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,799
Stop gambling.

196
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,000
Get yourself together within a year.

197
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,559
I'm Yao Gai.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,119
I frequent this area a lot.

199
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,080
If you need my help,

200
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,359
just let me know.

201
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,080
He

202
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,799
doesn't look like a panhandler.

203
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,479
The panhandlers next to
the gambling house are mostly gamblers.

204
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,159
He was once a fine gentleman, I bet.

205
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,000
What should we do now?

206
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,960
We can't interrogate them straight away.

207
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,479
They will deny everything.

208
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,239
Just wing it.

209
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,719
Oh, customers!

210
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,039
To pay respect to your ancestors
or to hold a funeral?

211
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:48,919
Some joss papers

212
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,719
to pay respect to my ancestors.

213
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:50,840
Oh, joss papers.

214
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:51,919
We have

215
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,039
gold ones, silver ones, and yellow ones.

216
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,960
Which one do you fancy?

217
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:55,799
All of them.

218
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,039
How many do you want?

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,159
How many can
a 100-tael silver note give me?

220
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,479
Shopkeeper!

221
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,520
Shopkeeper!

222
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:07,919
Gentlemen.

223
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,479
How many ancestors do you have

224
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
that require such a large amount
of joss papers?

225
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
Don't worry about that.

226
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
Just prepare what we want.

227
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,440
Please excuse me.

228
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:22,840
Unfortunately, we do not

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,039
have a lot in stock now.

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,359
Perhaps you can visit another shop?

231
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,599
It's okay.

232
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,599
I'll buy whatever you have now.

233
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,080
But we have to save some

234
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,039
for our regulars.

235
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,719
We can't sell all of them.

236
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,719
My, my.

237
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,039
Why would a businessman

238
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,119
turn down a lucrative trade?

239
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,960
We're a small business.
Please understand.

240
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,840
You.

241
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,520
See both of them out.

242
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,679
This way, please.

243
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,719
What if I say

244
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,679
I don't want money for the dead,

245
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,719
but money for the living?

246
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,919
Then you should visit the bank.

247
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
We don't offer this service here.

248
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,799
Truth be told.

249
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,159
Both of us had a streak of bad luck
in the gambling house

250
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,039
and we're now laden with debt.

251
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,359
Should we not pay up in time,

252
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,840
we might lose our lives.

253
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,239
We came here because

254
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,719
we had no other option.

255
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,919
I know you have your

256
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,400
rules and difficulty.

257
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,320
But please, make an exception.

258
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,559
Our lives are in your hands.

259
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,239
Okay.

260
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,559
As the saying goes,

261
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,679
saving one life is like building
a seven-story Buddhist tower.

262
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,479
You can build a 14-story one here.

263
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,679
If you help us survive this hardship,

264
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,159
you will be hailed

265
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,119
as our savior.

266
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,200
All right.

267
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,640
If you put it that way,

268
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,280
it will be utterly heartless of me

269
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,239
to not offer my help.

270
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,440
Well,

271
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,440
please follow me inside.

272
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,440
Here.

273
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,840
What are you doing, mister?

274
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,039
Oh missy, you're good at lying

275
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,559
but

276
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,799
your voice and your look betrayed you.

277
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,239
Both of you said you were
penniless gamblers

278
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,719
but the jade trinket this gentleman
donned on his waist

279
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,919
is enough to buy a small gambling house.

280
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,440
What do you want?

281
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,599
Who are you?

282
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,719
Why are you here?

283
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:30,679
What?

284
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,039
You plan to fight back?

285
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,239
I'm not strong

286
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,320
but I am still capable enough

287
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,760
to send you to the afterlife.

288
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,239
We're here for business. Not a fight.

289
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,359
You want to know who I am, don't you?

290
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,799
(Duke Ying Residence)
Read what's engraved upon it.

291
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,479
Duke Ying Residence.

292
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,599
I...

293
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,359
Yes.

294
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm the Second Young Master
from the Duke Ying Residence, Qin Xuan.

295
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,159
It's just a misunderstanding.

296
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,320
Follow me.

297
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,159
Youzi Alley, Qiu Residence.

298
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,080
Has someone ever bought

299
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,239
3,000 taels worth
of fake notes from you?

300
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,159
Like I said,

301
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,159
none jogged my memory.

302
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,919
I'm telling the truth.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,119
So there's another intermediary?

304
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,559
This fake note

305
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,039
must be produced by you.

306
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,000
Can you check who you sold it to?

307
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,239
Sorry, we can't.

308
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,239
We didn't issue

309
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,840
this fake note.

310
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,760
What?

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,960
The fake note we issue

312
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,919
only goes to ten taels the highest.

313
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,479
3,000 taels worth of fake notes?

314
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:35,799
If we issue such a huge amount,

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,640
no government official can cover for us.

316
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,520
And look at the fake note.

317
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,320
From the precision of the engraving
to the quality of the paper,

318
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,159
it's way superior
to the ones we produce.

319
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,479
No, you're lying.

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,599
If you didn't print this,

321
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,320
how could you recognize it

322
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,000
the moment I showed it to you?

323
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,520
To make sure we aren't given
our own fake notes,

324
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,280
our engraving expert

325
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,840
will leave a special mark

326
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
on the note that only we can recognize.

327
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,359
Even though we didn't print
this fake note,

328
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,520
but the mark on it

329
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,880
is similar to the one I made.

330
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,760
So

331
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,200
it came from your engraving expert.

332
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
Our engraving expert

333
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
is called Xiao Tie.

334
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,719
He left half a year ago.

335
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,919
I thought he quit for good

336
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,080
but it seems like

337
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,760
he found a new employer.

338
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,400
I can tell you where he lives.

339
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,719
Come. Come.

340
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,039
You again?

341
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,679
I'm here on an investigation.

342
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,719
And you?

343
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,200
Me too.

344
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,919
You're here on a suicide trip then.

345
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,960
Ouch!

346
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,000
Sorry.

347
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,039
Song Jin?

348
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,320
Liang Yi?

349
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,479
Qin Xuan, are you all right?

350
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm fine.

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,960
You two...

352
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,960
Did you move that pile of stone?

353
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,960
I took one to defend myself.

354
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:07,320
Song Jin!

355
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,840
Stay right here.

356
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,799
Go. We need him as well.

357
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,919
What's wrong with you?

358
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,359
Run!

359
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,640
They are here to remove the homeless!

360
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,959
Fight them!

361
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,640
Fight them!

362
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,040
Fight them!

363
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,959
Fight them!

364
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,359
The government won't let us live.
We'll fight them!

365
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,239
Fight them!

366
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Fight them!

367
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,599
Fight!

368
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,439
Have some money!

369
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,199
Grab some money!

370
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,319
Grab some money!

371
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,959
Move aside.

372
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,800
Grab some money!

373
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,199
Grab some money!

374
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,319
Grab some money!

375
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,000
Come!

376
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,800
Let me go

377
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,040
or I strangle him to death.

378
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,319
You look

379
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,199
old enough to have a kid of your own.

380
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,160
I'm just saying if you have a kid,

381
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,760
I will find him after you're dead

382
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,839
and make him suffer a lot.

383
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,199
You're just bluffing.

384
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,920
I forgot to introduce myself.

385
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,839
I'm Liang Yi, from the Firewood Office.

386
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,839
Have you heard of it?

387
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,599
My biggest strength

388
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,920
is that I always

389
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,119
deliver

390
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,280
my promise.

391
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,439
Did you kill him?

392
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,199
I think he fainted due to the pain.

393
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,479
He should be awake soon.

394
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,640
What a waste of his crafty hands.

395
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:56,479
I had to do this
because of your useless intervention.

396
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,959
Mr. Qin, this is your first time seeing

397
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,719
Firewood Office in action, isn't it?

398
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,079
Liang Yi.

399
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,160
What if you botched that throw just now?

400
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,079
Do you know how important he is to us?

401
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,239
It's fine.
I'm quite confident in myself.

402
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,680
Just quite?

403
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,319
I'm not a god. I did my best.

404
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:16,640
By the way,

405
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,719
why were you

406
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,640
in the criminal's hideout?

407
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:27,920
So

408
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,520
both of you are investigating
the fake notes too?

409
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,640
It took you half a day

410
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,000
to locate Xiao Tie.

411
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,119
Yes.

412
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,800
If you won't believe us, Lord Liang,

413
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,439
feel free to bring us
to the Firewood Office.

414
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,599
I told your father about the fake notes

415
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,400
so that he could gather the money

416
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
to avoid any incrimination.

417
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,760
It's not to ask him

418
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,160
to set his own daughter
on an investigation.

419
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,079
If Your Lordship didn't snitch on me,

420
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,680
I wouldn't be involved.

421
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,079
I would have no reason
to meddle in this.

422
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,959
Snitch on you?

423
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,000
I had the chance to sneak out yesterday

424
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,599
but I bumped into Lord Liang.

425
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,599
He cordially sent me back.

426
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,359
Liang Yi, you know about Qiu Yan and me

427
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:08,959
yet you...

428
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,079
Are we even friends?

429
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,760
If we aren't friends,

430
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,160
I won't care about your business.

431
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,599
But it's precisely

432
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,040
because of you

433
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,719
that Qiu Yan was forced
to promise Old Madam Qiu

434
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,000
that she would identify the snitch
in their household within three days.

435
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,880
Otherwise, Qiu Yan will be married off
to someone else.

436
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,239
Oh, you found another chance.

437
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,560
Not sure if I should say you're stubborn

438
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,680
or tenacious.

439
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,119
Honestly,

440
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,760
it's really impressive.

441
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,119
Well, thanks to you too, Lord Liang,

442
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,439
for telling my father
about the fake notes.

443
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,359
That's how I found my chance.

444
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,760
Either way,
we have nothing to say to you.

445
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,599
Just let us talk to Xiao Tie.

446
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,479
He's our only breakthrough now.

447
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,439
What a coincidence.

448
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:48,319
He's mine too.

449
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,359
Unauthorized personnel

450
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,079
cannot interrogate a criminal
that belongs to the Firewood Office.

451
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,199
Liang Yi, that's not fair.

452
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,479
Let's forget about the past.

453
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,160
Lord Liang, if you're investigating
the fake notes,

454
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,079
I suggest we work together.

455
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,839
Just like what we did
with the He family last time,

456
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,760
Qin Xuan and I can get what we're after

457
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,319
and you, Lord Liang, can close the case
earlier too.

458
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,359
It will be another great feat
to impress His Majesty.

459
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
I know what string you're pulling.

460
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,000
You're using the Firewood Office

461
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,199
to accomplish your own goal.

462
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,479
But your deadline is in three days.

463
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,280
Mine isn't.

464
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,439
After I solve the case,

465
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,400
I'll inform your father
who the snitch is.

466
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
And then, I'll ask 
for your younger sister's hand.

467
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,719
I'm afraid we won't meet again,
Second Young Lady Qiu.

468
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,119
Liang Yi, I'm begging you.

469
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,079
I'll ask Song Jin to send you back.

470
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,319
You snuck out alone.

471
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,040
I'm sure your parents
must be very concerned.

472
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:42,880
You...

473
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,359
I taught you martial arts.

474
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,079
Don't waste your energy.

475
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,000
As for you, Miss Qiu Yan,

476
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,359
I don't care how you'll carry out

477
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,319
your own investigation.

478
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,599
Let's see what you can do

479
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:55,920
in these three days.

480
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,400
Let's go, Song Jin.

481
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,119
Yes.

482
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,079
What should we do?

483
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,599
Hurry up.

484
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,319
Follow him.

485
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:14,800
Assassins!

486
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,839
Careful, Qiu Yan!

487
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,479
Come.

488
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,760
You can't take him away
from me like this.

489
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,839
You want to protect him and so do I.

490
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,520
What should we do now?

491
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,479
Watch out, Qiu Yan.

492
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,199
Are you all right?

493
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:35,719
Yes.

494
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,719
Xiao Tie fled.

495
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,800
Come back, Xiao Tie.

496
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,959
Qiu Yan! Qiu Yan!

497
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,680
- Qiu Yan, you're mad.
- Where are you going?

498
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:53,920
Come back here.

499
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,119
- Come back here now.
- Qiu Yan!

500
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,000
Qiu Yan!

501
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,760
They ambushed us.

502
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,599
They didn't kill everyone.

503
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,199
It seems like their target was Xiao Tie.

504
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,680
What should we do now, sir?

505
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,880
Bring backup from the Firewood Office.

506
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,760
Noted.

507
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,280
Both of you have to give up now.

508
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,439
I will ask someone to escort you
back to your home later.

509
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,160
Do not investigate this further
for the next three days.

510
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,439
I will have my people watch

511
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,680
all gates of the Qiu Residence.

512
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,719
I refuse.

513
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,680
Qiu Yan.

514
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,719
Liang Yi is right this once.

515
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,439
They set up an ambush in the Capital

516
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,119
just to silence him.

517
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,280
The risk involved is simply too huge

518
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,439
for the both of us.

519
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,839
Qin Xuan,

520
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:11,920
my chances are not easy to come by.

521
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,560
If I don't seize it, it will be gone.

522
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,239
Lord Liang,

523
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,760
I saw

524
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,359
Xiao Tie's assassin.

525
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,680
For real?

526
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:27,760
What does he look like?

527
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:28,760
That depends on whether Your Lordship

528
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,160
wants to work with me or not.

529
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,119
What do you mean?

530
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,880
I can give you the lead, Lord Liang,

531
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,599
but in exchange,

532
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,479
you should help me identify
the snitch in my home.

533
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:36,239
You have three days.

534
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,800
I don't take on offers

535
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,680
that I might not be able to deliver.

536
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,640
During the investigation,

537
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,359
just allow me to stay by your side.

538
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,160
Tell me whatever new lead you have

539
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,920
and I'll share whatever new theory
I can come up with.

540
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,160
We can work together.

541
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,119
After three days,

542
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,439
if we can't see to the bottom of it,

543
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,760
I'll accept my fate

544
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,040
and will never
fault you for this, Lord Liang.

545
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,520
Song Jin. Put her in cuffs

546
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
and lock her inside
Firewood Office jail.

547
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,119
Are you being serious, sir?

548
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:00,040
Liang Yi, Qiu Yan is not a criminal.

549
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,119
You can't incarcerate her.

550
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,599
She came to the assassin's defense.

551
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,599
She might be colluding
with those assassins

552
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,000
and thus, should be brought back
to the Firewood Office

553
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,599
for further questioning.

554
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,400
Fine. I'll play your game.

555
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,079
Sure.

556
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,800
Put me in cuffs too.

557
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:20,277
(Firewood Office)

558
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:28,599
So this is the Firewood Office?

559
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,760
I have heard the rumors

560
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,680
but this is the first time
I have seen it myself.

561
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,560
I have two criminals here.

562
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,319
Unlock the Sky One cell.

563
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,079
Yes.

564
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,599
Go inside.

565
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,359
This is the Sky One cell?

566
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,000
It's a cage for animals!

567
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,719
You think you're staying in an inn now?

568
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,040
Go inside.

569
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,719
Hurry.

570
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,520
Inside!

571
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:09,079
Officer, you might not be aware of this

572
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,319
but we're good friends with Lord Liang.

573
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,599
Enough talking.

574
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:13,800
Keep your eyes peeled for them.

575
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:14,719
Yes.

576
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:15,599
Officer!

577
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,599
I can't even stand up here.

578
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:24,560
Let's sit down.

579
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,560
If Liang Yi tortures me,

580
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,319
don't stop him.

581
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,000
If he decides to all out,

582
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,319
he won't show mercy to you either.

583
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,199
All right. I'll do as you say.

584
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,160
I won't stop him.

585
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,599
You truly think

586
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,359
Liang Yi will torture us?

587
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,839
He is capable of anything.

588
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,839
I grew up with him.

589
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,359
Besides Song Jing,

590
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,079
I'm the second person closest to him.

591
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,719
Before he led the Firewood Office,

592
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,160
he wasn't like this at all.

593
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,160
Back then,
he was all about serving justice.

594
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,040
No one could be more

595
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,479
righteous and compassionate than him.

596
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:16,839
Indeed.

597
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,760
In six years,

598
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,439
everything has changed.

599
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,000
How do you know

600
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,800
he came to assume his position
six years ago?

601
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,040
Oh, I guessed it.

602
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,359
Don't worry.

603
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,839
Liang Yi will not torture innocents.

604
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,599
He just wanted to give you
a small fright

605
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,599
so that you'll listen to him.

606
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,319
You're saying he's softer

607
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,719
than he looks?

608
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,560
No.

609
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,199
I did beg him once.

610
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,359
He wasn't moved at all.

611
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,599
Because he has some sort of prejudice
against you.

612
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,079
He was

613
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,800
the most tender person I know.

614
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,839
You don't know this

615
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,239
but since he was little, he was afraid

616
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:59,560
of girls crying in front of him.

617
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,880
Do you still remember me?

618
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,400
You're that stupid officer.

619
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:30,719
Have mercy, Your Lordship.

620
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,280
It was just a small mistake.

621
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,640
I'm not here
to settle the score with you.

622
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,760
I need you to find someone.

623
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,319
Who?

624
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,880
The old man who started the ruckus.

625
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,800
Fight them!

626
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,439
Fight them!

627
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:48,880
This is the place.

628
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,599
Where is he?

629
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,000
No idea.

630
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,280
He was here just now.

631
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,719
It seems like we're late again.

632
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,079
That scoundrel.

633
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,280
He didn't leave one thing at all.

634
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,160
He sure is meticulous.

635
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,280
I have his possession.

636
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,599
Come with me.

637
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,479
You are good at hiding something.

638
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,239
This one here.

639
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
Why do you
have that old man's possession?

640
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,199
He looked at it every day.

641
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,400
I thought it was something precious

642
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:31,239
so I stole it when he wasn't
paying attention.

643
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,000
What do you want

644
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:34,800
as your reward?

645
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,560
No need. It's a present.

646
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:40,760
Sir.

647
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,959
It's just a wooden token.

648
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,959
What clue can it hold?

649
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,479
Before you open your mouth,

650
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,640
can you use your...

651
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,400
Brain first?

652
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,479
Yes.

653
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,640
Sir.

654
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,000
Miss Qiu Min requests an audience.

655
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,479
Greetings, Lord Liang.

656
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,760
Why are you here?

657
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,560
I need a favor, Lord Liang.

658
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:13,880
Speak.

659
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,400
Please help us find Qiu Yan.

660
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,160
Qiu Yan?

661
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,040
She's not at home?

662
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,880
Your Lordship,

663
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,640
we have a snitch in the household.

664
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,640
Qiu Yan wanted to find out the truth

665
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,599
so she left home early.

666
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,239
She didn't even bring Qingdai with her.

667
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,920
I know Qiu Yan
wants to keep a low profile

668
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,920
for her investigation

669
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,280
but my father is worried sick now.

670
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,319
No one knows where she is now.

671
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,280
How can this happen?

672
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,199
Well...

673
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,959
The Capital is a huge city

674
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,280
but I'm sure nothing dangerous

675
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,439
will come to her in broad daylight.

676
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,959
Serve Miss Qiu Min some tea.

677
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,359
Noted.

678
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,800
Sir Jin.

679
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,920
Mr. Qin.

680
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,400
Miss Qiu Yan.

681
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,079
Wake up.

682
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,359
Open the door.

683
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I don't have the key.

684
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:29,079
Grab it then.

685
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:29,839
Yes.

686
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,599
Is it time to interrogate me now?

687
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,079
There's no interrogation.

688
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,719
My Master just wanted to scare you two.

689
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,760
Scared us?

690
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:42,040
Does he have to keep us
in a cage like this?

691
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:45,920
Well, it's a misunderstanding.

692
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,199
What misunderstanding?

693
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,560
Please don't put the blame

694
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,079
on my Master.

695
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,560
To be honest,

696
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,959
he didn't do this to scare you two,

697
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,560
but to protect you two too.

698
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,239
Protect us?

699
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,359
Lord Liang, I didn't come here

700
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,439
just to ask you to help me find Qiu Yan,

701
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,839
but also to ask you to help her

702
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,199
find out the snitch within three days.

703
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,119
So this favor is for her, not you then.

704
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,479
Also, I'm sure you know

705
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,719
that your sister and I
are not on good terms.

706
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,719
I know this is too big a favor
to ask from you

707
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:20,359
but I only have one sister.

708
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,599
I just want her to be okay.

709
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,520
You're gentle and kind

710
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,839
while your sister is cunning and rude.

711
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,959
Unfathomable.

712
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,520
What happened 
between Young Master Qin and her

713
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,079
is my fault, actually.

714
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,719
In fact,

715
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,040
she took this risk for me too.

716
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,920
I just want to help her.

717
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,599
I understand your feeling

718
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:47,880
but this is a criminal case.

719
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,520
It's not a child's play.

720
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,040
Also, three days is not enough.

721
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,520
Lord Liang, you're a talented person.

722
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,640
I'm sure you can save

723
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,599
my sister.

724
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,959
If you will help my sister,

725
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,319
I will never ever forget this favor

726
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,239
and repay you one day.

727
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,959
You're sacrificing yourself
for your sister.

728
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,040
A favor is a favor.

729
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,319
Another thing is another story.

730
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,000
So,

731
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,319
it's a yes then?

732
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,280
Tell Officer Qiu

733
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:17,520
that I will find Qiu Yan

734
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,040
but I need her for my investigation.

735
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Therefore, she won't be back home

736
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,560
in the next few days.

737
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,439
I'll find her a place to stay.

738
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,199
This...

739
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,079
This might be inappropriate.

740
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,560
If you want my aid,
you agree to my terms.

741
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,119
Xiao Tie's killer

742
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,400
is scrupulous and cruel.

743
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,040
If you have seen his face, Miss Qiu Yan,

744
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,959
he won't let you live either.

745
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,640
If you return home now,

746
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,959
you might put your family in danger.

747
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,839
So, the safest place right now

748
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:53,920
for you

749
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,079
is the Firewood Office,

750
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,719
especially this sturdy Sky One cell.

751
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,640
Liang Yi told you to tell me this?

752
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:01,760
No.

753
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,800
But if you want to know

754
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,319
who knows Lord Liang the best,

755
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,640
I'm second

756
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,880
to none.

757
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:08,239
Who's there?

758
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
Guess

759
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,439
what I'm thinking now.

760
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,280
Sir. It hurts.

761
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,399
It really hurts.

762
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,360
Shouldn't I be serving tea now?

763
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,239
My, how forgetful I am!

764
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,560
Open the door.

765
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes.

766
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,679
You. Come out.

767
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,280
Where to?

768
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:50,560
In this place,

769
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,239
I ask, you answer.

770
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,399
You don't have the right
to ask questions.

771
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,080
Come out.

772
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,800
Qin Xuan. Bear with me.

773
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:04,800
Stay here right now.

774
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,719
Lock the door.

775
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:07,600
Qin Xuan.

776
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,679
What do you mean by this, Liang Yi?

777
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,760
Liang Yi?

778
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,760
This is not the interrogation room.

779
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,959
You wish to be interrogated?

780
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,840
So

781
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,679
you're truly trying to protect me.

782
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:29,879
I'm trying to protect

783
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,600
my only lead.

784
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:32,959
In my eyes,

785
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,919
you're no different than a scroll here.

786
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,000
How professional of you.

787
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,320
I

788
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,719
owe you an apology.

789
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:49,679
I reflected upon myself in the cage.

790
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,600
If I were you, Lord Liang,

791
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,040
and I saw my good friend

792
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,320
being seduced by an evil wench,

793
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,840
I would intervene too.

794
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
You're right to do
what you did, Lord Liang.

795
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,639
The fault lies in me

796
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,560
who was born with no charisma.

797
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:05,760
That's why you're not fond of me.

798
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:10,639
Carry on.

799
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,760
The more I

800
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,040
think about it, the more your words
make sense to me.

801
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,080
I am

802
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,159
frivolous and disobedient.

803
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,120
I'm always up for no good.

804
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,399
Mr. Qin deserves better

805
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,159
so I decide

806
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
to stop pestering him now.

807
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,800
From now on,

808
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,520
I'll cut ties

809
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,719
with Mr. Qin.

810
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,280
For real?

811
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
My words

812
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,479
are sincere.

813
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,280
Why didn't you say this

814
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
in front of Qin Xuan then?

815
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,760
I already feel ashamed in front of you.

816
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,959
Even more so in front of Mr. Qin.

817
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,320
So I don't dare to tell Mr. Qin
in front of him.

818
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,000
Please convey

819
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,000
my message to him when you send him

820
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,919
back to his home.

821
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,520
I am

822
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,520
undeserving of the Qin Family

823
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,959
but I don't want to be
someone else's concubine either.

824
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,800
Lord Liang, now that I see

825
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,679
how wrong I am,

826
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,520
can you get me out of this predicament?

827
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,679
I will remember

828
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,439
your kindness forever

829
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,439
and ever.

830
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,280
Forever and ever,

831
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,280
just like what your younger sister said.

832
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,760
Pardon?

833
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,840
Qiu Min came here just now.

834
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,120
Why did Qiu Min come here?

835
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:04,360
What did you do to her?

836
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,000
You sound much more normal like this.

837
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,360
You haven't let go

838
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,479
of your prejudice against me.

839
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,560
Heed my words, Liang Yi.

840
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,760
Do not use me

841
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,000
to blackmail Qiu Min.

842
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,479
I would rather be sold to the brothel

843
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,919
than to be used as a tool of extortion
against Min'er.

844
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,320
Likewise.

845
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,879
Instead of claiming victimhood,

846
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,120
I much prefer
seeing you all flustered like this.

847
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:22,760
But I quite enjoyed hearing

848
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,840
what you said just now.

849
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,080
Where is Min'er?

850
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,399
I want to see her now.

851
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,199
She went back already.

852
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,239
Besides, I need to point out one thing.

853
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,399
I didn't make her come here.

854
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,800
She came here

855
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,959
asking me to help

856
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,520
her hopeless sister.

857
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,719
She said that?

858
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,760
You know I want to marry her

859
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,479
so I will agree
to whatever she asks of me.

860
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,600
Plus, she also said

861
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:46,800
she would never ever forget this favor

862
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:47,879
and would repay me one day.

863
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,600
You opportunistic scum.

864
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,479
Be a man.

865
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:51,840
Bad-mouth me in the cage.

866
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,879
Once you have made up your mind,

867
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,199
we can discuss the case.

868
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,080
Time is running.

869
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,239
The first day is about to end.

870
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,719
How may I help, Your Lordship?

871
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,520
Smart.

872
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,800
Can you tell me

873
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,879
how the assassin looks like

874
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,919
right now?

875
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,199
He

876
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,919
is moderately tall,

877
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,360
moderately-sized,

878
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,800
and has a moderate face.

879
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,159
I'm warning you.

880
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,000
Don't use any trick on me.

881
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,639
You and I

882
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,520
are on the same boat now.

883
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,000
I won't deceive you.

884
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:44,159
But this world is vast.

885
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,199
Few are the evil ones

886
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,320
who bear an evil face.

887
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,439
But, if I see him again,

888
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,719
I will be able to recognize him.

889
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,080
You're saying

890
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,600
that I have to keep you by my side then?

891
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,439
Actually,

892
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,800
I have another lead.

893
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,520
According to
Xiao Tie's previous employer,

894
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:09,000
the paper that the fake note uses

895
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,239
is very similar to a real silver note.

896
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,760
This special paper

897
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,840
is under the supervision
of the Ministry of Revenue.

898
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,639
I have already run a background check

899
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,439
on all the officials
and the government-owned

900
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,320
paper workshops in secret.

901
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,639
I found no abnormality.

902
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,080
Since we're working together,

903
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,239
shouldn't you tell me

904
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,719
every info the Firewood Office

905
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,919
has gathered so far?

906
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,280
Xiao Tie is dead.

907
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,800
If I have another lead,

908
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:34,239
why would I use you?

909
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,959
But didn't you revisit

910
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,159
Xiao Tie's abode?

911
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,360
Surely you have found something.

912
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:46,239
How do you know?

913
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,679
That's what I would do

914
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,679
if I were you.

915
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,600
Xiao Tie's abode has been burned down.

916
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:02,719
This is accidentally left by the person
who spied on Xiao Tie.

917
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,679
What do you think of it?

918
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,719
It's a cheap wooden token.

919
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,879
Great craftsmanship.

920
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,679
The edges are smooth,

921
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,919
which means the owner held it
in his hands often.

922
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,840
That's all?

923
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,639
The flower on this token
is a Chinese peony.

924
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,919
Chinese peony is an ornamental plant

925
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,040
but also a medicinal herb.

926
00:41:36,399 --> 00:41:37,159
I get it now.

927
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:40,080
This token is used
to identify medicinal herbs.

928
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,239
It's most probably from an apothecary.

929
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,840
I guess that's the best you can do.

930
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,479
What can you deduct from it then?

931
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:50,040
If it's to identify herbs,

932
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,719
Chinese peony and tree peony

933
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,479
look alike.

934
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:54,199
Why not use words instead?

935
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,520
If it's a medicinal token,

936
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,959
why would he toy it
in his hands regularly?

937
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:14,360
If he toyed with it often,

938
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,000
it's either a precious treasure

939
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:24,479
or a nostalgic keepsake.

940
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,719
Oh, I get it now.

941
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,679
The flower represents someone.

942
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:32,719
What do you mean?

943
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,919
If I'm not mistaken,

944
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,199
this token

945
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,639
was given to him by a woman.

946
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,479
And this woman has something to do

947
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,239
with Chinese peony.

948
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,520
Perhaps she likes the plant

949
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,439
or perhaps her name has something

950
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,479
to do with the plant.

951
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,239
But...

952
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,959
But if it's given by a female,

953
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,639
it should be something she uses a lot.

954
00:42:56,879 --> 00:42:58,080
And you can't figure out

955
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,719
why a girl needs a token like this.

956
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:01,879
Did I get it right?

957
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,600
Yes.

958
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:04,239
I don't blame you.

959
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,719
Women like her live in places

960
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,919
you never set foot in.

961
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,000
It's

962
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,159
from a brothel.

963
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
The Fengjing Prefecture replied, sir.

964
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:20,239
Speak.

965
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:21,719
All the scrolls are here.

966
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,719
Help yourself to them.

967
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,479
Since both of us
come to the same conclusion,

968
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:26,679
why don't we dispatch people

969
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:28,159
to search all brothels

970
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:29,560
in the Capital?

971
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:32,120
Search all brothels in the Capital?

972
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:33,840
Do you know how many brothels

973
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,600
we have here?

974
00:43:35,919 --> 00:43:37,239
And how many more

975
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,239
are not registered?

976
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,159
Patient, Miss Qiu Yan.

977
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,399
These scrolls document

978
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:45,239
the opening date of all brothels.

979
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:46,919
We already know when Xiao Tie

980
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,120
is due to go to the next one.

981
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,120
And now,

982
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:49,919
we just need

983
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,840
to pay close attention
to recently opened brothels.

984
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:57,360
So you figured out everything.

985
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:59,520
You said all that

986
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,679
to test me?

987
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,239
If you're here to investigate
the case with me,

988
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,000
I have to make sure you're not an idiot.

989
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,360
We're lucky.

990
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,120
There's only one brothel.

991
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:14,004
(Wanyan House, Yang Alley,
Yulin cul-de-sac. Constructed on January)

992
00:44:14,005 --> 00:44:14,960
(Year 27 of Chengzhao.
