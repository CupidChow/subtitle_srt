18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,800
Isn't the Firewood Office something?

19
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,680
As I said, I refuse to meet

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,879
any important officials,

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,239
including the Emperor himself.

22
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:50,839
Mister, look.

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,239
They're here.

24
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,160
Just turn around and greet them

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,839
and we will send you back straight away.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,800
Isn't your favorite book
Lu's Crime Investigation?

27
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,839
You always say
you want to meet the author.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,839
Behold, Mr. Lu.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,360
Mr. Lu?

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,000
Lu... Greetings, Mr. Lu.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,080
I have read all your books

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,679
and I have long admired you.

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,960
I never knew I would be able

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,440
to meet you in person.

35
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,479
How lucky am I?

36
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,080
I know you want to see me

37
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,440
but you shouldn't leverage
the Firewood Office to bring me here.

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,919
Pardon my insolence,

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,240
Mr. Lu.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
If you're here against your will,

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
we...

42
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,559
We will send you back home now.

43
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,919
Send him back.

44
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,839
We'll send you back now.

45
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:45,199
Miss, you claimed
to have read all my titles.

46
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,119
Tell me then.

47
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,559
Which one is your favorite?

48
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:52,399
The Case of Zhao featured
in your short story collection

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,360
released two years ago.

50
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,919
Many have read my books

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,039
but the one you spoke of

52
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,320
is rarely mentioned.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They said the story

54
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,919
wasn't easy or interesting enough.

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,000
The Case of Zhao might not be

56
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,639
as intriguing as your other works,

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,000
but its poignant commentary
and critique regarding the modern society

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,679
are shrewd,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,880
astute, and bold.

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,279
Most people read the mystery genre

61
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,080
as a hobby or to kill time.

62
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,639
But in my opinion,

63
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,720
your work

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,119
is more akin to a moral analogy.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,559
Miss, it seems like someone

66
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,399
has finally understood the effort
I put into my writing.

67
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,360
This is my latest story.

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,279
Have a look

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,759
and give me some input.

70
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,440
Me?

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,160
Sure.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,360
(The Blue Bridge)

73
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,440
Official Yuan,
if you still wish to interrogate me,

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,759
just bring me
to the Main Administrative Office.

75
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,440
Today,

76
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,600
Liang Yi went out shopping

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
with that Su Yiwan.

78
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Liang Yi bought her rouges

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,880
and jewelry.

80
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,559
He showered her with anything she wanted.

81
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,239
Even I am envious

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,880
of their romance.

83
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,480
Lord Liang is a young man

84
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,679
full of vitality.

85
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,640
He only has one concubine at the moment.

86
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,440
Naturally, he dotes on her.

87
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
I wonder how Liang Yi explained

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,079
his relation to Qiu Yan to you.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,799
The Qiu Family has been pardoned

90
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,799
but Qiu Yan still stays at his place

91
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,279
to be his concubine.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,279
When Qiu Yan was in the Royal Academy,

93
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,000
you even helped them

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,079
to put on a spectacle of jealousy.

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,640
Were you

96
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,519
not worried
that their act might become real?

97
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,320
Official Yuan.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What are you insinuating?

99
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,399
I just think
you deserve better, Miss Xiaoxiao.

100
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,880
If you don't want any of it,

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,119
fine,

102
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,200
I shall not continue.

103
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,799
I just want to let you know

104
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,440
that I can make your wish come true.

105
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,920
You're just a courtesan
in the Royal Academy.

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,559
You can never marry the Marquis.

107
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,200
But what if Liang Yi loses his title

108
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,359
and becomes a commoner?

109
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,519
Even if he is a commoner,

110
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:51,200
his heart does not belong to me.

111
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,880
Without a title,

112
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,359
his marriage can be easily arranged.

113
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
As long as Liang Yi quits politics,

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,519
I will let him live.

115
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:06,040
The Main Administrative Office will then
say you played a pivotal role

116
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:08,359
in capturing an important criminal.

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,160
I will bring you to His Majesty
so that you will be rewarded.

118
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,920
You just have to say
that you love Liang Yi

119
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,079
and let His Majesty
arrange this marriage.

120
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
By the time,

121
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,000
he can only marry you.

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,359
When both of you are together,

123
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,799
knowing what you're capable of,

124
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,239
you can easily steal his heart.

125
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,760
Official Yuan,
you absolutely detest Lord Liang.

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
If Lord Liang's power wanes,

127
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,760
you will never spare his life.

128
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,920
In my eyes, he shouldn't live.

129
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,160
But his demise is not what I want.

130
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,799
I want to defeat him.

131
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,079
I want him to lose so hard
that he can never rise again.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,239
I suppose you know why

133
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,519
I'm here, Miss Xiaoxiao.

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,559
I'm waiting for your answer.

135
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Sir, Miss Qiu Yan bought so many things.

136
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,160
I think she wants
to stay in the residence.

137
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,640
She can if she wants to. I can feed her.

138
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:29,920
Enough.

139
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,119
Go pack them up.

140
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,880
Don't bother me.

141
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,480
This latest storytelling script
will be yours now, miss.

142
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,160
Really?

143
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,760
Thanks, Mr. Lu.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,600
Your critical feedback regarding my work

145
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,399
is actually more constructive

146
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,399
than the ones from professionals.

147
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,920
Have you thought about
writing a story yourself?

148
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,559
I haven't entertained that thought.

149
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,880
Can I?

150
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,600
You'll never know if you never try.

151
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,640
Your logic is airtight.

152
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,000
You have a more nuanced view
compared to men.

153
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,679
You even investigated
some cases on your own.

154
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,600
You have the potential.

155
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,519
But I lack the wits.

156
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,760
I don't know where to start.

157
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,480
Then seek your own story

158
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,359
in this realm.

159
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
Liang Yi, you brought Mr. Lu to me.

160
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:40,760
Do you know?

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,559
Mr. Lu gave this book to me.

162
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,200
You can't buy it with money.
Only I have it.

163
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,000
Also, did you hear it?

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,080
Mr. Lu said I could be an author.

165
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,239
He said my logic was airtight

166
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:52,559
and had hands-on experience
in solving cases.

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,960
But I have never done
something like this.

168
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
Do you think I can do it?

169
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,320
Can I?

170
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,840
You are always confident.

171
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,880
Why did your confidence disappear

172
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,039
when it comes to this?

173
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,239
You know,

174
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,000
writing isn't as hard as you imagined.

175
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,760
Remember how you continued
my story once?

176
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,799
But you said I did a terrible job.

177
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,080
Let me do it.

178
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,840
Thanks.

179
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Song Jin.

180
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,719
Bring them to Madam Jin's room

181
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,239
for me tomorrow.

182
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,520
Why?

183
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,200
I splurged today
because I was preparing a gift.

184
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,200
Everything I bought here

185
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,159
is what Madam Jin likes.

186
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,880
Lord Liang.

187
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,320
Eunuch Liu wishes to speak with you.

188
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,640
How may I help, Eunuch Liu?

189
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:24,960
Official Yuan submitted
a memorandum this morning.

190
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,880
I copied it with my hand.

191
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,520
Have a look.

192
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,599
Eunuch Liu.

193
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,400
Official Yuan has been my rival
for many years.

194
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,479
He can make all sorts of things up.

195
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,119
Your rivalry is your rivalry.

196
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I don't care about

197
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,520
its veracity or if you are truly

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,760
involved.

199
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,359
May I remind you

200
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,960
that His Majesty has never been
this jovial for a long time,

201
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,320
not until he received
the Dengxian Pearl.

202
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,960
His Majesty is getting old.

203
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,760
He cannot go through something
as dramatic as this again.

204
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,080
If His Majesty believes
what Official Yuan says here

205
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,640
and gets so angry
that his health is affected...

206
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,840
I will hate to see this unfold.

207
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,640
I can delay
this memorandum for three days.

208
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,039
Please

209
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,760
deal with this problem
within three days.

210
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,280
I know Wang Shun.

211
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,640
He's prone to lying.

212
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,440
He said he took advantage of Min'er.

213
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,280
It must be a slip of the tongue.

214
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:50,520
Even the servants in the Royal Academy
won't believe this.

215
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:55,119
Yet, Yuan Lang does, somehow.

216
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,400
Yuan Lang got a lucky strike.

217
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,640
It is a desperate move

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
but that move

219
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,359
hit our vital.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,520
Yuan Lang places
all his bets on Wang Shun.

221
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Something's off.

222
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,000
At the moment,

223
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,400
our priority is to find a way

224
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,520
to maintain this deception.

225
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,880
If His Majesty knows

226
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,599
that Min'er has lost her maidenhood,

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,119
her fake identity
as the Empyrean Fairy will be found out.

228
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,719
Any further investigation

229
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,440
will let all of us the death penalty.

230
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,159
That's the worst-case scenario.

231
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,400
Three days is enough

232
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
to send all of you

233
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,320
far, far away.

234
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,479
That's your solution?

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,559
Of course,

236
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,599
the Qiu men will be included too.

237
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
They are on their way here.

238
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,599
I will send someone to inform them
by horse.

239
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,840
As for the future,

240
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,280
you're on your own.

241
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,200
What about you?

242
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,320
What will you do?

243
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,400
Are you worried about me?

244
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
You're the Qiu Family's benefactor.

245
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,400
It's natural that I am concerned
about your safety.

246
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,239
I didn't plan thoroughly

247
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,039
and now, someone has found my weakness.

248
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:38,960
I have to pay the price.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,559
Liang Yi.

250
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,640
I really hate

251
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,200
this stubbornness of yours.

252
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,919
Why are you shouldering
everything alone?

253
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,880
Do I need that?

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
I don't care if others
will leave or not.

255
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,159
I'm definitely staying.

256
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:54,520
But what can you do here?

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,239
We can think together.

258
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,039
We have escaped from

259
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,320
so many predicaments before.

260
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,200
Let's go to Min'er first.

261
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
She's involved.

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,799
No matter what,

263
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,159
she'll play a part in the solution.

264
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,280
If the three of us brainstorm together,

265
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,039
we can find the perfect solution.

266
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,200
All right.

267
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,280
Min'er will attract attention
if she comes here directly

268
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,159
but we can meet her outside.

269
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,000
We are not on good terms

270
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,080
but in this kind of tricky situation,

271
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,159
she still knows
to cast aside personal grudges.

272
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,599
Min'er.

273
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,679
Let's sit down first.

274
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,880
I didn't know the Empyrean Fairy
has to be...

275
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,400
I wanted to help

276
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,280
but I just made it worse.

277
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,000
Enough. There's no point lamenting.

278
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,719
I caused the problem

279
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,479
so I should solve it.

280
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,479
You have a way?

281
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,039
Not me.

282
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,159
Qin Xuan does.

283
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:36,280
Qiu Yan.

284
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,599
Why is he here?

285
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,039
He is not involved in this at all.

286
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,880
Just let me help you this time.

287
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,400
Please.

288
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:45,760
Qiu Yan.

289
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
I don't think involving Qin Xuan
is a mistake.

290
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:50,320
Don't forget

291
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,679
that I

292
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,799
lost my virginity to him.

293
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,919
He is just as involved as we are.

294
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,640
Qiu Yan, I know
you don't want me to be involved.

295
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,080
But this time,

296
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,599
no matter what,

297
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,799
I will not let you cast me aside.

298
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,919
Qin Xuan, you don't understand.

299
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,640
You might lose your life for this.

300
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,559
Do you think
I'm not willing to die for you?

301
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,200
Qiu Yan, I care about Qin Xuan too.

302
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,719
As much as you do, might I add.

303
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,119
The way I see it,

304
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:17,919
if you have feelings for each other,

305
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,640
you face adversity together

306
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,679
as a team.

307
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,880
Liang Yi, I can't get through them.

308
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,760
Ask Song Jin to send Qin Xuan away.

309
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,479
Patience.

310
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,479
I would like to hear about his solution.

311
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,919
Your plan is utterly preposterous.

312
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,159
If there's a slip-up,

313
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,159
it makes everything worse.

314
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,359
Whether it works or not
will depend on your performance too.

315
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:49,760
Liang Yi.

316
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,200
You said

317
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,919
you would give me a choice.

318
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,559
You know I will never sit still

319
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,799
and watch Qiu Yan die.

320
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,679
But if I proceed with your plan,

321
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,599
Qiu Yan and I can never
be together anymore.

322
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,280
That's what you want, isn't it?

323
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,800
You should know very well

324
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,760
that the moment you spent a night
with Qiu Min,

325
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,680
Qiu Yan will never be with you anymore.

326
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,079
You and Qin Xuan will come together.

327
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,920
You'll say that it's you
who told Qin Xuan.

328
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,920
Don't let Qiu Yan see through our lies.

329
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,760
Lord Liang can make my wish come true.

330
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,000
I will, of course, do my best
to work with you.

331
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,319
Don't get me wrong.

332
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,199
I'm not doing this for you.

333
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,280
I know.

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,680
You spent so much effort planning this

335
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
for my sister.

336
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,160
Aren't we the same?

337
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,359
No,

338
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,680
we are not.

339
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,640
You sure are very
certain of it, Lord Liang.

340
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,920
That's my plan.

341
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,880
What do you think?

342
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,079
It might work.

343
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,599
I agree.

344
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,839
It sounds reckless at first

345
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,280
but when I think about it,

346
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,000
it's worth a try.

347
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Qiu Yan.

348
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,280
At this point,

349
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
think about Min'er,

350
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,880
your father,

351
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,239
everyone in the Qiu Family,

352
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:20,160
and Liang Yi.

353
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,760
In your eyes,

354
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,439
is my life

355
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,280
more valuable

356
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,319
than all their lives?

357
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,199
Unless,

358
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm still an outsider

359
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,560
for you.

360
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,239
You're right.

361
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,680
Many lives are at stake.

362
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,719
I need to consider them.

363
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,040
Qiu Yan.

364
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,319
Ever since

365
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,319
I retrieved it from
the Fengjing Prefecture,

366
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,199
I carry this hairpin with me

367
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,280
as memorabilia.

368
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,800
And now,

369
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,160
allow me to return it to you.

370
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,800
I am now Su Yiwan.

371
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,319
If someone sees me

372
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,079
carrying Qiu Yan's belonging...

373
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,040
My bad.

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,040
Don't let anyone find out then.

375
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,319
Qiu Yan. I'll keep it for you.

376
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,319
Let's go.

377
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,719
Qin Xuan.

378
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,160
The Firewood Office made this box.

379
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,400
It's indestructible.

380
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,079
You need a code to open it.

381
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,079
Keep your hairpin in here

382
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,959
and remember the code you set.

383
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,880
No one else will be able
to open this box.

384
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,680
My mother's birthday

385
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,479
is the code.

386
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,199
Why did you tell me?

387
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
If I ever forget about it,

388
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,880
you can give me a reminder.

389
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,199
All right.

390
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,800
I'll remember the code for you.

391
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,520
Qin Xuan's plan

392
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
is actually your plan,

393
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:34,719
isn't it?

394
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,079
If it was my plan,

395
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,560
I could have just told you directly.

396
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,880
Because you know

397
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,760
if you tell me directly,

398
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:46,800
whether I agree to it or not,

399
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,479
it will be a tough decision.

400
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,800
If it comes out of Qin Xuan's mouth,

401
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,040
I will feel better.

402
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,160
When Qin Xuan broke down
the plan for us,

403
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,959
you nodded intermittently

404
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:08,239
as if you had just heard it
for the first time.

405
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,439
Say you truly
didn't know about this plan.

406
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,719
If you know Qin Xuan came up

407
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:14,239
with something better, you will sulk.

408
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,199
Not nod.

409
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,719
I know you're just being considerate.

410
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,479
I can never ever repay

411
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,880
what I owe to Qin Xuan.

412
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:28,760
I should shoulder

413
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,079
this guilt.

414
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,119
Only I can shoulder it.

415
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,839
It's getting late.

416
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,040
I have to get ready.

417
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,239
Why did I nod?

418
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:03,560
Yi'er.

419
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,560
Why are you looking for me this late?

420
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,479
Mother, I need to talk to you.

421
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,160
About what?

422
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:13,520
You should be staying by Wan'er's side.

423
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,880
If you want me to be happy,

424
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
you should bring me a grandchild soon.

425
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,479
Mother, it's something serious.

426
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,680
What's so serious?

427
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,119
Can you ask the Noble Consort

428
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,760
to help the Qiu Family and me?

429
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,400
The Qiu Family?

430
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,719
What for?

431
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,680
I would like to marry Miss Qiu Min.

432
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,119
I am here

433
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,719
(Plain Feathers)
to chat with your mother.

434
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,680
I have not agreed

435
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,040
to your request.

436
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,719
Your Highness, I grew up with you.

437
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,280
It is my true feelings

438
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:56,880
and I pray that you would help me.

439
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,280
If you want me to help you,

440
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,520
then you need to answer some questions.

441
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:06,359
You can lie to your mother

442
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
but you have to

443
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,959
be completely honest with me.

444
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,439
Of course, Your Highness.

445
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,959
You raided the Qiu Family yourself

446
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:17,560
because that was your duty.

447
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,599
But I heard

448
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,160
that when the Qiu women were in
the Royal Academy,

449
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,359
you hung out a lot with Qiu Yan,
Qiu Min's sister.

450
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:31,160
Everyone knows about that.

451
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,880
When Qiu Yan passed away,

452
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,719
you wedded a female performer

453
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,319
that bears a striking resemblance

454
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,760
to Qiu Yan.

455
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,160
If you want me to help you,

456
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,280
you owe me

457
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,239
an explanation.

458
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:53,119
You're very right, Your Highness.
I am at fault here.

459
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,800
Initially, I wanted to marry Qiu Min

460
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,719
but I was then drawn to Qiu Yan.

461
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,520
They are sisters.

462
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,839
One is quiet and elegant

463
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,400
while another is bold and decisive.

464
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,119
They stole my heart.

465
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,040
Therefore...

466
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:11,439
Why haven't you told me that?

467
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,199
After Qiu Yan passed away,

468
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,719
I took Su Yiwan in as my concubine.

469
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,479
Earlier on,

470
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,479
I heard that Qiu Min was still alive.

471
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:25,000
I want to give Miss Qiu Min a home.

472
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,880
Please grant me my wish, Your Highness.

473
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,280
You... philanderer!

474
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:33,640
Your Highness,

475
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,599
don't grant him his wish.

476
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:35,880
Your Highness,

477
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,280
Miss Qiu Min has been through an ordeal.

478
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,439
I feel like I owe it to her
and wish to make up to her.

479
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,040
Please grant me my wish.

480
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,680
Oh well.

481
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:56,599
Miss Qiu Min is the reincarnation
of the Empyrean Fairy.

482
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:01,199
Her marriage shouldn't be handled
the ordinary way.

483
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:02,920
Also,

484
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,959
if both of you reconcile,

485
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,479
it could be a beautiful tale.

486
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,800
Thanks, Your Highness.

487
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,959
Your Highness.

488
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,319
You indulge him too much.

489
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,079
If I don't indulge him,

490
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:21,640
who should I indulge then?

491
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,760
Get up now.

492
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,680
Also,

493
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,439
bring your concubine here.

494
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,599
I wish to see her.

495
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,719
I want to see

496
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,239
if

497
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,719
a doppelganger
truly exists in this world.

498
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,280
She is sick

499
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,959
and bedridden now.

500
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,560
Sick?

501
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,479
I am not aware of it.

502
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,359
Madam Su. Madam Su.

503
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,920
Madam Su, stop breaking things.

504
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,719
Madam Su, Old Madam gave you them.

505
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:05,760
If you break them...

506
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,560
I want to break them.

507
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,760
Why are you standing here?

508
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,079
Clean up now!

509
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:10,800
Yes, sir.

510
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Get changed.

511
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,359
Noble Consort Guo wishes to see you.

512
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,040
No, thanks.

513
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,079
I am sick now.

514
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,239
I will not see anyone.

515
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,239
Su Yiwan,

516
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,719
don't go overboard.

517
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,959
Who's stepping out of line again?

518
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,719
You said you would love me forever

519
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,119
but you got bored of me
after a few days.

520
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,280
And now, you're marrying someone else.

521
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,439
If you have a legal wife,

522
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,640
my suffering will never end.

523
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,599
We'll see about that.

524
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,880
The Noble Consort asks for you now!

525
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,359
You're using her to threaten me.

526
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,359
She takes your side anyway.

527
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,880
Why should I see her and grovel to her?

528
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,079
My, my.

529
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,479
Wan'er.

530
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,920
Where is your manner today?

531
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,920
Your Highness,
she is very respectful usually.

532
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,239
I suppose

533
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,839
after she learned that Yi'er wished
to marry the Qiu's lady,

534
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,000
she...

535
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,560
People say

536
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,359
Liang Yi spoils his concubine.

537
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,319
And now, you get a belligerent wife.

538
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,920
Please pardon my incompetence,

539
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,160
Your Highness.

540
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,880
Excuse yourself
in front of Her Highness now.

541
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,680
Su Yiwan, the lowly concubine,

542
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,239
bids you a good day, Your Highness.

543
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,839
Lift your head up.

544
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:43,640
The face is identical

545
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,000
but unfortunately,

546
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,160
she lacks her demeanor.

547
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,040
Her boldness does not hold a candle

548
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,160
to Qiu Yan's.

549
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,359
What did you

550
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,119
call yourself again?

551
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,800
Su Yiwan.

552
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,439
Not that.

553
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,839
I mean your title.

554
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:11,520
Lowly concubine.

555
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,719
You said you're a lowly concubine

556
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:16,599
but

557
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,599
you do not know your place.

558
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,760
If your lord wants a legal wife

559
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,439
you don't have a say in it.

560
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:26,119
Apologies, Your Highness.

561
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,680
Listen to me carefully.

562
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,479
When Qiu Min comes here,

563
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,359
she will be your master.

564
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,400
If you ever disrespect her,

565
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,359
even Liang Yi
won't be able to protect you.

566
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,680
Noted, Your Highness.

567
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,760
Thank you.

568
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,560
As the mother-in-law,

569
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,920
you overindulged Su Yiwan too.

570
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,599
Today,

571
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,920
I will make her know her place.

572
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

573
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,439
Summon Qiu Min

574
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,560
from the Qiu Residence.

575
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,400
Noted,

576
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,079
Your Highness.

577
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,199
Get up now.

578
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,239
Thanks, Your Highness.

579
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,599
Your Highness, you arranged this

580
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,760
and  were once due to be in-laws,

581
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:29,439
the Qiu Family will do as you wish.

582
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,599
Qiu Min,

583
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,760
you're now the Empyrean Fairy.

584
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,959
Even though your family elders
have agreed to this arrangement,

585
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,119
you reserve the right

586
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,280
to decide for yourself too.

587
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,959
Your Highness,

588
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,479
I was upset about Lord Liang's

589
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,000
rescission

590
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,880
but your words of wisdom

591
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,920
have enlightened me.

592
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,119
Lord Liang was just performing his duty.

593
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,000
I should be more understanding.

594
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,119
In that case,

595
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,040
you agreed to it?

596
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,839
Yes.

597
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:13,959
However, I am obliged to perform
my mourning duty.

598
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,640
Lord Liang might need

599
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,239
to wait three years for the marriage.

600
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,640
What a tradition-abiding child.

601
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,760
Perhaps...

602
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,000
Perhaps I can

603
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,280
talk to His Majesty

604
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,079
and adopt you as my foster daughter.

605
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,000
I will be your foster mother

606
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,680
and I will marry you off like this.

607
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:46,040
On behalf of the Qiu Family,
I thank your generosity, Your Highness.

608
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,079
Thank you for your magnanimity,
Your Highness.

609
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,400
Liang Yi.

610
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,920
Take good care of her.

611
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,000
Yes, Your Highness.

612
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,386
(Liang Residence)

613
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:04,040
Your Highness,
you truly overindulge Yi'er.

614
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,040
He's an obedient child too.

615
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:07,439
All right.

616
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,560
All of you can turn back now.

617
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,680
No need to see me off.

618
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,439
Your Highness!

619
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,679
(Autumn River)

620
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,040
I would like to talk to you.

621
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,920
Didn't I tell you to reflect
upon yourself in your room?

622
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,319
My lord, Old Madam, Your Highness.

623
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,280
Forgive me.

624
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,839
I know Miss Qiu Min is here

625
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,920
and I can't help but venture out.

626
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,160
I trailed the Qiu's wagon

627
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,439
and prayed

628
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,920
that I could take a peek of her.

629
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,040
What were you planning to do?

630
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,079
I just want to behold her beauty

631
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,959
and see what she has that I don't.

632
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,560
But

633
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,040
I accidentally

634
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,760
ran into a disgraceful sight.

635
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:52,359
Stand up and speak.

636
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:53,839
Noted.

637
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:56,880
Su Yiwan.

638
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,040
You cannot accuse someone falsely
in front of Her Highness.

639
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,319
I'm telling the truth.

640
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,680
I saw it with my own eyes.

641
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,359
Qiu Min and her maid

642
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,599
disembarked from the wagon
halfway through

643
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,800
and entered an inn.

644
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,160
And then,

645
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,959
her maid guided another gentleman

646
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,920
to her room.

647
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,040
Her maid did not enter the room.

648
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,520
Instead, she stood guard by the door.

649
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,760
I think

650
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,359
both of them are hiding a secret.

651
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,839
So I rushed here to tell Old Madam,

652
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,040
Your Lordship, and Your Highness.

653
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,680
Wan'er, are you sure?

654
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,239
My eyes did not fool me.

655
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,400
She and her lover must be still
in the inn.

656
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,280
Bring me there.

657
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,239
My lord.

658
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,400
It's unwise of you to go there.

659
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,280
Why?

660
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,599
You carry arms with you usually.

661
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,680
If you hurt someone

662
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,560
out of rage...

663
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,959
Perhaps

664
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,839
Old Madam, you can come with me?

665
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,119
Me?

666
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,680
I don't think that's right.

667
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,880
I will go.

668
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:56,880
Your Highness.

669
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,800
Think twice, Your Highness.

670
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,800
This is inappropriate.

671
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:01,880
Your Highness.

672
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:04,000
I started this

673
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,239
so I shall deal with it.

674
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:07,880
Besides,

675
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,919
Qiu Min is my foster daughter now.

676
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I need to know

677
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,360
her true character.

678
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:15,399
Your...

679
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,159
All of you, go out now!

680
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,600
Your Highness.

681
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:19,959
Out. Now!

682
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:20,840
This is the inn.

683
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,360
You see nothing.

684
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,959
You ask nothing. Understood?

685
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,719
All of you upstairs, go out now.

686
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:30,879
Bring her to me.

687
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:42,040
Your Highness, this woman
was standing by the staircase.

688
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,360
She was acting suspiciously

689
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,879
so I brought her to you.

690
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,639
I am with Third Young Lady
of Qiu Family.

691
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,959
She asked me to bring

692
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,800
Mr. Qin from the Duke Ying Residence here

693
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,439
and then told me to stay here.

694
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,320
That's all I know.

695
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,560
Wait here.

696
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,679
Min'er. Does it hurt?

697
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,280
Not anymore.

698
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
Qin Xuan, please don't forget

699
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,360
about me.

700
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,040
Didn't I tell you to wait downstairs?

701
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,879
You are worried that I might

702
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,000
be impartial to them?

703
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,239
Don't worry.

704
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,360
I shall handle this with fairness.

705
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,239
Insolence!

706
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:19,800
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

707
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:32,399
Qiu Min.

708
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,120
How dare you lie to me.

709
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,719
Your Highness, we...

710
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
It's just a mistake.

711
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,280
You're Qin Xuan?

712
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,239
Duke Ying's son sure fears nothing.

713
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,879
Don't blame Qin Xuan.

714
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:53,600
It was I who seduced him.

715
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,159
Why did you agree
to the marriage arrangement then?

716
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,239
You're just making me look like a fool.

717
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,760
I dare not to, Your Highness.

718
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,959
It's just

719
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,320
that I never love Lord Liang.

720
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,560
Back then,
I couldn't defy my father's wish.

721
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,600
And now, Your Highness
arranged this marriage for me.

722
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,280
Without my parents deciding for me,

723
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,080
I dare not to turn you down.

724
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,120
I already agreed to the arrangement.

725
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,320
I was planning to take my own life

726
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,159
so that Lord Liang and Your Highness

727
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,639
would not hold
the Qiu Family accountable.

728
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,879
Explain your relation to Qin Xuan.

729
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,159
I have always been
in love with Qin Xuan.

730
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,159
After I left the Liang Residence,

731
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:35,280
since I would be dead anyway,

732
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,080
I wanted to let Qin Xuan know

733
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,719
how much I loved him.

734
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,280
I asked Qingdai to bring Qin Xuan here
to meet with him.

735
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,879
What a fine rendezvous.

736
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:47,639
Qiu Min,

737
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,719
you ought to know

738
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,280
as the Empyrean Fairy,

739
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:54,399
you should be the role model
to all young maidens in the world.

740
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,159
Qin Xuan!

741
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,000
Qin Xuan!

742
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,719
It's you!

743
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,560
My lord.

744
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,520
- Move aside.
- Qin Xuan!

745
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
I treated you as my brother

746
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,399
and yet, you did this to me.
You're a scoundrel.

747
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,800
Scoundrel!

748
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,320
You're no brother to me!

749
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Careful, my lord!

750
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:12,879
Say that again.

751
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,000
Say that again!

752
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,120
I'll kick you to death.

753
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,479
Qin Xuan!

754
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,239
Fine, kill me if you can then.

755
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,320
Are you all right, Qin Xuan?

756
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,520
Don't hit him, Lord Liang.

757
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
Hit me first.

758
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,239
You had Qiu Yan

759
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,280
and now, you want Min'er too.
You know no shame.

760
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,399
Says the shameless one.

761
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,760
I can kill you
without martial arts today.

762
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,399
Bring it on.

763
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:37,879
Move aside.

764
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:38,520
Come!

765
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,239
Play along.

766
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,000
You hit Qin Xuan,

767
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,199
I'll hit your concubine.

768
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:47,040
Liang Yi!

769
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,879
Just because you look like my sister

770
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:52,800
doesn't mean I'm afraid of you.

771
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,560
I have always hated my sister.

772
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:55,879
You dare to hit me?

773
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,879
I'll tear your face!

774
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,639
Your sister might be dead

775
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,280
but I'll teach you a lesson
on behalf of her.

776
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
You think...

777
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,239
If the Qiu Family wasn't in danger,

778
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,520
she would never go to you.

779
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,639
You're just a rascal
who took advantage of someone.

780
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,239
Where were you when Qiu Yan
was in danger then?

781
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,399
You imbecile.

782
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,719
- Qin Xuan.
- My lord.

783
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,679
- Are you all right?
- Does it hurt?

784
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,639
So you're serious, Liang Yi?

785
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,560
Stop fighting. Let go!

786
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,600
- Don't hit Qin Xuan.
- Stop fighting.

787
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,040
Why are you here?

788
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,040
You don't have a say in this.

789
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,760
How dare you touch my hair!

790
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,360
Who do you think you are?

791
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,520
Remorseful now?

792
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,360
Or are all of you tired from the brawl?

793
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,000
Should I have someone

794
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,280
bring you some food?

795
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,800
Forgive me, Your Highness.

796
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,000
Forgive me, Your Highness.

797
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,399
At this point,

798
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,120
Liang Yi,

799
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,159
your marriage arrangement with Qiu Min
will be rejected.

800
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,560
Qiu Min, I will not adopt you

801
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,239
as my foster daughter.

802
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,399
I suppose you know it is not I
who failed to deliver the promise.

803
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,320
Yes, Your Highness.

804
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,879
Liang Yi,

805
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,080
bring you and your concubine back home.

806
00:40:27,879 --> 00:40:28,639
And you,

807
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,320
see Qiu Min back to the Qiu Residence.

808
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,399
That is all for today's

809
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,679
fiasco.

810
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,639
None of you is allowed to mention it

811
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,280
nor to bring this to the court.

812
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,399
As you wish, Your Highness.

813
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,520
Qin Xuan.

814
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:57,760
Are you all right?

815
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,439
Gentle.

816
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,360
Be gentle.

817
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,120
Honestly,

818
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,719
why can't you stay loyal to Wan'er?

819
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,879
Why do you have
to ask for Qiu Min's hand?

820
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,879
Rekindling old feelings?
What did you get?

821
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,040
A bunch of bruises.

822
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,719
Mother.

823
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,760
Retire to your room.

824
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,239
If you're here,

825
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,159
we can't rest.

826
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,520
You want to rest?

827
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,879
Sure. Sure.

828
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:40,000
Take your time to rest up.

829
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,000
Let's rest up.

830
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:58,760
Gentle.

831
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,000
It went better than expected.

832
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,679
Only you

833
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,239
would plot a scheme

834
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,560
against the Noble Consort.

835
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,719
I had to do it.

836
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,439
His Majesty is distrustful.

837
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,520
If you want to lie to him,

838
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,439
you need to make sure that his confidant

839
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,719
is on our side.

840
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:31,000
So making Qin Xuan gravely injured

841
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,320
is also a necessary evil?

842
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,159
Didn't you see

843
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,399
how hard he hit me first?

844
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,399
What about you?

845
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,000
Tearing Qiu Min's hair was fine?

846
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:44,120
I was just playing along.

847
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,919
I heard everything you said

848
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:48,639
to Qiu Min.

849
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,080
Are you telling me that those
weren't your personal feelings?

850
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,760
What about you?

851
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,639
What you said to Qin Xuan

852
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,360
must have been

853
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,159
buried deep inside your chest
for a long time.

854
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,280
And I have many more in there too.

855
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,639
Tell me then. I'm all ears.

856
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:00,679
I don't want to.

857
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,679
-Tell me.
-I'll tell you.

858
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,800
I will tell you.

859
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,399
I will.

860
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:10,399
I'm worried that they can't
handle Yuan Lang tomorrow.

861
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,000
