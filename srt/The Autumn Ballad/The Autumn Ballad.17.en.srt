=Episode 17=

18
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:43,029
(Royal Academy)

19
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,040
Medicine?

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,599
The money Mr. Qin gave me

21
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,319
was only enough to take care
of the second chamber.

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,559
As for the other things,

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
they are beyond my control.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,519
Ms. Wang.

25
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,000
This is the ebony hairpin
Mr. Qin gave me.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,559
It's more valuable
than a common jewelry hairpin.

27
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,559
Most people won't know its value.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,160
But I'm sure

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,760
you know how much it's worth.

30
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you sure about this?

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,080
Solutions come from the people.

32
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,720
The person my sister cares
about the most here

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,199
is the Old Madam.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,160
Why would I want a valuable hairpin
that I cannot sell?

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,199
It's a gift from Mr. Qin.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,559
It's a keepsake.

37
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,360
So, keep it.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,720
Very well.

39
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,440
The Royal Academy has the medicine.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,639
As for the money,

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,960
I'll ask Mr. Qin.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,839
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
Thank you so much, Ms. Wang.

44
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:19,520
Old Madam.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,360
Old Madam.

46
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,919
You're still willing to visit me.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,919
This is a ginseng pill.

48
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,000
Take it with water,
it extends your life.

49
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,880
Min will be in less pain
as long as you live.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,960
It's futile.

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,720
I know very well

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,119
how much time I have left.

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,520
However,

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,360
you managed

55
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,800
to get your hands on
ginseng pills in this place.

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,759
I applaud you for that.

57
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,679
For the past few days,

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,320
I've been thinking.

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,839
Of all the women in the Qiu family,

60
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,600
you're the most capable.

61
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,399
Whether it's the case
with Young Master He

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,959
or the fake notes,

63
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,000
you solved them flawlessly.

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
I assure you

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,519
I won't let you die.

66
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,239
You will be tortured for a long time.

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you still think

68
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,959
I was the one
who had your mother killed?

69
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,079
Isn't that the truth?

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,519
It doesn't matter whether

71
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,279
who did it or who the mastermind is.

72
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,839
I consider it your doing.

73
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,160
Wait.

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,440
About your mother's secret,

75
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,119
I had made up my mind

76
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,320
to take it with me to my grave.

77
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,640
But now,

78
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,279
you're the only one
who can keep this family together.

79
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,160
I don't want you to
hate this family forever

80
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,079
and leave it to fall apart.

81
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,640
What secret could my mother have?

82
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,040
This secret of the second chamber

83
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,799
has been kept for over a decade.

84
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,880
If I tell the world of this secret,

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
the whole Qiu family

86
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,920
will be executed,

87
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,640
and that won't be the worst.

88
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
(Your mother's surname)

89
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,399
(was originally Wei.)

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,920
(Back then,)

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,200
(her father stopped His Majesty
from building the Taoist temple.)

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,559
(Order was given)

93
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,640
(to banish her whole family.)

94
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,279
(Only the way of their exile,)

95
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,760
(they ran into bandits.)

96
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,880
(Your mother and her younger brother)

97
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,000
(were fortunate enough
to survive the attack.)

98
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,000
(The Wei family was a family friend.)

99
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,320
(Your mother and her brother)
Are you alright?

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,239
Run!

101
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,720
(did all they could)

102
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:24,683
(Qiu Residence)

103
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,920
(to reach our family.)

104
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,880
Is anyone home?

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,440
Open the door!

106
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,239
Is anyone home?

107
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,559
(Lord Qiu made the decision)

108
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,160
(to secretly take the siblings in.)

109
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:43,079
(He even gave them new identities.)

110
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,160
Your mother was married
to the second son.

111
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,320
We couldn't keep her brother with us,

112
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,799
so we sent him

113
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,239
to the Taiying Temple.

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,600
Master Zhenyan was her brother?

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,160
Yes.

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,799
They were siblings...

117
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,959
That's why they had the pendants.

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,320
This jade pendant

119
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,799
will remind me of you.

120
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,720
After so many years,

121
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,320
I've never forgotten
my life at the house of Wei.

122
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,920
How can we ever forget that, Sister?

123
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,440
Why was my father so furious

124
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,959
when he saw the pendant?

125
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Did he learn about
Master Zhenyan's true identity?

126
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,440
It was soon after Min's
marriage was arranged.

127
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,239
Sister, bad news.

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,839
My senior knows about my identity.

129
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,279
(Master Zhenyan talked to his senior)

130
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,679
(and asked him to keep the secret.)

131
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,079
(But during the argument,)

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,679
they both fell off the cliff and died.

133
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,600
Their death caught the attention
of the Fengjing Prefecture.

134
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,000
Your father went to
the Fengjing Prefecture for answers.

135
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,640
He learned that

136
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,479
the case

137
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,599
had been taken over by Official Yuan.

138
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,359
Your father knew
there was more to this case.

139
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,080
So, to protect your mother
and the Qiu family,

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,039
he came up with the idea
that has some compromises.

141
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,200
He faked your mother's death

142
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,039
and transported her out of the Capital

143
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:12,359
to avoid Official Yuan's investigation.

144
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:18,039
But how did she die of poisoning here?

145
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,239
She said

146
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,280
the only way

147
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,239
for the plan to work flawlessly

148
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,159
was for her to die.

149
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,840
Of course I know the reason behind it.

150
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,400
But

151
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,880
I had taken care of your mother
for over a decade.

152
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,080
How could I ever bring this up to you?

153
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,640
When she proposed the idea,

154
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,559
I gave her

155
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,840
the red safflower I obtained

156
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,359
from Mi.

157
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:03,599
By boiling it with enough flowers,

158
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,479
the poison was enough
to take anyone's life.

159
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,479
My lord.

160
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,400
Ruogu, I know you miss your brother,

161
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,520
but I'm afraid

162
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,520
you can't keep this item.

163
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,880
I should take it.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,640
Come.

165
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:01,960
Since

166
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:03,640
I'll be leaving soon,

167
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,840
I want to have a word with you.

168
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,760
Ruogu,

169
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,520
speak away.

170
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,960
Because of me,

171
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,320
you sacrificed your future.

172
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,000
I know.

173
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
You were in love
with a girl named Miss Xia.

174
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,760
You loved each other

175
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,280
and were childhood friends.

176
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,039
I...

177
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,000
Fate had other plans for the two of us.

178
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Over the years,

179
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,960
we treat each other
with respect and love,

180
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,520
but there is still regret in your heart.

181
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,119
That's why you married Liu

182
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,640
who resembled Miss Xia in Yuezhou

183
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,200
without telling your family.

184
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,440
Ruogu,

185
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,640
it was my fault.

186
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,880
No.

187
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,719
It was my fault.

188
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,239
As long as I see you as my benefactor,

189
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,280
I can never righteously

190
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,840
make you my husband.

191
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,239
Ruogu...

192
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,840
You've been complaining

193
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,640
that I've spoiled Yan'er.

194
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Six years ago

195
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,359
when she came to this family,

196
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:14,760
it reminded me of
when I first came here.

197
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,080
Greetings, Mother.

198
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,239
I want to study.

199
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,280
Father, I will study

200
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,440
what men study.

201
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,679
I don't want her to
follow in my footsteps

202
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:35,159
and live in fear her entire life.

203
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,359
Ruogu.

204
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,799
Have some tea.

205
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,080
Here.

206
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:44,359
Ruogu.

207
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,599
What did you drink?

208
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:50,559
Red safflower soup.

209
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,799
It's red safflower soup.

210
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,479
You have no proof!

211
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,080
Why should I believe you?

212
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,599
You're a smart girl.

213
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,320
Try to recall

214
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,200
your parents' past

215
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,320
and you can draw your own conclusion.

216
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,919
I don't deserve your pity,

217
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,960
but

218
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,080
I don't want the Qiu family

219
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,679
to fall apart.

220
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,039
This heirloom has been
passed down for generations.

221
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm giving it to you

222
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,400
and I leave this family

223
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,719
in your care.

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't mind if you hate me,

225
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:20,640
but

226
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:24,960
you must never hate your father

227
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,039
or this family.

228
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,080
Whether or not your father

229
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
could clear his name

230
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,039
in the future,

231
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,320
you must lead the women
of the Qiu family

232
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,520
and live on.

233
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,640
Grandma.

234
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,359
Old Madam, quick.

235
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,320
Take the medicine.

236
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:00,280
Old Madam.

237
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,080
Hurry.

238
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,840
Live on.

239
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,079
Old Madam...

240
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,119
Old Madam...

241
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,079
Ms. Wang!

242
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,839
Please, I beg of you,

243
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,520
let me pay my last respect.

244
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,199
Please.

245
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,640
I beg of you.

246
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,199
Could you give us some time

247
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,880
so we can pay our last respect to her?

248
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,400
I can't just change the rules

249
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,959
of the Royal Academy.

250
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,199
- Ms. Wang!
- Ms. Wang!

251
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,319
Mr. Wang, could you give us some time?

252
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,560
Your heard what Ms. Wang said.

253
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,319
We cannot change the rules.

254
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,479
I beg of you!

255
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:34,920
- Mr. Wang!
- Just go.

256
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,959
Please!

257
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,479
Old Madam!

258
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,479
Old Madam!

259
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,920
Bring in the discharged.

260
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,000
Kneel.

261
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,239
Qiu Yi,

262
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,959
you read your brother's statements.

263
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,160
The money we found in your house

264
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,800
is right here.

265
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,400
You embezzled the funding,
disrespected His Majesty,

266
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,479
and slandered the imperial court.

267
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,560
The charges are clear
and the evidence is presented.

268
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Do you plea guilty?

269
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,160
Official Yuan,

270
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,479
since you have the evidence,

271
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,439
does it really matter

272
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,959
if I plea guilty?

273
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,400
We are giving you a chance.

274
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,160
You are a mere fourth-rank official.

275
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,719
You wouldn't dare pull this off.

276
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,239
Who are you taking orders from?

277
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,880
Come clean.

278
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,800
I'll repeat what I said.

279
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,199
I never embezzled any money.

280
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:32,719
I never took orders from anyone.

281
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,239
Qiu Yi, don't expect your accomplices
to save your skin

282
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,160
just because you're
keeping your lips sealed.

283
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,280
Bring in the sons of the Qiu family.

284
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,040
Bring in the sons of the Qiu family!

285
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:44,959
Quick.

286
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,239
Move!

287
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:47,719
Move!

288
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,040
Keep walking.

289
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,319
Move.

290
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,439
Kneel.

291
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:58,920
Qiu Xian,

292
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,079
Qiu Ning, Qiu Hong.

293
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,680
I'll confront you here.

294
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,760
Qiu Hong, we'll start with you.

295
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,439
I've been wronged!

296
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,719
I've been wronged!

297
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,280
Sirs, please investigate.

298
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,800
Qiu Yi had served the imperial court
for decades.

299
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,079
He was never corrupted.

300
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,439
We only gave the statement

301
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,280
because we were under duress

302
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,760
while in prison.

303
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,319
I agree!

304
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:29,920
Qiu Xian...

305
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,079
Qiu Yi, say nothing.

306
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,239
We understand.

307
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,680
The fate of our family is on the line,

308
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,160
we are all on the same boat now.

309
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,079
We must fight and live as one
to have a chance

310
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,319
of clearing our names!

311
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,560
I agree!

312
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,160
Qiu Ning, Qiu Hong...

313
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,079
Qiu Yi...

314
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,959
Official Qiu,

315
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,280
this is your doing.

316
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,000
You must admit it.

317
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,079
We found the money from your house.

318
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,319
Secondly,

319
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:03,040
we have the imperial merchant
Hu Wan as our witness.

320
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:12,800
This is unbelievable!

321
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,280
The family were torn

322
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,800
because of the fake notes,

323
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760
they became

324
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,199
loving siblings again but at the court.

325
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,040
There must be something
we can use against the Qiu family.

326
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,160
When the house was raided,

327
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,920
there was a man who claimed
not to be one of the family.

328
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,760
What was his name again?

329
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,079
Qiu Di, Forth Madam Mi's son.

330
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:39,303
(Royal Academy)

331
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,000
Miss, we've brought you the clothes.

332
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,760
Perfect timing, Ms. Wang.

333
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,880
Come in.

334
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Come in.

335
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,880
Did anyone mistreat you?

336
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,800
Everything has been fine.

337
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,199
The weather is cold,
keep yourself warm.

338
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,760
Lord Liang.

339
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:37,640
(Shi Xiaoxiao,
Royal academy leading courtesan)

340
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,239
Sorry, Lord Liang.

341
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,439
We will leave right away.

342
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,920
Put the clothes down.

343
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:10,040
Don't just stand there like a fool

344
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,400
when you're in her room.

345
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,000
Aren't you usually very witty?

346
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,760
Ms. Wang,

347
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,079
who is that woman?

348
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,479
Miss Shi?

349
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,239
She is the most famous lady

350
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,319
in the Royal Academy.

351
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400
Even I wouldn't dare to
rub her the wrong way.

352
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,520
By the way,

353
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,359
the thing you asked for.

354
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:32,400
Thank you.

355
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,719
Min'er.

356
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,239
Let it all out.

357
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,800
They won't let us
burn joss papers here.

358
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,719
Here,

359
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,199
take these osmanthus cakes

360
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
and place them
on the west side of the courtyard.

361
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,079
The Old Madam loved desserts.

362
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
If she could see this,

363
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,319
she would know that you cared.

364
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,359
Qiu Yan!

365
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,359
Qiu Yan!

366
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,040
Qiu Yan!

367
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,680
How dare you!

368
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,000
You sneaked silver needles

369
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,079
into Miss Shi's clothes!

370
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,520
You hold a grudge against me,

371
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,239
so you meant to harm my woman!

372
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Sir, this must be a misunderstanding.

373
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,719
She wouldn't dare do this

374
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,439
in a million years!

375
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,719
You are slandering me
without any proof.

376
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,359
Perhaps you failed

377
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,280
to impress Miss Shi

378
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,719
and came here

379
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,079
to play the hero who saves her!

380
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,000
Stop denying!

381
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:54,880
Come!

382
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,319
Lord Liang!

383
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,599
- This must be a misunderstanding!
- Come with me!

384
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,680
- Lord Liang!
- Lord Liang!

385
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,319
Come here!

386
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,680
Kill me if you dare!

387
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,119
Lord Liang!

388
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,439
- You shameless scoundrel!
- Lord Liang!

389
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,239
Help!

390
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,079
Vile woman!

391
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,479
Help!

392
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,040
I'll make you pay!

393
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
Liang Yi, you scoundrel!

394
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,520
Vile woman!

395
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,800
You seem vigorous

396
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,199
to say those words.

397
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,640
Life here must be very decent.

398
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,040
I made use of your intimate time

399
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,160
with Shi Xiaoxiao.

400
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,400
Thank you.

401
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:22,760
You let the women of Qiu family

402
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,199
work as servants to
preserve their honor.

403
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,119
I need you to put on
a good play with me.

404
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,400
Yuan Lang might not buy it,

405
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,599
but he has nothing on us.

406
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:29,520
Don't stop.

407
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,400
Use this.

408
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,119
Come on.

409
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:31,719
Hold this.

410
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,199
Liang Yi, let go of me!

411
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:34,680
Qiu Yan!

412
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,560
Help!

413
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,439
Vile woman!

414
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,119
- How dare you harm Miss Shi!
- What were my father's charges?

415
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,239
Corruption.

416
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,520
There was a trial yesterday.

417
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,439
Officially, your father's charge is

418
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,199
embezzling the money

419
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,079
used for purchasing the woods
needed to build the temple.

420
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,680
The merchant Hu Wan can prove it.

421
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,439
That's impossible.

422
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,119
But based on my investigation,

423
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,640
the notion of impeaching your father

424
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
came from Lin Changzhi, 
Minister of Works.

425
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,920
He's been very close with Hu Wan.

426
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,239
He acquired a sum of money,

427
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,119
it's the same amount as the money

428
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,280
found in your house.

429
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,479
Are you saying

430
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,400
Lin Changzhi embezzled the money

431
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,040
and conspired with Yuan Lang and Hu Wan

432
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,839
to frame my father for their crime?

433
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,000
Lin Changzhi was just a cover.

434
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,520
The mastermind behind this

435
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,160
is Yuan Lang.

436
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,119
My father was
the Vice Minister of Works.

437
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,680
Why is it all quiet now?

438
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,680
He's coming after you?

439
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,920
Yuan Lang didn't want me
to marry your family member,

440
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,280
so he set your family up

441
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,599
so I'll have no ally
in the imperial court

442
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,520
and be isolated.

443
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:49,760
If the Firewood Office launched a joint raid
with the Main Administrative Office,

444
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,880
the second chamber
would be the first target.

445
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,239
How did you and Father

446
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,119
manage to escape from the courtyard?

447
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:59,439
There was no one in the courtyard.

448
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,400
Maybe there were too many chambers
and courtyards in our house,

449
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,160
so they got confused and overlooked it.

450
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,800
He let Min'er and I go

451
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,560
during the raid

452
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,880
so he can charge you with abetting us.

453
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:13,920
Yes.

454
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,920
During the trial yesterday,

455
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,079
Yuan Lang interrogated your father,

456
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,719
hoping your father would sell me out.

457
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,560
But your father was a wise man.

458
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,160
He admitted to embezzling.

459
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,079
He admitted it

460
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,400
to protect you.

461
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,000
Qiu Yan, I've let your family down.

462
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,959
Yuan Lang caught us off guard,

463
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,680
I must be extra cautious now.

464
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,239
Lord Liang, have mercy on her!

465
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,079
Please let go of Qiu Yan!

466
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,839
Min'er, do not ask him for mercy!

467
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
He can take my life if he wants!

468
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,680
Let go of me! Liang Yi!

469
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,400
When did you find the keys?

470
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,599
Not long ago. I didn't get to tell you.

471
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,079
Only the Firewood Office has this.

472
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:02,880
I carry it every day.

473
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,719
There are eyes and ears
in the Royal Academy,

474
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,199
there will be rumors about this.

475
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,680
It'll be hard for you to clarify it.

476
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:09,880
I was worried

477
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,239
I wouldn't find it.

478
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,040
Done.

479
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,280
Lord Liang?

480
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,560
Lord Liang?

481
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,719
You can let me know
if there is any dissatisfaction.

482
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,640
I'll educate her properly!

483
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,920
If she died because of you,

484
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,719
it'd be an embarrassment for all of us.

485
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,359
Liang Yi, let me go!

486
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,760
Let me go!

487
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,920
I'll spare you today.

488
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,680
Stop right there!

489
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,800
If you cross me again,

490
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,199
I'll tear you into pieces!

491
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,319
Lord Liang, calm down.

492
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,160
- I will teach her a lesson.
- Qiu Yan!

493
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,040
Are you alright?

494
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,040
Did Lord Liang hurt you?

495
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,560
Dismiss, now!

496
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,800
Lord Liang said

497
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,560
our father was framed?

498
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,920
Can he save our father?

499
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,040
He canceled his engagement with you,

500
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,680
but he was caught up in this too.

501
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,079
That's why he pretends
to have a fallout with us.

502
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:15,400
For the time being,

503
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm afraid we can't clear
our father's name.

504
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,199
There's more.

505
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,560
I've pondered on it lately.

506
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,760
I was wrong about our mother's passing.

507
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,319
She died of illness.

508
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,439
I refused to face the reality

509
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,119
and wronged our father
and the Old Madam.

510
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,160
Qiu Yan...

511
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,479

Don't ask.

681
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,840
There is no one else here.

682
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,239
Let me in on it.

683
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,320
No.

684
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,199
Liang Yi, please!

685
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,639
Qiu Yan came to me yesterday

686
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,239
and wanted to end everything with me.

687
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,719
I know she doesn't
want to put me in harm's way.

688
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:33,120
But I am a grown man,

689
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,919
how can I just watch and do nothing

690
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,199
while the woman I love suffers?

691
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:37,959
Right now,

692
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,679
we need to get her
out of the Royal Academy.

693
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,280
Liang Yi, we've known
each other for years.

694
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
Do me a favor, will you?

695
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,760
Please?

696
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:48,439
What do you have in mind?

697
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,879
I spent some money
and pulled some strings.

698
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,320
I don't have a plan to save him yet.

699
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:54,399
You're smart and good at splitting logs,

700
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,399
you can even bust him out

701
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,639
with brute force.

702
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:58,679
Bust him out?

703
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,000
His Majesty ordered
to have the perpetrator arrested.

704
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,479
The Firewood Office captured him,

705
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,879
now you want me to bust him out?

706
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,199
Qin Xuan, you are my friend.

707
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,959
I can pretend you never said it.

708
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,760
But if you even think of it again,

709
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,000
I'll have you arrested.

710
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Are you really

711
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,159
not going to do anything to help?

712
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,600
Qiu Min was your fiancee!

713
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,959
Our engagement was canceled.

714
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,000
Otherwise, His Majesty

715
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,800
would never let me investigate my in-laws!

716
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:25,360
If I secretly helped them,

717
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,719
I wouldn't still be an inspector

718
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,959
of the Firewood Office.

719
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:35,719
All and all,

720
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:39,000
you only care about your job.

721
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,280
Liang Yi.

722
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:44,479
Over the years, I've watched you

723
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,479
become distant, selfish, and cruel

724
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,360
with each passing day.

725
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:48,840
I defended you

726
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,199
and had hopes for you.

727
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,959
But it seems

728
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:56,840
I was wrong about you.

729
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,679
In your eyes,

730
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,439
your rank in the Firewood Office

731
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:02,840
is more important than anything!

732
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,639
I should never have
considered you a friend.

733
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,479
Congratulations,

734
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,479
you saw my true nature.

735
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:16,800
Fine.

736
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,199
From now on,

737
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:22,159
you and I are no longer friends.

738
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,679
Sir.

739
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,000
Why didn't you tell him

740
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,360
the predicament we're in?

741
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
That's between Yuan Lang and me.

742
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,439
He deals with problems by killing them.

743
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,840
It's best Qin Xuan knows nothing.

744
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,959
How are you going to save Miss Qiu?

745
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320
Yuan Lang failed to convict Qiu Yi,

746
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,399
so he's waiting for me to react.

747
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,479
Qin Xuan doesn't understand

748
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,679
only by defeating Yuan Lang

749
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,679
can we save the Qiu family.

750
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,679
Miss Qiu Min and Miss Qiu Yan
will have a rough time.

751
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,600
I don't know about the others,

752
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:25,479
but Qiu Yan

753
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,000
can take care of herself.

754
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,479
Thanks.

755
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,320
We ran out of buns.

756
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,479
These are for the stray cats
in the backyard.

757
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,719
Take them away.

758
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:03,919
Second Young Lady,
aren't you tired from all the work?

759
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:06,479
Do you need me to
share some food with you?

760
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:10,320
Hey...

761
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,199
Thanks, Qiu Ying.

762
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:14,199
Don't you know any shame?

763
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:15,760
Don't get smug.

764
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,879
Mr. Wang trusts me the most.

765
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,479
You've lost your favor with Ms. Wang.

766
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,959
You'll beg me to show you

767
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:22,959
some mercy.

768
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,280
Godmother,

769
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,959
what brings you here?

770
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:36,479
Greetings, Ms. Wang.

771
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,000
Who cleaned the toilet buckets today?

772
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,360
Her.

773
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,199
Why is it the washed toilet bucket I got

774
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:44,719
reeks of stench?

775
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,000
You worthless fool!

776
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,479
I only asked you to do some work,

777
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,399
and now you're giving me the attitude!

778
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:57,000
Don't worry, Godmother.

779
00:40:57,399 --> 00:40:57,800
I'll

780
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,959
teach her a lesson.

781
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,919
Ms. Wang.

782
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,679
I've noticed lately

783
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,600
there is blood in your toilet bucket.

784
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:08,239
I guess you are

785
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,479
suffering from

786
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,879
hemorrhoids and constipation.

787
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
I have a prescription
that works wonders.

788
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,000
Your body is ever so delicate,

789
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
you can't apply it directly on the skin.

790
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,959
So, I cover the toilet bucket with it

791
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,000
so you can

792
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
absorb the medicinal effect and recover.

793
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:27,479
How thoughtful of you.

794
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,239
You're the pillar that supports us.

795
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:31,280
All of us need you

796
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,199
to be stay well.

797
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:35,879
She's quite a witty girl.

798
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:37,879
Starting tomorrow,

799
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
stop cleaning the toilet buckets.

800
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,639
You'll serve the ladies
of the forecourt.

801
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,639
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

802
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,000
But Godmother,

803
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:45,800
this girl is a cunning one.

804
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,479
She deserves to
clean the toilet buckets.

805
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,320
My girl never disappoints.

806
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,159
Qiu Yan, when did you
learn about medication?

807
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,479
I don't know anything.

808
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,840
But it's true that Ms. Wang
has hemorrhoids.

809
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,439
It's embarrassing,

810
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,320
so she wouldn't tell the physicians.

811
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,479
I made up the prescription.

812
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:13,879
She wouldn't know anyway.

813
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,239
Yan, you're always so smart.

814
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,879
Even though

815
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,320
we'll still be servants
at the forecourt,

816
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,199
but it's better than
cleaning toilet buckets.

817
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:28,840
If you get lucky

818
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,479
and catches the eyes of a decent man,

819
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,199
that's...

820
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,399
You never stop asking for more.

821
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,120
You should learn to be grateful

822
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
and stop making me mad.

823
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,679
I'm not seeing anyone.

824
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,320
Miss Shi, it's me, Qiu Yan.

825
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,000
Ms. Wang sent me to serve you.

826
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,479
Come in.

827
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,159
Yes.

828
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,399
I thought Ms. Wang

829
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,360
had come to talk to into
meeting Baron Zhang again.

830
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,719
Miss Shi, you're a delicate lady.

831
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:22,000
Don't get mad over that useless man.

832
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,760
Delicate?

833
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:27,639
I just follow whatever benefits me.

834
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,280
If that's the case,

835
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:35,439
why would you care who you're meeting?

836
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,800
Go and see all of them,

837
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,639
don't get on Ms. Wang's bad side.

838
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:42,679
You're a sensible person.

839
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:45,120
Serve me,

840
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,639
and I'll keep you safe.

841
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I am here to serve you, Miss Shi.

842
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,479
I won't cause you any trouble.

843
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,199
You don't need to protect me.

844
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:58,600
You're an easygoing person.

845
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,360
I like you.

846
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,919
I'll leave all the work here

847
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,959
in your hands.

848
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,479
