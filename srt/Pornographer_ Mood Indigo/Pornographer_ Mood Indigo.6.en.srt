(Guiding Lantern of Soul)

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,130
(Mr. Gamoda's funeral
is going on quietly.)

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:17,740
Come in, please.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,520
(His only next of kin is a younger sister
with whom he has lost contact.)

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,700
(So Kijima is taking care
of the funeral.)

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,150
He must be targeting at the legacy.

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,080
It seems to be so.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,580
That's why he suddenly became
the disciple attending to Mr. Gamoda.

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,360
- He is such a schemer.
- Indeed.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,080
(There are people
who gossip groundlessly.)

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,660
Mrs. Sato.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,360
(Actually, Mr. Gamoda left)

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
(only a few things.)

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,680
(He has been in debt.)

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:03,980
(After he died,)

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,180
(his house and land
would be sold as planned.)

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,700
(The copyrights of his works)

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,640
(will be given to his ex-wife
as agreed at the time of divorce.)

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,240
(In accordance with his will,)

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,180
(Kijima will only inherit)

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,600
(the copyrights of
his works to be published.)

22

=Pornographer: Indigo=

23
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,960
("Haru's Life" by Gamoda Ikuo)

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,700
The manuscript is received.

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,820
=The Final Episode
The Opposite of Existence=

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,040
To be honest,

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,000
I thought Mr. Gamoda
would not be able to finish it.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,860
It is admirable that

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,780
he has finished it in poor health.

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,060
He didn't finish it.

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,920
He failed to finish writing the book.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
Eighty percent of the
manuscript was written by him

33
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,500
and the rest was written by me.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,100
Of course,

35
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,820
he gave me the consent.

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,680
Is it true?

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,880
I think this should not be made public.

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,880
I will not tell this
to others in all my life.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,900
OK. Take the manuscript

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,360
and go wherever as you please.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,320
I finished it not only
for the sake of Mr. Gamoda,

42
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,180
but also for your sake.

43
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,680
Kijima. Listen to me.

44
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,580
What do you want to say?

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,860
I won't resign. I will
go on with my job.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,840
Why?

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,660
My wedding also went up in smoke.

48
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,460
It has been a strange
relationship since the start.

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,340
I just got a feeling
that it would not last.

50
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,200
This is better.

51
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,360
Do you really think so?

52
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
Then,

53
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,160
you will still be my editor, right?

54
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,800
I will only be your editor?

55
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,240
What else can you be?

56
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,600
You said being together with me

57
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,440
was painful for you, didn't you?

58
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,440
Kijima.

59
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,280
- I...
- You are actually

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
a very decent person.

61
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,160
So you sometimes feel envious

62
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,520
seeing a wayward fool like me.

63
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,020
Being decent means you are
surrounded by gentle people.

64
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,220
This is what

65
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,140
I like about you.

66
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,040
Your words are so annoying.

67
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
You are saying as if you knew me well.

68
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,740
I...

69
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,180
What?

70
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,980
I and

71
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,540
you...

72
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,280
There is also the
mourning apparel genre, right?

73
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,020
It is really a turn-on.

74
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,840
Speaking of this,

75
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,100
it was also right after
the funeral on that day.

76
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,680
It was the day

77
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,960
when you picked me up.

78
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,020
It's great!

79
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,980
Apply more strength.

80
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,520
You are so sexy.

81
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
Open your legs.

82
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,860
How do you feel?

83
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,380
Get in.

84
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,640
We can't do this.

85
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,580
(In front of the brand-new
portrait of the deceased,)

86
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
(Kijima and I got especially excited.)

87
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,980
(Making love with me as a mourner)

88
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,460
(seems to be the kinky old man's
final request for Kijima.)

89
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,800
("Haru's Life" by Gamoda Ikuo)

90
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,380
(The posthumous work doesn't
seem to be written by a sick person)

91
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,300
(and it is well-received
by a wide variety of people.)

92
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,000
(Thus, it became a very popular book.)

93
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,640
(The posthumous work of Gamoda Ikuo)

94
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,080
(In the end, Kijima)

95
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,160
(restarted his writing using
the pen name"Renjiro Kijima".)

96
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,080
("Sweet Play" by Kijima Renjiro)
(His first book is highly raised.)

97
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,520
(Thus, other publishing houses
requested him for contributions.)

98
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,120
(As his name suggests,)

99
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,300
(he completed one work
after another like a ghost.)

100
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,020
How is a bow-tie tied exactly?

101
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,640
(As for me...)

102
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
You are so quick.

103
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,510
- I'll be off first.
- Forget about it.

104
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,250
All right.

105
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,510
(Rio Kijima)

106
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,000
- Kido, let's go.
- OK.

107
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,220
(My relationship with
Kijima remains subtle.)

108
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,520
Is Mr. Kijima calling?
Needn't you answer it?

109
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,400
It doesn't matter. I will go visit
him at the end of the year.

110
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,820
Let's go.

111
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,040
- Let's go.
- OK.

112
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,980
What the hell?

113
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,780
Darn!

114
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,320
Darn!

115
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,660
Darn!

116
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Darn!

117
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,460
Darn!

118
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,560
Darn!

119
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,080
Darn!

120
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,060
Darn!

121
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,600
(Looking back, I realized that)

122
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,580
(that period of time was
the peak of Kijima's writing career.)

123
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,540
(In the end,)

124
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,820
(I did nothing for him.)

125
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,980
(It has been a long time.
I am in Tokyo today. )

126
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,820
(Let's have a drink if
you are free. By Rio Kijima)

127
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,640
Daddy.

128
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,680
Ayaka.

129
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,820
Come on. What is the matter?

130
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,600
Mummy sent me to take you to her.

131
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,260
Your mummy?

132
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,040
(I asked her out randomly
at a social gathering.)

133
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
(We got married after
dating each other for one year.)

134
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,360
(Now,)

135
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,280
(I am living a peaceful life.)

136
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,960
How is your daughter?

137
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,480
- What's her name?
- Ayaka.

138
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,040
How many times need I say it
before you remember?

139
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,940
I have no intention to remember it.

140
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,120
What the heck!

141
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,720
But you are really doing very well.

142
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,920
Why did you say so?

143
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Kuzumi works for a big
advertising company, right?

144
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,240
Why not let him provide for you?

145
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,740
No, I can't do that.

146
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,240
Why?

147
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,680
He comes back late every day.

148
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,980
He is always worrying about work.

149
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,340
So I don't want to be his burden.

150
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,600
And I have to work hard as well.

151
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,180
I see.

152
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,040
I also

153
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,920
want to give him support.

154
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,600
I seem to be a little drunk.

155
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,580
Are you all right?

156
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,840
(All of a sudden,)

157
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,220
(I felt the sexual desire
of that day again.)

158
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm sorry.

159
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,280
Sorry.

160
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,140
No.

161
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,220
I should say sorry.

162
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,920
(What did I do just now?)

163
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,280
(I am such a fool.)

164
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,060
(We are no longer in a
relationship allowing us to have sex.)

165
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,720
Pull up here.

166
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,120
Thank you for what you did today.

167
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
Bye, Kido.

168
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,640
See you next time.

169
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,780
If you need me, you can
contact me at any time.

170
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,560
OK.

171
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't push yourself too hard.

172
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,940
Take care of your body.

173
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,360
Take care.

174
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,280
See you next time.

175
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,420
Then I'll drive.

176
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,940
A moment, please.

177
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,180
Sorry.

178
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,220
Coming.

179
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,780
I miss you so much.

180
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,280
Me too.

181
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,700
It's cold outside. Come on in.

182
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,080
Come in.

183
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,840
OK.

184
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,140
(Deep in my heart,)

185
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,020
(there are tiny flames flickering.)

186
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,740
(Back then,)

187
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,620
(they didn't burn out.)

188
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,460
(Maybe)

189
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,660
(they won't go out)

190
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,680
(throughout my life.)

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,500
How has Kido been recently?

207
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,040
Just as usual.

208
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,520
He is your only friend, right?

209
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,780
Kido?

210
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,820
Than a friend...

211
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,500
Well, sort of.

212
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,380
He is the only person I can call friend.

213
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,880
Thanks.

214
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,860
Just now

215
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,520
you definitely recalled something.

216
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,180
What?

217
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,880
That is suspicious.

218
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,560
Why are you snickering?

219
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,980
It might also be some kind of destiny.

220
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,340
You just glossed it over.

221
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,220
What is it?

222
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,420
Mr. Kijima.

223
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,780
Let's

224
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,740
shack up.

225
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,780
Kuzumi.

226
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,560
For me,

227
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,540
you are

228
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,620
someone special

229
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,080
and will always be

230
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,920
someone special.

231
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,480
Language really has magic.

232
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,760
Even if I am a writer,

233
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,740
I can't penetrate its mysteries.

234
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,000
(This is a work of fiction.)
