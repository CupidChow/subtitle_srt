1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,460
We feel very honored

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,980
to publish your book this time.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,420
But, it's a pity that

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,680
Kido can't be your editor in the future.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,780
Kido is going to...

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,040
Excuse me.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,240
What do you mean by saying that?

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:19,960
What?

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,040
He didn't tell you?

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,120
We promised to transfer
Kido to our sister company

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,040
if he could get the publication right
of Mr. Gamoda's posthumous book.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,700
I'll leave the rest to you.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,780
Thank you for your hard work.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,700
Kijima.

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,660
You are a scum.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,120
Hey, Kijima.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,220
Let me explain myself, all right?

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,420
No need.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,400
Actually, I have wanted to
tell all this to you.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,400
But I haven't got a chance.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,100
I am angry about two things you did.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,580
The first thing is that

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,640
you made up with your
girlfriend without telling me.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,560
When did you two make up?

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,500
When did that happen? Tell me.

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,240
This couldn't be worse.

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,120
You did that kind of thing with me.

28
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,160
I am so ashamed that I want to die now.

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,700
Kijima.

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,860
- I...
- Don't touch me!

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,160
Then,

32
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,180
what is the other thing?

33
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,440
The second thing is that

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,360
you were ashamed of your job,

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,960
but you still persuaded me
to write erotica.

36
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,480
How could you marry someone
who disdains your job?

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,840
Moreover,

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,660
to change your job, you used Mr. Gamoda.

39
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,820
To get Mr. Gamoda's
contract, you used me.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,100
Did you do all these
for getting married?

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Your behavior is really base.

42
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,360
But,

43
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,300
you are always such kind of person.

44
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,340
You always do things to please others.

45
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,040
You just can't do things you like.

46
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,700
You are unable to stick
to your own convictions.

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,560
Putting it accurately,
you don't have any conviction.

48
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,280
You are a person
with spiritual emptiness.

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,660
What?

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,200
You don't approve of my opinion?

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,540
You obviously had no convictions,
but you certainly have pride.

52
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,120
I can't be like you.

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,560
What?

54
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,760
Don't think that everyone
can live as you do.

55
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,560
You do things as you please

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,880
disregarding what others
think of you and your future.

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,320
You need not watch people's moods.

58
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:42,840
Darn!

59
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,800
Darn!

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,840
Darn!

61
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,140
(You have the talent allowing
you to get your own way.)

62
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,340
Darn!

63
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
(You have enthusiasm.)

64
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,720
(You are strong enough
to endure loneliness.)

65
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,700
(I want to be like you.)

66
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,440
When I was with you,

67
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,960
I found myself especially unlikable.

68
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,820
Really?

69
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,120
Then we finally agree on something.

70
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,600
You make me feel sick.

71
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,800
Hurry to pack up and get out of my home.

72
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:56,680

73

=Episode 5
The Chain of Betrayal and Sadness=

74
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,480
(Throughout March,)

75
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,780
(Mr. Gamoda has been
suffering from rain and cancer.)

76
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,060
(The cold days of the
early spring are unpleasant.)

77
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,700
(Though warm weather
is coming with the spring rain,)

78
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,580
(Mr. Gamoda's health is
becoming worse and worse.)

79
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:09,840
Mr. Gamoda.

80
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,180
Mr. Gamoda.

81
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,980
Sorry to disturb you
while you are resting.

82
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
- It's all right.
- Just keep lying down.

83
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,000
I am sorry that I can't
give you the manuscript.

84
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,200
It doesn't matter.

85
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,360
There are only a few
pages to be finished.

86
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,660
But I can't concentrate on writing.

87
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,060
Just revise it till you are satisfied.

88
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,140
We can release the unfinished version.

89
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,780
That is indicated in the contract.

90
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,700
You are really good at your work.

91
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,740
I am flattered.

92
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,380
I heard that

93
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,780
you would resign
after finishing this work.

94
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,700
Rio told me this.

95
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,880
In fact...

96
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,300
I am sorry.

97
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,980
This is normal when it comes to work.

98
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,200
It is understandable that
you want to find a better job.

99
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,860
Don't mind it.

100
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,740
OK.

101
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,930
But,

102
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,520
you are Rio's schoolmate, right?

103
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,760
Besides work,

104
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,880
could you also help him
with other things?

105
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,480
Mr. Gamoda.

106
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,660
I,

107
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
I am worried about him.

108
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
It is true that

109
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,140
he is good at writing.

110
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,180
But if he doesn't know how to relax,

111
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,620
he will break down
under too much pressure.

112
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,820
Yes.

113
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
So,

114
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,920
I will entrust you with him.

115
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,960
Please watch over him.

116
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,540
OK.

117
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,520
I'll do things for him within my power.

118
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,120
Thanks.

119
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,560
Don't mention it.

120
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,280
I thought I could die without regrets.

121
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,280
Mr. Gamoda.

122
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,140
It's your fault, Kido.

123
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,560
Your rash doing

124
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,120
made me...

125
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,260
made me...

126
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,470
You must be responsible for your doing.

127
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,740
Don't worry.

128
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,440
I will,

129
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,820
I will take care of him.

130
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,080
I will entrust you with him.

131
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,140
Look out for him, please.

132
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,740
Look out for him, please.

133
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,660
Look out for him, please.

134
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,000
(It is so painful.)

135
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,640
(But,)

136
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,720
(he must be more...)

137
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,420
Such a good chance is rare.

138
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,480
I know.

139
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,260
But I still want to stay.

140
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,940
- Even so...
- Sir.

141
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,740
I like the books published by us.

142
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,400
Please let me stay.

143
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,820
I see.

144
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,380
It is true.

145
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,720
Our publishing house is wonderful.

146
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,760
The reason why we can publish such books

147
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,320
is that we live in the age of peace.

148
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,740
You big fool.

149
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,320
I will fulfill your foolish wish.

150
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,300
I will go tell the publishing house
offering you the job.

151
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,480
Your refusal won't cause it any harm.

152
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,880
Sir.

153
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,520
I will be off.

154
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,600
This can't happen again.

155
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,200
Just work hard in our publishing house.

156
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,360
Thank you very much.

157
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,840
(This is fine.)

158
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,560
Kijima.

159
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,480
Is Mr. Gamoda fine?

160
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,260
Has he been in a coma for two days?

161
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,760
Why haven't you contacted
me immediately?

162
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,420
You are noisy.

163
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,400
You look pale. Have you got any sleep?

164
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,580
It's none of your business.

165
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,980
Don't push yourself
too hard. Have a rest.

166
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,560
OK?

167
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,920
No, I won't.

168
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,740
All right. Go to have a rest, OK?

169
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,260
What if something bad
happens during my sleep?

170
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,600
Don't worry.

171
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,120
I will wake you up
once something happens.

172
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,540
Let me take your place, will you?

173
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,880
If anything happens,
you can ring the bell.

174
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,300
Got it.

175
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,420
You are awake?

176
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:29,960
Have you fallen asleep?

177
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,580
Yes. For a while.

178
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,280
I want to apologize to you.

179
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,960
I am sorry for many things.

180
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,380
I wasn't honest with you.

181
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,160
You need not apologize.

182
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,040
I was wrong to have
expectations for you.

183
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,160
You had your reasons.

184
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,580
I understand.

185
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,220
Kijima.

186
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,120
Kido.

187
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,260
Thank you for coming here.

188
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,040
To be honest,

189
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,480
I feel I might not be able to hold on.

190
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,660
I still have many things
to tell Mr. Gamoda.

191
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,040
I ever imagined

192
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,700
what an ideal father should be like.

193
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,440
Now I know it is
a person like Mr. Gamoda.

194
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,300
He loves the world that I love dearly.

195
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,480
He is willing to understand me.

196
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,880
After I told him this,

197
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,040
he burst into laughter.

198
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,860
He said if I have had a father like him,

199
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,440
I would not have become a writer.

200
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,920
Right.

201
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,140
I don't know what I should do.

202
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,200
Five days ago,

203
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,180
Mr. Gamoda began to

204
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:12,500
have difficulty in speaking fluently.

205
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,460
That made me realize that

206
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:27,680
words are slipping away

207
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,760
from his mind

208
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,080
and...

209
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,680
they will never come back again.

210
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,700
I feel so painful.

211
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,720
But,

212
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:25,000
I guess Mr.Gamoda no longer needs them.

213
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,420
Mr. Gamoda has finished his manuscript.

214
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,880
I am keeping it for him.

215
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,920
But I might be busy
for some time to come.

216
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,100
After I settle all matters,

217
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,940
you can come to fetch it. All right?

218
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,600
OK. I got it.

219
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,520
(When dawn broke,)

220
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,280

silently in deep sleep.)
