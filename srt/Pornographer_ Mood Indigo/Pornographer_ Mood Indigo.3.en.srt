1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:02,980
Then...

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,040
could you suck his dick?

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,140
So you should try being a woman.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,360
(You want this job desperately, right?)

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,160
(What are you thinking?)

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,580
This is not a big deal.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,860
No way.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,860
I don't mind at all.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,000
This is unbelievable.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,680
Stop.

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,720
You need not do such a thing.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,920
You are really a bad guy.

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,840
You must coordinate
with me and ejaculate.

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,040
I feel great.

15
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,600
(Kijima's tongue excited me.)

16
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,440
(He excited me more than)

17
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,860
(all the women I ever dated.)

18
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,100
I am coming.

19
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,380
I am coming.

20
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,350
I am going to ejaculate.

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,680
You young people are so interesting.

22
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,580
I like you.

23
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,340
Rio.

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,280
You can stay in my place
as from tomorrow.

25
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:29,740
=Pornographer: Indigo=

26
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,370
=Episode 3
Awakening at the End of Reason=

27
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,580
Tell me.

28
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,500
Why,

29
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,640
why were you willing to do that?

30
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,340
You want to know why?

31
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,500
You said you wanted the job.

32
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,140
Let's forget

33
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
what happened just now.

34
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,900
We were just forced to do that
by the old pervert.

35
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,800
Kijima.

36
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,020
How did you like it?

37
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,740
What?

38
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,500
The blow job I gave you just now...

39
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,880
I could not remember clearly
what happened after we started kissing.

40
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,280
Here you are.

41
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,120
Back then...

42
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,740
Let's go.

43
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,800
(I forgot to ask for the receipt
before opening the door of the taxi.)

44
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,560
(Then I got hold of Kijima's hand.)

45
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,440
(Then...)

46
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,280
What do you want to do?

47
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,100
We will have to make love.

48
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,480
Then let's make love.
You want sex, right?

49
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
I can see that on your face.

50
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,700
Have you ever put your fingers

51
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,920
into this part of the woman's body?

52
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,500
Never.

53
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,080
Have you?

54
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,860
I quite like doing this.

55
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,200
- Unbelievable.
- Don't say that.

56
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
I put my fingers

57
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,640
into your body one by one.

58
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,180
Wait.

59
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,600
No.

60
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,980
- I am scared.
- It's all right.

61
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,580
Can I put my thing into your body?

62
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,800
No, you mustn't.

63
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,500
It is too big.

64
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,560
How can it get in?

65
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,180
Today maybe I can't do it.

66
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,780
Then...

67
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey.

68
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,460
What?

69
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,300
You said you couldn't do it today.

70
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,380
Will you do it tomorrow?

71
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,340
Kijima?

72
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,000
(I'll go to visit Mr. Gamoda. By Kijima)
(For some time to come,)

73
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,540
(Kijima has stayed in
Mr. Gamoda's place all along.)

74
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,290
(Gamoda 3-1)

75
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,860
My liver cancer recurred this year.

76
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,620
I am not in good conditions.

77
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,520
The doctor said I might
only have one year to live.

78
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,900
Now half a year has passed.

79
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,580
You,

80
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,420
you seem to be very calm facing this.

81
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,480
Yes. But life is really hard for me.

82
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,780
I have been running
a fever from time to time.

83
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,600
I have the hydro abdomen.

84
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,720
I have pain running through my body.

85
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,040
Sorry to hear that.

86
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,760
I wrote all the past works as I liked.

87
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,700
As long as I can finish this work,

88
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,400
I will have no regret in my life.

89
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,740
So,

90
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,320
I want you to chat with me,

91
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,320
a lonely old man every now and then.

92
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,820
It won't take too much of your time.

93
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,040
Please indulge me.

94
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,800
My pleasure.

95
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,560
Well,

96
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,700
since I accepted you as my disciple,

97
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,540
I will check your writing for you.

98
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,880
Thank you.

99
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,500
But, why did you
decide to write erotica?

100
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,340
Is it because you like them?

101
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,640
No.

102
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,960
To be honest, I never read any of such
novels before Kido advised me to.

103
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,080
Then did you decide to
write them for money?

104
00:13:59,380 --> 00:13:59,980
Yes.

105
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,960
But my writing didn't go smoothly.

106
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,680
Maybe I am not fit for writing erotica.

107
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,680
No.

108
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,340
Your body has the sexy elements.

109
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,980
When you sucked Kido's dick,

110
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,780
you looked so hot.

111
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
I had an erection

112
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,820
after so long a time.

113
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,360
Come with me.

114
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,740
OK.

115
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,140
It's this place.

116
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,700
What place is this?

117
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,060
It is my experiment room.

118
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,580
These are not reference materials.

119
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,140
You really used them?

120
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,320
Of course.

121
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,420
The description in my novel is so vivid

122
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,280
because I wrote it
based on real experience.

123
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,940
Of course I made love with people on a
voluntary basis and in a legal manner.

124
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,360
I know.

125
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,780
But to write excellent erotica,

126
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,660
must I also put myself through
the experience before writing?

127
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,700
No. I didn't mean that.

128
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,420
Whether you base your
writing on experience

129
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
or on imagination doesn't matter.

130
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,800
Then what matters?

131
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:23,800
What matters is whether
you have the sexual desire.

132
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,920
Sexual desire?

133
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,860
You must have it

134
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,180
whatever form

135
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,740
it takes.

136
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,420
I might be kind of frigid.

137
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,260
Though I have some sexual experience,

138
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,880
I have never wanted to
have sex voluntarily.

139
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,320
I see it only as
a physiological phenomenon.

140
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,160
Or I only had sex
after I had an erection.

141
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,820
That's all.

142
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,920
What is that?

143
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,320
Are you a dog?

144
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,580
But you need not think
it as a complex thing.

145
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,840
You ever thought of

146
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,440
doing it this way

147
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,080
or doing it that way, right?

148
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,660
I don't know.

149
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,240
Really?

150
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,680
The erotica is fabrication.

151
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,840
But it can arouse others sexually.

152
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,980
So,

153
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,220
only by writing about
your real sexual passions,

154
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,760
can you arouse others.

155
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,480
(Mr. Gamoda provided a room for Kijima.)

156
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,200
(In the room, there are
old desks and chairs.)

157
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,040
(At dusk,)

158
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,300
(the glow of the setting sun
slanted through the window.)

159
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,920
Kido.

160
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:46,840
Yes.

161
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,300
Now it is fine to entrust Kijima
with Mr. Gamoda, right?

162
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,660
Yes.

163
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,940
You said previously that Kijima
would have us publish his books, right?

164
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,480
Yes.

165
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,380
The first erotica written
by the winner of the Tenro Award.

166
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,460
This is great promotion.

167
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,820
Let's use this to cause a sensation.

168
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,300
It is not a good idea.

169
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,620
We can generate publicity
using his pen name.

170
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,320
But it will be a great waste if we
don't take advantage of his reputation.

171
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,620
That also makes sense.

172
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,440
But we haven't reached
that stage of work.

173
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,040
I will think about it
after he completed writing.

174
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,740
Right.

175
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,620
OK.

176
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
Then you shall do the work by then.

177
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
By the way, Kido.

178
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,520
What?

179
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,040
What should I do about that matter?

180
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,320
What matter?

181
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,560
Should I ask the HR Department
of Kyoden Publishing house about it?

182
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,820
But you need not give a reply now.

183
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,540
Sir.

184
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Sorry to trouble you.

185
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:51,960
OK.

186
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,200
Kido.
