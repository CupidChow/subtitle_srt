1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,760
(There is some kind of relationship
whose nature is difficult to define.)

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,700
Here you are.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,680
Thank you.

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,080
(But, putting it briefly,)

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,940
(my relationship with him is so.)

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,520
I am dating someone.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,160
Who is it?

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,780
It's Kuzumi.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,640
Well,

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,080
it is not necessary to
say more about this now.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
Don't try to hide your feelings.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,960
The smile on your lips is betraying you.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,320
Really?

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,580
I am sure that

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,380
you won't be able to meet a person
like Kuzumi anymore.

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,240
So you should cherish him.

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,940
I seem to be a little drunk.

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,480
Are you all right?

19
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,080
(All of a sudden,)

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,460
(I felt the sexual desire
of that day again.)

21
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,260
Sorry.

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,160
No.

24
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,540
I should say sorry.

25
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
(What did I do just now?)

26
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,320
(I am such a fool.)

27
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,080
(We are no longer in a
relationship allowing us to have sex.)

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Hurry.

Sorry for your loss.

(The professor in charge of my
alma mater's workshop passed away.)

38
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,540
Hey.

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,540
- Isn't that Kijima?
- What?

40
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,060
- Which person?
- Look! That one.

41
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,360
- Yes, it's him.
- It's really Kijima.

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,660
Great! He is the only person
that hasn't been informed.

43
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,340
Please sign here.

44
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,220
(I ever met my schoolmates of the)

45
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,160
(same college workshop
after graduation.)

46
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,520
(But I never met Kijima.)

47
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,040
Kido.

48
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,600
Kido.

49
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,940
- Hurry up.
- A moment, please.

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,820
Kijima.

51
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,120
I didn't expect to see you here.
It has been a long time.

52
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,960
Who are you?

53
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
I am Kido. Shiro Kido.

54
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,860
We have been in the
same workshop for two years.

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,960
Really?

56
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,840
Kijima.

57
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,060
- Saito.
- Unexpectedly, you still remember her.

58
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,100
Only you could not be contacted.
I have been worried.

59
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,620
I came to know this after
seeing the obituary on the newspaper.

60
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,960
The professor helped me a lot back then,
so I thought I must come.

61
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,380
Right.

62
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,360
You were the professor's
favorite student.

63
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,620
Maybe.

64
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,780
Well,

65
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,060
they are holding the feast
after the night watch over there.

66
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,120
Our teachers and schoolmates
of the same workshop are all present.

67
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,660
Would you like to go and join them?

68
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,060
No.

69
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,460
Sorry, I'm afraid not.

70
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,840
OK.

71
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,480
Please excuse me.

72
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,780
- Kido. Let's go.
- OK.

73
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,280
- By the way, I saw Kijima just now.
- Kijima?

74
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,160
He is here?

75
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,200
Yes. Yes.

76
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,580
He seemed to have changed.

77
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,700
He looked gloomier.

78
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,820
Yes.

79
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,940
Has he written any new works recently?

80
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,420
Who knows? Has he
run out of inspirations?

81
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
He has ever written a great work, right?
One got him the Tenro Award.

82
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,920
I heard someone
from the publishing house say

83
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,680
he made investments and failed.

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,600
Really?

85
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,700
He is rich. I don't think
that has done him any harm.

86
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,140
You are mean. Your words are mean.

87
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,060
He has been complacent.

88
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,220
Indeed.

89
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,280
Well...

90
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,830
(During my school days,)

91
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,260
( I was in the club
of literature and aimed to be a writer.)

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,310
(I was surprised that)

93
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,520
(one of my schoolmates
received a grand award like that.)

94
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,150
("Pornographer: Indigo" by Rio Kijima)
(Thinking that "His work )

95
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,520
("Pornographer: Indigo" by Rio Kijima)
(not a big deal",)

96
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
(I bought the book he wrote.)

97
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,020
(As a result, I felt
I was defeated completely.)

98
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,900
(Though I could not
resign myself to the result,)

99
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,040
(I found his book very interesting.)

100
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,160
(I found the world I wanted to
depict in his book.)

101
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,310
(Delete all
Yes)

102
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,340
(I...)

103
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,240
(want to give up writing.)

104
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,900
Hey, let's go. Let's go.

105
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,360
When will you stop eating?

106
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,540
You are as gluttonous as you used to be.

107
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,100
Which shop shall we go to for the next?

108
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,580
I have made a reservation.

109
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,080
I'd like to leave.

110
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,380
You are leaving so early?

111
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
I still have work to finish.

112
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,920
Besides, I drove here, so I can't drink.

113
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,180
I am expecting you to drive me home.

114
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,320
Maybe next time. All right?

115
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:24,920
I'll be off.

116
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,020
You go on.

117
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,480
- Bye.
- See you.

118
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
(No new message)

119
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,580
(Radio)
An accident happened

120
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,360
on the Tome Expressway.
Now it's congested.

121
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,260
In addition,

122
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,760
a 28-km section of the highway

123
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,720
before the Mizo Tunnel
inside Kanagawa is congested.

124
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,240
It seems that I have a long way
to go before entering the city.

125
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,040
Kijima.

126
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,340
Kijima.

127
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,460
You are...

128
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,620
The station is far away from here.
Have you lost your way?

129
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,080
I have no money to pay the fares.

130
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,460
- Really?
- Yes.

131
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,060
Wait! Wait!

132
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,480
Are you planning to
walk back to the city?

133
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,640
You live in the city, right?

134
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,400
You are in Chigasaki now.

135
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,160
I think I'll arrive there
after walking for some time.

136
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,980
Where is your home?

137
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,380
In Shinjuku.

138
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,280
Hop in.

139
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:37,960
Can I?

140
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,360
I can't leave you here and leave.

141
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,380
Thank you.

142
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,900
You are Kido, right?

143
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,800
So you really don't remember me.

144
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,140
Sorry.

145
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,860
What is your job, Kido?

146
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,740
I am an editor.

147
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,900
I am an erotica editor
of Tosui Publishing House.

148
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,100
You like that kind of novel?

149
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,820
No.

150
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,740
I couldn't find a job anywhere else.

151
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,600
So I became the regular
employee of this publishing house.

152
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,700
But it is a good job, right?

153
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,140
You even bought a car.

154
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,860
This is the publishing house's car.

155
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,040
I borrowed it.

156
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,280
I got kicked out by
my ex-girlfriend three days ago.

157
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,360
What?

158
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,700
Now I am living in my workplace.
It's funny, right?

159
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,480
I planned to get married.

160
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,980
That's really a pity.

161
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,180
Yeah.

162
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,860
Here?

163
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,720
Yes.

164
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,620
Your apartment looks nice.

165
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,400
Did you buy it?

166
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
I bought it while my books sold well.

167
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,200
Really?

168
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,700
Thank you.

169
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,500
Kido.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,060
If you don't mind,
you can stay in my place tonight.

171
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,940
Can I?

172
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,800
Yes. Just see it as a reward for
your driving me back.

173
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,660
Great! I can finally have a shower.

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,880
- Park the car here.
- OK.

175
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,700
Come on in.

176
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,660
Sorry to trouble you.

177
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,460
It is unexpectedly clean inside.

178
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,040
If you are willing to pay the rent,

179
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,300
I'll allow you to stay here.

180
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,540
Really?

181
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,600
I can see you are very busy, so you
may not have time to find a dwelling.

182
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
Yes. This place is not far away
from my workplace.

183
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
It's wonderful!

184
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
This is nostalgic.

("Pornographer: Indigo" by Rio Kijima)

186
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,400
The bathroom is over there.

187
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,380
Sorry. It has been three days
since I showered last time.

188
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,220
My body is quite smelly.

189
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,140
Could I take a shower?

190
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,260
Yes, go ahead.

191
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,400
Then I'll take the liberty.

192
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,860
You can use any of the towels.

193
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,900
Thanks.

194
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,760
OK.

195
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:03,920
I'll take this one.

196
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,020
OK.

197
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,340
Kijima!

198
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,760
Kijima.

199
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,640
What?

200
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,380
Kijima!

201
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,460
Come over.

202
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,540
Hurry!

203
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,260
Kijima!

204
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,820
You are so noisy.

205
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,100
Come here quickly!

206
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,080
What is the matter?

207
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,540
There is no hot water at all.

208
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:43,900
What?

209
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
I forgot.

210
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,920
There is no hot water
for the shower in my place.

211
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,580
Because the water heater is not working.

212
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,260
Then hurry to have it fixed.

213
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,440
Do you know that

214
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,500
the water heater costs a lot?

215
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:58,880
What?

216
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,380
Here is the knack for
showering with the cold water:

217
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,460
Don't wash your body
in an overall manner.

218
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,660
And just wash it part by part.

219
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,400
Then you won't feel so cold.

220
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,860
It's terrible.

221
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,920
I got it.

222
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,060
(Is he so short of money?)

223
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,350
♪Even faded away♪

224
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,890
♪And I will get it today♪

225
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,240
I got my body cleaned somehow.

226
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,460
You can put on that.

227
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,640
Thanks.

228
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,520
Hey.

229
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,840
You'd better pay these bills.

230
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,100
Though I own the apartment,
I still have to pay a lot for it.

231
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,520
For example,
I have to pay the house tax.

232
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,520
You are in debt?

233
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,060
Well,

234
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,340
if I fail to pay the debt,
what will happen?

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,840
You are not writing any book now?

236
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,760
No.

237
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,460
Unbelievable.

238
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,760
I am always quarreling with my editor.

239
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,580
Because we don't see
eye to eye on literature.

240
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,940
Don't do things like Bando.

241
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,460
The sales volume of
my books also declined.

242
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,020
Also, my editor has been
interfering with the contents I write

243
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,280
and making off-topic comments.

244
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,760
Maybe he thinks it is
hard to work with me.

245
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,520
Hey...

246
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,100
What?

247
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,840
How about writing books
for our publishing house?

248
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,780
What do you want me to write?

249
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,060
In my capacity,

250
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,580
I can only suggest
you write the erotica.

251
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,040
You are experienced in writing novels.

252
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,020
- And the novel need not be long.
- Wait...

253
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,900
Wait.

254
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
You want me to write erotica?

255
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,160
Are you insane?

256
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,640
I will never do it.

257
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,460
The erotica can't be
said to be literature.

258
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,060
They are tools.

259
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,400
All things with purposes and functions

260
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,140
are tools.

261
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,820
I

262
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,220
only want to write
real literature works.

263
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,220
I'd rather give up being a writer

264
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
than write that

265
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,880
kind of boring commercial books.

266
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,180
You are right, Mr. Kijima.

267
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,200
I'd like to drink a can of beer.

268
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,560
It is true that the
bad thing about erotica

269
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,780
is that they aim to
arouse people's sexual passion.

270
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,120
But I am your fan.

271
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,820
I think you are talented.

272
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,020
I have read all your books.

273
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,820
Have you?

274
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,460
Yes.

275
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,280
I hope you can continue with writing.

276
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,600
It'll be a great pity
if you stop writing.

277
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,820
How about seeing it as a rest
before you write the serious literature?

278
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,320
- But...
- Let me be straight with you.

279
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,640
You need money right?

280
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,560
These

281
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,940
are all your debts, right?

282
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,570
Though they are not in large sums,

283
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,640
if you don't pay them off,
you'll get into great trouble later.

284
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,060
I don't know what to do.

285
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,280
I don't know...

286
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,620
I don't know what to
do in the coming days.

287
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,540
(I...)

288
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,960
(I suddenly felt an impulse
to take him down with me.)

289
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,860
It will be fine for you to do it.

290
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,820
If you worry that it will
make your personal record look bad,

291
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,260
you can use a pseudonym.

292
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,660
Just give it a try.

293
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,840
I'll buy the water heater.

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,460
