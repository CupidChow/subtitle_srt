00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,540
(Belmont Hotel)

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,040
Listen!

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,180
My dad said that

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,560
he came to have a new appraisal of you.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,440
Really?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
I am happy about that, too.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
I used to think you would
not quit the job for me.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,720
Right.

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,920
Let's be happy together.

10
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:29,840
=Pornographer: Indigo=

11
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,180
It's all right.

12
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,210
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks.

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,640
=Episode 4 The Thing Called Love=

14
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,680
Thank you.

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,560
You are working very hard.

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,640
It is your work?

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,120
I thought it is Mr. Gamoda's work.

18
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,220
You overreacted.

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,240
I just finished one work.

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,960
("Sweet Play")

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,840
It is worth celebrating.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,520
For you, this is your first erotica.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,860
Let's have a proper celebration today.

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,300
Join in the celebration, Kido.

25
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,840
OK. I'll drink.

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,760
Good.

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,220
Have another cup.

28
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,680
This book is very interesting.

29
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,000
- Is it?
- I'm flattered.

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,820
It is not easy for you to
finish a book in such a short time.

31
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,380
I should thank you, Mr. Gamoda.

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,040
(This is the first time
for me to see Kijima)

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,000
(since that night.)

34
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,020
Hey, Kido.

35
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,100
Kido.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,240
I want to write on the
belly band of this book.

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,980
What do you think of that?

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
OK.

39
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,140
I will entrust Mr. Matsumoto
with the illustration.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,560
Though he may be very busy these days,

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
he will do me a favor
and won't turn me down.

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,720
I will bring up this
in the editing meeting.

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,550
OK.

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,780
Mr. Gamoda.

45
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,260
What would you like?

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,180
I'd like the food I usually eat.

47
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,540
Then I'll tell Mrs. Sato
to make them for you.

48
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,420
Thank you.

49
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,560
I'll dig in.

50
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,920
Eat more and drink more.

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,300
Mr. Gamoda, what do you usually eat?

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,080
Recently, my stomach
has been in bad conditions.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,700
I usually drink the vegetable juice
made by the maid in the evening.

54
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,560
It is very healthy.

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,320
Mrs. Sato, I am here to
fetch the vegetable juice.

56
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,000
It is in the refrigerator.
Please get it.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,780
Got it.

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,260
Rio…

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,460
He is really helping me
a lot staying by my side.

60
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,540
He is sharp-witted.

61
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,040
Though he is young, he has
the temperament of an old man.

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,460
We hit it off.

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,000
I see.

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,340
I didn't want to have a man
as my disciple at first.

65
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,240
If he were a woman,

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,280
I would be eager to hit on him.

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,960
Based on my health,
it is good that he is a man.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,800
(This old man doesn't
seem to be seriously ill.)

69
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,520
Sorry to have troubled you.

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,980
What did you chat about?

71
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,480
We talked about you.

72
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,120
What?

73
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,000
If you were a woman,
I would make you my lover.

74
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,740
What nonsense!

75
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,800
Please give me a break.

76
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,700
I have the right to choose
whom to love, right?

77
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,830
Yes, you do.

78
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,460
Well.

79
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's take the chance to
decide on your pen name.

80
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,220
Rio Kijima sounds too gentle.

81
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
Does it?

82
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,240
Let's give you a powerful name.

83
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,320
Also, it should have the erotic element.

84
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,480
How about this one?

85
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,800
Your surname will be Kijima.
[*meaning ghost island]

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,300
And your given name will be Renjiro.

87
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,560
Ghost?

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,540
Kido, how do you like this name?

89
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,740
It is quite unusual.

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,820
Hey, you two.

91
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,040
One's name is very important.

92
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,080
Well. Well.

93
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,360
I'll ask for the diviner's opinion.

94
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,620
I can't wait.

95
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,620
It will be quicker for me
to call the diviner.

96
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,020
Mr. Gamoda, are you all right?

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,320
Mr. Gamoda! Mr. Gamoda!

98
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,700
Are you fine, Mr. Gamoda?

99
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,060
I got too excited.

100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,480
Kido, sorry.

101
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,320
Just go help yourself to the food.

102
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,300
You can drink up the wine.

103
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,560
OK.

104
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:10,820
Let's go have a rest.

105
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,580
Kido.

106
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,820
Come with me.

107
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,280
You,

108
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,220
you just tamed the difficult old man.

109
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,520
Well,

110
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,640
have you slept with him?

111
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,460
Rubbish!

112
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,920
I respect Mr. Gamoda
from the bottom of my heart.

113
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,400
But…

114
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,160
I gave myself the anal sex

115
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,440
while thinking of you.

116
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,400
Really?

117
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,100
So,

118
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,540
it has been expanded enough.

119
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,280
(I myself thought I was a jerk)

120
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,500
(doing that to him at that time.)

121
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,340
(Let's be happy together.)

122
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,300
(I was thinking about
my girlfriend at that time.)

123
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,960
Rio, where are you?

124
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,400
Rio!

125
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,620
Rio!

126
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,120
Where are you?

127
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,560
Mr. Gamoda! Mr. Gamoda…

128
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,560
Rio, where are you?

129
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,540
Rio, Mr. Gamoda…

130
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,380
Mr. Gamoda!

131
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,340
Mr. Gamoda!

132
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,300
Mr. Gamoda!

133
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,680
Mr. Gamoda!

134
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,380
Mr. Gamoda!

135
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,060
Mr. Gamoda! Wake up!

136
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,180
Mrs. Sato, call the ambulance!

137
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,320
Mr. Gamoda!

138
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,740
Mr. Gamoda!

139
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,020
I am Rio.

140
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,380
Mr. Gamoda! Mr. Gamoda!

141
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,400
(Mr. Gamoda spat blood and fell down.)

142
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,360
(Then he was admitted to the hospital.)

143
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,500
(Kijima attended to him
in the hospital every day.)

144
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:00,260
(Though I wanted to ask
how Mr. Gamoda progressed in writing…)

145
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,040
Mr. Gamoda.

146
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,100
You mustn't tire yourself too much now.

147
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,180
I am in good spirits today.

148
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,680
I will take the chance to write more.

149
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,000
You should heed people's advice.

150
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,340
Rio.

151
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,620
Yes.

152
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,720
I have something to tell you.

153
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,720
You need not look after me like this.

154
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,200
For me, you are not a family member.

155
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,160
We have no blood ties.

156
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,880
Am I bothering you?

157
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,020
From now on,
my illness will deteriorate.

158
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,160
Taking care of a patient
is harder than you can imagine.

159
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,620
Though we didn't
know each other for long,

160
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,580
for me,

161
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,440
you are a lovely disciple.

162
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,420
I don't want to trouble you.

163
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,540
Maybe

164
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,320
I am doing this for my own sake.

165
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,460
For your sake?

166
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,080
My father died of illness.

167
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
But I didn't take care of
him before he passed away

168
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,980
because I was angry with him.

169
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,760
So,

170
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
taking care of you now

171
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:12,620
is a kind of redemption for me.

172
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,100
Rio.

173
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,520
I don't think it is a
burden to take care of you.

174
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,260
I am doing this to
make myself feel better.

175
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,160
Besides, I still have a lot

176
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,560
to learn from you.

177
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,140
Thank you, Rio.

178
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,480
Thank you.

179
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,980
Thank you.

180
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,840
Thank you.

181
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,140
Thank you.

182
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,120
Thank you.

183
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,860
Thank you.

184
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,180
Thank you.

185
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,860
Thank you.

186
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,480
Hello.

187
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,080
Please.

188
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,360
OK.

189
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,640
Kido.

190
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,240
Someone is waiting for you in the lobby.

191
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,500
I'll be right there.

192
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,560
Please.

193
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,340
(One thing led to another.)

194
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,000
(Rio's first book is to be published.)

195
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:54,900
Hey.

196
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,520
Kijima.

197
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,840
It has been long since
the last offprint meeting.

198
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,120
Yes.

199
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,240
This way.

200
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,580
Well, about your pen name,

201
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,460
our publishing house still thinks

202
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,380
Rio Kijima is better.

203
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,220
Really?

204
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,000
But this work of yours is totally
different from your previous ones.

205
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,940
So I want to listen to your opinion.

206
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,660
Could you allow me to think about it?

207
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,380
Of course. Just take your time.

208
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,780
Mr. Kijima.

209
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,400
Ah, we are so honored
to cooperate with you.

210
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,240
You often appeared on TV.

211
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,020
So I recognized you at first sight.

212
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,620
This is the director
of our publishing house.

213
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,860
So glad to meet you.

214
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,000
I am…

215
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,820
I am…business card.

216
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,980
I am…

217
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,780
I am Mizutani.

218
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,920
Nice to meet you.

219
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,340
Nice to meet you, too.

220
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,720
Let's go.

221
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,220
Mr. Kijima, your hand
is cold. Are you fine?

222
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,600
Is it cold?

223
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,580
He asked you to deal with Mr. Gamoda.

224
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,020
I knew what Mr. Gamoda is like.

225
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,620
For social practice,

226
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,680
I ever worked with Mr. Gamoda.

227
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,560
It was not easy work.

228
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,220
Though he wrote good books,

229
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,280
he was difficult to get along with.

230
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,380
Yes.

231
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,940
Though he is ill and
soft with people now,

232
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,480
he is still a troublesome old man.

233
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,960
Right.

234
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
OK. Let's change the topic.

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,740
We feel very honored

236
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,300
to publish your book this time.

237
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,380
Well, I feel honored
to cooperate with you.

238
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,940
Please support us.

239
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,780
But, it's a pity that

240
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,040
Kido can't be your editor in the future.

241
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,200
Kido is going to…

242
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,380
Excuse me.

243
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,700
What do you mean by saying that?

244
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,000
What?

245
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,960
He didn't tell you?

246
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,840
How come?

247
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,240
Kido,

248
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
we promised to transfer
Kido to our sister company

249
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,260
if he could get the publication right
of Mr. Gamoda's posthumous book.

250
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,820
You will quit this job?

251
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,120
Yes.

252
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,860
Poor Kido. Her girlfriend's parents
oppose their marriage

253
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,580
because our publishing house published

254
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,500
many books that are
considered to be indecent.

255
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,820
Girlfriend?

256
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,760
How is it going?

257
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,300
When will you hold the wedding ceremony?

258
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,420
I will send you the
congratulatory message.

259
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,100
Remember to inform me of it.

260
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,640
I will.

261
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,140
The congratulatory message.

262
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,240
I'll leave the rest to you.

263
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,580
Thank you for your hard work.

264
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,980
Kijima.

265
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,700

Did you do all these for getting married?

279
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,760
(Don't think that everyone
can live as you do.)

280
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,760
I entrust you with him.

281
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,520
And they will never come back again.
