1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,580
Shizuko.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,820
Don't stare at me like that.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,980
It makes me shy.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,720
Can I have you?

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,780
I am willing to give all of me to you.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,860
Shizuko.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,040
Shizuko.

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,560
I love you.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,400
Dear Toshio.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,320
I feel so good.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,820
Toshio.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,860
(Their love that is as sweet as honey)

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,780
(melted into the
dark night of the city.)

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,720
(They fell into the
tender and sweet trap.)

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,480
Um.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,660
How do you like it?

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,520
That is the end?

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,280
Yeah.

19
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,400
Well, tell me.

20
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,400
Can you ejaculate reading this?

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,920
Maybe not.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
Then it is not OK.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,740
I mean...

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,700
it is good writing in general.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,560
You are really good at writing.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,220
However,

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,820
you wrote too much about
what happened before they had sex.

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,960
And you only described their intercourse
in the last 10 pages, which worried me.

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,720
I had to because
Shizuko is not frivolous.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,040
Then change her identity
to a lascivious maid.

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,100
Write more about sex scenes.

32
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,140
All right.

33
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,580
Also, you described sex too implicitly.

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,980
Readers can finally read the sex stuff.

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,160
But there are only five lines about it.

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,780
Need there be so many sex contents?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,240
Of course. It's like
the chorus of a song.

38
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,320
It's difficult to write that.

39
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,440
Well, have you read
the novels I recommended?

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,200
Yes. But it was hard for me.

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,660
Because there is
too much description of sex.

42
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,300
But I quite like some of them.

43
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,260
I like the books of
this writer especially.

44
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,180
As expected.

45
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,060
This is the first time that I have
come to know the fun of erotica.

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,240
And I was excited by them.

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,680
This writer is special.

48
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,380
He is a master.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,340
I was too arrogant to
say the erotica is a tool.

50
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,580
Now I don't think it is
easy to write erotica.

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,360
In a word, you need to

52
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,440
increase the eroticism in
proportion to the story

53
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,980
and write more about sex scenes.

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,020
OK.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,420
I'll try harder.

56
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,390

- Kido.
- Yes.

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,680
From today onward,
you'll work with Mr. Gamoda.

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,200
Me?

63
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,420
Go secure the contract with
Mr. Gamoda about his posthumous work.

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,700
Posthumous work?

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,020
Wait. He is still alive, right?

66
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,980
He called it posthumous work himself.

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,540
He said the next book
would be his posthumous work.

68
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,980
Are his days numbered?

69
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,400
Maybe his third surgery
didn't go very smoothly.

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,100
(But many big publishing houses
will scramble for his last work, right?)

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,580
(We have been cooperating with
him for the longest time.)

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,520
(Gamoda 3-1)
I think there is hope for us to succeed.

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,080
Anyway, you must convince him.

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,740
(It's really a tough job.)

75
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,100
- Have some tea, please.
- Thank you.

76
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,320
- Make a cup of tea for me, too.
- Yes.

77
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,940
Mr. Gamoda.

78
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,200
Thank you for sparing time to see me.

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,600
I think I have played
mahjong with you once.

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,700
With Sudo of Tosui Publishing House.

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Yes, right.

82
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,420
Mr. Gamoda.

83
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,300
How is your health?

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,540
How can it be good?

85
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,720
Right.

86
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,400
I can't eat what I like.

87
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,240
I am not allowed to sleep with women.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,280
I am supposed to rest in peace early.

89
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,500
But my brain is still
functioning effectively.

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,300
So in the end,

91
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,500
I want to write a book
that satisfies me.

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,360
Excuse me.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,760
Please.

94
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,660
By the way, just before you came,

95
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,360
the staff of Shunjio
Publishing House also came.

96
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,660
I am back.

97
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,420
I am back.

98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,400
You came back so late.

99
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,920
You also drank a lot today.

100
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,940
You should drink some now and then.

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
I am not allowed to do that like you.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,340
You need not go to work tomorrow, right?

103
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,280
(Invitation to Kijima)
That is the invitation telling me

104
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,300
to attend the 1st anniversary
of my father's death.

105
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,520
The date indicated on it is today.

106
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,380
You didn't go?

107
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,120
I won't go.

108
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,500
I didn't even attend his funeral.

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,760
Really? Why?

110
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,400
Reading books will make a person a fool.

111
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,200
What?

112
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,920
This is my father's pet phrase.

113
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,020
Why did he say that?

114
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,640
My father has an elder brother.

115
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,240
His brother got admitted to
a university of Tokyo.

116
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,740
But he devoted himself to the
students' movement and got arrested.

117
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,840
He caused a lot of
trouble to the family.

118
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,760
Since then, my father
has been afraid of knowledge.

119
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,660
He is puerile, right?

120
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,480
This means that

121
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,180
he and I never saw eye to eye.

122
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,180
No matter what award I got

123
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,000
and how much money I made,

124
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,300
he...

125
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,700
he has never praised me.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,760
He has been too harsh on me, right?

127
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,640
But,

128
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,240
he is still your father.

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,880
Yes, I can't deny that.

130
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,240
Maybe I should go to
see him for the last time.

131
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,840
But I don't have the face to see him

132
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,160
being a life's loser.

133
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,060
Maybe he was right about me.

134
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,660
Because I'm a fool

135
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,700
after all.

136
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:14,800
Kijima.

137
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,100
Inform me before you throw up!

138
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,020
Hey! Wait. Wait.

139
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,000
Go to throw up in the
bath room, all right?

140
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,700
Are you fine?

141
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,220
Want some water?

142
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,740
Kido.

143
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,980
Sorry that

144
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,980
I didn't go.

145
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,040
Sorry.

146
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,420
Sorry.

147
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,240
Sorry.

148
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,220
Time to get up.

149
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,580
I feel terrible.

150
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,080
Did you make this?

151
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,340
Yes.

152
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,400
Drink it.

153
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,100
Thank you.

154
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,900
Well...

155
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,600
I...

156
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,700
What have I done?

157
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,180
Your vomit was all over my suit.

158
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,560
Don't worry. I won't ask you
to pay the laundry fee.

159
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,900
But...

160
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,040
But what?

161
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,020
From tomorrow onward,
you can't drink again.

162
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,660
If you dare drink another drop of
alcohol, I'll sever ties with you.

163
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,740
OK.

164
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,020
Nowadays,

165
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,020
a writer without a
single success is not popular.

166
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,100
You'll die lonely going on like this.

167
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,700
So eat well, sleep well
and write good books.

168
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,760
You don't want to
end up like this, right?

169
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,880
Kido.

170
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,100
Sir.

171
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,990
Why are you in low spirits?

172
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,040
I am?

173
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,660
I heard you were dumped
and kicked out by your girlfriend.

174
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,140
How come even you know this?

175
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,960
Her father is old-fashioned and
doesn't like me being an erotica editor.

176
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,920
So that's what it is.

177
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,000
(Smoking Room)
Are you still in love with that girl?

178
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,440
I will be lying if I say no.

179
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I think I should settle down.

180
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,060
How about changing your job?

181
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,700
Are you in a position to
say this as the director?

182
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,360
Do you know Kyoden Publishing House?

183
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,160
It is a major publishing
house publishing practical books.

184
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,860
It is owned by one of my relatives.
I can recommend you.

185
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,220
Really?

186
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,160
But

187
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,560
you have to get the
manuscript of Mr. Gamoda first.

188
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:09,280
My father, no, our president
is looking forward to it.

189
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,760
Sir, you need to come.

190
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,440
I am coming.

191
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,240
Kyoden Publishing House is very good.

192
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,060
Not like ours, it is a
decent publishing house.

193
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,360
Just think about it.

194
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,000
Coming. Coming.

195
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,520
(I have no negative feelings
about this job.)

196
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,460
(I am proud of it.)

197
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,540
Kido, I heard that you work
in the publishing house.

198
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,380
But all the works you
published are obscene, right?

199
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:45,980
Yes.

200
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,160
In the future, how will you
explain your job to your children?

201
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,820
Well...

202
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,440
Just change your job to a decent one.

203
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,820
OK.

204
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,540
(If you ask me whether
I am still willing to do this job)

205
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,900
(when being looked down upon)

206
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,640
(or discriminated against,)

207
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,100
I must say I don't know.

208
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,220
(Company Profile)
(The Kyoden Publishing House)

209
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,660
(Company Profile)
(offers a much better pay.)

210
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,880
(This is a rare chance.)

211
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,140
Kido.

212
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,260
Mr. Gamoda is giving you a call.

213
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,000
You have been put through. I am Kido.

214
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,800
Little Kido.

215
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,860
I am sorry. I am planning
to contact you.

216
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,560
I am calling to give you the reply.

217
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,340
I decided to cooperate with
another publishing house.

218
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,000
Sorry for turning you down.

219
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,560
(This is bad news. This sucks.)

220
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,500
Could you please think twice about it?

221
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,840
For me,

222
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,140
there is no reason to
choose your publishing house.

223
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,040
(The reason for choosing
our publishing house...)

224
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,120
(Let me think about it.)

225
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,120
(What reason...)

226
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:23,350
("Pornographer: Indigo" by Rio Kijima)

227
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,360
It is unbelievable.

228
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
You promised to let me be his disciple.

229
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
How could you decide
on this without my consent?

230
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,440
I could only think
of this way back then.

231
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,180
- But...
- I beg you.

232
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,880
It might be the last book of Mr. Gamoda.

233
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,340
You like the books
written by him, right?

234
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,300
That's right...

235
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,220
It is not a completely
bad thing for you.

236
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,220
You see, you might be able to get
some hints from him on your writing.

237
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,500
I,

238
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,620
I want to land this job very much.

239
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,180
I want to be the person
who will release this book.

240
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,180
Kijima.

241
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,940
I can only count on you.

242
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,080
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

243
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,500
Sorry to disturb you,

244
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,940
Mr. Gamoda.

245
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,720
Thank you a lot.

246
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,700
Sorry to ask you to come suddenly.

247
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,330
It's our pleasure.

248
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,660
You need not bother about that.

249
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,080
Let me do it.

250
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,980
Who is him?

251
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,820
He is the Kijima I mentioned to you
earlier. He wants to be your disciple.

252
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,240
I am Rio Kijima.

253
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,520
You deceived me.

254
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,900
How come my future disciple is a man?

255
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,720
Tell me.

256
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,340
Isn't Rio usually a girl's name?

257
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,500
That is not always the case.

258
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,860
I thought that an erotica writer

259
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,200
must be a sexy woman.

260
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,880
Why did he get such a confusing name?

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,360
I don't want any man as a disciple now.

262
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,930
Please give me a break.

263
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,540
It spoiled my good mood.

264
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,480
Hurry to bugger off.

265
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,320
I am really sorry.

266
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,280
- Get out of my face!
- Please...

267
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,600
Shut up! Get lost!

268
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:03,940
Let's go.

269
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,560
Mr. Gamoda.

270
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,000
What?

271
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,400
I am sorry to have
caused you misunderstanding.

272
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,080
And it is a pity that I am a man.

273
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,680
But my body is healthy
and my brain is good.

274
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,080
Besides, I am facing
the bottleneck in my writing.

275
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,860
I want to stay by your side
and learn from you.

276
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,920
Could you please
let me be your assistant?

277
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,700
Kijima.

278
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,100
I am willing to do anything for you.

279
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,880
I implore you.

280
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,420
You will do anything?

281
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,740
Yes.

282
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,940
Then...

283
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,620
could you suck his dick?

284
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,530
What?

285
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,120
You are willing to do anything, right?

286
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,330
You won't do it?

287
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,480
Mr. Gamoda, this...

288
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
If you make him ejaculate,

289
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,000
I will allow him to
publish my posthumous book.

290
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,220
You...

291
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,280
You look sexy for unknown reasons.

292
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,720
I said just now that

293
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:37,260
I don't want a man
to be my disciple at all.

294
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,840
So you should try being a woman.

295
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,980
Mr. Gamoda, this is really improper.

296
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,840
I will do it.

297
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,260
What are you thinking?

298
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,580
You want this job desperately, right?

299
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,360
This is not a big deal.

300
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,700
No way.

301
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,220
I don't mind at all.
