I'm the director, Miki. I'll be in your care until the end of filming.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,760
It's been about ten months?
[We're filming in the same location as last time]

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,890
First, I ran up a slope, like in "Full Effort Slope".
(T/N: A Japanese show, where talents run up various slopes)

Isn't that weird?
[Reviewing Toujou-like gestures]

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,830
A little. The hand position's a bit...

00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,820
Put that there,

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,200
and enter the scene like this.
[As a result, he won't wear his jacket]

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,220
And like this.
[As a result, he won't wear his jacket]

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,720

Thank you.

30
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,930
Just like last season,
[Upon finishing the first day of filming]

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,180
"Toujou" is characterized by his bag-holding posture.

32
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,200
When I watched the last season,

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,070
my hair was brighter.

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,160
I stood out like crazy,

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,210
especially in school scenes.

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,060
Among all the black hair, there was one blonde.

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,770
It is a comedic drama, after all.

38
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,660
If you watch and think about how

39
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,940
"Toujou's the only one that stands out,"

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,730
while laughing along, I'd be glad.

Thank you!
[Yamazaki: "Thank you❤︎"]

50
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,850
This is my first time acting.
[Upon finishing the first day of filming]

51
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,870
It's my first time on a set,
[Idegami Baku, as "Yamazaki"]

52
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,690
and everyone is a new face.

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,850
Everything was a first,

54
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,550
but it all felt fresh

55
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,380
and was very fun.

56
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,210
I'm not usually like "this".

57
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,130
I like to think I understand the type of girls that guys like.

58
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,950
So I put my all

59
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,280
into being a "girl guys like," when playing Yamazaki.

60

Today was the first day I was on set.
[Upon finishing the first day of filming]

Though I was a bit nervous,
[Shuzo Ohira, as "Kakei"]

62
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,340
I wish to create a great show

64

than I could ever imagine.

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,600

Good work!

85
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,370
It's been ten? Nine months? Since the last season.
[Upon finishing the first day of filming]

86
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,810
I'd say it was most difficult
[Atsuhiro Inukai, as Side Character ("Mob")]

87
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,130
deciding how far the characters should go.

88
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,460
If they end up together, then it destroys the very title of this series.

89
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,480
I think season two begins

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,490
in a way that was "as expected".

91
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,420
Chronologically, it's interesting to see

92
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,100
how this isn't the aftermath of the previous season, but a new beginning.

93

[The two keep their acting very real, as the scene ends]

96
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,120

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,140
with a guy.
[Asahi Itou, as "Kikuchi"]

98
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,840
I was on the receiving end of Izuka,

99
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,510
who I met for the first time. I just left it to him,

100
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,170
and accepted my fate as the one being kissed.

101
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,150
Kikuchi travels to many places

102
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,620
through flashbacks,
[Watches over Mob and the maid talking]

103
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,090
and there are scenes where he looks at Mob from afar.
[Watches over Mob and the maid talking]

104
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,270
I want to take that all in, so it acts as a bridge

105
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,700
to the finale...

106
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,300
the airport scene.

107
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,780
For now, I'm glad the filming ended well.

108
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,300
I had watched season one,
[Upon finishing the first day of filming]

109
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,400
and this rooftop scene left an impression on me.
[Kenta Izuka, as "Igarashi"]

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,830
First, I realized, "Oh, I'm going to intrude in that."

111
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,100
I was shocked, but also happy to hear it.

112
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,150
This is the beginning of the story,

113
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,380
so it's an important scene. My role was to return Mob,

114
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,210
to being someone in a mob.

115
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,480
I did my best

116
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,750
to fulfill that role.

117
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,640
He's a key character,

118
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,140
so I hope he accentuates the story,

119
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,860
though it's far from over.

120
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,620
I hope to do my best.

121

it seemed natural

150
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,960
that his father would be a vet.

I'm really excited for season two to begin. It's really happening. I'm really hyped.

155

but you're much better for him.
[is one with Igarashi and Mob]

317
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:01,980
Narita. His flight leaves at 4:00 p.
[Soon as it was, this wraps up Igarashi's filming]

318
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,000
Though he first appears like a protagonist,
[A brief word, post-filming]

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,750
he ultimately plays cupid.
[Kenta Izuka, as "Igarashi"]

320
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,400
At least, that's what I thought

321
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,440
as filming came to a close.

322
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,250
I'm excited to see the end result.

323
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,170
Though he looks flippant,

324
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,860
his heart remains pure, as the white rose.

325
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,880
That's the role I was given.

326
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,490
So no matter how he looks,

327
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,410
I feel I needed to convey

328
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,250
his heart's purity through my acting.

329
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,940
I kept this very carefully in mind.

330
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,110
[Filming: Day Six]
[Filming at the university once more]

331
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,700
First, hold out your hand.
[Misaki, who appears in season one]

332
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,140
Then grip it.
[has a new partner!]

333
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,610
Gaze at one another.
[Fuma Sadamoto, as "Misaki"]

334
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,520
And walk off.
[Yuuki Hirai, as "Izumi"]

335
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,140
No,

336
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,780
that's no good.

337
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,590
It's wrong. Once you hold hands, you need to be mesmerized.
[To further improve the hand holding scene,]

338
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,490
Once you grab your things, it becomes "reality".
[he's told in detail when to grab his belongings.]

339
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,590
Get it afterwards.
[he's told in detail when to grab his belongings.]

340
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,910
Afterwards?
[he's told in detail when to grab his belongings]

341
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,260
You can get it after you hold hands.

342
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:14,470
[After given instructions, they try one more time]

343
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,870
Let's lose this.
[This time, they get rid of the scarf]

344
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:24,630
[And one more time]

345
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,360
[Their movements became smoother]

346
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,990
Now it's complete.

347
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,610
Looks good, yes.

348
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,560
I hear they have really pretty flowers.
[Filming a take]

349
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,100
You really do love flowers, don't you?

350
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,110
I guess so.

351
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,560
Then...

352
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,300
let's go.

353
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,210
And cut!

354
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,080
- Cut!
- Looks good.

355
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,850
[This is the last scene for both of them]

356
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,400
[As custom, the two of them ad lib,]

357
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,300
[and walk happily away]

358
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,890
Cut.

359
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,800
Good work to Fuma Sadamoto, who played Misaki.
[And that's a wrap for both of them!]

360
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,660
Thank you very much.

361
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,470
Good work.

362
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,810
And good work to Yuuki Hirai,

363
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,990
- who played Izumi.
- Thank you very much.

364
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,150
- Here you go, well done.
- Thank you.

365
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,750
Good work.

366
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,610
Thank you for calling me back, after season one.
[A brief word, post-filming]

367
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,910
Yes, I never thought
[Fuma Sadamoto, as "Misaki"]

368
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,340
there'd be a new boyfriend.
[Yuuki Hirai, as "Izumi"]

369
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,130
I'm sure everyone will be equally as shocked,

370
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,580
but Misaki is as lively as ever.

371
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,190
I hope everyone looks forward

372
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,010
to the finished result. Thank you.

373
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,280
It was my first time acting for TV, so I was nervous.

374
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,220
However, we were already aquaintances,

375
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,530
so I felt I had a reliable companion,

376
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,010
and he helped me lots.

377
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,760
I think a wonderful show has been created.

378
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,490
I hope you look forward to it. Thank you very much.

379
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,910
Gaze at each other,

380
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,820
pause, and then hand on the shoulder.

381
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,540
[Next up is scene for a new couple]
[Tsubasa Takizawa, as "Yukawa"]

382
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,570
[As always, a thorough explanation of the scene is given]
[Masashi Ikeda, as "Suzuno"]

383
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,120
Understood.

384
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,940
If they're not in sync, the timing...

385
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,810
When you hold hands,

386
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,190
look down.

387
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,250
Then, you meet eyes again.

388
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,620
Exactly.

389
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,050
[Filming a take]

390
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,770
Of course you can...

391

Rin.

392
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,230
Don't tease me like that...

393
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,460
Looks good.

394

[The two are relieved upon hearing the "Okay"]

[And that's a wrap for both of them!]

397
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,680
- For you.
- Woah!

398
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,370
- It's huge!
- It's brandy.

399
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,040
- Brandy?!
- Of course not.

400
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,620
Brandy... Thank you!

401
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,980
That's a wrap

402

- for Masahi Ikeda!
- Thank you very much.

Thank you very much.

407
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,730
I'd actually be in my first year of university,
[A brief word, post-filming]

408
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,560
but I'm not a student. So being able to act
[Tsubasa Takizawa from Enjin, as "Yukawa"]

409
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,440
as a student, in such a new place,

410
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,160
makes me realize I came across a wonderful series.

411
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,210
It was really fun. Though our time was short, I thank everyone.

412
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,610
Thank you.

413
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,100
I'm also a university student,
[Masashi Ikeda, as "Suzuno"]

414
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,950
so I'm used to this setting,

415
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,790
and it felt familiar. But through this BL role,

416
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,510
it was given a new spin, and I had fun.

417

- Break up with her!
- You just say whatever the hell you want?!

I'm glad I was invited back after season one.
[A brief word, post-filming]

428
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm sure filming will continue,

(T/N: the act of slamming another person against a wall)

It's a first for me. I'll do my best.

434
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,440
Yes, and then

435
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,170
have a moment of surprise, gaze at each other,

436
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,790
and then say your line, when you think he's beautiful.

and then do this.

441
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,530
He'll throw himself on the wall for you.

442

In that case...

443
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,240
What if...

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,980
I was a flirty guy?

and then...

447
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,210
I think...

448
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,930
that would be okay.

449
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,320
Right?

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,590
will change day-of.

632

so I'll bring it to 100% tomorrow,

when we film the dance.

[Afterwards, filming with Mob and Kikuchi continues]

[That's a wrap for Kikuchi]

639
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,370
It ended in the blink of an eye. This season
[A brief word, post-filming]

640
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,560
has a number of scenes, where Kikuchi's watching everything.
[Asahi Itou, as "Kikuchi"]

641
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,290
I was glad I could spend

642
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,360
a lot of time with the staff and cast.

643
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,950
Personally, I feel like the level of difficulty
[A word regarding the opening dance number]

644
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,980
has increased.

645
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,320
I was shown a video of the dance.

646
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,060
If I don't practice hard,

647
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,040
the others will leave me behind.

648
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,400

653

It's nice that
[A brief word, post-filming]

654
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,790
the acting portion's done, but there's still
[Atsuhiro Inukai, as Side Character ("Mob")]

655
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,710
some hurdles to cross.

656
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,830
I'm currently pondering how to go about that.

657

The dance number,
[What are these hurdles?]

and dubbing.

659
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,770
I have to recall

660
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,670
how I felt while I was acting,

661
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,710
when recording the dub.

662
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,080
That's the most difficult part.

663
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,700
[The morning of the final day, begins with dance practice]
[Filming: Last Day]

[Though everyone practiced on their own,]

And so, these two happily reconciled.
[In the afternoon, Mob's narrations are filmed]

669
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,890
They became even more lovey-dovey.

[Not only was the dance number filmed this day,]

672

Yes, sir!

674
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,890
I was too late.
[Next, Inukai records the monologues,]
