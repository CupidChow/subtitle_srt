00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,110
That must mean...

31
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,030
she isn't really a girl.

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,110
I'll take one.

33
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,860
Thanks!

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,820
It's a boy.

H-Hold on there!

36

I'm sorry, but you're so cute!

37
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,730
It probably sounds strange for me to say

38
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,830
but my theory is that girls exist only in the periphery of this world.

39
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,580
So if you see a stunningly pretty girl,

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,410
it's usually a man.

41

You're the cutest girl in the whole country!

And so, the fights that arise in this world of BL

177
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,950
are usually "lovers quarrels".

[VS Lovers' Quarrels]

180

He's in a lovers' quarrel too, I'm sure of it.

181
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,960
What's Toma's deal?

182
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,500
He was so nice,

183
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,310
and he suddenly got cold with me.

184
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,320
With this, you've captured me by my stomach.

185

Well...

186
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,770

But... why?

189
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,270
Why did Toma go cold all of a sudden?

190
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,610
I'm sorry!

191

Hey, you're late!

That looks good!

I had some.

194
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,100
It was super good.

And then...

198
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,230
- it was super cheap, too.
- Oh!

199
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,510
Did he find out I went to the movies with Katsumi?

200
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,910
No, we both just happened to want to see the same movie... Oh!

201
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,520
What about when we went to the planetarium together?

202
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,030
No, we just both happened to like stars!

203
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,920
Maybe he knows we went camping together the other day?

204

No, no, no!

205
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,920
It was just a coincidence we both like the outdoors!

206

Aren't there too many coincidences here?

No, Katsumi and I aren't like that.

It's a friendship that goes beyond a normal dude.

I'm the student council president,

so I have to bring everyone together.

310
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,310
But I never thought

311
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,400
that Hiroya, the vice president, would profess his love for me.

312
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,730
But that's because...

313
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,780
there was a weak spot somewhere inside of me,

314
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,740
so I just couldn't tell you—

315
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,780
Don't say anymore.

316
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,760
Ayato...

317
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,050
It's fine.

319
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,600
I was at fault, too.

320
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,040
There's nothing you need to apologize for.

321
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,250
You're the one that doesn't need to apologize.

322
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,110
No... I'm really sorry.

323
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,470
Then...

324
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,210
- Come on!
- Why not?!

325
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,090
It's fine!

326
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,840

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,430
Come on!

328
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,330
And so, these two happily reconciled.

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,450

♫ Don't leave me, I knew you would ♫

342
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,820
♫ Teach me how to resist you ♫

♫ It pops into thin air ♫

353
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,530
♫ What's left in my hand that should have held on ♫

354
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,650
♫ Are droplets of you ♫

355
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,510
♫ Just like "Bubble Love" ♫
