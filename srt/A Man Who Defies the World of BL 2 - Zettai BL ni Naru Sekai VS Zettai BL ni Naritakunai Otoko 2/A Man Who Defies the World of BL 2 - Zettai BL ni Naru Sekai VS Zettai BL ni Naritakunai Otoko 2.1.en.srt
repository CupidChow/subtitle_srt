But it's not just an ordinary manga.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,790
I'm in a "Boys Love" manga.

5

6

You're the only one for me!

This proves it!

Even when I try to open the biggest chapter of my life,

50

my side-character status is impenetrable!

51

Rika, Rika, Rika!

That guy's name is Morikawa.

173
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,270
From "Morikawa" to "Rika"...

174
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,710
Isn't that a little too forced?

175
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,710
Oh! For the party tomorrow,

176
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,640
can I invite my friend Misaki?

177
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,820
What's he like?

178
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,930
Kind of an airhead, really cute.

179
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,000
He's like a therapy dog!

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,890
- That's perfect!
- Nice!

181
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,430
I can't wait!

182
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,900
And this is Misaki.

183
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,700
You might think it's a girl's name

184
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,650
but there are tons of examples of it being a man's surname.

185
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,920
Sorry! Were you waiting long?

186
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,830
Izumi?

187
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,000
And his last name is Izumi.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,480
Not at all.

189
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,000
Yellow!

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,010
They're not sunflowers...

191
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,750
It's not lavender...

192
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,280
That's it! They're marigolds!

193
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,170
So?

194
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,440
Where are we going today?

195
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,930
Why don't we go to the park in the next town over?

196
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,870
I hear they have really pretty flowers.

197
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,500
You really do love flowers, don't you?

198
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,360
I guess so.

199
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,890
Then...

200
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,420
let's go.

201
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,020
It's so cold today!

202
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,870
And so, the couple that loves flowers above all else,

203
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,920
enjoys the flowers of this world to their heart's content.

204
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,990
Just then...

205
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,720
Hey!

206
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,550
That guy is Mayumi.

207
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,360
His last name is Mayumi.

208
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,950
What the heck is going on in this world?

209
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,820
Can I give you a nickname?

210
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,170
What?

211
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,470
If we have nicknames for each other,

212
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,040
we'll feel more like friends. Right?

213
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,900
Let's see...

214
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,330
Oh! You have big eyes!

215
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,080
What about Ai-Ai (Eye-Eye)?

216
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,490
This is bad.

217
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,090
This development is very bad!

218
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,370
Or maybe... Ai?

219
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,980
No... AIko, maybe?

220
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,750
What about Tomi?

221
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,500
Hey, how about Miki?

222
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,390
- Nice one!
- That's so cute!

223
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,830
- Himari's pretty cute too, huh?
- Super cute!

224
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,700
The second I get a girly nickname...

225
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,550
I will absolutely...

226
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,610
start loving one of these guys!

227
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,500
This is bad!

228
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,320
What about... Jeans?

229
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,800
That's it!

230
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,050
Or...

231
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,900
I also love this. What about Macaroni?

232
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,680
Oh, that's it!

233
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,510

I'm Hoodie! Call me Hoodie, guys!

235
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,430
Well...

236
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,200

called "Hoodie" by anyone.

And so...

Wait a minute... this guy's in love with Ayato, too?!

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,110
let me preserve my coolness in your eyes for now.

341
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,180
Toujou...

342
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,490
Hey, you can take a piece now.

343
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,050
Right...

344
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,510
Deep down, I was relieved.

345
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,860
Ayato still doesn't know Toujou's weakness.

346
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,030
Which means...

347
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,060
Toujou, it's morning.

348
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,820
Why won't you wake up?

349
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,330
Is your weakness morning time?

350
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,370
So, that's it!

351
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,980
You little...!

352
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,300
It means they haven't woken up together yet.

353
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,040
Come on!

354
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,220
If you don't stop that...

355
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,310
you'll get punished.

356
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,540
What the hell?!

357
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,250
I-It's nothing...

358
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,110
This is really good!

359
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,600
The cake you get from winning a quiz sure is yummy!

360
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,490
Right...

361
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,910
I'll have some, too.

362
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,060
Mine is good, too.

363
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,780
So tasty.

364
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,370
So they haven't gotten that far yet.

365
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,360
That means...

366
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,490
you still have a chance.

367
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
Good luck, kid!

368
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,020
What? Did I say something out loud?

369
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,500
Big bro...

370
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,450
What?

371
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,640
Big bro, I want to feed you some of this!

372
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,380
- No.
- Just one bite?

373
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,280
- No!
- Please?

374
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,930
No, no, no!

375
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,620
- Just a bite!
- Feed someone else!

376
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,710
- I've fallen for you.
- What?

377
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,350
Well, weaknesses can be quite unexpected, huh?

378
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,070
Wait, it's not like that!

379
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,410
A Man Who Defies

380
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,340
