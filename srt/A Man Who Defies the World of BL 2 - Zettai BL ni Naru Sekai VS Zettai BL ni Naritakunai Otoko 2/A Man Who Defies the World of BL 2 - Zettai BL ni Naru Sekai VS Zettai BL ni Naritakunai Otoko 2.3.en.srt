This may seem sudden, but I'm in the hospital.

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,430
If you're wondering how I got in this situation...

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,740
Has it been that long?

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,040
I haven't seen him in forever.

28
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,850
Tomoya!

29
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,010
I never thought long-distance would be so painful.

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,690
I want to see you!

31
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,000
Crap.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,170
If I keep going, I'll trigger a story trap.

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,600
I must avoid danger, and—

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,810
Can't change things now.

35
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,030
While hospitalized, I'll finally conquer all 27 volumes of

37

However,

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,460
there was one big problem.

39
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,620
Lucky you.

40
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,030
That was...

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,210
Oh, yeah! This is it!

42
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,740
I wanted to read this manga, too!

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,150

The handsome high-schooler next door

45

48
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,950
But there was one thing I noticed.

49
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,910
Excuse me.

50
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,030
A visitor brought me some sakura mochi.

51
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,320
Want some?

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,980
You sure?

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,860
Ta-daa!

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,110
I can't finish this alone.

55
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,270
Here you go.

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,380
Thanks.

57
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,930
Apparently, he's here because of a car accident. But...

58
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,050
I played soccer all through elementary and middle school.

59
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,930
Well, I may be rusty after being hospitalized.

60
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,980
I also played basketball when I was little.

61
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,900
I see.

62
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,680
Within our conversations,

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,540
he's never talked about his high school life.

64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,320
Thanks for the food!

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,900
Another thing.

66
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,980
While eating meals...

67
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,380
I feel like... I was fond of this flavor.

68
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
Or so he proclaims.

69
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,080
His words and actions lead me to one conclusion.

70
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,980
Aoyagi...

71
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,410
can I ask you something strange?

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,230
Go for it.

73
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,190
You have...

74
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,920
no memories of high school, do you?

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,220
Yes.

76
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,020
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,790
No, it's fine.

78
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,880
If he's an amnesiac,

79
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,450
then the chances of us triggering plot points drastically dwindle!

80
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,470
Huh? "Why," you ask?

81
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,810
Aoyagi!

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,230
Aoyagi!

83
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,810
Theory states that in this BL manga world,

84
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,150
there's always drama

85
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,880
within those lost memories.

86
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:35,400
Aoyagi!

87
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,080
You were in an accident?

88
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,910
I heard after I got back from training camp.

89
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,330
Are we... from the same high school?

90
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,310
What?

91
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,120
Sorry.

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Apparently, the accident made me lose my memories.

93
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,040
I don't remember anything past entering high school.

94
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,660
No way.

95
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,000
Looks like it's time to pretend I'm not here.

96
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,750
I'll leave this here.

97
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,450
Thanks.

98
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,570
I want my memories back, too.

99
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,590
You made time to check up on me.

100
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,090
We must've been good friends, right?

101
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,870
We weren't friends.

102
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,950
Not friends...

103
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,980
What?

104
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,960
We were dating.

105
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,710
No way.

106
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,630
It's true.

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
It's true...

108
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,010
What's wrong?

109
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,760
Are you crying?

110
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,650
Because, that means...

111
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,570
you've forgotten my confession behind the gym.

112
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,070
The first time we held hands was at the movies.

113
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,700
When we kissed in the park, it was with no one around.

114
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,030
You've forgotten everything.

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
They were precious memories.

116
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,660
Our...

117
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,330
precious...

118
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,880
precious...

119
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,000
It's okay.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,580
I'll definitely remember.

121
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,360
Besides...

122
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,650
Besides?

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,960
We can just create

124
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,440
new memories together.

125
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,270
Precious memories for the two of us.

126
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,740
Aoyagi...

127
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,030
Aoyagi...

128
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,180
Ended just as I thought.

129
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,830
Bystander, you're a detective!

130
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,190
Man, I didn't think amnesia actually existed.

131
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,770
Maybe that's only because this is a BL manga?

132
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,100
In that case,

133
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,690
I'll test it out on him.

134
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,070
Hey,

135
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,730
I brought you a change of clothes.

136
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,730
Seriously, what a pain.

137
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,780
Don't go breaking your leg.

138
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,240
Who might you be?

139
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,620
What?

140
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,410
It seems I hit my head.

141
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,570
I can't remember who you are.

142
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,700
How will you act, Ayato?

143
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,850
Will you cling to me

144
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,290
and tearfully tell me to get a grip?

145
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,980
Seriously?

146
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,260
So you don't remember how I lent you 5,000 yen?

147
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,010
No... It was 10,000 yen.

148
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,240
Yeah, 10,000 yen!

149
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,620
I'm in no rush, so pay me back whenever.

150
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,990
Aren't I so nice?

151
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,150
What a natural born liar.

152
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,290
Amnesia, huh?

153
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,740
You've got it rough.

No, I...

155
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Amnesia?

156

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,110
Starting tomorrow, it's back to school.

174
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,640
Returning to my campus life, where B's will L.

175
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,040
W-W-Wait a moment!

176
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,250
M-Me?

177
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,650
Yes, sir.

178
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,500
Here.

179
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,410
This was brought for you.

180
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,020
- For me?
- Yes, sir.

181
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,350
Here you are.

182
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,010
From you?

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
No.

184
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,140
Cosmos?

185
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,280
Congratulations on your recovery.

186
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm glad you got better.

187
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,610
I was shocked to hear you had amnesia.

188
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,180
I thought only that happened in manga.

189
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,050
You may find this letter a nuisance,

190
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,230
but there was something I needed to tell you.

191
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,900
It's about

192
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,030
that unforgettable day.

193
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,990
What are you doing?!

194
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,910
What's wrong, Kikuchi?

195
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,470
Weren't you...

196
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,240
waiting for me?

197
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,950
Even now, I thought

198
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,480
you couldn't forget me.

199
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,840
Though our relationship is long over,

200
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,920
he comes by, whenever he feels lonely.

201
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,620
He toys with my feelings.

202
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,530
Don't ever...

203
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,050
show your face to me again.

204
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,890
Kikuchi...

205
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,120
Goodbye.

206
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,110
I wanted to clear your misunderstanding.

207
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,790
After all, you're irreplaceable to me.

208
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,530
However...

209
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,740
I was mortified and embarrassed,

210
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,340
since you saw me in that situation.

211
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,340
As a result, I ended up avoiding you.

212
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,440
Even so,

213
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,900
I was always following you with my gaze.

214
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,510
- What about Sachi?
- He's pretty pale, what about Mayuhi?

215
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,240
Mayuhi's good!
(T/N: the characters for "Mayuhi": "true," "superior," "princess")

216
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,840
When you were being teased...

217
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,030
Thank you!

218
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,460
When you were boasting about a cute girl...

219
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,910
Are you all right?

220
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,200
Are you okay?

221
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,200
- Call an ambulance!
- Even when you broke a bone.

222
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,600
Now I know

223
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,890
I'm truly glad to have met you.

224
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,380
My encounter with you...

225
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,210
has encouraged me to take a new step in life.

226
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,340
What?

227
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,540
My father's a veterinarian

228
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,890
and he's a professor in America.

229
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,350
Though I used to oppose that future,

230
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,400
I realized I want to become a vet like him.

231
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,310
That's why...

232
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,670
I'm going to go study abroad.

233
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,500
Your kindness for both people

234
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,590
and cats alike,

235
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,000
made me finally realize my goal.

236
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,490
Thank you for everything you've done.

237
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,540
And...

238
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,800
goodbye.

239
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,070
Studying abroad, huh...

240
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,850
Hope you thrive in America.

241
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,070
All right then.

242
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,290
As expected, I'm a background character.

243
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,740
Even in this world set on being a BL,

244
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,510
a B like me, won't L.

245
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,880
You still haven't realized?

246
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,560
What?

247
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,970
A voice?

248
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,980
The reason why you've avoided triggering plot points,

249
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,600
isn't because

250
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,530
you don't want to BL with anyone.

251
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,120
What the hell?

252
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,940
It's because you don't want to BL

253
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,620
with anyone except Kikuchi.

254
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,520
Bullseye.

255
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,460
Hey.

256
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,700
Who are you?

257
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,970
Who the hell are you?!

258
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,010
What was that?

259
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,270
I don't want to BL with anyone except Kikuchi...?

260
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,830
That's...

261
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,890
Thank you for everything you've done.

262
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,530
Goodbye.

263
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,180
My heart hurts.

264
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,860
Kikuchi!

265
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,710
You... You're...

266
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,920
You're the only one for me.

267
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,520
You're the only one!

268
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,290
Kikuchi? Where are you?

269
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,440
Where are you?

270
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,220
Sorry!

271
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,200
Kikuchi!

272
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,010
Where are you?

273
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,760
Seriously, where are you?

274
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,190
Kikuchi...

275
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,380
Where are you?

276
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,030
Where are you, Kikuchi?

277
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,700
You're shredded.

278
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,810
Kikuchi?

279
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,740
Who are you?

280
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,570
Yo!

281
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,960
My apologies.

282
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,860
Kikuchi...

283
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,510
Where are you...

284
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,350
Seriously, where are you?

285
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,340
I was too late.

286
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,190
He's already...

287
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,440
long gone.

288
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,390
It's too...

289
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,570
Do you want to see him?

290
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,320
You're...

291
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,520
I hate to admit it,

292
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,450
but you're much better for him.

293
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,340
Narita.

294
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,400
His flight leaves at 16:00.

295
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,880
Hey!

296
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,980
Kikuchi.

297
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,930
Kikuchi!

298
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,560
Channel Manager: lankafei

299
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Thank you to our wonderful Chief Segmenter: josselinelino

300
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Thank you to our amazing English Editors: cerejacult (GE) & kakashiandme (CE)

301
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Thank you to all of our great Language Moderators and Subtitlers

302
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,420
Thank YOU for watching this drama!

303
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,680
Why did you come?

304
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,940
Were you planning on leaving without a word?

305
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,290
Well, didn't you

306
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,160
forget everything?

307
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,790
All those memories...

308
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,250
and all about me.

309
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,420
It would've been easier if I could forget.

310
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,950
What?

311
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,690
The chocolate you gave me...

312
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,200
Your kindness...

313
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,980
The warmth of your back...

314
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,710
and how you smell like citrus.

315
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,450
It would've been easier if I could forget it all.

316
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,490
You're okay with this, right?

317
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,740
With being the main character of this BL manga?

318
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,380
I...

319
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,160
You're really okay with it, right?

320
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,570
I... um...

321
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,460
I...

322
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,410
I li...

323
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,230
li...

324
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,030
li...

325
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,820
- li...!
- No!

326
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,730
Don't say another word.

327
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
W-Why?

328
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,690
Because it'll only break my heart.

329
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,600
It'll break my heart... to go to America.

330
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,290
Instead...

331
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,780
let me say it.

332
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,520
♫ Just like "Bubble Love" ♫

333
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,740
♫ Just like "Bubble Love" ♫

334
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,190
No matter how far apart we are,

335
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,420
I'll always, always,

336
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,760
be thinking of you.

337
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,300
Always. Always.

338
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:25,050
Always, always, always.

339
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,820
♫ Don't take me, why? ♫

340
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,680
♫ Help yourself ♫

341
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,630
I won't let go.

342
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,370
I don't want to let go.

343
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,560
♫ Teach me how to resist you ♫

344
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,940
♫ Just like "Bubble Love" ♫

345
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,220
♫ Is this time finally true? ♫

346
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,970
Finally, he got caught.

347
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,970
♫ This is our famous scene ♫

348
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,680
♫ If you're so kind to me ♫

349
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,030
♫ Why don't we be happy together? ♫

350
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:04,360
♫ Just like "Bubble Love" ♫

351
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,560
♫ It pops into thin air ♫

352
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,180
♫ What's left in my hand that should have held on ♫

353
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,380
♫ Are droplets of you ♫

354
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,630
♫ Just like "Bubble Love" ♫

355
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,130
That's where it ends?!

356
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,010
Wait! We're suddenly in a long distance relationship?

357
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,650
To be continued in season three!

358
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,820
I hope we get one.

359
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,900
A Man Who Defies

360
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,700
