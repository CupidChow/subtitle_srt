00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,289
Fortunately there is no danger.

5
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,420
Here is some hot tea for you.

6
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,700
Alright.

7
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,289
Thanks.

8
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,340
You've been working hard.

9
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,340
Come here.

10
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,820
Have you injured?

11
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,020
Do I look terrible?

12
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,060
You too.

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,540
Sikong

14
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,420
Have a cup of hot tea.

15
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,940
You've been working hard.

Wanqing.

17
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,340
It's what I'm supposed to do.

18
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,820
Brother Nangong.

19
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,620
Brother Nangong.

20
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,490
Xiaoyi,Xiaoyi.

21
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,300
Don't cry.

22
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,340
You have a nightmare again.

23
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,100
Don't cry.

24
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Don't leave at night, okay?

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,170
I will be afraid.

26
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,140
Don't cry, Xiaoyi. I'm here for you.

27
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,900
I'm right here.

28
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,780
I'm here for you.

29
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
I'm not going anywhere.

30
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,540
Xiaoyi.

31
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,579
There's no rooms for brother and sister tonight.

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,260
Let them go back first and

33
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,940
they'll see you tomorrow, ok?

34
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,100
No.

35
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,740
I want to share a room with Brother Nangong.

36
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,100
Alright, alright, I'm here.

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,620
I'm here for you.

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,220
I'm here for you.

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,980
Don't cry.

40
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
Don't cry, Xiaoyi.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,420
Don't cry, Xiaoyi.

42
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,730
It's okay now, Xiaoyi.

43
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,220
Don't cry, Xiaoyi.

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,700
How about,

45
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,620
let Xiaoyi follow us back to Lilu Villa.

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,060
No.

47
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,780
He is so naughty.

48
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,860
You can't take care of him.

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,540
Sister Wanqing.

50
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,620
I want to share a room with sister Qingqing

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,820
and brother Nangong today.

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,500
Don't cry.

53
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,900
Don't worry. You can count on me.

54
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,140
I...

55
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,890
we can handle this.

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,340
Don't worry.

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,380
We're home.

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,100
We're home.

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,340
Xiaoyi,

60
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
this is where your brother Nangong lives.

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,820
Let me show you around.

62
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,260
Brother Nangong,

63
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,500
there is a hostess in your house.

64
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,060
You're talking nonsense.

65
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,540
Yes.

66
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,940
I'm the hostess here these days.

67
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,820
Let's get you washed up.

68
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,940
Go.

69
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,820
I think Xiaoyi is very thoughtful.

70
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,250
But he seems to rely on you very much.

71
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,420
Maybe.

72
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,820
After all, when he was the most helpless and lonely,

73
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,529
I brought him to Ciyou Kindergarten.

74
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,060
Where is his parents?

75
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,610
This wound...

76
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,860
the crescent cut...

77
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,140
This magic force is getting more and more rampant.

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,380
In order to get magic girl and magic power stone,

79
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,620
they will try all means.

80
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,460
Don't worry, kid.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Go back with me.

82
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,300
I remember that after I brought him back,

83
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,740
he had a fever for three days in a row.

84
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,860
He almost lost his life.

85
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,700
When he gets better,

86
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,450
during half a year,

87
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,900
he didn't even say a word with me.

88
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,540
He is trembling when he encounter something.

89
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,980
Doctor Wu said

90
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,980
it was because he had witnessed the death of his parents

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,420
and was frightened.

92
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,170
In addition, his spleen and stomach are weak,

93
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,420
and his health has always been bad.

94
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,340
I didn't expect such a lively and laughable Xiao Yi

95
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,980
to encounter these things at a young age.

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,340
Although I have been taking care of Xiaoyi

97
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,140
for a while,

98
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,100
but I still can't do it well.

99
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,940
Fortunately, I met Wanqing.

100
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,500
She helped me take over Ciyou Kindergarten.

101
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,460
Xiaoyi is getting better every day.

102
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,860
Wanqing is vey capable.

103
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,460
She is my role model.

104
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,180
When I think of Xiaoyi's eyes,

105
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,140
I think...

106
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
he’s so pitiful.

107
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,820
At a young age

108
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,500
that he has to endure so much hatred.

109
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,900
But those magic force...

110
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,260
Why did they come to No Magic Valley and

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,220
why do they want to kill at random?

112
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,260
They are looking for magic power stones

113
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,260
and magic girl.

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,420
I heard Baihe said

115
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,940
the magic girl ran away with the magic power stone,

116
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,260
she had not be found for ten years.

117
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,060
Is she in the No Magic Valley?

118
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,530
No one knows where they are now.

119
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,570
No matter what,

120
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,340
they can’t kill the innocents at will which

121
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,900
makes these children lose their parents.

122
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,500
I’ll tell my father when I go back

123
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,180
and make him manage these magic forces better.

124
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,420
Qingqing,

125
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,100
Actually, do you know that these magic forces

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,180
are all sent by Lord Lu?

127
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,460
My father?

128
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,060
How do I not know?

129
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,580
There are so many things you don't know.

130
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,460
and you don’t need to know.

131
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,860
Take good care of yourself.

132
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,740
Don't underestimate me!

133
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm sure I can do something for Xiaoyi.

134
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,020
there is nothing I can't do by myself.

135
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,210
Lift the left hand up and

136
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,020
use mind to transport the energy to the pubic area of the lower abdomen.

137
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,060
Good morning!

138
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,140
You've been sleeping too long!

139
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,460
Brother Nangong and I

140
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,380
have practiced for an hour.

141
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,700
Xiaoyi,

142
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,300
where would you like to go today?

143
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,340
I want to go to the bazaar.

144
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,820
Market?

145
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,380
Me too.

146
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,740
You can go with me.

147
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,340
You?

148
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,820
I follow with you?

149
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,060
I am afraid you will get me lost.

150
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,580
I...

151
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,620
Speaking of going to the bazaar.

152
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,140
How could we not take you brother Nangong with us?

153
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,090
He is rich.

154
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,930
Neither of us will get lost.

155
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,780
Let's go to the bazaar!

156
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,820
Let's go to the bazaar!

157
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,900
Well, nice.

158
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,980
[Liquor]

159
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,980
I'll call three, two, one.

160
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,180
If someone loses, he buys our dinner.

161
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,380
I'll call to start.

162
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,820
OK.

163
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,540
Three.

164
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,780
Two.

165
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,700
One.

166
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
Wait for me,please

167
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,059
Come in, Xiaoyi

168
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,450
I will catch up with you.

169
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,900
Wait for me.

170
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,340
Wait for me.

171
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,220
Come on.

172
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,940
Slow down, please.

173
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,059
Come in, Xiaoyi.

174
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,020

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,980
with different kinds of illness.

349
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,580
It's really inconvenient for me to go out.

350
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,160
Absolutely.

351
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,460
I can go to get it back for you.

352
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,620
I’m familiar with

353
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,460
the surroundings a lot in the past two days.

354
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,700
You can tell me the location and

355
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,620
I will get it back for you.

356
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,300
Qingqing

357
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,380
The Chonglou

358
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,140
grows in an extremely difficult environment.

359
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,220
Just in case...

360
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,780
Don't worry.

361
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,980
I am very flexible.

362
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,740
In that case,

363
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,420
you must be careful.

364
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,740
This medicine is here,

365
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,050
go out to the north of Huanggong Mountain three or four miles

366
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,570
to the mountainside up the stone steps,

367
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,460
and you can find it if you look closely.

368
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
The leaves of Chonglou

369
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,140
have eight thick and oblong leaves

370
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,700
with a red flower.

371
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,740
Wanqing

372
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,060
What is wrong?

373
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,980
Xiaoyi is sick.

374
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,500
I must go see him right now.

375
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,220
Isn't Xiaoyi taken care of by Nangong and Qingqing?

376
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,420
There is nothing serious.

377
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,810
They are still children.

378
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,980
and how can they take care of other children?

379
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Help me take care of Ci Kindergarten and

380
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,100
I have to go to Lilu Villa now

381
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,900
Wanqing

382
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,140
I'll immediately command the subordinates of the Commander's House

383
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,980
to protect the Ci Kindergarten.

384
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,180
I will go with you.

385
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,820
Alright.

386
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,460
Wanqing.

387
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,420
Walk slowly.

388
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,500
It's still raining,

389
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,380
and the road is so slippery.

390
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,980
Walk slowly, be careful.

391
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,130
The rain is getting heavier,

392
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,020
let's find a place to hide from the rain first.

393
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,380
No, I worry about Xiaoyi.

394
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,300
If something happens to him,

395
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,380
I won't forgive myself.

396
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,980
Wanqing,

397
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,410
Wanqing.

398
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,770
You are hurt.

399
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,980
Why are you bleeding?

400
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,940
The injury

401
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,180
is nothing serious.

402
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,780
Then let's go find Xiao Yi quickly.

403
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,370
Wanqing

404
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,780
How did you get that scar?

405
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,500
I am OK.

406
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,500
Off we go. We need to find Xiaoyi.

407
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,420
Today I have to thank Miss Qingqing

408
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,340
for helping me to find Chonglou.

409
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,820
If you need help in the future,

410
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
you can just come to me.

411
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,420
Thanks,doctor Wu.

412
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,420
Although I was born in Qiyuan Continent,

413
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,660
I have no magic power.

414
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,780
So this time,

415
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,780
I can help them with my own ability,

416
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,020
I am happy enough.

417
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,180
So, see you next time.

418
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,060
Ok.

419
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,820
When this Miss Qingqing smiles,

420
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,860
she is somewhat similar to the magic girl.

421
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,540
Let me wipe your face.

422
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,620
No,I can do it by myself.

423
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
You hurt your muscles and bones,

424
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,980
I will rub it for you first.

425
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,660
I am really OK.

426
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,660
It is pretty late now.

427
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,820
We need to go immediately.

428
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,020
Come on.

429
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,780
Let me carry you.

430
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,770
No, I can walk.

431
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,340
I think you are in a hurry to see Xiaoyi.

432
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,380
At this speed,

433
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,340
you can't see him until night.

434
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,420
Come on...

435
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,820
Come on, just do it.

436
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,380
At that time, the Chonglou was growing on the cliff and

437
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,500
the cliff is high and steep.

438
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,940
You have never seen it.

439
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,700
You will be frightened if you were me.

440
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,540
In order to get the heavy building,

441
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,100
Xiaoyi

442
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,340
is creeping under the scorching sun.

443
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,460
At that time,

444
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,220
A python came out.

445
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,220
That snake is so long and so wide.

446
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,780
Of course,

447
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,420
I don't be afraid and

448
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,780
I picked up a big rock next to me

449
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,260
and threw at that python's head.

450
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,940
It fainted at once.

451
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,490
Am I brave?

452
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,620
Well down.

453
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,460
Sister Qingqing.

454
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,940
You are making up stories at random, right?

455
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,540
Even a child like me

456
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,820
can tell there's something wrong with your story.

457
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,460
The so big

458
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,860
and so wide python.

459
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,020
You can take it down with a single stone?

460
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
I... I don't make up stories.

461
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,660
I obviously got the Chonglou.

462
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,020
It's true to get a Chonglou and

463
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,020
I guess it's a fake encounter with a python, right?

464
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,180
If you have encountered a python,

465
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,500
you should be in the belly of the python.

466
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,260
How can you brag here?

467
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,380
You don't look down on me.

468
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,690
Anyway, I am the person who

469
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,140
got such a precious medicinal material.

470
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,610
Slow down.

471
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,420
Xiaoyi, your foot is still hurting.

472
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,980
Xiaoyi

473
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,180
-Xiaoyi. -Sister Wanqing.

474
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,340
What's wrong? Are you ok?

475
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,940
Have you taken medicine?

476
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,900
Sister Wanqing, he is fine.

477
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,620
Don't worry.

478
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,260
Didn't you say that you will take care of him?

479
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,580
Why did he still get sick?

480
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,300
Wanqing.

481
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,500
I... I am so sorry.

482
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,780
Xiaoyi.

483
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,620
Go back with me.

484
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,100
Sister Wanqing.

485
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Sister Qingqing is not good at taking care of people, indeed.

486
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
But she is thoughtful,

487
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,220
and she's getting better and better.

488
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,140
Look,

489
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,940
after she fed me the medicine,

490
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
and she gave me a plate of fruit to eat.

491
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,580
Xiaoyi.

492
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,140
Your health is not good.

493
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,220
I am worry about you.

494
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,140
Don't worry. Sister Wanqing

495
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,740
Brother Nangong is also here.

496
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,620
Wanqing.

497
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,420
Actually, Xiaoyi's illness

498
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,250
can't be blamed on Qingqing.

499
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,930
Qingqing, actually worked very hard.

500
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,020
Qingqing burned her hand while cooking.

501
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,060
She didn't tell anyone.

502
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,420
And Xiaoyi just said that

503
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,580
she is doing better day by day.

504
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,820
So you really don't have to worry.

505
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,460
Sister Wanqing

506
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,490
I really made a mistake.

507
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,540
But give me another chance,

508
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,020
and I can take good care of him.

509
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,260
Sorry, I was too emotional.

510
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,220
Thanks for your hard work.

511
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,660
Be relax.

512
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,300
Xiaoyi, be good.

513
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,820
Come here slowly.

514
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,420
Be careful.

515
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,580
Be careful.

516
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,650
[Ci Kindergarten]

517
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,020
I will apply the medicine on you first.

518
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,220

00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,060
How dare she!

691
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,700
She went to No Magic Valley surprisingly.

692
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,460
Qi Yi.

693
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,180
Call all the people together.

694
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,820
Come with me to No Magic Valley and get her back.

695
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,300
Yes.

696
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,260
Dad

697
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,180
I'll go with you.

698
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,700
You want to go?

699
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,210
Just persuade her to come back with me.

700
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,620
Just stop begging for her.

701
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,900
Yes. My dad.

702
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,340
Move.

703
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,580
Is it fun?

704
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,700
Yes.

705
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,050
Look.

706
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,860
I just picked.

707
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,340
Come here.

708
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,420
I will wash it for you.

709
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,300
Get out of.

710
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,300
All of you,get out of.

711
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,420
Come here,all of you.

712
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,540
Lady Qingqing

713
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,179
Lord Lu and Lady Yunxi are coming.

714
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,139
Dad,My sister

715
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,940
Why are you here?

716
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,179
Go back with us.

717
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,179
I don't want to go back.

718
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,500
I like living here.

719
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,380
So impudent you are.

720
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,659
It can't be decided by you.

721
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,100
Qingqing

722
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,179
Don't be capricious.

723
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,980
Lord Lu,how's it going?

724
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,260
If it wasn't for the purpose of

725
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,610
the worthless daughter,

726
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,340
I have no time

727
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,100
and no interests in coming here.

728
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,900
Even if my daughter is so worthless,

729
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,139
she is still a person from the Qiyuan Continent,

730
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,700
how can she stay in this No Magic valley?

731
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,100
Lord Lu

732
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,620
Qingqing like here.

733
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,220
She dou't want to go back to Qiyuan Continent.

734
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,100
Why don't you keep her here for a few more days?

735
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,940
How can I discipline my daughter,

736
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,940
it’s not your turn

737
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,660
to interfere.

738
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,410
Lord Lu

739
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,780
This is too much.

740
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,300
Dad

741
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,780
They are all my friends.

742
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,180
You can not treat them like this.

743
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,260
If you are from the Qiyuan Continent,

744
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,580
you can’t make friends with the people from No Magic Valley.

745
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,140
I don't even have the freedom to make friends anymore?

746
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,740
You are right.

747
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,330
Qingqing

748
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
You leave privately

749
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
which makes the Empress extremely angry.

750
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,050
I have found you for a long time,

751
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,780
Do you know?

752
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,900
Baihe and the servants of yours

753
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,260
are punished because of you.

754
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,140
Baihe

755
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,380
what's the matter of her?

756
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
This matter has no relationship with her.

757
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,660
What I do alone is enough for me

758
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,340
to take on it alone.

759
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,780
Qingqing

760
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,980
Don't be capricious.

761
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,180
Lady Yunxi

762
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,130
Take your sister back.

763
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,490
After that,

764
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,700
she will not be allowed to take a step out of Qiyuan Continent.

765
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,500
Qingqing,off you go.

766
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,780
Sikong

767
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,370
Where is Nangong?

768
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,260
He...

769
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,090
He has gone out.

770
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
before I leave,

771
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,340
I need to say goodbye to him.

772
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,020
There is no need.

773
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,700
Move immediately.

774
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:28,900
Xiaoyi

775
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,500
Sister Qingqing

776
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,380
Do not leave.

777
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,860
Xiaoyi

778
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,100
Do not hurt him.

779
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,300
The person who hurt him is yourself.

780
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,660
Hurry up!

781
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,800
[Thin strip of sky]

782
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,220
Qi Yi

783
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,780
It's already half an hour.

784
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,860
What is she waiting for?

785
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,940
Remind her!

786
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,820
Yes.

787
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,010
Lady Qingqing

788
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,620
Go back quickly.

789
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,500
I have a stomach ache.

790
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:07,860
Qingqing

791
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,860
You have used this reason three times

792
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,770
Move.

793
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,380
It is useless.

794
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,580
Where did he go?

795
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,450
Who are you waiting for?

796
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,580
I am waiting for a friend of mine.

797
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,810
These days,

798
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,970
he has been taking care of me.

799
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,220
If he knows I'm leaving,

800
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,620
he will come to see me off.

801
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,940
My sister

802
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,180
My best sister

803
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,980
Please!

804
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,810
You finally come.

805
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,860
I know you will come.

806
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,780
Qingqing is waiting for Lord Jin.

807
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,660
Due to me,Baihe was punished.

808
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,860
I have to go back.

809
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,100
If there is a chance to come back to No Magic Valley in the future,

810
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,060
can we still be like these few days?

811
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,540
We eat,live and

812
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,220
play together.

813
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,810
What's wrong with you today?

814
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,810
Why are you weird?

815
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,660
Lord Jin,thanks.

816
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,140
If it weren't for Lord Jin,

817
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,780
I still don't know

818
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,850
Where my daughter is.

819
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,740
What do you mean?

820
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:44,980
Yes.

821
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,420
I told Lord Lu that you were in No Magic Valley.

822
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,340
Why are you doing this?

823
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,090
Helping Lord Lu

824
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,700
is my duty.

825
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,460
Aren't we friends?

826
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,460
Shouldn't friends trust each other?

827
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,820
How could betray?

828
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,900
Friends?

829
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,740
It's all in your head!

830
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,900
Except for Sikong,

831
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,820
I don't need other friends.

832
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,380
Even more,

833
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,500
you are a person who always makes me in trouble.

834
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,020
So in your eyes,

835
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,140
I have always been a trouble.

836
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,780
You are right.

837
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,180
So in the future, you don't come to the No Magic Valley.

838
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,140
and don't come to me again.

839
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,700
you are the Crown Princess,

840
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,460
the Empress in the future.

841
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,780
But I...

842
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,180
I am an idle Lord.

843
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,380
We are not all the same.

844
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,020
I have always regarded you as my friend,

845
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,860
I consider you will...

846
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,570
Don't flatter yourself，ok?

847
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,740
Do not over this.

848
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,620
Why is it so?

849
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,060
Lord Jin and Qingqing,

850
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,890
What is the relationship between them?
