[Episode 22]

4
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,550
Your Grace.

5
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,030
Your Grace!

6
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:39,789
Your Highness.

7
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,430
Your Grace.

8
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,229
Your Highness,

9
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,910
I heard that Your Highness

10
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,150
sent Lu Qingqing to the No Magic Valley.

11
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,070
Is that true?

12
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,830
That's true.

13
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,509
Why did you do that?

14
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,550
Only the magic power stone inside her body

15
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,310
can help you to ascend the throne smoothly.

16
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,990
Don't you want to be crowned?

17
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,710
To get the magic power stone,

18
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,870
not only I can,

19
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,870
my brother and Qingqing together can also get the stone.

20
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,030
Lord Jin?

21
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,150
He previously colluded with the Red Face Army with the intention of treason.

22
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,110
Your Highness,

23
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,310
are you confused?

24
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,270
You have accused

25
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,670
my brother of treason,

26
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,150
but in my opinion,

27
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,430
this matter

28
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,270
needs to be investigated more carefully.

29
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,910
Is Your Highness questioning me now?

30
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,750
You worry too much.

31
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,270
That's not what I meant.

32
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,390
Well,

33
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,150
I still have something to do,

34
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,670
you can leave now.

35
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,190
My father and brother

36
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,550
entrusted everything to me.

37
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,829
Lu Hongzhu,

38
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,470
I will make you pay for it.

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,820
Your Grace.

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,500
Speak.

41
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,260
Your Grace.

42

Magic power army is looking for the Li An Guild Leader in the No Magic Valley.

43
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,420
They were repeatedly confronted by the Red Face Army,

44
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,860
so their actions failed one after another.

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,260
The Red Face Army suffered heavy losses in the battle of Thin strip of sky.

46
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,660
How can they recover so quickly?

47
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,660
This is really strange.

48
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,740
I am also stepping up my investigation into this.

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,260
This matter must be related to the Li An Guild Leader.

50
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,579
Your Grace,

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
The Crown Prince had invited General Murong

52
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,540
to the palace two days ago for a secret talk.

53
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,970
The Crown Prince is going to be completely against me.

[Lilu Villa]

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,420
Take a break.

56
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,140
You have been sticking this all night.

57
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,460
Why did you become like this?

58
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,300
You obviously miss her so much,

59
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,410
but you just don't see her.

60
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,460
Not all love for each other

61
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,020
can really stay together.

62
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,940
So you can bear to push her away again?

63
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,140
Maybe she doesn't even approve of that.

64
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,250
This thing

65
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,140
is possibly the only last thing

66
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,890
I can do for her in the world.

67
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,420
I don't care if she agrees or not.

68
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,260
You're being selfish.

69
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,340
Nangong,

70
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,900
I've told Qingqing everything.

71
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,300
I just can't stand you two like this.

72
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,690
Why do you push each other away

73
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,170
when you obviously love each other so much?

74
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,980
You did this

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,659
without any regard for Qingqing's feelings.

76
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,050
You'd better have a chat about it.

77
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,420
Wan Qing,

78
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,260

79

let's go

81
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:05,980
and give them some space.

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,500
Why are you so stupid?

83
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,140
Look,

84
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,980
I am a man who is going to die.

85
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,460
So I don't want you to be upset

86
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,660
about me anymore.

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,700
I want you to

88
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
be as purely happy

89
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,210
and purely free as you were before.

90
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,730
Without you,

91
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,620
I wouldn't be happy.

92
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,900
It was your appearance that

93
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,500
let me know

94
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,220
what it is like to love someone.

95
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,580
I won't regret knowing you

96
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,940
and I won't regret being with you.

97
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,580
So don't push me away anymore, okay?

98
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,380
I will stay with you.

99
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,620
No matter what happens,

100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,460
I won't leave you,

101
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,180
and I will not leave you alone

102
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,140
to face all this.

103
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,660
Qingqing,

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,380
in that case,

105
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,620
even if I can only live one day,

106
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,460
I will hold you tightly.

107
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,940
I will die with no regrets.

108
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,500
Your Grace,

109
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,060
I went to the No Magic Valley

110
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,740
and found out that

111
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,420
the Li An Guild Leader had shown up,

112
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,740
which boosted the morale of the Red Face Army.

113
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,340
That's good.

114
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,340
After more than ten years,

115
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,380
he finally stopped hiding.

116
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,300
I can finally kill him.

117
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,140
Your Grace,

118
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,260
the person who previously revealed the appearance of Li An Guild Leader

119
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,420
and held the Li An Guild Leader mask

120
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,420
has been found.

121
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,980
Who is it?

122
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,100
She is the teacher of the Ciyou Kindergarten, Wan Qing.

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,060
I learned that

124
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,820
the Ciyou Kindergarten was built by Lord Jin in the No Magic Valley,

125
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,100
and Sikong Ying often goes here.

126
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,300
This girl is very close to Lord Jin

127
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,420
and Sikong Ying.

128
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,420
Qiyi,

129
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,980
take some of your subordinates to the No Magic Valle

130
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,580
and bring Wan Qing back.

131
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,380
Use her as bait to lure out the Li An Guild Leader.

132
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
I'll see how he can escape this time.

133
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,059
Yes, Your Grace.

134
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,860
Qingqing.

135
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,420
Nangong was sleeping heavily,

136
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,020
so I thought I'd help out in the kitchen.

137
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,060
Then...

138
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,540
Go and find me a bowl to hold the medicine.

139
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,500
Doctor Wu,

140
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,860
have you been alone all these years?

141
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,860
I had a daughter

142
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,180
and a wife.

143
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,460
But my wife left me 20 years ago

144
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,300
and my daughter is still missing.

145
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,260
It's my fault

146
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
for reminding you of your sad past.

147
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,700
It doesn't matter

148
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,930
If my daughter

149
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,380
were still alive now,

150
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,820
she would be as beautiful

151
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,260
as you.

152
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,380
How have you been living

153
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,860
since your wife left?

154
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,380
By...

155
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,060
the belief that I would find my daughter

156
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,700
and live with her.

157
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,780
I've been living on that belief until now.

158
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,020
I'm sure my wife

159
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,460
is watching me from heaven,

160
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,140
and she also wants me to find my daughter

161
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,660
and live happily with my daughter.

162
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
I see what you mean.

163
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,020
But I don't want

164
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,860
Nangong to watch me from heaven,

165
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,340
I want him by my side.

166
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,020
Nangong，

167
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,700
it's time to take your medicine.

168
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,340
Where did he go?

169
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,020
Why are you sitting here alone?

170
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,900
You said you'd stay with me all the time.

171
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,900
I'm just enjoying the fresh air here alone.

172
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,050
I didn't want you to see me

173
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,060
looking sickly.

174
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,500
Nangong,

175
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,740
You used to protect me,

176
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,140
now I'm here to protect you.

177
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,620
No matter what you say or do,

178
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,900
I won't leave you.

179
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,380
Silly girl.

180
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,180
The glacial poison can be cured.

181
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,500
The Crown Prince and I have been looking for a way to save you.

182
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,930
We have not given up

183
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,020
so don't give up either, okay?

184
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,940
So you visited The Crown Prince frequently before

185
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,060
were actually due to the glacial poison thing.

186
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,940
Yeah, right.

187
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,060
We have been looking for an antidote to the poison.

188

Nangong,

189
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,460
we are going to visit other fun places

190
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,740
in the No Magic Valley,

191
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,140
and you're going to make me a lot of delicious food in the future.

192
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,380
We are going to build the Ciyou Kindergarten bigger.

193
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,580
And we are going to raise many rabbits together.

194
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,140
We will plant flowers together,

195
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,820
and row boats together.

196
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,740
We will do many, many things together.

197

199
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,100
are you all right?

200
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,180
Have you heard from my brother and Qingqing?

201
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,940
Lord Jin has not

202
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,650
been well lately.

203
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,260
I'm afraid that...

204
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,980
These books brought by the imperial physician

205
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,060
do not mention the method of antidote.

206
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,780
Let them send more people to continue the investigation.

207
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:41,740
Yes, Your Highness.

208
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,780
How is Nangong?

209
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,620
Be prepared to hear bad news.

210
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,340

Your eyes are swollen with tears.

215

I'm not.

216
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,060
I remember that time you were in the Muxin Garden.

217
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,660
It was raining,

218
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,980
and you got soaked through.

219
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,220
You didn't want me to see your eyes that time.

220
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,660
Don't cry.

221
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,060
You should smile.

222
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,260
I love to see you smile.

223
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,460
You look so good

224

when you smile.

225
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,940
I want to take a nap.

I'll come to you.

I'm so sorry.

It's my fault.

236
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,620
I should never have stolen

to act.

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,460
Great.

Mother.

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,020
I heard that you have been looking for an antidote to glacial poison.

263
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:54,930
That's right.

264
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,540
My brother had a relapse of glacial poison.

265
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,580
His life was in danger,

266
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,220
and I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.

267
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,180
The antidote to glacial poison is

268
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,700
the Red Flame flower.

269
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,060
The Red Flame flower?

270
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,220
Yep.

271

The Red Flame flower

272
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,770
grows on top of Taiji mountain in the No Magic Valley

273
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
This flower is fed by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

274
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,980
It is only effective when it is in bloom.

275
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,580
This flower is rare,

276
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,180
and its blooming period is variable.

277
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,180
It is extremely difficult to find.

278
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,940
As long as there is an antidote.

279
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,540
Thank you for telling me that.

280

This is my fault.

281

If I hadn't been jealous,

282
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,700
Lord Jin wouldn't have to suffer so much.

Father.

519
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,060
Sikong.

520
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,420
Father.

521
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:11,860
Father.

522
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,660
Wan Qing,

523
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,500
Where is my father?

524
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,820
Where is my father?

525
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,500
Lu Hongzhu killed my father.

526
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,220
I'll kill him!

527
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,660
I'll kill him!

528
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,700
Sikong! Sikong!

529
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,860
Sikong! Sikong!

530
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,100
Wan Qing, don't stop me!

531
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,580
I'll kill him!

532
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,700
Sikong, calm down.

533
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,580
Sikong.

534
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,460
I'm going to kill Lu Hongzhu.

535
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,500
You haven't recovered yet.

536
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,180
I'm going to kill him.

537
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,300
This is all because of me.

538
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,060
I have known your father for many years.

539
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,060
He was both my right-hand man

540
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,500
and my brother.

541
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,020
This time he was killed by the magic power army.

542
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,900
I will find Lu Hongzhu

543
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,810
and avenge your father's death.

544
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,260
Lu Hongzhu is simply shameless!

545
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,100
In order to find the Li An Guild Leader,

546
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,540
they have repeatedly stirred up trouble in the No Magic Valley.

547
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,570
Now he has allowed his subordinates

548
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,740
to kill Commander Sikong.

549
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,730
Lu Hongzhu has committed such a great crime

550
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,140
and the evidence is all there.

551
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,980
Your Highness, now would be a good time

552
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,300
identify his crimes and take back his military power.

553
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,300
Your Highness has the support of General Murong

554
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,290
and the other ministers.

555
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,180
You must take advantage of this opportunity to bring down Lu Hongzhu!

556
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
He has done so many evil things that

557
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,220
God will not forgive him.

558
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,300
Greetings to Your Highness.

559
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,780
Your Majesty.

560
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,530
As you were.

561
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,290
I received a letter from Sikong Ying,

562
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,420
the son of the Commander of No Magic Valley.

563
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
The letter says that the Ciyou Kindergarten in No Magic Valley

564
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,460
had been harassed harassed by the magic power army.

565
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,300
Lord Sikong went to stop it

566
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,940
but was killed in an assassination attempt.

567
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,940
The Commander of No Magic Valley has been killed by the magic power army

568
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
and the matter is of great importance.

569
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,260
So I have asked the Empress to come to this meeting.

570
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,180
That's right.

571
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,100
Due to the loss of the magic power stone.

572
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,300
Twenty years ago,

573
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,500
the Qiyuan continent signed an agreement with the No Magic Valley.

574
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,300
We have agreed to have friendly relations.

575
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,300
Both sides must not provoke any trouble.

576
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,500
Now the magic power army

577
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,940
had killed the Commander of No Magic Valley.

578
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,020
Lord Lu,

579
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,940
what is your explanation for this?

580
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,180
Your Majesty,

581
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,260
there is no evidence.

582
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,980
I don't think you can trust

583
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,260
the words of Sikong Ying.

584
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,220
Lord Lu,

585
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,460
this weapon

586
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,140
was handed over to me by Sikong Ying.

587
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,130
It was this arrow that

588
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,020
killed Lord Sikong

589
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,620
that night.

590
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,380
I have found out that

591
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,010
this weapon came from your Mansion.

592
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,060
What?

593
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,780
Are you afraid to admit it?

594
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,460
Your Highness,

595
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,300
The purpose of the magic power army in the No Magic Valley

596
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
was to capture Li An Guild Leader.

597
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:08,699
But Sikong Ren had got in magic power army's way.

598
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,900
That's why he was killed.

599
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,610
I think he deserved to die.

600
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,420
You're so unbridled!

601
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,179
Now you see that the evidence is overwhelming,

602
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,100
so you lay all the blame on

603
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,620
Commander Sikong.

604
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,300
I am ashamed of you!

605
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,940
The Qiyuan continent has had a friendly relationship

606
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,300
with the No Magic Valley for over ten years.

607
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,139
You are the one who disregarded the agreement

608
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,940
and repeatedly messed up in No Magic Valley.

609
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,300
Now you've made a big mistake

610
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,540
and you deserve to be punished.

611
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:30,889
Your Highness,

612
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,659
Lord Lu holds the power of the magic power army.

613
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,170
But he has allowed his subordinates to act violently

614
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,210
and kill civilians in the No Magic Valley.

615
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,460
Now he has caused a lot of anger in the No Magic Valley.

616
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,380
His actions are morally bankrupt.

617
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,739
He is not worthy of commanding two armies.

618
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:45,739
Lord Lu,

619
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,060
I've had a lot of respect for you

620
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,170
over the years.

621
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,820
I never thought

622
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,540
you'd be killing people in the No Magic Valley.

623
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,180
You even killed women and children.

624
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,540
I am so disappointed.

625
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,980
Lord Lu allowed his subordinates to rebel in the No Magic Valley

626
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,260
and killed their commander.

627
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,300
His crimes are numerous.

628
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,500
I declare that

629
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,340
from this day onwards,

630
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
the two armies held by Lord Lu will be taken back..

631
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,180
I will take charge of it myself.

632
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,810
Are there any objections from the others?

633
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,100
No objection.

634
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,980
Your Highness is wise.

635
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,060
Qingqing.

636
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,100
Qingqing!

637
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,300
Qingqing!

638
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,020
Qingqing!

639
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,220
Nangong!

640
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,500
Help me!

641
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,580
Nangong!

642
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,330
Help me!

643
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,380
Nangong!

644
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,460
Qingqing!

645
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,100
Nangong.

646
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,700
Doctor Wu,

647
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,220
Where did Qingqing go?

648
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,450
She learned that the Red Flame Flower from Taiji Mountain

649
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,340
could save your life.

650
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,660
So she is now on her way to Taiji Mountain.

651
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,540
This is the letter she left.

652
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,380
How could she be so stupid?

653
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,060
It's not worth it for her to do this for me.

654
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,180
It's not worth.

655
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,940
Taiji Mountain is a bitterly cold place

656
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,940
where people never return.

657
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,140
There is no return.

658
00:37:59,460 --> 00:37:59,980
I'm going to find her.

659
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,220
I'm going to find her.

660
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,780
Nangong,

661
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,260
with such a weak body,

662
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
you will be dead

663
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,140
before you get there.

664
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,050
Even so,

665
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,220
I still want to see her for one last time.

666
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,300
Qingqing, she is my daughter.

667
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,020
I don't want her to do this neither.

668
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,940
But she was devoted to you,

669
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,130
and had made up her mind.

670
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,780
So how could I be able to stop her?

671
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,970
Now you are too weak to move.

672
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,700
So you need to stay and recover yourself,

673
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,180
waiting for Qingqing to come back safe and sound,

674
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,940
while I am out there finding her.

675
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,370
So this is Red Flame flower.

676
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,180
The book says that there will be a dazzling light emitted

677
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,500
when the flower is blooming.

678
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,300
It seems that this one has not bloomed yet.

679
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,420
What should I do?

680
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,060
Magic Blood!

681
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,420
Nangong,

682
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,100
Wait for me.

683
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,420
Please hand over the Red Flame flower, my lady.

684
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,500
How did you know?

685
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,540
Qingqing,

686
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,340
You've been staid confused for too long?

687
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,540
You are taking Red Flame flower to save Lord Jin.

688
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,380
But Lord Jin has colluded with No Magic Valley

689
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:28,980
to kill our father,

690
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,220
and tried to take The Crown Prince's place.

691
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,980
So I am not letting you pass with Red Flame flower today.

692
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,460
Lu Yunxi,

693
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,860
think about it,

694
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,580
how come Nanggong would hand the secret edict to The Crown Prince,

695
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,770
if he was going to take over the throne?

696
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,540
How dare you call my name straightly.

697
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,380
Where is your manner?

698
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,500
Don't you know it yet?

699
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,740
We are not related to each other at all.

700
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,580
Lu Hongzhu is not my real father.

701
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,340
Instead he was the one who killed my father.

702
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,980
Not only that,

703
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,100
he has also killed the late Emperor.

704
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,580
By going against Lu Hongzhu,

705
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,180
Nangong was trying to maintain the safety of No Magic Valley

706
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,540
and Qiyuan continent,

707
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,100
surely not to take the throne.

708
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,740
Lu Hongzhu worked so hard to kill the late Emperor,

709
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,780
step by step.

710
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,060
Was he just trying to support The Crown Prince to get his place?

711
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,380
All those years,

712
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,300
he was just raising me up to get the magic power stone inside my body.

713
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,380
Do not delude Lady Yunxi.

714
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,140
Please forgive my discourtesy,

715
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,900
If you don't hand over the Red Flame flower.

716
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,380
Take the flower only,

717
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,740
Do not hurt her.

718
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,420
It's the Magic palm from Li An Guild Leader.

719
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,500
Smart, boy.

720
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,690
I thought this place is forgotten,

721
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,700
since I have disappeared for so many years.

722
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,300
No Magic Valley,

723
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,410
is not the place for you magic power army to

724
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,380
come and go as your will,

725
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,820
doing whatever you want.

726
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,020
You are just in time.

727
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,220
Move together.

728
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,340
Catch Li An Guild Leader alive!

729
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:15,980
Lady Yunxi!

730
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,980
Go back and tell Lu Hongzhu.

731
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,460
Me and him,

732
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,060
we'll have a lot of old history to be figured out.

733
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,570
Qingqing.

734
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,540
Qingqing!

735
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,460
Qingqing.
