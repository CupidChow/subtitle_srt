00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,740
If...

177
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,140
If it really happened,

178
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,020
it was not my intention.

179
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,580
I have done you wrong.

180
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,940
Yunxi didn't come to accuse you,

181
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,140
I said all this

182
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,180
with the hope of being with you.

183
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,860
Yunxi,

184
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,420
I already have someone I like.

185
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,380
Me being with you

186
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,780
will only hurt you more.

187
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,890
I absolutely cannot do that.

188
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,900
As for what happened that night,

189
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,220
I’m willing to use everything to make it up for you.

190
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,540
But

191
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,060
I can't go against my will.

192
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,460
You mean,

193
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,500
you can't accept me.

194
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,700
I understand.

195
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,140
I don't need you to compensate me.

196
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,100
And nothing can compensate me,

197
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,300
except your heart.

198
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,300
I compromise out of consideration for the general interest.

199
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,500
But what do I get?

200
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,620
Greetings, Lord Jin

201
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,580
I will excuse myself.

202
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,980
Where is Qingqing?

203
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,500
Miss and Missy went to buy clothes

204
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,420
for the Lantern Festival today.

205
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
She isn't in.

206
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,180
She went out without you?

207
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,060
My Highness!

208
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,900
She really isn't in.

209
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,220
She doesn't want to meet me, right?

210
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,740
No. My Highness.

211
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,660
Alright.

212
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,180
Go and tell Qingqing that

213
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,500
I'll be waiting for her right here today.

214
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,020
Yes, my Highness.

215
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,460
Baihe.

216
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,060
He really told you that?

217
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
Absolutely yes, my lady.

218
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,460
He said

219
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,570
he won't leave

220
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,540
if he doesn't see you today.

221
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,860
Why don't you just

222
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,300
meet him briefly?

223
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,700
He is just getting well.

224
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,580
What should I do if he feels unwell again when meeting me?

225
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,860
But he looked rather pale just now.

226
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,780
If others see him

227
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,780
waiting outside like that,

228
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,260
it may have a bad influence.

229
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,100
If Lord Lu runs across the Lord Jin...

230
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,250
Let Fu greet him into the main hall to rest.

231
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:49,940
Yes, my lady.

232
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,340
Wait...

233
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,460
He won't see me even if he comes in.

234
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,180
You better not invite him in.

235
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,020
Maybe if he can't meet me after some waiting

236
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,860
he will leave on his own.

237
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,060
My lady.

238
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,580
How long are you going to hide from him?

239
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,140
This is all i can do until we can find a way

240
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,460
to detoxify the glacial poison.

241
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,580
My lady Yunxi.

242
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,300
Lu Qingqing can really play with people's feelings.

243
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,100
Actually let Lord Jin wait for her at the gate of the mansion.

244
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,700
Why didn't Qingqing see him?

245
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,100
She is playing hard to get.

246
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,450
If she has no special ways,

247
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,300
how can she make Lord Jin and His Highness

248
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,260
run circles around her?

249
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,060
Zhenzhu.

250
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,460
Do you think I'm really bad

251
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,500
compared to Qingqing?

252
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,620
My lady.

253
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,100
How could you think that way?

254
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,820
You are dignified and virtuous.

255
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,460
And you are polite and sensible.

256
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,460
How can Lu Qingqing

257
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,940
compare to you?

258
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,980
I'm not as good as you said.

259
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,340
I use the fusang fruit to lie to Qingqing.

260
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,090
And I also lied to the crown prince that he and I were already...

261
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,540
I almost don't know myself anymore.

262
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,290
My lady.

263
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,900
Happiness is your own.

264
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,460
Never let go of what should be caught.

265
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,660
But I abandon my dignity and

266
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,619
offered myself,

267
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,819
he still can't accept me.

268
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,700
He only has eyes for Qingqing.

269
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,020
I don't know

270
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,380
where I am lacking.

271
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,380
The Crown Prince and you

272
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,140
are innocent playmates and true to each other.

273
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,500
This is obvious to all of us.

274
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,460
I think that this problem

275
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,860
lies with lady Qingqing,

276
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,060
who made trouble and

277
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,300
took away your crown princess title.

278
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,180
But I don't think Qingqing is scheming.

279
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,610
I apologize for what I say.

280
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,660
You are so kind.

281
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,140
You are generous and kind to Qingqing

282
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,900
so that she can take advantage of it.

283
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,540
You treat her as your sister and

284
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,780
you are tolerant of her.

285
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,140
But she doesn't

286
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,900
treat you like her sister.

287
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,530
When she was a child,

288
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,620
you have given her anything

289
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,860
that is delicious and well-dressed.

290
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,900
She is used to accepting.

291
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,900
Naturally, she will think that

292
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,780
the Crown Prince belongs to her too.

293
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,220
I did indulge her a bit.

294
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,660
Now the Crown Prince only has eyes for Lady Qingqing.

295
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,660
Have you ever thought that

296
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,500
if there is no lady Qingqing,

297
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,100
the Crown Prince

298
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,060
will come back to you again?

299
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,780
What do you mean?

300
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,570
We can make her disappear

301
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,380
from the Crown Prince's sight.

302
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,130
Kneel down! Zhenzhu

303
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,340
Do you know what you're talking about?

304
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,260
She is my sister.

305
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,100
How can you...

306
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,940
My lady.

307
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,340
Zhenzhu.

308
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,780
Zhenzhu is also afraid of you being wronged.

309
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,300
Lady Qingqing is selfish

310
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,380
robbing you of

311
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,820
what belongs to you again and again.

312
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,780
She never care about your feelings.

313
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,700
I really can't figure out

314
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,060
why you still think about her everywhere.

315
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,540
I'll assume you

316
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,260
haven't said this today.

317
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Don't mention it again.

It's been three hours.

347
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,370
How can he stand without eating or drinking?

348
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,940
Baihe,

349
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,460
send a message to Lord Jin's Mansion and

350
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,700
tell Xiaowu to come.

351

Lord Nangong anyway.

Will he blame me?

386

I think Lord Jin will not blame you.

387
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,780
But he must be very sad.

388
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,180
It is really unfair.

389
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,020
You finally have someone you like,

390
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,820
but Lord Nangong got such a strange illness.

391
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,780
You want to meet but can't meet each other,

392
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,420
it's really distressing.

393
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,140
Now only if we find a way to detoxify,

394
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,770
we can finally meet.

395
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,980
Baihe.

396
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,810
Go and tell Xiao Wu

397
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,620
to keep an eye on Lord Jin recently,

398
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,460
don't let him go out alone,

399
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,180
and give him some medicated meals to replenish.

400
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,740
Ok. I will go.

401
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,260
And,

402
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,450
tell him not to come to me anymore.

403
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,980
I say, I like you.

404
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,740
Lu Qingqing likes Nangong Yixin.

405
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Do you hear that?

406
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,660
Nangong Yixin also

407
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,300
likes Lu Qingqing.

408
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,660
Miss, don't think too much.

409
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,020
My Lord.

410
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,140
My Lord?

411
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,620
My Lord!

412
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Why you are so close

413
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,060
with your big faces?

414
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,700
I haven't settled the score with you for knocking me out yesterday,

415
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,420
and now you're scaring me.

416
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,700
My Lord.

417
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,620
I had no choice but to do that

418
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,460
yesterday.

419
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,210
You have been sick recently.

420
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,730
Yesterday, you stood outside Lu mansion for the whole day

421
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
and you were soaked in the rain.

422
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,420
Even the healthiest person would fall sick.

423
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:33,820
My Lord.

424
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,940
Why are you so weak that

425
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,020
even I can ambush you easily?

426
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,260
Could it be,

427
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,380
your magic power...

428
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,580
Would you have a chance if

429
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,540
if I didn't seal the magic power?

430
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,260
You sealed your magic power?

431
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,340
I can stop the glacial poison through this method

432
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,180
and I can be with Qingqing.

433
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,980
You have no magic power.

434
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,060
If others find out,

435
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,610
we will be in danger.

436
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,500
Keep calm! Don't panic!

437
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,580
I am still very mighty

438
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,540
without any magic.

439
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,220
Yes, you are right about all that.

440
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,500
You must not utter a word about this

441
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,500
to anyone else.

442
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,140
Did you hear me?

443
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,340
My lips are sealed. Tightly.

444
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,460
It’s just that Lady Qingqing is clever.

445
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,300
I think

446
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,740
it’s a matter of time before she finds out.

447
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,220
Quick, help me think of a way

448
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,420
to tell her

449
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,940
that my glacial poison has been lifted.

450
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,780
Looking at the situation yesterday,

451
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,140
she insisted on not seeing you.

452
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,900
Now you have no magic either,

453
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,100
so you can't see her.

454
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Then you can only write a letter.

455
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,170
Looks like your brain still has some use.

456
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:54,980
Qingqing.

457
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,860
Why are you here?

458
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,420
I know

459
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,260
you are worried about my brother's illness.

460
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,140
This is the secret medicine book that

461
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,780
I have searched secretly in the past few days.

462
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,940
I am here to bring it to you.

463
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,490
I hope you can use it.

464
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,100
Thanks, Your Highness.

465
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,260
My pleasure, Qingqing.

466
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,140
I also hope to contribute to

467
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,300
my brother.

468
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,340
And I hope he can get well soon.

469
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,700
Qingqing

470
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,100
You can’t find medicine in a hurry.

471
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,460
Three days later,

472
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,300
it will be the most lively and grand Lantern festival in Qiyuan continent.

473
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,380
Why don't we

474
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,540
attend it together?

475
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,620
There are lots of noise and people.

476
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,060
I don't want to go.

477
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,340
If the prince wants to go,

478
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,700
you can go with sister Yunxi.

479
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,980
I heard that lanterns can be placed

480
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,460
to pray for relatives and friends at the festival.

481
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,410
It's said that it's useful.

482
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,140
So why don't we go and

483
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
set the lantern to pray?

484
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,980
We might as well.

485
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,020
Lady Yunxi,

486
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,370
Zhenzhu can't understand.

487
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,500
The Crown Prince only sent

488
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,580
these precious gifts,

489
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,660
and his carriage obviously stopped at the gate of the mansion.

490
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,020
But he don't come to see you.

491
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
So cruel.

492
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,660
Where is he?

493
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
He...

494
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,220
He is in Lady Qingqing's yard.

495
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,580

496
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,100
want to see me now?

Where there is poison,

there is an antidote.

Many years ago, the person who gave me the glacial poison said,

556
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,220
the antidote to glacial poison requires the Chi Yan Qiong flowers.

don't give up easily.

684
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,780
Doctor Wu.

685
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,260
Doctor Wu

686
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,100
I am here.

687
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,100
Miss Wanqing

688
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,900
Come in, please.

689
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,010
Miss Wanqing came to see me today,

690
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,380
s there any problems?

691
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,060
t’s not a physical problem that

692
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,260
I am looking for you today.

693
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,380
I have something to ask you.

694
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,730
Do you still remember that

695
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,820
I brought a soldier here three years ago?

696
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:49,860
Doctor.

697
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,420
He is covered in wounds.

698
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,500
Please have a look at him.

699
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,180
Miss

700
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,500
This person is badly hurt,

701
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,050
but he has a strong will to survive.

702
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,580
Don't worry.

703
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,420
I can cure him.

704
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,020
Thanks.

705
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,570
Miss

706
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,180
However, your own injury should be treated in time,

707
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,820
or it is easy to leave scars.

708
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,740
No, thanks.

709
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,500
It turns out that the

710
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,100
girl who came and went in a hurry

711
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,020
three years ago was you.

712
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,660
I lost my lover and

713
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,620
I was preparing to die.

714
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,820
Doctor

715
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,300
Do you still remember

716
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,580
who I brought back that year?

717
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,570
A few days ago someone came to me to

718
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,500
ask for scar ointment.

719
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,860
He said he wanted to remove

720
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,740
an old scar on the lady he loves.

721
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,380
many years ago.

722
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,140
I didn’t expect that

723
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,170
you have such a deep bond with him.

724
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,780
It’s just that you didn’t know each other

725
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,860
for so many years.

726
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,500
You are right.

727
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,660
The person you are looking for is Sikong Ying.

728
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,820
It's really him.

729
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,740
Your Highness.

730
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,580
Your Highness.

731
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,580
I will invite lady Qingqing.

732
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,380
No need.

733
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,410
I will go in person.

734
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,500
Your Highness.

735
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,740
Your Highness.

736
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,940
Pay respects to my Highness

737
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,780
Zhenzhu.

738
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,050
How is Lady Yunxi these days?

739
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,420
Your Highness

740
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,380
Lady Yunxi is extremely depressed and

741
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,420
sleepless.

742
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,460
You are here to see Lady Yunxi?

743
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,900
She must be very happy to know that.

744
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,980
I will report to her now.

745
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:03,900
Uh...

746
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,060
I...

747
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,540
My lady My lady!

748
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,540
My lady.

749
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,850
Stop reading,

750
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,900
the Crown Prince is coming.

751
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,140
He is at the gate of Lu mansion.

752
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,210
Really?

753
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,020
He asked about you,

754
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
so he must be here to see you.

755
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,300
His Highness must have known that

756
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,660
you have been in a bad mood in the past few days.

757
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,980
So he might be inviting you out

758
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,140
on the basis of the lantern festival.

759
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,500
My lady

760
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,180
Don't keep him waiting too long.

761
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:41,700
[Lu mansion]

762
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,380
Lady Yunxi.

763
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,500
The Lady Qingqing speaks contrary to her thoughts.

764
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,100
she said she doesn't like the prince and

765
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,260
broke their marriage contract.

766
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,290
And yet she seduces him almost everyday.

767
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,700
She doesn't.

768
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,500
A few days ago, His Highness took the initiative

769
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,180
to ask my lady out to the lantern festival.

770
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,940
The prince took the initiative to make an appointment with Lady Qingqing.

771
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,330
There's no need to show off!

772
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,260
So short-sighted!

773
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:13,860
You...

774
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,500
Ridiculous.

775
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,460
My lady.

776
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,820
Yuan

777
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,380
Go and play first.

778
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,580
OK.

779
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,620
Give the grapes to brother Sikong.

780
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,460
Brother Sikong.

781
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,300
Xiaoyi.

782
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,650
This is the grape that Sister Wanqing asked me to give you.

783
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,260
Wanqing?

784
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:07,860
Xiaoyi.

785
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,690
Wanqing just smiled at me.

786
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,620
Of course.

787
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,100
She thinks you are too tired and

788
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,140
asks you to eat a grape and rest.

789
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,020
She is caring about me?

790
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,500
Hurry up and eat one.

791
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,220
Alright.

792
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,300
Delicious?

793
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:24,980
Yes.

794
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,420
So sweet.

795
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,700
I feel that Wanqing is treating me differently now.

796
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,260
Qingqing

797
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,580
you have no idea how happy I am

798
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,060
that you're willing to accompany me to the Lantern Festival.

799
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,180
I have never been to the Lantern Festival.

800
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,420
Wonder how it's like.

801
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,660
I was locked up in a yard by my father since I was a kid.

802
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,180
I have never been to many places

803
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,300
in Qiyuan continent.

804
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,340
We're the same.

805
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,380
We aren't free to do what we want.

806
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,570
Rest assured.

807
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,410
In the future,

808
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,180
I will take you to

809
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,140
all the fun places in Qiyuan Continent.

810
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,740
Why don't you reply to my letter?

811
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,690
Don't you want to see me?

812
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,900
Don't you believe me?

813
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,730
Your Lord Nangong

814
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,140
Lady Qingqing

815
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,260
went to the Lantern Festival with the Crown Prince.

816
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,340
She went to the Lantern Festival with him?
