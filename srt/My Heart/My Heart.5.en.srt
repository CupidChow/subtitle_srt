[Episode 5]

4
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,340
My lady,

5
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,620
it's about the Crown Princess selection.

6
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,729
Your dream will soon come true.

7
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,700
But why do you still look so worried?

8
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,700
The Crown Princess selection is coming,

9
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,450
but I feel more and more restless.

10
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,610
My lady,

11
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,460
on this Qiyuan continent,

12
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
regarding either identity

13
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,330
or witness,

14
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,140
you're the most excellent.

15
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,940
Just rest assured.

16
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,180
Other than you,

17
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,140
no one is qualified to be the Crown Princess.

18
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,139
Do you think His Highness will choose me?

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,180
If he...

20
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,980
My lady!

21
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,700
Please don't think too much!

22
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,060
I've heard

23
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,220
Her Majesty thinks highly of you.

24
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,540
She always praises you and says

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,940
you're elegant, decent and sensible,

26
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,170
with a good sense of etiquette.

27
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,860
His Highness will surely pick you!

28
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,100
See?

29
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,540
His Highness came
to visit you here today, didn't he?

30
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,500
Do you really think

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,100
he came here for me?

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,380
Sure!

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,860
You're also

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,500
His Highness's childhood friend

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,540
who grew up with him.

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,660
Why haven't you finished transcribing
Magic Inspiration Scriptures yet?

37
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,500
I've asked you

38
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,620
not to meet Lord Jin again,

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,700
while you still went to see him.

40
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,610
You didn't take my words seriously, did you?

41
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,290
Father!

42
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,500
I've told you

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,860
Lord Jin is a good man!

44
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,650
You're wrong about him...

45
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,260
Enough!

46
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,579
You'll never remember it

47
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:15,940
if I don't punish you!

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,780
Kneel down!

49
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Please forgive her, Master.

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,820
Lady Qingqing knew she was wrong.

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,860
Kneel!

52
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,260
Please forgive Lady Qingqing, Master!

53
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,060
Qi Yi,

54
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,900
send some guards here to watch over Qingqing.

55
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,500
Never let her get out of this room

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,420
before she finishes transcribing the scriptures.

57
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,220
Yes, my lord.

58
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,860
My lady,

59
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,220
are you okay?

60
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,020
Please stop getting angry with Master!

61
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,700
Your Highness,

62
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,140
I know you don't like to celebrate your birthday

63
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,980
because of your father.

64
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,170
But in my humble opinion,

65
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,020
you should take a bowl
of birthday noodles, anyway.

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,060
Brother!

67
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,570
A single bowl of noodles
is not enough for your birthday!

68
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,140
Too simple!

69
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:24,980
Sit!

70
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,420
Okay!

71
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,290
See what I've brought you.

72
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,940
The hazelnut cake we both loved
when we were little.

73
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,700
I've been missing this for a long time!

74
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,820
Today is your birthday.

75
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,260
You're one year older now.

76
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,730
Do you have any wishes?

77
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,940
I wish to celebrate today with my father!

78
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,900
Nanny Aman,

79
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,060
I want to make some desserts
for Father by myself!

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,220
Okay!

81
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,020
The desserts you made look so great.

82
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,700
They must taste good!

83
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,540
Why hasn't Father come back?

84
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,180
Mingyang,

85
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,660
you came to find me so early

86
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,140
not just for this, right?

87
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,180
I'm here mainly to celebrate your birthday,

88
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,700
and I'd like to ask you a favor by the way.

89
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,980
We're brothers.

90
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,450
Just go ahead.

91
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,220
Tomorrow is my Crown Princess selection.

92
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,980
I hope you can help me as an examiner.

93
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,490
Tomorrow?

94
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,700
Why is it in such a rush?

95
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,780
According to the custom, the first round alone

96
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,900
needs one month to prepare!

97
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,980
Mother has kept mentioning it.

98
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,020
She taught me I need to build a family first
and then pursue my career.

99
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,020
Grand Preceptor Lu is also selecting candidates.

100
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,300
Listen to me.

101
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,340
None of these matters.

102
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,659
What matters is your own thoughts.

103
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,140
My own thought

104
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,780
doesn't matter at all, does it?

105
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,860
You're the most popular man in Qiyuan continent

106
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,980
except for me.

107
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,140
It must be fun tomorrow.

108
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,420
They'll have fun,

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,180
while I won't.

110
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,020
It's selecting your wife!

111
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,660
But Mr. Lu has announced that,

112
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,740
on Qiyuan continent,

113
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,420
all those girls of marriageable age
from noble families

114
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,820
can participate in the selection.

115
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,820
I just hope you

116
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,940
can go there to give me some advice.

117
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,610
Can you?

118
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,620
Mingyang,

119
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,660
it's okay for me to go there to have a look

120
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,340
as an outsider.

121
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,380
But if you ask me to be the examiner,

122
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,460
I'm afraid Her Majesty won't agree.

123
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,580
You're my eldest brother!

124
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,380
You have this right.

125
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,100
If Mother disagree,

126
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260
I'll go explain it to her.

127
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,300
Let me ask you.

128
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Who else are the examiners.

129
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,300
Mother,

130
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,380
you, and me.

131
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,140
That's all.

132
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,100
Mr. Lu is so concerned about you.

133
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,820
Doesn't he attend it?

134
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,980
Because Mother

135
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,580
specially asked Yunxi
to participate in the selection.

136
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,650
For the sake of fairness,

137
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,140
Mr. Lu can't work as the examiner.

138
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,140
Then it's a deal, okay?

139
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,580
I'll wait for your arrival tomorrow.

140
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,180
Don't worry.

141
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,180
I won't miss such a lively occasion.

142
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,260
Well, then I'll leave now.

143
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:58,980
Okay.

144
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,660
To control Mingyang,

145
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,970
Lu Hongzhu is going to sacrifice
his well-cultivated daughter,

146
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,100
Lu Yunxi.

147
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,980
His ambition is so apparent.

148
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,100
Why haven't I seen

149
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,340
that silly girl these days?

150
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,250
Did she get punished again?

151
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,060
Or is she planning for something new?

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,380
His Highness's birthday is in three days, right?

153
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,780
Yes.

154
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,820
Then why did he say

155
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,020
he didn't celebrate birthday?

156
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,140
Please tell me!

157
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,540
I swear I won't tell it to anyone else!

158
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,420
Lady Qingqing,

159
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,100
here's the thing.

160
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,620
10 years ago,

161
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,900
His Highness's father
passed away on his birthday,

162
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,180
so His Highness doesn't like to celebrate it,

163
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,650
and just make it a simple day.

164
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,300
In No Magic Valley before,

165
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
he was accompanied by Lord Sikong.

166
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,620
But now, His Highness is here alone.

167
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,940
I see...

168
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,660
But it's his birthday, after all!

169
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,060
That's so poor if he's alone on his birthday.

170
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,179
Don't worry!

171
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:29,980
I'll come to be with him that day!

172
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,010
My lady,

173
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,340
the medicine is ready.

174
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,419
Come to take it.

175
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,010
You're still running a fever.

176
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,980
Should I fetch the imperial physician?

177
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,460
Don't bother.

178
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,540
You've been having a fever
ever since you came back in the rainy day.

179
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,540
And later you were punished by Master.

180
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,100
It's already been three days!

181
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,940
In such poor health,

182
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,740
you still go to extreme lengths to transcribe.

183
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,380
Why?

184
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,220
Master didn't set a deadline!

185
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,260
Can't you continue to transcribe
after you feel better?

186
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,260
No.

187
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,980
I have to finish it today.

188
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,730
I'll go out.

189
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,820
How could you go out in this condition?

190
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,700
You'll faint!

191
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,300
I'm not that weak.

192
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,540
Baihe,

193
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,620
give me some advice.

194
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,180
What should I give him as a present?

195
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,980
A present?

196
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,300
Today is his birthday.

197
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,540
I want to finish transcribing quickly
to celebrate it for him.

198
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,100
It's so difficult to get close to Lord Jin,

199
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,180
and Master's also against
your meeting with His Highness.

200
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,380
I think we should give up

201
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,940
and find other ways to improve your magic power.

202
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,340
No!

203
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,140
I can give up getting magic power,

204
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,740
but I'm determined to celebrate
his birthday.

205
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,220
You don't know it.

206
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,900
He has few friends, just like me.

207
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,180
And he seldom celebrates his birthday.

208
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,660
But I knew it this year,

209
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,980
so I won't leave him alone on his birthday.

210
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,260
But isn't it your first priority

211
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,820
to get magic power?

212
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,660
I mean,

213
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,060
I can't give up the plan
of getting magic power halfway.

214
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,260
It was not easy for me

215
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,620
to find this solution.

216
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,220
How could I give it up easily?

217
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
And don't worry.

218
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,740
Though he looks uneasy to get along with,

219
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,940
I find he's really a good guy

220
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,100
after I got along with him.

221
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,850
I just think your way of getting magic power

222
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,940
is so hard and painstaking.

223
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,540
Hard and painstaking?

224
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,530
Not at all.

225
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,820
I can appreciate a handsome man
and get magic power at the same time.

226
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,820
It's all worthwhile.

227
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,260
I...

228
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,940
I...

229
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,100
Your Highness,

230
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,260
are you thinking of Lady Qingqing again?

231
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,540
Nonsense!

232
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,810
Even if you are thinking of her,

233
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,220
you still can't see her these days.

234
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,980
Why?

235
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,020
What happened?

236
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,420
It's said she was punished

237
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,740
by Lord Lu three days ago.

238
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
She was also punished to transcribe scriptures,

239
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,700
and was not allowed to go out
before she finishes.

240
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,460
And because she was caught in the rain
the other day,

241
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,820
she's still running a fever.

242
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,140
When did it happen?

243
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,090
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

244
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,540
I also didn't know it until I came across Baihe

245
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,860
at the pharmacy this morning

246
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,020
when I went out to buy something.

247
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,380
Lord Lu punished Lady Qingqing

248
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,820
because she had been too close to you

249
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,170
these days.

250
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,220
Your Highness,

251
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,260
won't you make more trouble for her

252
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,850
if you go to meet her now?

253
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,140
Why did she run a fever?

254
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,820
I've given her Water Panacea!

255
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,100
Water Panacea?

256
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,250
It can cure serious illnesses,

257
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,540
and strengthen the physique.

258
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
Lady Qingqing is just having a fever.

259
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,220
Isn't it too precious for a fever?

260
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,900

261
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,020
Come over.

262

and send them to her tomorrow.

Didn't find anyone?

Then why did I recruit you, the useless man?

to mislead the magic power army.

is hindering me.

344
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,330
Besides,

345
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,100
speed up the search for the magic girl.

346
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,540
I must get the magic power stone.

347
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,580
Yes, my lord!

348
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,780
My lord,

349
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,860
these are the scriptures
that Lady Qingqing transcribed.

350
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,540
Give them to me.

351
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,180
Lady Qingqing is not feeling well these days.

352
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,940
Will you go to visit her?

353
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,460
All right...

354
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,300
Just send some supplements to her.

355
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,220
I'm busy with the Crown Princess selection.

356
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
I don't have much spare time.

357
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,010
Will Lady Yunxi also participate in it?

358
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,220
This doesn't seem to be something
you should care about, right?

359
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,569
Don't you know

360
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,900
what you should care about?

361
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,500
Yes, my lord.

362
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
Your Highness,

363
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,620
do you still remember this?

364
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,900
The prize for the cuju game back then!

365
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,220
Xiaowu said it was left to you by your mother,

366
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,610
and this one and the porcelain fox
in your room are a pair.

367
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,900
Now I finally return it to its original owner.

368
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,780
Actually, I have another little present.

369
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,660
What's it?

370
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,740
I've recorded my voice

371
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,780
in this rabbit.

372
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,940
So it can be with you and relieve boredom

373
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,220
when you feel boring.

374
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,730
Then I can

375
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,060
hear your voice every day, right?

376
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,620
Yes!

377
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
It's so good!

378
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,660
It can accompany you

379
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
when I'm not with you.

380
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,140
Okay, I accept it.

381
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,620
Thank you.

382
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,770
In order to come to celebrate your birthday,

383
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,500
I haven't eaten anything today!

384
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,740
I'm starving.

385
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,900
There are so many palatable dishes here,

386
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,700
and I guess you can't eat them all.

387
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,060
How about letting me help you eat them?

388
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,620
Right.

389
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,340
I've heard from Xiaowu
that you were punished by your father.

390
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,370
Did you get hurt?

391
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
It's okay...

392
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,500
Yummy!

393
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,220
Mr. Lu sets really strict family rules,

394
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,940
then why did you still take risks meeting me?

395
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,700
Because I can't leave you alone

396
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,580
on your birthday!

397
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,380
I also celebrated my birthday by myself.

398
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Baihe was the only one who accompanied me.

399
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,490
So I know how it feels if you celebrate

400
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,330
your birthday alone.

401
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,700
I don't want you

402
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,850
to be alone on your birthday.

403
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:02,900
Come on!

404
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,940

I brought it from No Magic Valley.

416

unable to see the world outside.

426

Does she like cuju?

534
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,700
My lady has been locked in this room
since her childhood.

535

So she can only play cuju.

This is the toy she treasures most.

She's unwilling to throw it away
after so many years.

538
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,060
She asked me to bring

these books and drawings
from outside the mansion,

540

by which she got to know the outside world.

541

while she always dreams

543

to live a free life herself.

I really feel sorry for her.

554
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,770
and had already fallen asleep
when you got home last night.

Please don't take too much wine from now on.

What's more,

563
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,180
the moon last night was round and big!

564

Then please stop thinking about Lord Jin
from now on.

679
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:30,900
May I ask

680
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,220
which family you are from?

681
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,580
I'm not here to run for the Crown Princess!

682
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,450
You can just leave me alone.

683
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,290
Then what are you doing here

684
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,410
if you don't run for the title?

685
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,660
I...

686
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,060
Sorry, I didn't teach her well.

687
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,620
I apologize for my sister.

688
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,500
I'm here to cheer for the Crown Prince.

689
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Nonsense.

690
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,300
Are you not afraid of disgracing Lord Lu?

691
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,860
Qingqing...

692
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,620
Lady Qingqing,

693
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,940
No. 1.

694
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,740
No. 1?

695
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,820
[No. 1]

696
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
I can be No. 1!

697
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,180
Why is Qingqing on the selection stage?

698
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,420
I didn't expect your attendance today, Yixin.

699
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,130
Seems like you really care about

700
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,500
Mingyang's Crown Princess selection.

701
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,820
If Mingyang didn't invite me,

702
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,330
I wouldn't have known this interesting event.

703
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,060
You two brothers are on good terms.

704
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,530
It's good that you come to give him some advice.

705
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,980
But you had stayed
in No Magic Valley for a long time.

706
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,020
I'm afraid our criteria are different.

707
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,700
I have no criteria.

708
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,180
I'm just here to have fun.

709
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,250
But speaking of criteria,

710
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,570
I respect Mingyang's choice.

711
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,100
Why is she also here?

712
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,900
She's not on the candidate list, is she?

713
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
I invited her.

714
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,940
I find her lively, candid,

715
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,340
and uninhibited personality really cute.

716
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,300
Seeing her,

717
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,860
I'll also feel exhilarated unconsciously.

718
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,340
But I also don't know
why she becomes a candidate.

719
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,300
However, I'm so looking forward
to her performance.

720
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,420
The Crown Princess will be selected
among ladies from noble families.

721
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,780
There are two tests in the selection.

722
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,940
Firstly,

723
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,260
appearance and physique.

724
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,260
Secondly,

725
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,820
talent performance.

726
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,140
Candidates will be scored by the Crown Prince,

727
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,340
Her Majesty and Lord Jin respectively.

728
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,580
After two rounds,

729
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,500
we'll pick three of you,
who are gentle with good nature,

730
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,980
virtuous and decent

731
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,540
with graces and virtues,

732
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,380
as well as gorgeous and elegant.

733
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,340
So many rules.

734
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,340
I'm already so dizzy.

735
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,140
The Crown Princess will be selected
after comprehensive evaluation.

736
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,900
Now I announce,

737
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,780
the Crown Princess selection

738
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,860
starts!

739
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,180
The first round, flower arrangement.

740
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,420
Lady Qingqing from Lu Family, please.

741
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,260
What should I do?

742
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,940
Please arrange flowers
according to your aesthetics.

743
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,020
Just put these flowers into this case, right?

744
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
Yes, Lady Qingqing.

745
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,580
It's so easy!

746
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,460
Why is this test necessary?

747
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,740
So strange.

748
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,460
Flower arrangement

749
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,780
should be scored according to the speed, huh?

750
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:17,900
I've finished!

751
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
Is my work that funny?

752
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,780
Qingqing is really outspoken and adorable.

753
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,660
I've never seen any flower arrangement

754
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,620
like this.

755
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,790

756
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,300

Next one!

763
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,620
Zhao Xiu'er, the eldest lady
from Zhao Family, please!

764
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,980
So this is flower arrangement!

765
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,139
No wonder everyone was laughing at me.

766
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,010
So embarrassing!

767

Brilliant, Yunxi!

The eldest lady from Lu Family,
Lu Yunxi ranks first.

00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,620
Congratulations!

795
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,740
Yunxi! You're No. 1!

796
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,060
You're so great!

797
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,540
Next, those who score under five points,
please leave.

798
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,340
The second round,

799
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,970
talent performance.

800
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,010
It's in reverse order this time.

801
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,980
Lu Yunxi is really a beauty
with marvelous talent!

802
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,220
Only she can perform

803
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,780
such a special skill.

804
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,060
I really envy

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,380
her talent!

806
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
She'll definitely be chosen
as the Crown Princess.

807
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,500
She's really a gorgeous and talented lady

808
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,940
on our Qiyuan continent.

809
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,780
Of course!

810
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,060
She's my sister!
