[Episode 7]

4
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,700
So... So you mean

5
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,180
I ate too much, huh?

6
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,820
I don't mind how much you ate.

7
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,050
You can eat as much as you can.

8
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,460
But you need to pay the bill!

9
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,620
Gosh!

10
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,979
I remember Baihe told me that

11
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,180
the residents in No Magic Valley

12
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,940
buy things with silver.

13
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,540
Excuse me,

14
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,740
I-I came to this place for the first time,

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,730
so I have no money.

16
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:05,539
I have seen so many people like you!

17
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:06,860
You have no money, huh?

18
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,340
OK!

19
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
Stay here and wash dishes to pay for your debt.

20
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,410
I...

21
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,820
Actually, I have money

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,220
but I don't take any.

23
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,740
If you let me go home,

24
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,620
I'll come back with money right away, okay?

25
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,380
No way!

26
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,820
Waiter,

27
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,220
how much is it? I'll pay her bill.

28
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,530
All these dishes!

29
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,780
Is this enough for the dishes?

30
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,460
Yes. Yes. Yes.

31
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,540
You can order some more dishes if you want.

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,820
Do you want more?

33
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,260
N-no, I don't.

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,540
Welcome to come again!

35
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,820
Are you following me?

36
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,260
You think too much.

37
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,500
I heard a disturbance from far away,

38
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,660
so I went to have a look. As expected, it's you.

39
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,700
I don't have money here.

40
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,820
Wait.

41
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,940
What do you mean?

42
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,900
Look, we are closely connected these days,

43
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,980
which indicates that our relationship
is hard to cut off.

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,100
As the old saying goes, "People decreed
by destiny will meet from far away,

45
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,060
while others can't meet
even though they are close."

46
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,579
Since we are connected by destiny,

47
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,100
we'd better not cut the rope off

48
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,180
and be tied to the same rope.

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,820
What the hell are you talking about?

50
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,140
I read it in a novel.

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,050
I'm not familiar with this place.

52
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,740
What if I get bullied by bad people?

53
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,820
Listen to me.

54
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,300
I wouldn't look for you if you get lost.

55
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,060
I'm in a good mood today.

56
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,340
You can buy anything you like.

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,500
Really?

58
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,060
Yeah.

59
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,020
Look at this.

60
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,540
Listen.

61
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,060
Have you heard the sound of the sea crying?

62
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:07,940
I can't hear anything.

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,980
You can!

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,660
Bakery!

65
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,700
Osmanthus cake is my favorite dessert.

66
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,700
Buy me some, please!

67
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,660
You've just eaten a whole table of dishes!

68
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,500
But, dishes are dishes

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,540
and dessert is dessert.

70
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,580
How could they be the same?

71
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,780
Excuse me.

72
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,900
Ice-sugar gourd! Sweet and sour!

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,300
Ice-sugar gourd!

74
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,820
Come on, choose by yourself.

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,260
Can you eat two by yourself?

76
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,020
This is for you.

77
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,620
Is this where you live in No Magic Valley?

78
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
It's much better than Lord Jin Mansion...

79
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,820
Stop. Stop.

80
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,860
It's late now,

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,980
so you can sleep here tonight.

82
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,500
But

83
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I should make it clear that

84
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,700
you can only stay here for three days,

85
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,820
and then you need to go back home.

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,460
I don't want to be involved
in your runaway event.

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,540
Three days?

88
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,300
That's too short.

89
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,220
Ten days!

90
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,930
Ten?

91
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,100
No. Just three days.

92
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,340
No! Then seven days!

93
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,500
No. Only three days.

94
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,820
No! Then five days!

95
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,700
Five days, deal!

96
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,180
You're tricking me!

97
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,060
Here in my place,

98
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,420
you can't live and eat for free.

99
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,420
But I have neither magic power

100
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,300
nor silver.

101
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,700
What about this?

102
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,540
You can take the place of Xiaowu

103
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,700
to take care of me these days, okay?

104
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm so tired.

105
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,180
You can live here.

106
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,540
But I must tell you first,

107
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,180
that you need to remember
a few rules for living here.

108
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,050
Rules?

109
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,540
You are my servant girl now.

110
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,340
How dare you protest me!

111
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,370
OK, fine.

112
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,100
First,

113
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,500
keep the room clean and neat.

114
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,450
Second,

115
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,660
keep the bed clean and neat.

116
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,540
Third,

117
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,740
keep yourself clean and neat.

118
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,180
Do you remember?

119
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,970
Y-yes.

120
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,580
Have a good rest.

121
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,220
I do remember the rules,

122
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,620
but I can't promise to follow them.

123
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,540
Let me think about what to eat for dinner.

124
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,420
Why does the fire go up and down randomly?

125
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,940
It has a bad temper!

126
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,860
On Qiyuan continent,
we make fire with magic power.

127
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,180
I didn't know it's that hard!

128
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,420
Are you okay?

129
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm fine.

130
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,820
Look at the dishes I made.

131
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,340
Although they don't look good,

132
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,780
they should taste good.

133
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,500
You cooked only one dish
and got yourself so dirty.

134
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,500
You may destroy the kitchen if you cook more!

135
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,060
That's enough.

136
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,220
You can go and have a rest.

137
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,970
Lord Jin not only boasts great magic power,

138
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,980
he can also cook well.

139
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,660
He is awesome!

140
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,140
Can I start eating?

141
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,820
Just eat. Eat it.

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,820
Eat slowly.

143
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,020
Nobody would grab your food.

144
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,820
This is delicious!

145
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,180
Especially this soup!

146
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,660
What's it?

147
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,580
Cattail soup.

148
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,020
What?

149
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,130
So this is cattail soup.

150
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,059
I learned to cook the soup

151
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,460
from one of my old friends.

152
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,980
He used to cook this for his wife.

153
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,690
His wife must be very happy!

154
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,660
But unfortunately,

155
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,050
his wife passed away later,

156
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,210
so he makes the soup very often.

157
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,100
Each time he drinks the soup,

158
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,540
it reminds him of his wife.

159
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,020
He also names it "cattail soup".

160
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,340
Cattail soup...

161
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,620
Cattail is as resilient as silk

162
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,860
and rock is tough and won't change.

163
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,180
You know this poetry.

164
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,180
Amazing.

165
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,300
The man is like a rock

166
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,620
and his wife is like a cattail.

167
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,140
I was not allowed to go out of home
since my childhood,

168
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,700
so I read lots of novels

169
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,300
and heard many stories.

170
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,740
I knew this line at that time,

171
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,660
and I was deeply moved!

172
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,380
Although people in No Magic Valley
have no magic power,

173
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,500

00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,020
You remind me of my old friend.

346
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,200
Father,

347
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,890
she is the second daughter of General Lu

348
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,340
on Qiyuan continent, Lu Qingqing.

349
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,300
Are you the daughter of Lu Hongzhu?

350
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,220
Do you know my father?

351
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,780
I only met him once.

352
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,900
Great Commander,

353
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,860
I have bothered you a lot today.

354
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,100
Thank you so much for being honest,

355
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,480
See you around.

356
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,100
Father,

357
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:30,780
I'll go with them.

358
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,980
The bazaar in No Magic Valley is so bustling!

359
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,860
So interesting!

360
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,980
We're here to buy things,

361
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,760
rather than play.

362
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,940
Buy things?

363
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,460
It's not my birthday yet.

364
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,180
What should we buy?

365
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,180
It's got nothing to do with you!

366
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,220
Don't flatter yourself.

367
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,220
This mask looks good.
It must be suitable for you.

368
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,220
Have a try.

369
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,580
I think this is suitable for you.

370
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,420
You can have a try.

371
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,460
Wait a minute.

372
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,060
Why do I feel that I'm an outsider

373
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,900
next to you two?

374
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,530
Come and catch me!

375
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,820
Try harder!

376
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,700
[Ciyou Kindergarten]

377
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,380
Brother Nangong!

378
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,020
Xiaoyi.

379
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,100
Brother Sikong!

380
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,660
Brother Sikong!

381
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,100
Brother Nangong!

382
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,780
Xiaoyi.

383
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,020
Xiaoyi. What are you eating?

384
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,660
Grapes!

385
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,380
Grapes, I see.

386
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,360
Have you been a good boy lately?

387
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,020
Yes!

388
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,140
Brother Nangong,

389
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,220
didn't you tell me that you'd buy me new toys

390
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,020
as long as I behave myself?

391
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,930
Did I keep my promise?

392
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,580
You always keep your promise!

393
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,620
You are a good boy, Xiaoyi.

394
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,650
You are so conscienceless!

395
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,380
You forgot me quickly after seeing
your Brother Nangong!

396
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,900
Hello, Uncle Sikong.

397
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,100
You call him brother,

398
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,660
and call me uncle?

399
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,660
My name is Lu Qingqing.

400
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,360
You can call me Sister Qingqing.

401
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,820
These are the presents for you.

402
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,380
Come on!

403
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,930
-Go. Just go. -Come on.

404
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,620
Go.

405
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,220
-Thank you. -Thank you, sister.

406
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,860
Come here.

407
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,780
This is also for you.

408
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,820
I want this.

409
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:29,810
Take it.

410
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,500
Take this. Take it.

411
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,220
Here you are.

412
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,820
Everyone has presents.

413
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,700
These are all yours.

414
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,580
Come on, this is for you.

415
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,660
-Go. -Take this.

416
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,140
Thank you, sister.

417
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,540
Take it.

418
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:39,980
Xiaoyi,

419
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,020
this is for you.

420
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
What should you say?

421
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,980
Thank you, sister.

422
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,300
Sister,

423
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,380
are you Brother Nangong's beloved one?

424
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,020
Kids know nothing.

425
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,820
He is talking nonsense.

426
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,620
Xiaoyi,

427
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,260
tell me bravely,

428
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,690
why did

429
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,370
you guess so?

430
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,380
This is the first time

431
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,900
Brother Nangong brought a sister here,

432
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,380
so she must be very special.

433
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:15,980
Xiaoyi,

434
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,420
let sister play cuju with you, okay?

435
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,300
Go.

436
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,220
Quickly.

437
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,140
Sister, let's play cuju.

438
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,540
Okay.

439
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,020
Special.

440
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,780
Special.

441
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,180
Special.

442
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,540
She is indeed special.

443
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,500
Take it.

444
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,940
Great.

445
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,620
Wan Qing!

446
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,660
Wan Qing.

447
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,650
Miss Wan Qing.

448
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,740
You brought all the toys

449
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,300
the kids asked for.

450
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,940
You really keep your words.

451
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,260
I'll realize everything

452
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,220
I promise to the kids.

453
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,340
By the way, Miss Wan Qing,

454
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,460
the kindergarten was just built,

455
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,650
and you're also new here.

456
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,660
Many facilities and supplies are not enough.

457
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,900
So if there is anything you don't adapt to?

458
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,980
Not at all.

459
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,660
I feel happy to

460
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,660
live with the children.

461
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,020
Well. Then thank you for your hard work.

462
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Just tell me if you are homesick.

463
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,900
I'll give you a few days off.

464
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,260
Don't bother.

465
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,140
Home is meaningless to me.

466
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm used to being alone.

467
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,260
Wan Qing,

468
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,100
you won't be alone here.

469
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,250
You also have me...

470
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,620
You have us!

471
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,130
Well,

472
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,020
let me take it for you.

473
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,140
It's too heavy.

474
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,420
Nangong,

475
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,180
you donated money to build Ciyou kindergarten

476
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,660
and visit the kids from time to time.

477
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,340
You have put a lot of effort into it.

478
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,380
Don't mention it.

479
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,290
Look,

480
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,820
so many kids without their parents

481
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,420
can have a family in my kindergarten.

482
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,420
I feel happy, too.

483
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,020
Play by yourself for a while.

484
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,900
So it's you who built this Ciyou Kindergarten.

485
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,580
Can't imagine that, right?

486
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,380
Nangong has made great efforts

487
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,220
to build this kindergarten.

488
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,940
He is like both a father and a mother.

489
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,340
He doesn't say it,

490
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,940
but we all know he is kind-hearted.

491
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,860
This is...

492
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,780
I'm Lu Qingqing,

493
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,290
She is my... my...

494
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,140
My servant girl, Lu Qingqing.

495
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,820
You never go out with a servant.

496
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,380
Why did you take a servant girl today?

497
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,730
Wan Qing,

498
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,020
this servant girl...

499
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,380
She is not an ordinary servant.

500
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,420
I'm from Qiyuan continent.

501
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,540
You can just call me Qingqing.

502
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,380
Qiyuan continent?

503
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,250
It's your first time
to come to No Magic Valley, right?

504
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,130
Yes.

505
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,020
How did you know?

506
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,140
I can tell by your costume.

507
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,060
But forgive me for saying it straight.

508
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,700
Your clothes may not be suitable

509
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,340
for No Magic Valley.

510
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,810
This place is full of thorns and storms.

511
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,740
Your shoes could be torn,

512
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,260
and your clothes could also be scratched.

513
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,420
Then I'll have a change.

514
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,620
This.

515
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,660
OK.

516
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,460
You are truly a girl from Qiyuan continent.

517
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,580
You don't even mind tearing up your clothes.

518
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,500
unlike us in No Magic Valley,

519
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,980
who might wear each clothes
for at least two or three years.

520
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,660
I have many other clothes at home.

521
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,100
I'll send them to you next time,

522
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,940
Miss Wan Qing.

523
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,740
Don't bother.

524
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,100
I'm not used to clothes

525
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,260
from Qiyuan continent.

526
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,700
Well, since we're here,

527
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,980
maybe we can have dinner here tonight.

528
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,100
Right, Nangong?

529
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,260
Yes...

530
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,420
Then we'll trouble you, Miss Wan Qing.

531
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,420
Wan Qing,

532
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,780
you are busy with the business
of the kindergarten recently.

533
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,100
You must be tired.

534
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,620
Remember to take good care of yourself.

535
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,940
You are so skinny now.

536
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,090
So you've done these things

537
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,620
all by yourself.

538
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,060
You are awesome!

539
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,060
Of course.

540
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,060
Wan Qing is in charge of

541
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,610
all the business of Ciyou Kindergarten.

542
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,740
She not only handles it in order,

543
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,340
but also...

544
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,420
What do you want for dinner?

545
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,420
As you like.

546
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
Anything you cook tastes good.

547
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,340
Brother Nanggong,

548
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,740
let's go play cuju.

549
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,460
Come on,

550
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,370
let's play cuju!

551
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,300
Wan Qing,

552
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,660
are you free tomorrow?

553
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,730
I want...

554
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,140
Tomorrow we'll have a birthday party
for Xiaoyi at the kindergarten.

555
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,500
Miss Wan Qing, let me help you.

556
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,260
How can you do so many things here by yourself

557
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
without any magic power?

558
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,420
Can you teach me later?

559
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,300
Take on your shoes first.

560
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,820
I'll fetch a pair for you in the room.

561
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,340
OK.

562
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,540
Miss Wan Qing,

563
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,220
what're these for?

564
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,980
They all look delicious.

565
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,660
It doesn't seem too hard.

566
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,050
You can assign me some work

567
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,780
and I'll help you.

568
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,420
No, thanks.

569
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,820
Even though I've never done it before,

570
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,420
I'm smart enough to learn!

571
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,180
Wan Qing,

572
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,860
I picked these flowers specially for you.

573
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,260
Do you like them?

574
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,060
I don't like flowers.

575
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,940
Even the most beautiful flowers will wither.

576
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,020
So what?

577
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,260
Everyone will remember them

578
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,860
when they're at their best time.

579
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,100
Sikong,

580
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,900
give me the flowers.

581
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,020
I will put them in the vase.

582
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,660
Give me.

583
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,740
Just give me.

584
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,980
Lu Qingqing

585
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,300
is just a simple and alive girl,

586
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,340
so please go easy on her.

587
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,300
A girl from Qiyuan continent,

588
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,620
doesn't have any worries.

589
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:49,900
Wan Qing,

590
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,530
you don't seem to like her.

591
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,300
It has nothing to do with like or dislike.

592
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,570
She is from Qiyuan continent.

593
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,180
People from Qiyuan continent

594
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,180
use their magic power

595
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,060
to do evil in No Magic Valley.

596
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,180
I don't like it.

597
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,860
Actually, she is different

598
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,330
from other people on Qiyuan continent.

599
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,500
Do you know her well?

600
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,500
Very well?

601
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,540
No.

602
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,380
I just found you upset when you saw her,

603
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,820
so I...

604
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,730
Let me help you.

605
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,540
No.

606
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,540
Wan Qing,

607
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,900
I think you can do everything well.

608
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,700
There's nothing you can't do.

609
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,540
I have neither magic power
nor people to rely on.

610
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,860
I can only rely on myself.

611
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,890
Brother Sikong,

612
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,410
my kite is hanging on the tree.

613
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,060
Can you take it down for me?

614
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,180
Sure.

615
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,060
Hurry up, Brother Sikong!

616
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,740
Xiaoyi,

617
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,300
are you laughing at me?

618
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,340
You naughty kids!

619
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,980
You knew there was a hornet's nest, didn't you?

620
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,780
You were just picking up a kite,

621
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,660
and you got yourself into this mess.

622
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,940
I didn't expect that either!

623
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,660
Brother Sikong, be careful!

624
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,780
Be careful!

625
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,260
Wan Qing,

626
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,010
I finally see your smile.

627
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,100
My wounds are worthwhile.

628
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,460
If this can make you happy,

629
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,500
I'd like to get stung every day!

630
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,100
You'd like to get stung every day,

631
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,410
but I wouldn't like to
dress your wounds every day.

632
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,420
Wan Qing!

633
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,740
Nangong, are you full?

634
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,580
Sister Wan Qing,

635
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,420
I've finished my meal.

636
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,380
I'm going out to play.

637
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,020
OK.

638
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,980
Be careful.

639
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,380
Sister Wan Qing,

640
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm full, too.

641
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,290
I'll also go out to play.

642
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,500
Alright. Just go.

643
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,020
Seems like Qingqing is tired
after helping with the work.

644
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,820
I never did so much work before.

645
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,260
Although it's tiring,

646
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,340
I feel happy.

647
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,380
Are you going to eat it all?

648
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,740
This is the do-it-yourself No Magic Valley,

649
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,570
not Qiyuan continent where everything

650
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,170
can be done by magic power.

651
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,420
So,

652
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,860
each grain is precious.

653
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,890
Each grain is precious.

654
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,340
Very few people in Qiyuan continent

655
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,460
know that

656
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,180
there are some people who can't eat enough food.

657
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,770
The first time I met Xiaoyi,

658
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,980
he hadn't eaten any food for several days.

659
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,780
He was so skinny
and was almost starved to death.

660
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:40,900
Qingqing.

661
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,860
She fell asleep.

662
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,980
Well, you've had a hard day.

663
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,770
Take her back.

664
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
She worked hard today.

665
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,980
She hadn't done any work before,

666
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,300
but she insisted on washing dishes,

667
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,100
and cut her hand in the end.

668
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,260
Wan Qing,

669
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,650
she isn't my servant girl.

670
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,660
I could tell.

671
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,770
Then I'll take her back to Lilu Villa first.

672
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,450
Be careful.

673
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:15,940
OK.

674
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,180
You are still awake.

675
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,340
Well, Wan Qing,

676
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,220
you are always kind to people,

677
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,180
but why didn't you get along

678
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,260
well with Qingqing today?

679
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,180
It's not like that.

680
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,060
Just because Qingqing's from Qiyuan continent.

681
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,340
She is different from us

682
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,340
who live in No Magic Valley.

683
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,300
Actually, Qingqing is different
from others on Qiyuan continent.

684
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,780
She is pure and lovely.

685
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,100
And she doesn't discriminate against

686
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,220
us in No Magic Valley.

687
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,540
Well...

688
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,420
Wan Qing,

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,100
Hello, Sikong.

696
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,219
Where is she?

697
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,380
Who?

698

Firecracker.

00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,260
Firecracker. Firecracker...

702
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,260
She was too tired yesterday.

703
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,179
I don't think she has got up now.

See it by yourself.

705
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Lady Qingqing fled from her wedding,

706
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,940
and the Empress was furious about that.

707
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,170
Recently, Lord Lu has been

708
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,780
searching Qiyuan continent
but failed to find her.

709
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,740
Now they'll probably look for her
in No Magic Valley.

710

If you see Lady Qingqing,

711
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,860
please tell Lord Lu as soon as possible.

Were it not for Xiaowu's letter,

how long would you keep this from me?

714
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,570
Now everyone in Qiyuan knows that

715

Lu Qingqing fled from her wedding,

716
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,180
and Lu Hongzhu is looking for her
with all efforts.

717
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,980
I knew he's looking for Qingqing.

718
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,380
Then why do you keep her here?

719

If the Crown Prince, Lu Hongzhu

720

what would they think about us?

722
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,660
Since late Emperor Nangong passed away,

723

you've always done things carefully.

How can you be so reckless

about this thing?

726
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,220
I have my own plan.

727
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,940
I made an appointment with her for five days.

728
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,580
I'll send her back in five days.

729
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:26,780
OK.

But I have some advice for you.

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,300
You can't flirt with your brother's wife.

732

They didn't get married yet.

So what?

She is the future Crown Princess.
