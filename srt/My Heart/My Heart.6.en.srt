Top three candidates, please come up to the stage.

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,460
They are Lu Yunxi,

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,770
Jin Ruchang,

7
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,180
and the last one goes...

8
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,020
Lu Qingqing.

9
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,780
Me?

10
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,740
Your Highness, please come forward and hand over the embroidered ball,

11
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,700
to choose the Crown Princess.

12
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,380
Qingqing.

13
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,340
Me?

14
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,380
Of course it's you.

15
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,660
Of course not!

16
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,620
This...this thing...

17
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,180
should give to my elder sister,

18
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,290
she got the highest score.

19
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,340
It's supposed to be yours.

20
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,820
What a wonderful sisterhood.

21
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,980
Sister Yunxi,

22
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,020
just take it.

23
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,579
Don't waste your sister's good intentions.

24
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,260
Qingqing,

25
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,460
this is the final contest,

26
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,780
I'll give you scores.

27
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,180
Now the embroidered ball is in your hands,

28
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,060
that means you've got the highest scores.

29
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,100
Qingqing,

30
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,380
congratulations.

31
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,100
I...

32
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,420
so it means I'm the Crown Princess?

33
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,780
Let's announce the result.

34
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,460
Yes, Your Highness.

35
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,100
Lu Qingqing, the second young lady of Lu Mansion, has a tender and gentle nature.

36
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,780
She is virtuous and dignified,

37
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,580
kind,

38
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,410
and beautiful.

39
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,540
So, she was chosen as the Crown Princess.

40
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,860
Silly people has silly good fortune.

41

45
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,860
I'll leave now.

46
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,500
All right.

47
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,290
This is not what I want,

48
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,660
I don't want to be the Crown Princess at all!

49
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,820
Qingqing,

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,420
are you happy today?

[Changqiu Hall]

Mother,

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,620
please let me explain.

54
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,060
You still know that I am your mother,

55
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,380
then why didn't you stick to our plans today,

56
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,940
and choose Lu Yunxi as the Crown Princess?

57
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,860
Mother,

58
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
you help me to choose Crown Princess

59
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,130
was also in the hope that

60
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,620
I would have a happy marriage.

61
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,820
Lu Qingqing is smart and cute,

62
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,900
clerver and lively.

63
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,730
If she becomes the Crown Princess,

64
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,060
it's the same that she can help me to solve my problems.

65
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,930
Besides,

66
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,300
she is also the daughter of Lord Lu,

67
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,980
it will still be doubly related.

68
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,540
Your Majesty, please calm down.

69
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Now that Qingqing has been chosen as the Crown Princess,

70
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,940
and everyone knows about it.

71
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,140
It can't be changed.

72
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,580
It's true that,

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,020
my youngest daughter was lack of discipline before.

74
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,940
But since,

75
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,340
now that she has been chosen as the Crown Princess,

76
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,700
then I'll make sure to strengthen her discipline,

77
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,940
and raise her into a decent woman

78
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,860
as soon as possible.

79
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,940
Please don't worry, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

80
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,820
Forget it.

81
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,580
What's done is done.

82
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,940
Then I'm counting on you, Lord Lu.

83
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,620
Since you have the ability to raise the Crown Prince,

84
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,620
I have faith in your ability.

85
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,940
Lu Qingqing is really out of line,

86
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,620
must be strictly disciplined.

87
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,460
I'll send a nanny afterwards,

88
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,460
to teach her the rules.

89
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,220
My lady,

90
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,940
today, Lady Qingqing made so many public gaffes,

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
but His Highness still chose her!

92
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,540
It is clear that you are the perfect choice.

93
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,060
What's done is done.

94
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,940
It's no use talking about it.

95
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,340
Do you still believe that

96
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,980
she came to the stage just for fun?

97
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,620
In my opinion,

98
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,620
she did it on purpose.

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,220
She wants to compete with you!

100
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,700
But the Crown Prince chose her!

101
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,500
His Highness has always been prudent,

102
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,260
but today,

103
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,500
I don't know why he...

104
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,810
suddenly became so muddled.

105
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,460
My lady,

106
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,900
Does master not care about this matter?

107
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,820
He just let Lady Qingqing be the Crown Princess and do nothing about it?

108
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,780
This will become the joke of the whole Qiyuan continent,

109
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,410
and this is also related to master's career.

110
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,820
Why don't you go and talk to Master?

111
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,180
We can't let Lady Qingqing become the Crown Princess.

112
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,420
What's done is done,

113
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,780
It's not gonna help even I talk to my father.

114
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,740
You can leave now.

115
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,460
Yes, My Lady.

116
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,900
My lady,

117
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,980
didn't you say that you were going there just for fun?

118
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,020
Why did the embroidered ball come to your hands?

119
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,700
Stop it now!

120
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,940
I'm worried sick!

121
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,100
Didn't we plan that

122
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,820
I was going to be with Lord Jin as a couple?

123
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,660
That's right.

124
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,060
Now it's all messed up!

125
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,050
My lady,

126
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,940
It's not impossible now.

127
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,780
You see,

128
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,860
All these years, you've been craving for get magic power,

129
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,140
so you wouldn't be bullied,

130
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,900
and discriminated against.

131
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,700
Now that you become the Crown Princess,

132
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,580
which is the future Empress.

133
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,580
Who dares to bully you, am I right?

134
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,420
So?

135
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,100
So you don't have to

136
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,220
steal magic power from Lord Jin.

137
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,700
But I'd rather have magic power.

138
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,460
Look on the bright side,

139
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,500
now you are the Crown Princess,

140
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,049
you'd have more time

141
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,940
to play Cuju with the Prince.

142
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,340
But Lord Jin is also good at playing Cuju.

143
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,690
Why are you still mentioning Lord Jin,

144
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,340
you are the Crown Princess!

145
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,740
Crown Princess, Crown Princess!

146
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,380
Crown Princess.

147
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,620
Stop it!

148
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,620
Where is this place?

149
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,970
This is the No Magic Valley.

150
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,340
I heard you mentioned about the No Magic Valley a lot,

151
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,660
tell me about this place.

152
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,620
Speaking of the No Magic Valley,

153
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,940
there are four distinct seasons,

154
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,700
and the northernmost part is extremely cold,

155
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
but the southernmost part...

156
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,740
has a wide sea.

157
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,100
The people there

158
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,540
are simple and honest,

159
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,220
they are also hardworking and kind,

160
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,260

00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,950
♫Flower must know what I'm thinking♫

174
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,150
♫Moving with the wind, not asking when you'll come back♫

175
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,380
Lu Qingqing, the second young lady of Lu Mansion, is chosen as...

176
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,200
♫As long as I'm with you I don't care about tomorrow♫

177
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,180
Crown Princess.

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,620
♫As long as we meet, I'll love you always♫

179
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,590
♫I think of you, and this love will never ceased♫

180
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:35,220
♫I run to you as it was meant to be♫

181
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,680
♫I cherish you, only the moon can tell my true feelings♫

182
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,700
Xiaowu told me,

183
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,980
this was left to you by your mother,

184
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
and is paired with that porcelain fox in your room,

185
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,560
♫I will hold your hands to see all the beautiful scenery♫

186
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,340
now it finally be returned to its rightful owner.

187
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,280
♫I won't leave you, no matter how wide the world is♫

188
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,390
♫A flower, a bodhi, a pair of shadows♫

189
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,380
Your Highness,

190
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,460
you've been up all night?

191
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,100
Your Highness,

192
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,100
are you alright?

193
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,500
Do I need to call a doctor

194
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,300
for you?

195
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,540
No need for that.

196
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,500
By the way,

197
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,060
Have you delivered the thing to Lu Mansion last day?

198
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,410
It's been handed over to Lady Qingqing.

199
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,170
Your Highness,

200
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,460
where are you going?

201
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,620
Lu Mansion.

202
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
What brings you here?

203
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,020
Congratulations, Lady Qingqing,

204
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,460
you finally became the Crown Princess.

205
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,060
It seems like you're on your way to success.

206
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,740
I came here to get my stuff back,

207
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,740
anyway, you won't need it anymore.

208
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,940
What stuff?

209
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,860
If you don't like the gift that I gave you,

210
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,820
you don't have to accept it,

211
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,620
it's fine.

212
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,300
But why do you have to destroy it like this.

213
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,980
I've been convincing myself,

214
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,380
that you are not a scheming person.

215
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,900
But it turned out

216
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,580
I was the fool!

217
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,740
What did you take it for?

218
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,900
A play by chance?

219
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,180
A game?

220
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,180
I...

221
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,660
I really don't know,

222
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,260
why it's here.

223
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,020
I never saw it before.

224
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,540
I know that it was your mother's legacy,

225
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,940
so I would never destroy it.

226
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,700
You used the deceased person

227
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,100
to gain my trust.

228
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,500
Lu Qingqing,

229
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,860
I was thinking too much.

230
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,860
Your Highness,

231
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,300
I wish you happiness and prosperity,

232
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,500
farewell!

233
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,980
Don't go,

234
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,330
let me explain!

235
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,700
I... I really have no idea.

236
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,540
Father.

237
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,940
What's the matter, my dear Xi.

238
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Qingqing was brought up in the side yard,

239
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,300
she's not familiar with the ways of the world.

240
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,020
Now she's been chosen as the Crown Princess

241
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,100
and will marry into the palace.

242
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,740
Every word and action she made will be noticed.

243
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,860
But she isn't...

244
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,980
a person of good manners.

245
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,620
If she causes trouble,

246
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,420
she will bring down the entire Lu family.

247
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
So, father,

248
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,380
can this marriage be renegotiated?

249
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,380
I know that you're looking out for Lu mansion and me.

250
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,170
But the marriage can't be canceled,

251
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
and it can't be changed.

252
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,020
The Empress has decided

253
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,060
to appoint a nanny for your sister,

254
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,820
to teach her the court etiquette before the royal wedding.

255
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,780
I understand how you feel about the Crown Prince.

256
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,930
Don't worry,

257
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,860
I'll find

258
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,100
a suitable bridegroom for you.

259
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,780
Father...

260
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,380
since you know what's going on,

261
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,620
then I'll say no more.

262
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,300
I'll do as you say.

263
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,780
You can leave now.

264
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,260
I really didn't know

265
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,180
why it was in my room.

266
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,900
I also didn't know,

267
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,610
why it's broken.

268
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,220
I just went to ask about it,

269
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,140
it was sent by the guard,

270
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,260
while we were away.

271
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,300
So he was angry when he left here.

272
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,980
Tell me, what should I do now?

273
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,500
Perhaps I can go and ask Xiaowu.

274
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,300
Hurry up, go!

275
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,820
Yes, My Lady.

276
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,290
Lady Qingqing was so careless,

277
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,900
she knew how much it meant

278
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,860
to Lord Jin,

279
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,340
but she was still so careless.

280
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,860
She is going to be the Crown Princess,

281
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,300
the gift that I gave her,

282
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,850
of course she won't care about it.

283
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,460
But why did she lie to me?

284
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,300
She said she never saw this thing.

285
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,100
Your Highness,

286
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,220
Lady Qingqing might be telling the truth.

287
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,660
Why?

288
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,180
I went to Lu Mansion that day,

289
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,140
but Lady Qingqing and Baihe weren't there.

290
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,740
So I asked Fu

291
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,260
to deliver it to Lady Qingqing,

292
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,860
so she probably didn't see it.

293
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,060
Nanny,

294
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,300
this is my daughter, Lu Qingqing.

295
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,980
I'll appreciate it for your future concerns.

296
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,340
Don't worry, Your Grace.

297
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,180
In Qiyuan continent,

298
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,060
there's no girls I can't teach.

299
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,020
Father,

300
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,220
what's this for?

301
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,860
I don't want to be the Crown Princess.

302
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,900
Nonsense,

303
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,820
my daughter was talking nonsense.

304
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,170
Qingqing,

305
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,260
you will be the Crown Princess in the future.

306
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,820
You must think twice before you say,

307
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,980
do not joke around.

308
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm being serious.

309
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,370
I don't want to be the Crown Princess.

310
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,140
Qingqing,

311
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,300
you must be obedient,

312
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,580
and learn those etiquette from the nanny.

313
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,900
Don't be impetuous, understood?

314
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,740
But I...

315
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,580
Thre is no "but."

316
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,780
It was you who showed up

317
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,859
in the concubine selection ceremony,

318
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:04,339
then you should be responsible for the result.

319
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:06,619
Nanny,

320
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,060
my daughter is counting on you.

321
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,780
If she disobeys any rules,

322
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,380
do as you want.

323
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,339
I would never interfere.

324
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,579
Yes, Your Grace.

325
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,619
Lady Qingqing,

326
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,980
Since the Empress and Lord Lu,

327
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,540
assigned me the task,

328
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,020
then I must finish it.

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,860
If there's anything you're unhappy about,

330
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,700
please bear with me.

331
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,490
This Lu Qingqing,

332
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,060
acting like a buffoon,

333
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,540
it's really inappropriate.

334
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,500
If she becomes the Crown Princess,

335
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,100
I wonder how many jokes there will be.

336
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,210
Mingyang,

337
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,500
I have told you many times.

338
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,980
Only Yunxi,

339
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,140
is the perfect choice for the Crown Princess.

340
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,770
But you didn't listen to me.

341
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,100
Mother,

342
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,700
Lu Qingqing was brought up in the side yard of Lu Mansion.

343
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,140
She did lack some manners,

344
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,130
but her heart is pure,

345
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,220
she treats people genuinely,

346
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,060
and she's lovely.

347
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,620
I think those are also the essential parts

348
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,060
of being the Crown Princess.

349
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,100
And to me,

350
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,050
she meant a lot.

351
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,820
She meant a lot to you?

352
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,500
She can make me feel delight.

353
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,260
And it was the joy from the heart,

354
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,940
that makes me feel comfortable.

356
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,020
you're not an ordinary citizen,

and the stability of the throne...

363

366
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,860
is for your own good.

I'm not against you.

From childhood to adulthood, no matter how big or small things are,

I always listen to you.

372

But this time, I really hope

373
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,660
that you will give Lu Qingqing one more chance.

so he has no time to supervise me.

513

Even if he knows about it,

514
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,540
he would only be angry for a moment,

515
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,020
he'll be fine after a while.

516
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,540
After all, father loves me so much.

517
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,460
But if the Master asks,

518
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,770
what should I say?

519

Sleeping powder!

you are making another mistakes.

523
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,340
I am doing this to protect you.

524

When the time comes,

525
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,900
you just say, you wake up and don't know where I go.

526
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,620
My father will not blame you.

527
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,220
Although your sister was chosen as the Crown Princess,

528
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,220
the Empress was very dissatisfied with her.

529
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,820
Your mother passed away young,

530
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,380
so, you are like a mother to her.

531
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,540
If you usually care more about her,

532
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,900
she won't be so unruly as she is now.

You were supposed to be the Crown Princess

541
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,420
and you have already been aggrieved enough.

542
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,490
Why do you still give her gifts?

543
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,700
After all, she is my sister,

544
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,220
since His Highness has chosen her,

545
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,180
I will respect his choices,

I'm feeling aggrieved for you.

I don't know.

I don't know what happened yesterday,

but I woke up and found myself passed out here.

And Miss Lu has gone already.

Maybe...

567
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,860
maybe she has gone to greet the nanny.

568
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,580
Lady Qingqing dislikes the teaching of manners the most.

569
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,370
She usually avoids seeing the nanny,

570
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,260
so why would she go to greet them personally today?

571

why are you still reasoning with her?

I think we should just take her to the woodshed

and severely tortured her.

There is sleeping powder in the water.

584
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
Qingqing must have drugged Baihe,

585
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,780
and then ran out on her own.

586

She ran away?

587

How dare Lady Qingqing did such things?

00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,460
How dare she run away from the marriage?

589

It can't be like this, I have to tell the Master.

Father,

609
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,300
Qingqing used the sleeping powder.

610
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,140
Now she has an exaggerated opinion

611

of her abilities!

683
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,140
will be really unclear.

684
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,780
I'm not wrong!

685
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,180
Because if I become the Crown Princess,

686
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,780
I'm sure I won't be able to see you.

687
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,860
How sad would I be!

688
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,660
So I'd rather run away.

689
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,180
My Lady! My Lady! My Lady!

690
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,140
Please help me.

691
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,980
Leave them to me.

692
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,139
My Lady!

693
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,380
My Lady,

694
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:11,000
[Thin strip of sky]

695
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,179
Greetings to Your Highness.

696
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,420
In the past, Your Highness was always alone,

697
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,940
but today you brought your spirit pet with you.

698
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,060
This rabbit

699
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,540
is always jumping.

700
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,620
it's especially restless.

701
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,540
Look!

702
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,219
It just broke my beloved water glass.

703
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,940
I am now taking it to No Magic Valley to be punished.

704
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,100
Let it learn a lesson.

705
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,500
I see.

706
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,219
Take care, Your Highness.

707
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,300
The Lord Jin

708
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,699
often goes to the No Magic Valley.

709
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:31,940
And he doesn't do anything serious at all.

710
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,219
Fortunately, he was not the one who took over the Qiyuan continent.

711
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,780
Lu Qingqing

712
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,219
really does not know anything.

713
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,460
She's so crazy!

714
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,370
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

715
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,500
Your daughter has made such a big mistake,

716
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,179
how can you let me not be angry?

717
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,050
How dare she run away?

718
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,100
Where will my royal honor go?

719
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,300
Lord Lu,

720
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,980
This is the daughter you taught!

721
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,460
I hope that Your Majesty punish me

722
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
for my incompetence in disciplining my children.

723
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,860
Mother,

724
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,700
This thing

725
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,300
must also be out of Lord Lu's expectation,

726
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,380
so why don't we think of a solution first?

727
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,500
If you hadn't insisted on marrying Lu Qingqing as your concubine,

728
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,100
how would this happened?

729
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,220
That unruly girl

730
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,460
is not worthy of the Crown Princess position.

731
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,620
I believe that

732
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,420
Lu Qingqing didn't intend to run away from the marriage.

733
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,580
Maybe she was just stressed out,

734
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,900
and wanted to escape for a few days.

735
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,260
I implore Your Majesty

736
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,820
to give my daughter another chance.

737
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,940
I will get her back as soon as possible

738
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,900
and discipline her severely.

739
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,740
Mother.

740
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,380
Lord Lu has done his duty

741
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,380
and served the Qiyuan continent faithfully for so many years.

742
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,820
I hope you can give Qingqing another chance

743
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,180
for the sake of Lord Lu.

744
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,540
I believe that Qingqing will correct the mistake immediately.

745
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,130
Lord Lu needs to be deducted half a year of his magic crystal salary

746
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,450
because he is not strict in teaching his daughter.

747
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,340
Find Lu Qingqing back quickly.

748
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

749
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,380
Why did I change back?

750
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,940
There is the No Magic Valley.

751
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,100
You can't use the magic powers here.

752
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,260
Would the people of the Qiyuan Continent not be able to use the magic power

753
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,420
if they come to the No Magic Valley?

754
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,260
In fact, in the ancient times,

755
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,260
the Magic God divided the land into two parts.

756
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,940
This land is No Magic Valley,

757
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,940
and the other one is the Qiyuan continent.

758
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,980
The Qiyuan continent is full of magic energy

759
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,740
and has produced many warlocks.

760
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,700
The other land basically has no magic power

761
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,540
and is full of ordinary people.

762
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,180
But in fact, these two lands

763
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,860
are ruled by the Magic God.

764
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,780
The Magic God in order to prevent the two lands spiritual power disparity,

765
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,740
resulting in strife.

766
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,900
So he used up all his magic power

767
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,500
to cover this place with a boundary.

768
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,260
Everyone who comes to the No Magic Valley is equal,

769
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,420
and cannot use the magic power.

770
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,980
That means,

771
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,940
there is no bullying or discrimination in the No Magic Valley

772
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,260
because of the difference in spiritual power?

773
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,540
I guess you are the only one

774
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,580
in the Qiyuan continent who thinks so.

775
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,980
Everyone is used to using the magic power,

776
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,220
who wants to do things by themselves?

777
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,980
But I think these are all excuses.

778
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,410
Obviously, it is more fulfilling to do things by themselves.

779
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,900
In my opinion,

780
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,700
this place is much more lively

781
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,740
than the Qiyuan continent.

782
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,780
All right, I'm being kind enough

783
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,820
to bring you here.

784
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
Let's not meet again.

785
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,620
Goodbye then.

786
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,100
Are you leaving now?

787
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,060
Or what?

788
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,020
I am not familiar with this place,

789
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,860
and I only know you.

790
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,980
What do you want?

791
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,860
You can take me with you.

792
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,620
No way.

793
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,460
You'll

794
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,300
get in the way of my work.

795
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,860
It seems like that he really doesn't want me to go with him.

796
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,460
Could it be that he is afraid that I will involve him in?

797
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,940
Well.

798
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,460
Will we meet again?

799
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,460
Bye.

Come and take a look!

804
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,420
Is this the market of the No Magic Valley?

805

what is this black thing?

811
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,020
Miss,

812
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,420
it's home-brewed aged vinegar.

813
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,700
This tastes great!

814
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,300
Have a try.

815
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,740
Okay.

816
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,780
Try it, girl.

817
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,500
My vinegar has a rich flavor,

818
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,700
and it's mellow.

819
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,660
It's good, right?

820
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:56,900
Merchant.

821
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,130
Your vinegar is mellow indeed,

822
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,540
but the taste is too heavy.

823
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,580
It doesn't fill my stomach and doesn't quench my thirst.

824
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,580
It's not that good.

825
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,370
How can this vinegar have these functions?

826
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,580
It's noon.

Come and see the fans I sell.

The fans I sell are all handmade.

00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,020
I want to try them all.

Thanks a lot.

are you going to leave now?

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,300
Your food is delicious.

That's it.

I mean,

00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,740
Don't you think that you're missing something?

Our restaurant is too small

853
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,780
to withstand your non-payment behavior.

854
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,140
So you're saying that

855
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,940
I ate too much?

856
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,580
I don't care how much you eat,

857
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,980
as long as you can eat it.

858
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,300
The problem is that you have to pay for it.

859
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,500
Oh no!
