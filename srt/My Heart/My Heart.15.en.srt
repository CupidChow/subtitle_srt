4
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,220
Baihe.

5
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,140
I'm home.

6
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,500
My lady!

7
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,940
My lady.

8
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,860
Thank goodness,

9
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,180
you're finally back.

10
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,700
Did the Empress punish you?

11
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,660
Did she pick on you?

12
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,340
Don't worry, kind people like me are naturally blessed.

13
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,900
See?

14
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,100
I'm completely fine,

15
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,060
not even a single scratch on me.

16
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,700
Good, good.

17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,220
Your hands are all cold.

18
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:55,980
Come on,

19
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,140
let's get you some rest inside.

20
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,010
Let's go.

21
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,540
Lord Jin helped you find the fusang fruit?

22
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,699
He really is your lucky star.

23
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,980
If you ask me,

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,580
you two are a pair made in heaven,

25
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,180
the legendary official pair.

26
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,660
Baihe,

27
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,410
what you are saying...

28
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,980
is exactly what I like to hear.

29
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,660
I like it.

30
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,660
Since the Crown Prince has broken off his marriage to you,

31
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,170
you and Lord Jin

32
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,900
can naturally get together now.

33
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,300
Speaking of that,

34
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,940
I have His Highness to thank.

35
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,100
It was all thanks to him.

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,900
I have to show him my gratitude tomorrow.

37
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,700
What a great friend.

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,940
Leave the gift of thanks to me!

39
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,860
Lord Lu, by his level of magic,

40
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,180
could definitely tell that the fusang fruit was fake.

41
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,660
But instead of asking you about it,

42
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,540
he simply handed it to the Empress

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,140
as it was.

44
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,260
My lady,

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,460
the problem was already resolved.

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,220
Why do you still seem worried?

47
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,460
Do you think this whole fusang fruit matter

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,380
is really as simple as it seems?

49
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,980
What do you mean?

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,740
I just don't understand.

51
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,460
With father's ability,

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,900
he could definitely tell that

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,540
the fusang fruit was a fake.

54
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,940
And if he knew it was a fake,

55
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,180
why did he give the fake fruit

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,260
to the Empress

57
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,490
and put the whole Lu Mansion in danger?

58
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,340
It doesn't make sense.

59
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,100
You mean to say,

60
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
Master purposely handed the fake fruit in?

61
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,860
Lower your voice!

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,780
Master doesn't seem like that kind of person.

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,620
What made you think this way?

64
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,100
I can't make sense of it either...

65
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,220
It's just not possible.

66
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,660
What's not possible?

67
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,170
Elder sister, you're here.

68
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:41,700
Lady Yunxi.

69
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,780
Qingqing.

70
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,980
Everything worked out this time,

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,540
I am so glad for you.

72
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,700
Thank you, sister.

73
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,860
But there are some details I just can't figure out.

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,380
Lord Jin said the fusang fruit was swapped for a fake one.

75
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,260
Wo do you think is trying to harm us,

76
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,860
or harm the entire Lu Mansion?

77
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,180
You mean,

78
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,420
this matter was targetting the Lu Mansion?

79
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,180
Lady Yunxi, your tea.

80
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,780
My deepest apologies!

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,660
Are you alright sister?

82
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,780
It's fine, it's fine.

83
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,130
How could you be so careless?

84
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:26,900
It's fine.

85
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,580
I was the one distracted by what you were saying.

86
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,900
Lady Yunxi, I'm so sorry.

87
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,450
No worries, at ease.

88
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,170
That reminds me, Qingqing,

89
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,020
now that your wedding with the Crown Prince has been called off,

90
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,700
are you upset?

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,540
His Highness is a kind and righteous man.

92
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,780
But I only feel for him

93
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,740
as a dear friend.

94
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,980
If we were really married,

95
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,260
I won't even know how to face him.

96
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,380
So, to have the wedding called off

97
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,820
is great news to me.

98
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,500
But I think His Highness

99
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,020
harbors true feelings for you.

100
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
If you don't feel romantically for him,,

101
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,700
it's best to clarify things with him.

102
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,380
You're right.

103
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,580
I'll find a good time to tell him.

104
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,060
Well then, rest soon.

105
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,140
I will visit again tomorrow.

106
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,740
Safe trip, see you.

107
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:28,980
Baihe,

108
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,340
what happened just now?

109
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,100
I don't know why,

110
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,700
but Lady Yunxi's hand shook a little just now.

111
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,180
That's true.

112
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,930
She is usually calm and composed.

113
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,500
But she did look rather distracted just now.

114
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,060
Could it be

115
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,060
because I mentioned the fusang fruit?

116
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,020
You must have been really touched

117
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,580
when she ventured into the Manghuang forest to see you

118
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,980
despite the dangers.

119
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,300
Sister, you went to the Manghuang forest?

120
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,420
Why didn't I meet you then?

121
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,740
I was worried for your safety

122
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,020
when you ventured into the forest alone.

123
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,500
So I went to visit you,

124
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,580
but I could not find you.

125
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,740
Perhaps, by then,

126
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,780
you have already entered the Youhuang grove.

127
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,940
That's strange.

128
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,500
How did you find the fusang fruit?

129
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,660
I don't believe you were the one who swapped it.

130
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,820
Who am I?

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,300
I am the all-mighty Lord Jin!

132
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,659
This was nothing.

133
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,340
And, let me tell you a secret.

134
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,700
There are more than one fusang tree

135
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,450
in the Manghuang forest.

136
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,420
There is one in the deepest part of the forest.

137
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,220
I just had to grab another fruit.

138
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,900
Master, due to circumstances, I need to harvest another fusang fruit

139
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,540
thus I write to inquire about the next fruiting bearing window.

140
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,740
But father knew that fusang fruit was fake.

141
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,460
Yet he gave it to the Empress anyway,

142
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,500
and even conspired together

143
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
to drug Qing'er with the Hehuan powder.

144
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,180
To think that for the sake of the magic power stone,

145
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,820
father would use such unscrupulous means,

146
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,610
to the point of sacrificing

147
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,020
Qing'er's happiness and reputation.

148
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,620
Will Master one day

149
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,500
do the same to you, my lady?

150
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,860
You're right.

151
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,460
I can't just sit and wait any longer.

152
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,300
Only I understand exactly

153
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,620
what the Crown Prince needs,

154
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,890
and only I am qualified to be the Crown Princess.

155
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,860
No matter what father decides to do with the magic power stone,

156
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,620
I will not let anyone else get their hands on His Highness.

157
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,020
For the sake of that Lu Qingqing,

158
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,820
you have repeatedly disobeyed my orders.

159
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,810
Seems like you have grown up,  Mingyang,

160
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,780
and no longer hold any regards for me.

161
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,700
Mother,

162
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,980
it is not virtuous to take advantage of others in trouble.

163
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,659
Have you not always taught me that

164
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,620
a ruler should conduct himself properly?

165
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,420
Using the fusang fruit as an reason to

166
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,460
threaten Lu Qingqing

167
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,820
to marry me as a princess,

168
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,570
is not something I can do.

169
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,940
Mother,

170
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,500
Since the fusang fruit has been retrieved,

171
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,900
let's put this matter behind us.

172
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,460
Please don't worry about it anymore.

173
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,620
Mother,

174
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,340
it will hurt my heart

175
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,780
if you hurt your health over this.

176
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,980
I have always disapproved of Lu Qingqing.

177
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,900
If not for her possessing in her body

178
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,700
the magic power stone we need,

179
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,900
she isn't even qualified to be your concubine.

180
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,300
Mingyang,

181
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,540
why would you for the sake of this unruly brat,

182
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,860
hurt my heart again and again?

183
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,700
Lu Qingqing isn't some unruly brat.

184
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,700
She is the person I like.

185
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,419
I love her.

186
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,299
Love.

187
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,340
You are the future Emperor Nangong.

188
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,580
The Emperor of Qiyuan continent

189
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,740
Your love should be reserved for your throne,

190
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,420
for your people.

191
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,780
Your love

192
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,740
should be used to obtain the magic power stone,

193
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,140
and not be occupied by such insignificant romantic love.

194
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,380
I love my people.

195
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,860
But I also love Lu Qingqing.

196
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,740
She makes me feel that

197
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,660
I'm not just the Crown prince.

198
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,620
I'm also a living person

199
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,100
with feelings and desires.

200
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,220
I feel anxious and lost when I can't see her.

201
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,900
When she is injured,

202
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,660
I feel more pain than her.

203
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,340
When she is happy,

204
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,260
I can't help but smile too.

205
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,940
And when she is sad,

206
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,100
I will feel even more upset than her.

207
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,300
This is my first time loving someone.

208
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,490
I want her to be happy.

209
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,420
I want to be the reason she is happy.

210
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,500
Is her happiness

211
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,340
more important than your throne?

212
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,460
Mother,

213
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,140
I know the magic power stone is important.

214
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,420
And I promise you,

215
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,940
I will obtain it.

216
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,580
But I will my own methods

217
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,260
to retrieve it.

218
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,740
I plead that mother would stop forcing Lu Qingqing.

219
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,620
Doing that will only push her further away.

220
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,340
Fine.

221
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,300
I know I can't convince you.

222
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,140
If you refuse,

223
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,250
it matters not what more I say.

224
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,540
But you must remember.

225
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,540
You have to obtain the magic power stone.

226
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,140
Thank you for your understanding, mother.

227
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,420
I shall take my leave.

228
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,180
My lady,

229
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,900
Will you really allow His highness to marry Lu Qingqing?

230
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,300
As long as we have the magic power stone,

231
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,500
my son will inherit the throne.

232
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,460
As for Lu Qingqing,

233
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,460
if she could survive life in the palace or not,

234
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,020
that will depend on her luck.

235
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,100
Qingqing,

236
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,740
you didn't have to be so polite about it.

237
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
I am more than willing

238
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,620
to do anything for you.

239
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,100
But I feel bad.

240
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,100
So i thought I'd gift you something

241
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,500
to express my gratitude.

242
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,090
Now that the matter is resolved,

243
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,540
I hope you are happier now.

244
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,580
As for the rumour,

245
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,860
I have already sent people to clear the air.

246
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
You have nothing to worry about.

247
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,810
Thank you, Your Highness.

248
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,220
You are too kind to me.

249
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,260
To the point that

250
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,820
I don't know how to repay you.

251
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,260
I don't need you to repay me.

252
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,100
As long as you're happy,

253
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,580
I am happy.

254
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,140
But you asking for nothing in return

255
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,380
gives me a lot of stress.

256
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,100
For me you have defied the Empress

257
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,610
and always prioritized my needs.

258
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,780
To me,

259
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,260
your kindess is too heavy.

260
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,700
I have always treated you as a dear friend.

261
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,700
I cannot return the feelings you want.

262
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,770
[Lord Jin Mansion]

263
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,330
I'm glad this whole matter has finally concluded.

264
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,460
But who would have thought

265
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,540
that Lu Yunxi swapped the fusang fruit.

266
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,420
She has such an air of discernment on the surface,

267
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,580
but secretly

268
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,500
went as far as to frame her own sister.

269
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
The human nature is unpredictable.

270
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,140
Lu Yunxi.

271
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,020
The reason she swapped the fusang fruit

272
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,700
was because she has feelings for the Crown prince.

273
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,450
She did not want Lu Qinging to return to Qiyuan continent

274
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,290
and become Crown princess.

275
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,700
A woman blinded by love

276
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,780
may be terrifying,

277
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,220
but she acted within boundaries,

278
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,500
so she is not much of a threat.

279
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,140
Then what are you worried about?

280
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,300
Lu Hongzhu.

281
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,380
See,

282
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,740
he knew the fusang fruit was fake,

283
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,620
but handed it to the Empress anyway

284
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,940
and conspired with the Empress.

285
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,820
They even manipulated Lu Qingqing and the Crown Prince,

286
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,020
and drugged them with despicable means.

287
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,020
What does this mean?

288
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,660
This means he is certain that Lu Qingqing

289
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,740
has the magic power stone in her.

290
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,650
This magic power stone

291
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,580
was crystallized by magic, using the blood of

292
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,980
the first ever emperor and

293
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,490
the first generation of Magic girl of Qiyuan continent.

294
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,940
They are planning to use the royal bloodline of the Crown prince

295
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,220
to unseal the magic power stone.

296
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,580
But that is his biological daughter!

297
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,540
He would even harm his own daughter?

298
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,700
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

299
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,820
It must be dangerous for Qingqing to stay in Lu Mansion right now.

300
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,020
As long as the magic power stone is in her body,

301
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,860
Qingqing will be safe for now.

302
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,610
But I don't know

303
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,660
what other nasty means Lu Hongzhu will resort to

304
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,540
in order to obtain the magic power stone.

305
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,620
So I'm worried.

306
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,940
I want to convince Qingqing to leave the Lu Mansion.

307
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,940
Where do you want her to go?

308
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,780
To Youhuang Hall.

309
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,620
I hope she'll continue to train her magic with Master's help.

310
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,180
Lord Nangong.

311
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,860
My lord,

312
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,220
At your order, I visited Lu Mansion in the morning

313
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,420
to deliver the item to Lady Lu.

314
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,090
But Baihe told me,

315
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,100
Lady Lu went to the palace early in the morning

316
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
to meet the Crown prince.

317
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,580
Early in the morning.

318
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,860
Look how fast that woman changed.

319
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,060
Go. Let her go.

320
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,020
I'm not gifting her anything anymore.

321
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,900
You can have it.

322
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,860
You were literally just talking

323
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,050
with nothing but concern for Lu Qingqing.

324
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,770
And now you're acting like you don't care at all.

325
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,420
Love.

326
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,580
It really makes a mess out of people,

327
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,220
turning them into fools.

328
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,130
I'm the one who helped her retrieve the fruit,

329
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,340
shouldn't she thank me instead?

330
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,650
All the Crown Prince did was say a few words for her

331
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,540
and she's touched to tears.

332
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,020
How can I not feel disheartened.

333
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,220
My lord,

334
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,140
as for your afternoon plan with lady Lu

335
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,340
at Muxin garden, will you still go?

336
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,140
Nope.

337
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,450
You're here.

338
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,130
Weren't you and Mingyang

339
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,610
enjoying your time in the palace?

340
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,420
What are you doing here?

341
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,660
Didn't you tell me to come?

342
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,620
Why are you asking me about it now.

343
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,980
if you are unwilling,

344
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,140
I won't force you to stay.

345
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,980
You may leave.

346
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,100
Fine, then I'll go.

347
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,220
I'm really going.

348
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,340
Come back.

349
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,130
Are you angry because

350
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,060
I went to meet him?

351
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,860
I...

352
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,100
What's that sourness I smell in the air?

353
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,860
You're jealous.

354
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,660
Is there?

355
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,890
I'm not jealous.

356
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,940
Sure, sure, you're not.

357
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,730
Didn't I come back for you?

358
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,500
You sound like coming back for me

359
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,450
is doing me a huge charity.

360
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,420
Am I supposed to thiank you?

361
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,140
A huge charity...

362
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,540
What huge charity?

363
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,020
Something like this?

364
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,940
What's wrong?

365
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,940
Where do you feel unwell?

366
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,740
It's fine, it's fine.

367
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,700
Just a small matter.

368
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,850
Maybe your charity was lacking.

369
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,900
Qingqing,

370
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,260
I have always been

371
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,740
a man of reciprocity.

372
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,140
Last time,

373
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,730
I left it in a box and you missed it.

374
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,980
This time, I fixed it myself.

375
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,060
You have to protect it well.

376
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,460
Sure.

377
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,260
From now on, I will take care of the little fox

378
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,140
and you will care for the little rabbit.

379
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,620
Deal.

380
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,060
My lord,

381
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,660
Lady Qingqing is not at home.

382
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,820
She went to meet Lord Jin at Muxin garden.

383
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,740
All my attempts to stop them from interacting,

384
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,980
and yet they only get closer.

385
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,700
Qi Yi, make some preparations.

386
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,620
I'm paying the palace a visit.

387
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,180
Understood.

388
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,700
It's so comfortable here at night.

389
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,370
Since my mother passed away,

390
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,140
whenever I was upset,

391
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,860
I would come here,

392
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,740
take a look at everything in this world,

393
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:02,460
and all my worries would disappear.

394
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,220
Next time, I'm keep you company.

395
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,819
I'm taking your words for it.

396
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,980
No regretting it.

397
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,420
You can trust me.

398
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,900
How I wish to be with him like this forever.

399
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,770
It's beautiful!

400
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,420
The Hehuan powder plan was foiled by Lord Jin.

401
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,900
And now he retrieved the fusang fruit

402
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,700
and helped Lu Qingqing resolve the crisis.

403
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,530
I believe he has already figured out our plan.

404
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,660
And today,

405
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,300
He invited Lu Qingqing out.

406
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,500
At this rate, I'm worried that

407
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,060
he will eventually get his hands on the magic power stone.

408
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,860
Mr. Lu, there is no need to worry.

409
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,220
Lord Lin and Lu Qingqing cannot be together.

410
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,260
Why so?

411
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,450
Because he is suffering from the glacial poison.

412
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,460
Glacial poison.

413
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,260
The glacial poison is triggered by feelings.

414
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,860
The more you feel, the more it hurts.

415
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,900
And along with it, one's magic will be diminished.

416
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,980
Once the poison reaches the heart and lungs,

417
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,020
it will become fatal.

418
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,740
Now that Lord Jin has harbored feelings for Lu Qingqing,

419
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,500
the glacial poison must be taking effect.

420
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,660
The stronger he feels, the deeper the poison.

421
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,140
As time passes,

422
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,060
he may even lose his life.

423
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,740
Your Majesty, how did you know about this?

424
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,140
Shall I send someone

425
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,540
to verify this information?

426
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,860
I personally poisoned him 20 years ago.

427
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,370
All to prevent him, Nangong Yixin,

428
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,220
from ever competing for the throne with my son.

429
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,700
Your Majesty's foresight is most impressive.

430
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,940
If that's the case, we can settle things with ease.

431
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,540
If Lu Qingqing knows about this,

432
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,850
she will definitely stop getting closer to Lord Lin.

433
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,620
Then, we can effortlessly

434
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,100
separate the two of them

435
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,780
and take the chance

436
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,220
to pair His Highness and Lu Qingqing together.

437
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,340
Qingqing,

438
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,220
do you know?

439
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,930
That was the first time I have ever seen anyone ride on Taowu.

440
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Back then I thought,

441
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,820
This girl is so bold and so spontaneous,

442
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,100
must be someone impressive.

443
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,100
Well, the clueless are fearless.

444
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,060
The clueless are fearless?

445
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,820
So when you turned into a rabbit and ran into me,

446
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,900
that was also clueless and fearless?

447
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,420
I- I was focused solely on escaping.

Yes.

This is because you are getting closer with him.

613

When you become closer with him,

you are also hurting him.

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,260
My lady,

679
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,090
I once read that

680
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,460
All things in this world compliment and repel each other

681
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,540
Though Lord Jin's illness may be rare,

682
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,060
it doesn't necessarily mean it's incurable.

683
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,780
Baihe,

684
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,850
you are right!

685
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,820
If it's an illness

686
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,340
there must be a way to cure it.

687
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,100
For headache,

688
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,220
for fever,

689
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,860
for flu,

690
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,380
for bone fracture...

691
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,900
Why isn't there a single symptom here

692
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,780
that could match Nangong's symptions?

693
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,900
My lady,

694
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,250
be patient

695
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,340
and carefully search again.

696
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,700
Why don't you search with me?

697
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,100
I will start searching right away.

698
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,900
Knowledge is truly never enough when you need it.

699
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,820
Baihe, come here.

700
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
I just had a great idea.

701
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,570
My lady,

702
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,580
you're so clever!

703
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,650
This way,

704
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,180
hurry.

705
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,580
Baihe, where are you?

706
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,300
Hurry, hurry.

707
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,460
Please tend to my lady.

708
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,620
Greetings, Lady Qingqing.

709
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,140
His Highness heard you were sick

710
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,620
and ordered the imperial physician here to see you.

711
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,700
Send my gratitude to His Highness.

712
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,450
Lingyu

713
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,500
My lady is not feeling well,

714
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,020
please wait outside.

715
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,650
I will inform you of any updates.

716
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,100
Alright.

717
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,290
Imperial physician,

718
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,380
please tend to my lady.

719
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,460
Miss,

720
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,260
pray tell where your discomfort is.

721
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,940
Recently, I caught a terrible illness.

722
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,660
I felt chills all over my body,

723
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,100
my limbs were always cold,

724
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,140
and my heart

725
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,020
felt constant twisting pain.

726
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,900
Do you by any chance know what illness this is?

727
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,060
Recently?

728
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,300
How recent is recently?

729
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,460
I was reading in the study yesterday

730
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,180
and I suddenly caught the illness.

731
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,370
It hurt so much, I could not stand straight.

732
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,580
Miss, is there any symptom for me to check right now?

733
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,340
R-right now-

734
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,180
Currently, well

735
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,300
there isn't any right now.

736
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,700
But I really feel miserable all over.

737
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,820
Miss,

738
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,180
This illness must be vicious

739
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,180
to strike so suddenly.

740
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,980
Please allow me to take your pulse instead.

741
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,940
Take my pulse?

742
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,660
My pulse is very weak right now,

743
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,420
you might not feel anything.

744
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,660
Could you make a diagnosis

745
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,780
based on my description instead?

746
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,900
In medicine, one must observe, listen, ask, and take the pulse of the patient.

747
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,420
The last step is particularly important.

748
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,810
If I do not read your pulse,

749
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,940
how could I possibly diagnose your illness?

750
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,170
Lady Qingqing,

751
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,180
please lend me your hand.

752
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,620
What if-

753
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,860
what if....

754
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,900
I... I draw it out for you?

755
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,820
Yes.

756
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
She will draw it for you.

757
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,180
Draw?

758
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,260
Done. Here you go

759
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,020
Lady Qingqing,

760
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,540
your drawing is too mysterious,

761
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,810
my untrained eyes

762
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,100
cannot understand it.

763
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,170
How can you not understand it?

764
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,940
It's so well drawn!

765
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,820
Cold limbs.

766
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,210
Twisting ache in the heart.

767
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,940
Lady Qingqing,

768
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,860
If you do not cooperate and let me take your pulse,

769
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,820
there is nothing I can diagnose.

770
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,540
Pulse taking is mandatary.

771
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,660
Here.

772
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,980
This will do.

773
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,100
Lady Qingqing,

774
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,140
There is indeed a problem with your pulse.

775
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
What problem?

776
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,420
Your pulse is disordered,

777
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,100
indicating an irregular heartbeat,

778
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,060
your heart is beating too fast.

779
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,180
This is precisely--

780
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,220
precisely what?

781
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,780
Precisely the symptom of someone lying.

782
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,340
Lady Qingqing,

783
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,980
I am a busy person.

784
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,460
You are in the pink of health

785
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,460
this is wasting my time.

786
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,380
I will take my leave.

787
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,820
Imperial physician, please hold on.

788
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,980
Lady Qingqing,

789
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,820
why do you do this?

790
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,300
Actually, the symtoms I mentioned

791
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,060
are from my friend.

792
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,380
Due to his identity,

793
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,420
he cannot meet you in person.

794
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,460
That's why,

795
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,179
that's why I came up with this bad idea.

796
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,130
I see, please tell me more

797
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,780
about your friend's symptoms.

798
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,420
Recently,

799
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,580
whenever I get close to him,

800
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,380
his heart starts to hurt,

801
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
chills start to surround him,

802
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,380
and his magic powers would weaken.

803
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,860
And everytime it happens,

804
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,540
it's worse than the previous time.

805
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,540
This...

806
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,060
illness strikes whenever you get close to him.

807
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,290
Does he like you?

808
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,810
Like me?

809
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,740
Imperial physician,

810
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,330
are you here to gossip

811
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,460
or here to make a diagnosis?

812
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,260
For a great number of people,

813
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,300
illness stems from the heart.

814
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,140
Naturally, I have to ask about it.

815
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,700
What kind of saying is that?

816
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,700
If this illness stems from the heart growing fond,

817
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,060
then I dare say this is the rarest illness in Qiyuan Continent.

818
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,890
I have never heard of it,

819
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,180
let alone treated it before.

820
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,420
I see...

821
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,940
Thank you for the troubles.

822
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,820
If you really care for him,

823
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,540
it is best to distance yourself from him.

824
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,380
His illness is rare and hard to comprehend.

825
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,900
As of now, you can only distance yourself

826
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,100
to stop him from feeling ill.

827
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,460
My lady,

828
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,020
His Highness is here to see you.

829
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,060
Qingqing

830
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,060
are you alright?

831
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,220
Where exactly does it hurt?

832
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,700
I. I'm fine.

833
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,610
I spoke to the Imperial physician.

834
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,700
He said you were fine.

835
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,140
But if you were fine,

836
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
why did your heart hurt?

837
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,340
I couldn't stop worrying,

838
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,820
so I rushed over to see you.

839
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,580
I. I.

840
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,500
I am fine.

841
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,780
I was just kidding.

842
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,860
As long as you're fine.

843
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,060
Qing'er

844
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,420
No matter what you do,

845
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,820
I believe

846
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,780
you have your reasons.

847
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,580
Is something bothering you?

848
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,340
If you don't mind,

849
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,580
you could always share it with me

850
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,820
I will bear it with you.

851
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,460
Recently, a friend of mine

852
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,380
is feeling unwell.

853
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,700
Whenever I get close to him,

854
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,500
his heart start to ache,

855
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,180
chills would surround him,

856
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,420
and his entire body starts to frost up.

857
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,580
I don't know why it's happening.

858
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,180
I can't believe brother

859
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,660
contracted such a strange illness.

860
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,860
Qing'er, don't worry.

861
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,700
Since this involves brother's health

862
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,820
I won't ignore it.

863
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,820
I'll put extra men on the lookout

864
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,940
to learn more about this illness.

865
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,580
How do you know I was referring to Lord Jin?

866
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,220
You don't usually go out much,

867
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,740
and you don't have many people close to you.

868
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,090
So the identity of your friend

869
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,420
can be easily deduced.

870
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,780
Rare illnesses tend to be old,

871
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,540
perhaps there are records of it in old books.

872
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,900
Speaking of old books,

873
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,780
The Library Pavilion in the palace

874
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,660
has the largest collection of books in all of Qiyuan Continent.

875
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,500
Perhaps there are records of it there.

876
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,340
I will pay the Library Pavilion a visit

877
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,460
and see if I could find anything about the illness.

878
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,660
But,

879
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
it will take a while.

880
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,220
Can I visit the Library Pavilion too?

881
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,260
I want to look it up, too.

882
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,460
We might be faster with two people on the job.

883
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,140
Well...

884
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,220
What's wrong?

885
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,580
According to regulations,

886
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,900
Only a descendant of the Nangong royalty

887
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,220
may enter the Library Pavilion.

888
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,660
I'll just find a way to sneak you in.

889
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,660
That's great!

890
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,740
Since we have to do it when no one is looking,

891
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,180
night time would be a good decision.

892
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,900
Very well,

893
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,260
in two days,

894
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,060
I will use a feast as an excuse to summon you to the palace.

895
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,690
Then we'll find a good chance to go to the Library Pavillion.

896
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,740
Alright.

897
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:14,010
[Lu Mansion]

898
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,220
Your Highness.

899
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,250
I can't believe Lord Jin would contract such a strange illness.

900
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,020
This doesn't sound like an illness,

901
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,780
more like some kind of poison.

902
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,780
Who did such a vile thing to him?

903
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,140
But if you think about it from another angle,

904
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,170
If Lord Jin is in this state,

905
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,900
he won't be able to be with Lady Qingqing.

906
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,620
This is a good chance for you, Your Highness.

907
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,140
Do not speak such nonsense.

908
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,220
Romance matters aside,

909
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,700
he is above all, my brother.

910
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,100
If he is sick,

911
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,460
I will be worried as well.

912
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,570
Let's go,

913
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,780
to Lord Jin Mansion

914
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,300
Understood.

915
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,050
[Lord Jin Mansion]

916
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,300
Brother,

917
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,940
perhaps you should stop seeing Qingqing from now on.

918
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,820
What do you mean.

919
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,220
Why are you telling me this.

920
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,980
For your own good,

921
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,780
and for her own good.

922
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,700
The two of you are not meant to work out.

923
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,260
Mingyang,

924
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,180
she is no longer your Crown Princess-to-be.

925
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,420
But brother,

926
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,140
you knew that just being with her

927
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,980
will result in unbearable heartache.

928
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,660
If this goes on, you will die.

929
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,420
How did you know?

930
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,100
Qingqing told me.

931
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,730
I visted her just now.

932
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,860
She is still in Qiyuan continent?

933
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,860
What did she tell you?

934
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,770
Brother.

935
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,860
Perhaps it is fate toying with us.

936
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,180
The two of you are not meant to work out.

937
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,860
You're just going to hurt each other like this,

938
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
stop while you still can.

939
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,860
I don't want

940
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,140
either of you to be hurt.

941
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,540
I'm going to see her now.

942
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,100
She may not see you recently.

943
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,690
You should take good care of your health in the meanwhile.

944
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,020
I will also send people out to seek a solution.

945
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,580
Hope it will be of help.
