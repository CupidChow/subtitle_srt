00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,100
You can do it, Your Highness!

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,780
Come on,Lord Jin!

10
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,020
Lord Jin has broken through the defenses

11
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,980
with his spectacular skills!

12
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,220
Nicely done!

13
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,300
Here comes Lord Jin

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,220
with a back flip kick!

15
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,260
And shoot!

16
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,650
What a pity!

17
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,380
The Crown Prince stopped the ball

18
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,100
with his head.

19
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,579
Spectacular!

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,740
Absolutely spectacular!

21
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,220
Such a pity...

22
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,140
Come on, another try.

23
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,500
Yeah!

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,740
You can do it!

25
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,579
My lady,

26
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,900
who do you think will win this match?

27
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,380
That's a foul! He used magic!

28
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,260
Team Crown Prince used magic.

29
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,860
Leave the field!

30
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,860
Why are they sending him off the field?

31
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,900
You must be a newcomer.

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,020
He broke the rules.

33
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,340
Lord Jin set the rules for this match.

34
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,380
No magic is allowed in Cuju.

35
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,100
No magic allowed?

36
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,090
That's perfect for me!

37
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:39,930
Nice!

38
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,220
Goal!

39
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:42,980

[One]

41
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,700
Listen up,

42
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,060
Their strategy is very simple,

43
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,810
there's no need to worry.

44
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,500
You guys are doing it all wrong.

45
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,380
If you had blocked him earlier,

46
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,940
he wouldn't even get the chance to shoot.

47
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,420
You should pass the ball to Lord Jin more.

48
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,140
Their defense is weakest at the right,

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
so you need to aim there, understand?

50
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,700
Who dares to criticizes us?

51
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,300
Where did such a rude guy come from.

52
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,260
Oh shut up.

53
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,900
Referee.

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,660
Yes, captain?

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
My team would like to switch players.

56
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,899
Alright,

57
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,060
Team Lord Jin has switched the player

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,740
at the Zhengxie position.

59
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,140
Will Team Lord Jin turn the tide

60
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,170
after switching players?

61
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,490
Let us look forward to it

62
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,340
My lady,

63
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,380
doesn't that person look familiar?

64
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,860
They look like...

65
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,860
Lady Qingqing!

66
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,740
A skilled move from the Crown Prince!

67
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,610
He has snatched the ball

68
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,780
and immediately began his offense!

69
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,620
Awesome!

70
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,020
I knew you could do it!

71
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,450
You're amazing my lady!

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,420
A goal! A goal!

00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,180

My lady,

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,540
She really is Lady Qingqing!

78
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
How dare she disguise herself as a man and join the match!

79
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,140
You've got skills

80
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,020
You too.

81
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,940
I won't go easy on you.

82
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,900
Me too.

83
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,060
Are you alright?

84
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,060
Yeah.

85
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,260
That's a relief.

86
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,890
Come on.

87
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,610
Did you sprain your ankle?

88
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,140
I'm fine.

89
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,740
We're ending the match here.

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,060
We can't!

91
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,659
I want us to win.

92
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,740
I want to win the prize for you.

93
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,180
Don't worry,

94
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,460
I'm completely fine.

95
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,180
See?

Come on, let's continue!

Let's go,

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,980
we're resuming!

99
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,380
Lady Qingqing is becoming more and more presumptuous!

100
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,620
How could she do that with a man?

101
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,250
The shame she brings to the family!

102
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,340
My god!

103
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,900
How did that ball score the goal?

104
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,780
It happened so fast,

105
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
even I couldn't see it clearly!

106
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,940
Foul!

107
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,300
Team Lord Jin used magic.

108
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,980
It's not me!

109
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,940
Was it you?

110
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,260
I didn't!

111
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,740
Maybe you're too used to using magic everyday

112
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,020
and used it out of reflex just now.

113
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,740
No way!

114
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,460
That force of magic didn't come from my direction.

115
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,020
Could it be that

116
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,659
I suddenly had magic just now?

117
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:28,340
It's me, it's me.

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,460
I accidentally used magic.

119
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,970
You used magic?

120
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,620
What happened?

121
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,540
Shut up.

122
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,940
Keep an eye on her for me.

123
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,659
Alright, resume!

124
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,700
Sure.

125
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,540
Let's go!

126
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,460
The source of that magic just now

127
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,060
was clearly Lady Qingqing.

128
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,260
We won!

129
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,980
Goal! Goal!

130
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,700
Team Lord Jin scored another goal just before time's up!

131
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,100
Let us congratulate Team Lord Jin

We won we won!

136
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,659
You're good!

137
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,850
My lady!

138
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,860
I knew you could do it!

139
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,340
Of course!

140
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,860
My lady,

141
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,300
I knew you had it in you!

142
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,300
We won!

143
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,540
How is that possible?

144
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,210
How could His Highness

145
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,020
lose to Lady Qingqing?

146
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Qing'er is becoming more and more willful.

147
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,820
Don't be angry, my lady.

148
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,860
His Highness

149
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,620
must have purposely gone easy on her.

150
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,260
No,

151
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,300
I mean,

152
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,020
his Highness did not go easy on her.

153
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
I was wrong!

154
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,300
My lady, my lady!

155
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,540
Qingqing, congratulations.

156
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,140
so Your Highness knew it was me all along?

157
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,060
Next time,

158
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,660
I'll allow girls on the field,too.

159
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,940
Then, you won't need a disguise anymore.

160
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,570
You promise?

161
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,460
You have my words.

162
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,300
What's wrong?

163
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,740
Unhappy that you didn't get the prize

164
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,780
you came here for?

165
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,260
Why don't you ask Lady Qingqing to give it back?

166
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
She admires you so much anyway,

167
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,180
I bet if you sacrifice your appeal for a bit...

168
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
It's just a prize,

169
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,860
there's no need.

170
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,180
But why didn't you expose her doing?

171
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,210
You even helped her.

172
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,860
She just wanted to play some Cuju,

173
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,580
what for expose her?

174
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,620
She used magic!

175
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,860
That's against our rules.

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,540
And since when was I a rule-abiding person?

177
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,100
What's my life philosophy?

178
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,620
Do as the heart will.

179
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,970
Besides, I think

180
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,440
she didn't mean to use her magic today.

181
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
She suddenly had magic, and couldn't control it.

182
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
You used to hate

183
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,340
people who abuse their magic.

184
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,740
To think now you're taking the blame for her.

185
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,180
Since she stepped onto the field,

186
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,100
your gaze

187
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,840
never left her.

188
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,900
She's likely

189
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,140
sent here by Lu Hongzhu to keep an eye on me.

190
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,580
Of course I have to keep her in my sight.

191
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,660
You and your excuses.

192
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,620
But my view of her

193
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,760
has changed quite a bit today.

194
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,740
She's a pretty nice person.

195
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,820
Frank, direct,

196
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,820
and pretty cute.

197
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,450
Just look at how hard she worked

198
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,580
for our victory today.

199
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,220
It's a pity that she is just a pawn for Lu Hongzhu.

200
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,340
if she marries the Crown Prince instead,

201
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,980
you're in for some tears.

202
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,900
What kind of mismatched couple are you suggesting?

203
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,850
I'm telling you,

204
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,090
it's possible!

205
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,450
Mingyang looked out for her through the second half of the match.

206
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,380
How else did you think won?

207
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,900
Think about it.

208
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,380
Lu Qingqing is unruly and ill-mannered.

209
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,780
How could the Empress possibly like her?

210
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,540
And how would she possibly

211
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,740
be a candidate for the Crown Princess?

212
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,100
What matters is that the Crown Prince likes her.

213
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,460
What could Mingyang possibly like about her?

214
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,580
Her pretty looks, for example.

215
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,820
Plain and tasteless.

216
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,540
She's naive.

217
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,180
You mean foolish.

218
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,460
What about friendly and welcoming?

219
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,410
Can't tell the good from the bad.

220
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,020
Fine, keep denying.

221
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,540
Your Highness, Lord Jin.

222
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,620
Your Grace, Sikong.

223
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,660
You were spectacular today, Miss Qingqing.

224
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,620
You both knew it was me?

225
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,780
You only fooled yourself.

226
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,060
No matter,

227
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,380
I won the match

228
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,060
and got the prize anyway.

229
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,700
You called me just now?

230
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,660
Alright,

231
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,140
enjoy your chat, I'll take my leave first.

232
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,740
Thank you.

233
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,060
What for?

234
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,500
On the field just now,

235
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,380
I think I really did use magic.

236
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,100
But I too have no idea how

237
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,620
I suddenly had magic.

238
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,020
Seems like Miss dud is not so useless after all.

239
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,780
You're not as aloof and indifferent

240
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,660
as people said too.

241
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,460
Such a cute rabbit!

242
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,700
But,

243
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,130
are you sure Lord Jin likes this?

244
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,940
Xiaowu wouldn't lie to us, right?

245
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,250
Not at all,

246
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,740
One of the spectators told me that

247
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,260
this was a dowry belonging to Lord Jin's mother.

248
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,620
It used to be a pair,

249
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,980
the other half being a fox.

250
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,620
The fox has always been with Lord Jin

251
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,690
and he greatly treasures it.

252
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,700
But the rabbit

253
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
was unfortunately lost when he was young.

254
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,940
Lord Jin joined the Cuju match this time

255
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,020
specially for this rabbit.

256
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,420
Good thing I won the match.

257
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,100
What's wrong?

258
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,860
Let me check.

259
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,780
Baihe?

260
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,900
Baihe, Baihe!

261
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
There, you're fine now.

262
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,940
You saved us again.

263
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,380
How are you?

264
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,980
Are you hurt?

265
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,330
No.

266
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,940
Thank you, your Highness.

267
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,900
If not for you,

268
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,020
we'd have been dead by now.

269
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,980
Don't mention it.

270
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,100
But,

271
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,180
this is the second assassination attempt made against you.

272
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
Do you have any enemies?

273
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,740
Of course not.

274
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,620
We have always been cautious,

275
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,100
there is no reason for anyone to kill us.

276
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,740
Then why are there

277
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,940
always people trying to assassinate you?

278
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,410
If I didn't come this way to run some errands,

279
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,500
you would have died right here.

280
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,180
We don't know

281
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,100
who we have offended either.

282
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,180
Who knows if we will meet another assassination attempt

283
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,620
on our way back home.

284
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,970
To prevent unnecessary trouble,

285
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,900
let me send you two home.

286
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:26,170
[Qingyun Mansion]

287
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,020
I bid you farewell.

288
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,700
Don't bother to see me out.

289
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:32,430
[Lingqing Court]

290
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,900
Lord Jin

291
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,700
At ease.

292
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,380
The Lu Household sure knows its methods.

293
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,300
To think they orchestrated the entire scene themselves.

294
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,540
Alright, you can get up now.

295
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,500
He's already gone,

296
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,060
no need to pretend in front of your father.

297
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,660
Did you actually fall asleep?

298
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,740
Wake up!

299
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:04,970
Father.

300
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,420
What brought you here?

301
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,540
I heard you've gotten close to Lord Jin lately,

302
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,940
and that you're quite trusted by him.

303
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,820
That's right.

304
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,730
We even worked together

305
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,060
and won a Cuju match today.

306
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,220
Cuju match?

307
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
But girls are not allowed to take part in that.

308
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,900
Father,

309
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,220
my head suddenly hurts!

310
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,060
So does my back, my leg, and my neck.

311
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,620
The man in black must have hurt me.

312
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,340
Please go back for now, I'm going to rest.

313
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,060
Alright.

314
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,820
Since Qing'er is injured,

315
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,500
better stay home and nurse your injuries.

316
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,620
Don't go anywhere for a while.

317
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,660
Your grace.

318
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,980
Play a game of chess with me.

319
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,300
Understood.

320
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,300
Does Lady Qingqing have magic or not?

321
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
I clearly sensed Lady Qingqing's magic

322
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,820
at the Cuju match today,

323
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,900
so I tested her again.

324
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,820
But in the midst of it,

325
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,220
an exceptionally strong magic barrier

326
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,660
suddenly appeared

327
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,690
by Lady Qingqing's side.

328
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,340
I had no way to break through it,

329
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,580
so I could only give up.

330
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,380
A magic barrier!

331
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,620
Mother, you're here.

332
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,860
It's already late,

333
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,220
shouldn't you be resting?

334
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,620
So you know it's late.

335
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,580
What kind of Crown Prince

336
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,060
would run off in the middle of court session

337
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
to play Cuju with Nangong Yixin?

338
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,020
Mother,

339
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,820
the Cuju match was agreed upon by brother and I.

340
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
It only happens once every four years.

341
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,180
How can he possible compare to you?

342
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,820
You are meant to inherit the throne in the future,

343
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,980
and he is but an idle lord

344
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,060
The more he ignores his duties, the better.

345
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,579
But you cannot.

346
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,700
Brother is just used to doing what he likes,

347
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,050
he is not as bad as you think.

348
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,140
Oh, you.

349
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,460
You're just blinded by him,

350
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,060
nothing I say now will get to you.

351
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,660
You must think I'm purposely picking on him,

352
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,740
and on you.

353
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,020
Mother,

354
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,579
that is not what I mean.

355
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,140
Mingyang,

356
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,020
The magic power stone has been lost in the No Magic Valley for twenty years,

357
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,860
and Nangong Yixin had stayed there all those years.

358
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,060
If you tell me Nangong Yixin

359
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,740
has no desire for the magic power stone at all,

360
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,180
I won't believe you.

361
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,540
And if he really got his hands on the magic power stone,

362
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,420
have you ever considered the consequences?

363
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,700
Mother, that is not possible.

364
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,020
Brother isn't that kind of person.

365
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,780
You may know a person's face, but not his mind.

366
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,820
Mingyang,

367
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,780
you are still too young,

368
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,220
and take things for granted.

369
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,620
If you won't listen to my advice anymore,

370
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,820
Then I'll choose someone who can make you listen to her.

371
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,420
Mother, what do you mean?

372
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,780
Since you have already been crowned,

373
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,580
it is time to arrange your marriage.

374
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,300
I have already delivered the news

375
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,940
to all the ministers' daughters of age.

376
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,260
As soon as an auspicious date is determined,

377
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,100
they will gather in the palace for the Crown Princess selection.

378
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,700
Mother,

379
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,380
we're currently busy with nation matters,

380
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,620
and the magic power stone is still missing.

381
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,420
Choosing a princess now is-

382
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,580
No need to worry about this,

383
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,060
I will have everything arranged.

384
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:32,490
[Dicui Pavilion]

385
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,860
Why is Lady Qingqing not at the table yet?

386
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,020
Master,

387
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
I went to inform lady Qingqing about meal time just now,

388
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,060
and found that she was still sleeping.

389
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,300
So I did not bother her any further.

390
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,420
Still sleeping?

391
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,460
Father,

392
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,380
did you not tell Qing'er

393
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,020
to focus on her magic training recently?

394
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,140
I saw her training very hard lately,

395
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,970
perhaps she is too tired

396
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,810
and slept in.

397
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,020
Why don't I accompany you to the palace in the afternoon?

398
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,780
Since she's working so hard,

399
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
I'll let her get some rest.

400
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,140
Good, come to the palace with me.

401
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,300
Maybe you can help with

402
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,780
preparations for the Crown princess selection.

403
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,700
Let's eat.

404
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,330
Lu Hongzhu most definitely dispatched more manpower.

405
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
I suggested yesterday that

406
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,780
General Murong also send some people over.

407
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,020
He is a righteous man

408
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,580
dedicated to his work.

409
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,300
So I hope this arrangement will restrict Lu Hongzhu's plans.

410
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,860
Lu Hongzhu has a lot of power in his hands,

411
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,620
and the Crown Prince is constantly restricted by him.

412
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,300
This is not a good time for you to butt in.

413
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,100
It doesn't matter if

414
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,540
I butt in now or later.

415
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,660
Even if I don't interfere at all, he won't let me off.

416
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,780
Our priority now is finding the magic power stone.

417
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,300
We must not let the stone

418
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,260
fall into Lu Hongzhu's hands.

419
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,100
Else, the future of Nangong royal family is bleak.

420
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,900
Rest assured,

421
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,940
I'll send my father a message soon

422
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,530
and ask for more men to keep an eye on Lu Hongzhu.

423
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,940
If they find the magic power stone,

424
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,100
seize it before him.

425
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,460
We must not relax our

426
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,300
investigations on Lu Hongzhu.

427
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,020
It was mentioned in my father's secret edict

428
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,180
that his death was caused by bad guys.

429
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,780
So I hope to find out

430
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,020
what happened 20 years ago.

431
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,740
May be it's helpful for the current predicament.

432
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,820
Matters from twenty years ago,

433
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,260
as the leader of No Magic Valley,

434
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,980
perhaps my father knows about that.

435
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,490
I will go back and ask him.

436
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,140
Alright.

437
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,340
Baihe,

438
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,460
hurry up!

439
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,700
Lady Yunxi.

440
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,300
Oh, my elder sister,

441
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,460
it's you!

442
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,380
I thought it was Dad.

443
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,300
Since you are not sick,

444
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,380
why do you to pretend?

445
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,260
I am afraid of being punished by father.

446
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,060
You still know the fear!

447
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,210
I think you are not afraid at all.

448
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,180
Qing'er,

449
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,020
yesterday you were dressed as a man and went to the Cuju field.

450
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
The behave is extremely badly.

451
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,780
But you are still impenitent,

452
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,940
and try to quibble for yourself.

453
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,100
Coming up with this way of pretending to be sick

454
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,450
is really out of line!

455
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,740
I know I made a mistake.

456
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,580
You have never change it though you know it,

457
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,570
and you'll do next time.

458
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,620
You’ve always been like this since young.

459
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,220
You were lucky to have not been exposed yesterday.

460
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,300
if you were exposed,

461
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,020
where would you put the Lu mansion?

462
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,020
My elder sister, rest assured.

463
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,020
I won't do it again.

464
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,940
The Crown Prince said yesterday

465
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,020
that he will hold women's Cuju competitions in the future.

466
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,220
Then, regardless of gender,

467
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,300
everyone can take part in it.

468
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,220
Crown Prince deals with a host of problems every day,

469
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,140
and you still bother him with such leisure and mundane matters

470
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,860
like Cuju.

471
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,730
I didn't say it.

472
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,020
He said it at first.

473
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,140
He said I am good at Cuju

474
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,340
and it is a pity not to play it.

475
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,610
I think Qingqing is fine,

476
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
there is no need to visit at all.

477
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,420
Zhenzhu,

478
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,140
put the fruits down.

479
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,780
We're leaving.

480
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,620
Yes.

481
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,850
Why did she get angry all of a sudden?

482
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,700
Yeah.

483
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I really don't understand what

484
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,820
goes on at the Imperial Court.

485
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,620
Will organizing a women's Cuju competition

486
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,100
really trouble the Crown prince?

487
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,860
But it sounds so exciting,

488
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,940
and I really want to compete on the field.

489
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,260
Why don't we ask Lord Jin?

490
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,780
My lady,

491
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,620
I think you just want to see Lord Jin.

492
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,420
I just want to verify

493
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,660
if lord Jin can really grant me magic power.

494
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
Just forget it.

495
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,580
Every time，

496
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,660
you vowed to say that you want magic power,

497
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,980
but you forgot everything when you saw Lord Jin.

498
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,890
[Lord Jin mansion]

499
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,210
He isn't in?

500
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,140
Yes.

501
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,460
Lord Nangong stays out today.

502
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,820
If Miss Lu has something to say,

503
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
you can tell me

504
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,300
and I will pass it on to Lord Nangong.

505
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,540
Where did he go?

506
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,420
He didn't say when he left.

507
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,260
Well, when will he come back?

508
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,780
I don't know.

509
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,740
What should I do?

510
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,650
I have an appointment with Lord Jin.

511
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,650
Come in, please.

512
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,500
Didn't you say that Lord Nangong is not here?

513
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,980
That's what Lord Nangong said.

514
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,100
He isn't in today.

515
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,210
He doesn't want to meet me.

516
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,340
Why?

517
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:34,900
Baihe,

518
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,820
What do you think of it?

519
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,660
Does he also think

520
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,940
I'm out of dignity in the Cuju field pretending to be a man?

521
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,580
He won't.

522
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,980
Maybe he has another appointment today,

523
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,140
so he isn't able to meet you.

524
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,020
But he can say next time,

525
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,940
why did he say he is not in?

526
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,810
Since he doesn't want to meet us,

527
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,620
we'll have to go with a different approach.

528
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,730
Baihe,

529
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,540
my lady

530
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,410
We will arrive soon.

531
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,340
Just bear it.

532
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,140
Baihe,

533
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,620
are you talking to me?

534
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,500
No.

535
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,420
Yes! I mean yes!

536
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,180
I said,

537
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,660
you look so energetic today.

538
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,900
Recently,

539
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,540
I have started training with Lord Jin,

540
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,500
and I have made some progress.

541
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,500
Following the high magic power of Lord Jin,

542
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,460
you will definitely be able to do it.

543
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,260
Baihe,

544
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,260
we're almost there.

545
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,500
Greetings, Lord Jin

546
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,860
Why are you here again?

547
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,380
Lady Qingqing is grateful for the life-saving grace of Lord Jin.

548
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,260
She has sent me to deliver this gift.

549
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,260
A teacup?

550
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,700
For what reason?

551
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,220
My lady said that

552
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,300
although this cup is inexpensive,

553
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,020
it can accompany you every day.

554
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,340
The gift itself may be small, but the goodwill is deep.

555
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,780
So glib-tongued!

556
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,820
Alright,

557
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,540
Go back and tell your lady,

558
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,780
I have received the gift,

559
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,060
but there is no need to meet.

560
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,700
Lord Jin

561
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,220
This cup must be handled with care.

562
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,940
Anything else?

563
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,090
Xiaowu,

564
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,100
be careful!

565
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,340
Do not break it.

566
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,620
Alright.

567
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,130
Xiaowu,

568
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Come in.

569
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,300
Lord Jin,

570
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,300
this new cup...

571
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,700
Just put there.

572
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,420
The old cup still feels better in hand.

573
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,500
Her taste is just terrible.

574
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,130
It looks nothing like what I'd fancy.

575
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,300
How is my taste bad?

576
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,260
It's obviously such a cute design.

577
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,140
My ink stick is all used up.

578
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,620
Get me another one.

579
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,620
Yes.

580
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,780
Lady Qingqing of Lu mansion,

581
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,420
in order to approach me,

582
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,940
is doing everything she can.

583
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,980
And today she gifts me a teacup?

584
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,140
What does she mean?

585
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
Keeping you around would be an eyesore.

586
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,700
Shall I throw it?

587
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,820
Catch it, don't break it!

588
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,890
Oh, that scared me.

589
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,700
Lord Jin,

590
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,700
Look at its pattern again

591
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,380
its material,

592
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,100
and its shape and color.

593
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,180
Isn't it inappropriate to throw it away?

594
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,770
Something smells nice!

595
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,180
Drinking good tea without telling me again.

596
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,060
I heard that Lu Qingqing came to find you,

597
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,220
but you didn’t meet her.

598
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
Shall we take a stroll instead?

599
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,380
I am tired and don't want to go.

600
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,620
You didn't go outside and

601
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,140
you didn't meet her,

602
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,380
What do you mean?

603
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,180
What, just because she wants to meet me,

604
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,060
I have to meet her?

605
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,940
This cup looks so nice.

606
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,900
Don't touch it, give me.

607
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,460
I have magic again!

608

It turns out that I can get magic power without biting him

609
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,820
What kind of precious things is it

610
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,420
that I can't even touch it?

611
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,060
It is not precious.

612
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,020
This is what I have used.

613
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,300
If you want some tea,

614
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,180
I will get Xiaowu to give you another one.

615
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,900
Used? Used...

616

Obviously,you are lying.

Does it not hurt your conscience to treat me like this all the time?

621
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,260

I will forgive you.

Amazing!

What't the meaning of "Ou" ?

628
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,020
The meaning of "Ou" is

629
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,500
if you continue to be angry with me,

630
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,220
I don't mind.

631

It's so boring in this room.

636
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,760
Just go for a walk with me.

637

Aren't you tired?

So mercurial.

I will not bite you.

Just let me pat you a little.

Leaving me alone here

You are just a few years older than Mingyang.

No. No. No.

Yes, my lord.

Shouldn't you explain yourself?

You became a rabbit last time and

718

this time you became a cup.

You were gone for so long

without any updates.

731
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,140
I was so worried.

732

I was just a teacup.

He kissed you!

Miss, have you grown your magic power?

743
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,780
I really felt and understood

how to use magic this time.

745

But as soon as I thought about it,

746

I was back.

753
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:16,699
It's fine.

Before, I thought she was simple and innocent,

but she wanted to get close to me,

758

to make me feel compassionate.

761
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,540
Could it be that Lu Hongzhu was secretly advising her?

762
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,219
