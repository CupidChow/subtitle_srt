00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,080

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,690
(Arin)

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,230
(Yoo Jung Hoo)

4
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,470
(Chuu)

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,010
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

6
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,920
Park Yoon Jae.

7
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,260
What brings you here early in the morning?

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,990
What's that on your head?

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,599
Gosh, what are you doing?

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,039
- Do you want to join me? - What?

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,339
Raise your knee. And then kick.

12
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,940
Raise your knee. And then kick.

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,010
Raise your leg and then kick.

14
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,980
Let's turn.

15
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,880
Keep turning.

16
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,080
- Keep turning. - Hey, this is fun.

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,160
All right. One, two, three.

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,860
And then...

19
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,000
What are you doing here in the morning?

20
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,670
What about you, Min Joo?

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,110
What are you doing here at this hour?

22
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,270
Me? I'm moving here.

23
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,680
You're moving here? Where?

24
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,680
Right here.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Here?

26
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,250
This building?

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,790
Yes. Unit 202 on the 2nd floor.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,560
Why do you look so shocked?

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,830
Is there a reason I can't move here?

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,870
- Yes. - Yes.

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,870
But what are you two doing here?

32
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,110
Oh, this? I can explain.

33
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,950
So what happened was...

34
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,780
- I also... - Excuse me.

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,550
As I told you when we were loading your stuff,

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,150
you have more stuff than I expected.

37
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,049
I'll only move them up to your unit and then go.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,359
I see. Okay. I understand.

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,390
All right.

40
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,800
Guys, do you want to have jjajangmyeon at my house?

41
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,680
(Episode 7: Sleeping with the Enemy)

42
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,690
My gosh.

43
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,540
Just go home.

44
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,969
I can help her a little bit and go.

45
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,140
I hate that even more.

46
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,450
Don't worry.

47
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,049
I have no intention of using my strength...

48
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,080
for her and this house.

49
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,720
Yoon Jae, can you help me move this to my room?

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Okay.

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,590
Two, three.

52
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,130
- This must be very heavy. - No, it's not.

53
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,740
Where should I put this?

54
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,970
Over there.

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,820
Yoon Jae.

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,369
- Min Joo, where should I put this? - Yes?

57
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,370
Over there.

58
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,870
Yoon Jae, can you help me with this? It's too high.

59
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
My gosh.

60
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,420
Yoon Jae! Help me.

61
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,430
I didn't know that he was such a hard worker.

62
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,040
What are you doing?

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,710
Jealousy is making me do all kinds of stuff I don't want to do.

64
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,449
Should I just go home?

65
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,350
Yoon Jae! Help me.

66
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,490
Yoon Jae.

67
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,250
Yoon Jae!

68
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,130
You don't need a manual to assemble this.

69
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,830
Leave it to me.

70
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,610
There.

71
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,980
What is that supposed to be?

72
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,350
A chair.

73
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,390
A chair?

74
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,690
We're almost done.

75
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,630
- This is the last step, right? - Yes.

76
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,530
It looks perfect.

77
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,800
- There. - Okay.

78
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,610
My gosh. It's so sturdy.

79
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,310
It came out nicely.

80
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,110
I'll kill you.

81
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,650
Yoon Jae, why are you sweating so much?

82
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,420
What?

83
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,490
It's a bit hot in here.

84
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,320
Oh, no. I must have asked you to do too many things.

85
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,830
I'm fine.

86
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
Hold on.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Have some water, at least.

88
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,200
Thanks.

89
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,120
Actually, it's getting hot in here for me too.

90
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,420
What about you, Ji Hoon?

91
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,410
Our jjajangmyeon is here.

92
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,680
I'll go and get it.

93
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,160
No! I asked for spoons and chopsticks when I ordered.

94
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,389
They didn't give us any.

95
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,889
You don't have spoons and chopsticks here?

96
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,959
No. I don't keep stuff like that at home.

97
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Good for you, I guess.

98
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,130
- Pardon? - Nothing.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,370
I'll go and get some from my house.

100
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,840
Where do you live? Why are you going to your house?

101
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,240
Didn't I tell you earlier?

102
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,070
I live in the neighbourhood.

103
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,710
Gosh, really?

104
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,340
Where does he live?

105
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,649
But these are noodles.

106
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,749
Buying some from a convenience store might be faster.

107
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,350
Going to his house will be faster.

108
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,150
He lives that close to here? Where does he live?

109
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,650
- Unit 201. - Unit 201?

110
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,520
Where's Unit 201?

111
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,060
What?

112
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,190
What? He lives next door?

113
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,630
No way!

114
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,270
But it was my first kiss.

115
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,940
Is it a problem because it was your first kiss?

116
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,210
What?

117
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,950
Of course! The first time is very important.

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,450
I'm not doing this because I have feelings for you,

119
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,050
but because I'm your fan.

120
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,060
What is this?

121
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,930
What am I remembering?

122
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,230
No way.

123
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,130
Me and Lee Min Hyuk?

124
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,250
"The kiss she and I shared was like rain falling on a rock."

125
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,950
Do you know what life and soju have in common?

126
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,490
- What is it? - Quiet.

127
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,590
What they have in common is...

128
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,590
Drumroll, please.

129
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,830
It has two syllables.

130
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,960
Did she use AI to write her novel?

131
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,840
I was already fooled once. I won't be fooled again.

132
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,770
Every time you open your mouth, only lies come out of it.

133
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,970
Don't tell me what to do with my life. Stay out of it...

134
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,780
because it's over between us.

135
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,410
Did you have a fight with your personal trainer again?

136
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,750
What's the problem this time?

137
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,350
He put me on the StairMaster, and I was climbing to my death.

138
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,389
- What's this? - A courier brought this...

139
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,420
for you just now.

140
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,630
The old guy is at it again.

141
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,870
I didn't know he had such big eyes.

142
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,740
How cute.

143
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm so exhausted.

144
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,709
If people complain about me,

145
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,720
tell them I'm some stupid customer, not the owner.

146
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,020
I doubt we'll have any customers.

147
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,150
But even if we did, no one would think you're the owner.

148
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,160
Excuse me.

149
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,470
Hello.

150
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,769
Could I talk to the owner?

151
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,040
I see.

152
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,639
Well, the owner isn't here right now.

153
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,709
If you leave a message, I'll relay that to her.

154
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,980
I see. Is that so?

155
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,680
Then could you give this to her for me?

156
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
What's your name?

157
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,350
Tell her Hong Young Seok's mother came by. Then she'll know.

158
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,590
Thank you.

159
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,020
Mother?

160
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,130
My gosh. I didn't think I'd get to see you before leaving.

161
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,270
- I just came back from the gym. - I see.

162
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,539
- Why don't you sit here? - Okay.

163
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,570
Thank you.

164
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,710
My gosh. It seems nice.

165
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,040
Oh, my. This is my son.

166
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,449
These days,

167
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,550
candid photos of dates are trending.

168
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,150
My gosh.

169
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,790
Could you take our order?

170
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,620
Mother, what about your tea?

171
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,430
You can check the menu over there.

172
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,130
Cold water will do for me.

173
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,170
You heard her, right? Bring the best-quality cold water...

174
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,640
and one of each dessert we have.

175
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,210
Oh, my. He should've taken you to nicer places.

176
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,410
My son isn't so good in the dating department.

177
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,280
The food was excellent.

178
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,079
By the way, what brings you all the way here?

179
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,480
Oh, I almost forgot.

180
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,020
I brought Siberian ginseng liquor.

181
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,960
I cleaned and prepared each ginseng to make this.

182
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,060
Oh, my. This is such a precious present.

183
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,770
I wish there were more I could do for you than this.

184
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,139
I casually asked my son what you liked.

185
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,799
He told me you liked to drink.

186
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,070
My gosh. He didn't hide anything, did he now?

187
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,109
He's always so honest and upright. He'd make the perfect civil servant.

188
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,810
The liquor you get from supermarkets has chemicals.

189
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,980
But you can call this healthy liquor.

190
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,220
Let me know if you run out of it.

191
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,949
Mulberry liquor, green plum liquor,

192
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,560
ginseng liquor, and wild ginseng liquor.

193
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,920
I'll make you all the liquor you want.

194
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,130
Mother. Thank you.

195
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,170
I should be thanking you.

196
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Good work.

197
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,150
- I'm so tired. - Could you help me with this too?

198
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,850
Can we take a break?

199
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,060
Right here.

200
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,030
- Yoon Jae. - Gosh.

201
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,790
Seriously.

202
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,029
- There. - Thank you.

203
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,070
("Moment of Youth")

204
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,040
We're done.

205
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,070
What's this doing in here?

206
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,210
What?

207
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,280
Oh, right. This?

208
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,109
What is it doing in there?

209
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,150
He dropped it on the day we had malatang.

210
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,920
- Yoon Jae. This is yours, right? - What?

211
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,790
Yes.

212
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,870
Your girlfriend looks much better in the pictures.

213
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,070
Why? She looks the same in person.

214
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,940
She didn't look like this in person.

215
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,579
How did she look in person then?

216
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,140
She looked way too plain.

217
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,210
But she looks cute in the pictures. It's like a scam.

218
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,420
I've met her in person too.

219
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,880
She looked much better in person.

220
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,620
What? You're prettier than her.

221
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,659
What is it with men? None of you can spot real beauty.

222
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
How frustrating.

223
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,559
Can you not spot real beauty?

224
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
What?

225
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,200
I can! I totally can.

226
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,770
Seriously? That was so lame.

227
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,339
Come on. Let's hurry up and finish organising the house.

228
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Come here.

229
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,770
Bye.

230
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,880
I had no idea you were living in the building.

231
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,520
Thank you for today. I hope we can get along...

232
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,230
well.

233
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,400
This is nice.

234
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,010
("Moment of Youth")

235
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,300
What was that?

236
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,700
Was she trying to look like me?

237
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,470
No way.

238
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,140
It can't be.

239
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,890
Gosh, no way.

240
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260
But why?

241
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,460
For what?

242
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,400
To seduce...

243
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,670
Yoon Jae?

244
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,850
I'm home.

245
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,490
What are you doing, Dad?

246
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,320
Can't you see? I'm doing chores.

247
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,990
In the middle of the night?

248
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,729
It's past 10pm now. You should do it later.

249
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,700
I must do it when it's quiet to be noticed.

250
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,500
My gosh. Oh, my.

251
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,810
My back hurts a bit.

252
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,310
But I finished organising the cabinets I'd been putting off.

253
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,550
It feels great.

254
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,010
Okay.

255
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,220
I'll get some sleep for now...

256
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,190
and clean the balcony tomorrow morning.

257
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,290
My gosh. Oh, my.

258
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,360
My goodness.

259
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,969
Oh, my back.

260
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,100
Are you going to sleep out here?

261
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,070
Could you turn off the lights on your way to your room?

262
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,640
Are you scared of Mom?

263
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,109
Sleep in my room.

264
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,740
If I do that, she won't notice me.

265
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,179
What on earth are you talking about?

266
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,580
What does she need to notice?

267
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,020
Given the severity of the trouble I caused,

268
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,219
I'm doing everything I physically can...

269
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,890
to show her that I'm sorry.

270
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,389
How did your mother do all these chores every day?

271
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,830
There you go again. You always side with her in the end.

272
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,700
I do.

273
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,710
Come to think of it, I have a sad life too.

274
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,310
Get some sleep. My gosh.

275
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,360
How are things going with your girlfriend?

276
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,460
My girlfriend?

277
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,370
It's not easy.

278
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,610
Every woman is a challenge.

279
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,080
And the one you love is the biggest one of all.

280
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,219
But the harder the challenge gets,

281
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,280
the more you must face it head-on, not run from it.

282
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,550
Have meals together.

283
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,690
Watch movies together.

284
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,020
Talk about silly things.

285
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,360
Hold hands.

286
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,430
And kiss her too.

287
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,500
What a great lesson you're teaching our son.

288
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,940
No kissing.

289
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,380
I'm going to sleep.

290
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,210
Good night.

291
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,700
Face it head-on, not run from it.

292
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,270
I do want to face it head-on.

293
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,480
But with Kim Ji Eun.

294
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,660
"I, You" by Na Tae Joo.

295
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,700
"You don't need to know how deeply I love you."

296
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,210
"My feelings for you are mine alone to carry."

297
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,940
"My longing for you is more than enough to fill my heart."

298
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,850
"Even without you, I can still love you."

299
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,020
"Even without you, I can still love you?"

300
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,230
Yoon Jae, do you think you can still love me without me?

301
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,170
I think I can.

302
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,699
- Which pose should we do? - A heart?

303
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,440
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

304
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,910
Okay.

305
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,040
Which one this time?

306
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,140
- Like this? - Sure.

307
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,610
- The last one. One more. - Last one.

308
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,420
- Should we kiss? - Should we?

309
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,830
What?

310
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,270
What? Wait.

311
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,040
Ji Eun.

312
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,510
Do you think you can still love me without me?

313
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
I think I can.

314
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,630
Ji Hoon.

315
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,529
- Ji Hoon. - You startled me!

316
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,600
Hi.

317
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,300
How pretty.

318
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,670
I'm getting sick of hearing that now.

319
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,840
My gosh. Is that a pain relief patch?

320
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,009
Did you put it on after helping me move yesterday?

321
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,950
No. Mind your business.

322
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,589
I've noticed that you act all tough on the outside,

323
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,720
but deep down, you're a softie. Right?

324
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,360
I've never really had a neighbourhood friend.

325
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,130
Who knew you lived right next door? This is amazing.

326
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,200
Why do you keep following me around?

327
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,099
I see. Birds of a feather flock together.

328
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,909
You and Yoon Jae have a similar vibe.

329
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,710
So you're not even listening.

330
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,520
So,

331
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,620
what vibe do you mean?

332
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,190
The naive and cute vibe?

333
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,420
You're no match for Puppy Dog Yoon Jae, though.

334
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,060
Woof, woof.

335
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,860
I miss Yoon Jae.

336
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,460
Park Yoon Jae.

337
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,500
Wait up for...

338
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
What's this?

339
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:12,350
(Flyer distributors wanted, Seoul residents welcome)

340
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,850
What's this about?

341
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,720
Hey.

342
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,320
Okay.

343
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,430
It's just you?

344
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,470
Yes, but they'll come.

345
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,439
Why are we meeting at a place like this?

346
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,570
Hey, Min Joo.

347
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,570
How do I look?

348
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,980
Are you going somewhere nice?

349
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,780
We're here.

350
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,280
What's so nice about meeting our team?

351
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,320
What's going on?

352
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,520
Are the others coming?

353
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,859
- I'm leaving. - No, wait, Min Joo.

354
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,560
It's my birthday today.

355
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,940
Can you join me for a meal?

356
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,710
Welcome.

357
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,080
How's this?

358
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,510
- What? - Do you like it?

359
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,080
Yes, I love it.

360
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,290
- I'll take it. - Ten dollars, please.

361
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,760
Thank you.

362
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,760
Here.

363
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,660
- Is it a birthday present? - Let's say it is.

364
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,730
Thanks so much, Min Joo.

365
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,570
If there's a guy I like or am interested in...

366
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,399
If there's even a sliver of a possibility...

367
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,040
I'll like him, I don't shop for him like this.

368
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,480
I choose and think carefully, and imagine him with the gift.

369
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,379
I pick something as if...

370
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,610
that gift represents me.

371
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,280
Do you get what I'm saying?

372
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,690
From now on, don't set up such uncomfortable situations.

373
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,930
Happy birthday.

374
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,080
He who wears the crown...

375
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,409
must withstand the weight.

378
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,630
Hi.

379
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,860
Sit down.

380
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,610
Come on. A bit more.

381
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,650
- It hurts, Mom. - Try a bit more.

382
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,050
No, I want to stop. I've had enough. It hurts.

383
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,050
Let's finish up. Relax.

384
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,070
Why did we do that this morning?

385
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,270
When did you learn to do yoga?

386
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,340
When I turned into a man like you.

387
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,640
It was just as hard on me too.

388
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,810
So I picked up meditation and yoga.

389
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,950
It will help you too.

390
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,949
I haven't done it in a while, and I feel so good I could fly.

391
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,990
You might feel like you could fly.

392
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,349
Look at me.

393
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,160
I don't have the body to fly.

394
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,190
I weigh over 70kg.

395
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,060
My arms are filled with rocks.

396
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,200
I weighed over 100kg.

397
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,740
No way.

398
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,420
Nothing beats yoga when you're confused.

399
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,320
- Practice when you can. - Okay.

400
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,060
You can hate and resent me.

401
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,790
I feel terrible for you,

402
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,760
but I can't just sit around and feel bad.

403
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,669
I'll teach and help you with whatever I can.

404
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,600
I don't hate you or resent you.

405
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,439
It's hard to love...

406
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,810
and easy to hate.

407
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,510
It's an extraordinarily weird life,

408
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,080
so do what you feel like. I'm okay with that.

409
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,710
I don't hate you.

410
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,020
Why do you keep saying that? It's getting annoying.

411
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,220

412
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,220

00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,170
I write as a hobby.

453
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,699
A hobby becomes a specialty...

454
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,300

You did pretty well for a first timer.

490

- Lee Min Hyuk. - Oh, Min Hyuk?

What's the occasion?

494
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,880
Why did you call me and not Yoon Jae?

Wait.

498

I know you're close,

500
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,160
but Yoon Jae's no sculpture.

501
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
True.

502
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,570
He's more like a block of tofu than a sculpture.

503
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,300
You think so too?

504
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,340
It's not just me, then.

505
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,610
You're right. Yoon Jae's pale-faced...

506
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,280
and soft and squishy, like soft tofu.

507
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,740
Soft and squishy.

508
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,350
Left or right? Which cheek is softer?

509
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,880
I'd love to bite into it.

510
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,049
It'll be soft, right?

511
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,350
Why not just bite him and end up in jail?

512
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,019
Anyway, how long have you been doing this?

513
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,490
It looks like you've done this more than a couple of times.

514
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,999
I may look like a spoiled princess,

515
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,800
but I've worked all kinds of part-time jobs.

516

So, you can trust me.

517
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,640
Also, I asked them to pay us in cash.

518
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,810
Two hundred dollars.

519
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,310
- Two hundred dollars? - Yes.

520
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,150
My gosh, that's amazing.

521
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,750
Hey, thanks.

522
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,249
Hook me up with this job more often.

523
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,550
I'll do my best.

524
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,760
Well, hey.

525
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,020
By any chance...

526
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,890
One second.

527
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:45,060
I'm almost there. I can just go in, right?

528
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,730
Yoon Jae says he's almost here.

529
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,470
Initially, he said he couldn't come.

530
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,200
It was a good call to tell him that I was with you.

531
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,340
Yoon Jae?

532
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,640
Yoon Jae is coming here?

533
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Yes.

534
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,410
But why? Did you call him here?

535
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,319
Yes. I thought it'd be fun to hang out after we're done here. Why?

536
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,789
I look like this now, and you called Park Yoon Jae here?

537
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,349
Why? You look the coolest I've seen you yet.

538
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,219
You look like a manly, studious young man from a noble family.

539
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,520
Exactly, I look like a young master now!

540
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,260
Hey, I'm leaving.

541
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,159
Where do you think you're going? Part Two is about to begin.

542
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,000
I can't go onstage now.

543
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,000
But don't you want the money? Two hundred dollars.

544
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,170
I can't do this.

545
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,940
Hey!

546
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,210
What the...

547
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
Ji Hoon.

548
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,490
- Darn it. - What?

549
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
Ji Hoon!

550
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,830
He must be going crazy.

551
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,900
What am I going to do now?

552
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,170
Hey, Min Joo.

553
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
Where is Ji Hoon?

554
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:01,470
Did you lend him money or something?

555
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,039
What are you talking about?

556
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,779
I don't know. I told him you were coming,

557
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,009
and then he suddenly ran away.

558
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,450
Look at this. Is he Cinderella or what?

559
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,250
Honestly, he's such a weirdo.

560
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,950
Why did he run away like that?

561
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,460
We were getting along fine until I mentioned you were coming.

562
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,830
Can we do that later on too?

563
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,630
It's on my bucket list.

564
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,030
Why wait? Let's just do it now.

565
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,170
- Let's go. - No.

566
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,770
I'm not wearing any makeup today.

567
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,339
Even without makeup, you still look pretty.

568
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,380
No.

569
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,380
I want to prepare properly...

570
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,420
so we can have a real date...

571
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,280
and take lots of pictures too.

572
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,950
And I'll pick out a beautiful hanbok too.

573
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
All right.

574
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,260
Let's do that.

575
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,390
By the way,

576
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,700
don't you think a hanbok will really suit me?

577
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,930
You'll be blown away.

578
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,130
You know...

579
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,400
what suits you best? Me.

580
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,480
You two fought, didn't you?

581
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,680
Min Joo, we'll be starting in ten minutes. Get ready.

582
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,250
What?

583
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,090
Oh, no.

584
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,260
I have no choice. You'll have to fill in.

585
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,030
- For what? - We don't have time!

586
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,870
(Under the clear fall sky, going after my beloved)

587
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,680
(Hanok Village Fall Festival)

588
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,429
Young Master, hold her in your arms.

589
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,500
You're hot!

590
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,020
Darn it.

591
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,459
Since this is the last show of the day,

592
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,060
please give her a light peck on the lips.

593
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,599
We'll give you a bonus for it.

594
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,000
All right, in ten seconds.

595
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,750
Ten, nine,

596
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,820
eight, seven,

597
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,060
six, five,

598
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,260
four, three,

599
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,960
two, one.

600
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,769
Stop!

601
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,070
- What? - What is going on?

602
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,570
- What is this? - No idea.

603
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,240
- Look! - Who is he?

604
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,480
- What is he doing? - What's going on?

605
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,810
- Who is that man? - My gosh.

606
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,250
Young Master!

607
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,590
So, you are alive.

608
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,200
How dare you!

609
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,080
You scoundrel.

610
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,740
How dare you seize the opportunity...

611
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,549
in my absence and pursue my lady!

612
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,280
- What? - What is happening?

613
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,150
Oh, my.

614
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,060
My goodness.

615
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,430
Young Master, I knew you would come to my rescue.

616
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,600
I am sorry, my lady.

617
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,730
It seems I have come too late.

618
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,210
I am simply overjoyed that you have returned safe and sound.

619
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,170
I have returned, alive and well.

620
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,310
So, now...

621
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,280
What do I do?

622
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,050
Kill him.

623
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:18,820
Only then can we end this.

624
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,170
You scoundrel!

625
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,400
You are to die!

626
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,140
Oh, my.

627
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,080
My gosh!

628
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,860
- Die. - My goodness.

629
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:52,960
You need to die.

630
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
Come on.

631
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,460
Die now.

632
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:42,640
All right.

633
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,080
Here's your udon.

634
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,210
Yes, enjoy.

635
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,750
- I'm ready to pay. - Yes! One moment, please.

636
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,520
- Here, enjoy. - Thank you.

637
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,650
One moment, please.

638
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,429
- Do you need your receipt? - No.

639
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,860
Got it. Here you go.

640
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,230
Thank you. Come again!

641
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,240
I give you nothing but a bowl of udon and make you work so hard.

642
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,080
It's all good. I'll have another bowl later.

643
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,950
You'll have another bowl?

644
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,800
(Hong Young Seok)

645
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,340
What is it? He still hasn't replied?

646
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,340
That rude punk.

647
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,939
Show me. Let me see what you wrote.

648
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,010
Sit.

649
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,750
Oh, my gosh.

650
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,060
No wonder he hasn't replied.

651
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,720
Listen up.

652
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,860
To get Young Seok to take action after eight years in Noryangjin,

653
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,860
you need to make him worry, not cheer him on.

654
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,499
Make him worry?

655
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,300
That's right! Make him worry.

656
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,309
After Young Seok started studying for the exam...

657
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,210
and didn't pass the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd time,

658
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,510
I cheered him on with a lot of enthusiasm too.

659
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,050
I made him ginseng chicken soup so many times too.

660
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,550
But one day, he suddenly stopped coming by.

661
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,680
Why?

662
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,750
I guess the things I did for him made him feel uncomfortable.

663
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,720
And he was embarrassed because he kept failing the exam.

664
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,790
I kept telling him to come by, but he didn't.

665
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,730
Do you know what made him come back to the restaurant?

666
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,030
No, what?

667
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,230
I had back surgery.

668
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,130
He heard about it through the grapevine and came to visit me.

669
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,470
He helped me clean, move things,

670
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,240
and even made kimchi together with me.

671
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,510
That's how I figured it out.

672
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,680
I figured out the trick.

673
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,810
To cook him a warm, hearty meal,

674
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,220
I have to make him worry.

675
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,950
You get what I mean, right?

676
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,020
- Do you understand? - Understood.

677
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:23,870
My gosh.

678
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,770
Was that too obvious?

679
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,510
His voice didn't sound very good earlier.

680
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,680
Should I send him another text and say I'm okay?

681
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,710
Or should I just be honest and tell him that Auntie told me the trick?

682
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,950
Goodness. Either way, I'll look so lame.

683
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,250
Hey, Kim Ji Hye!

684
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,560
What happened? Are you all right?

685
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,859
I must've sprained my ankle...

686
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,800
when I tried to walk fast.

687
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,300
Hey, let me...

688
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:57,900
Oh, okay.

689
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,369
Where is the man who was following you?

690
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,840
Oh, he just walked past me. I guess I was mistaken.

691
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,680
I'm sorry. You must be busy with your studies.

692
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:11,149
You're the only person I know in Noryangjin.

693
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,420
Of course, you should call me. Why are you even sorry?

694
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,620
Can you walk?

695
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,860
Yes, I can walk.

696
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,460
Hold on.

697
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,599
It's getting late. All the hospitals must be closed.

698
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,130
Hey, it's fine.

699
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,170
Can you just walk me to the bus stop down the street?

700
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,010
Will you be all right?

701
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,749
All right, then. Give me your bag. Here.

702
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,080
Hold my hands. Good.

703
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,649
One, two, three.

704
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,079
- There. - Hey, careful.

705
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,589
- Gosh, it hurts. - Oh, no. Here, this way.

706
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,249
Come this way. Yes, that's it.

707
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,260
- Watch your step here. - Okay.

708
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,090
I did it.

709
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,860
Make sure you see a doctor tomorrow.

710
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,930
You used to trip and fall often, even back in school.

711
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,340
You remember that?

712
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,810
These are the only things I remember about my school days.

713
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,209
How handsome I was and how funny you were.

714
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,340
I only remember those two things.

715
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,080
You're still handsome.

716
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,779
Oh, I also remember how...

717
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,280
you never wore glasses, despite your bad eyesight.

718
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,090
Now that I've had vision correction surgery,

719
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,620
I think the world looked more beautiful back then,

720
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,829
because I saw less.

721
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,330
Was that why you liked me?

722
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,399
Hey, we sat side by side.

723
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,930
I saw you right in front of me every single day.

724
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,370
You really adored me back then.

725
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,969
- Hey, be careful. - Okay.

726
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,870
- Gosh, it hurts. - Oh, no.

727
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,710
- Does it hurt a lot? - A little.

728
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,140
Be careful.

729
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,810
Let's walk slowly.

730
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,719
(Noryangjin High School)

731
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,820
Which bus do you take?

732
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,250
Bus 129.

733
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,360
Bus 129? It'll be here shortly.

734
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,690
That's so quick.

735
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,190
You have to see a doctor tomorrow.

736
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,360
I will.

737
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,860
Here.

738
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,730
Bye.

739
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,640
Bye.

740
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,320
Let's just get a taxi. I'll take you home.

741
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,920
No, I'm fine.

742
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,990
I'd worry if I don't see you off...

743
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,530
and wouldn't be able to focus on my studies.

744
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,200
I don't want you to struggle with your studies.

745
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,750
You think it's funny?

746
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,390
Is it not funny to you?

747
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,789
You slashed Park Yoon Jae's neck with your own hands.

748
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,030
Not his neck.

749
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,959
Seriously, Kang Min Joo or whatever. That girl's really something.

750
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,900
How did she even think of inviting you there?

751
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,269
She can't even imagine in her wildest dreams...

752
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,900
that I'm Yoon Jae's girlfriend.

753
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,640
She acts super friendly around me.

754
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,740
She says she's happy to have a friend in the neighbourhood.

755
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,409
What if she asks you to help her...

756
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:26,040
so she can be with Yoon Jae?

757
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,679
No way. She knows he has a girlfriend.

758
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,710
Is she pretty?

759
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,220
- She's not ugly. - So, she's really pretty.

760
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,590
Hey.

761
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,059
Since you're my one and only friend,

762
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,960
I shouldn't keep any secrets from you, right?

763
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,170
So, I have a confession to make.

764
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,170
Hey, no.

765
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:58,710
I thought we had sorted it all out.

766
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,050
What are you saying? This time, it's not you.

767
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,680
So, you already have someone else?

768
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,050
Why? Are you jealous?

769
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,190
Who is it?

770
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,030
Well...

771
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,960
It's someone you know.

772
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,330
Someone I know?

773
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,340
Hey.

774
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,900
Don't tell me... Is it Yoon Jae?

775
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,210
Is there some kind of button?

776
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,940
Whenever I say anything, you assume it's about Yoon Jae.

777
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,510
And do you seriously think I'd fall for Yoon Jae,

778
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,650
knowing he's my only friend's boyfriend?

779
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,150
Then who else could it be if it's someone we both know?

780
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,530
No way. Min Hyuk?

781
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,700
My gosh. Birds of a feather sure do flock together.

782
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,570
So? Are you dating him now?

783
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,730
No.

784
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,140
But we kissed.

785
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,370
What?

786
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,110
With every breath I take, I think about that moment.

787
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,440
The moment we kissed.

788
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,350
Anyway,

789
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,620
you have to do your best to help me without making it obvious, okay?

790
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,960
What did you do when I told you I was going out with Yoon Jae?

791
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,100
I gave you my full blessing, didn't I?

792
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,739
The first encounter was wrong to begin with.

793
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,770
Don't you know how it'll end?

794
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,710
It'll be catastrophic.

795
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,139
Break up with him.

796
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,649
Hey, "catastrophic?" That's really mean.

797
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,720
You guys were supposed to be on blind dates with someone else,

798
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,590
but you cheated on your original dates.

799
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,090
We cheated?

800
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,359
We only exchanged names. That's it. I never cheated on anyone.

801
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,160
In any case, you can't date him. Break it off.

802
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,929
Yoon Jae and I...

803
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,300
are going to watch "Fly Me to the Moon 3" this evening.

804
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,670
What?

805
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,339
You watched the two prequels with me.

806
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,570
Who are you watching the third one with?

807
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,210
Seriously, you can't do this to me.

808
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,540
Break up with him right now.

809
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,510
I said that?

810
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,250
I don't remember that.

811
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,250
Anyway, all right. Congratulations. I'll be praying for you.

812
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,520
I'm off.

813
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,689
Bye.

814
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,330
Right. Watch out for that minx next door.

815
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:35,630
What's this?

816
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:37,070
It's a gift-with-purchase for my book.

817
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,669
Hey, the readers these days don't fall for this stuff.

818
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,080
Don't you think this is too childish?

819
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,110
Hey, what are you doing?

820
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,420
Hey, don't make a mess in my house.

821
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,589
- You need to leave. - Okay.

822
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,160
- Okay, I'm leaving. - Bye.

823
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:12,670
Blowing on it makes it bigger

824
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,940
A giant cotton candy

825
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:21,880
Min Joo.

826
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:25,920
Dong Gi?

827
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,920
What brings you here?

828
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,890
I mean, why are you here?

829
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,359
You didn't answer my calls,

830
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,890
so I was waiting here, hoping to catch you.

831
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,490
How do I look?

832
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,160
I got this to go with the hat you bought for me yesterday.

833
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,200
I don't think I ever told you I lived here.

834
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,439
Have you been tailing me?

835
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,600
No, it's not that.

836
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,469
The other night, I was anxious because you were going home alone,

837
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:51,479
so I followed you.

838
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,010
That's what tailing means.

839
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,510
I'm really offended and upset right now.

840
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,620
Leave.

841
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,389
- Let's watch a movie this weekend. - I'm busy this weekend.

842
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,820
Even if I'm free, I don't want to see you.

843
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,390
Why not?

844
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,130
Think about it. Why do you think I don't want to see you?

845
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,800
As you probably know already, I like you.

846
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,269
I fell for you at first sight,

847
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,840
and I've only had eyes for you since then.

848
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,909
That's none of my business.

849
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:21,970
I'll be so good to you.

850
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,879
I can take much better care of you than Park Yoon Jae ever could.

851
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,679
Why are you bringing up Yoon Jae?

852
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,910
I get better grades than he does and have a brighter future ahead of me.

853
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,120
My parents run a golf course.

854
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,720
Dong Gi.

855
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,460
If you say a word more,

856
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,330
I'll never want to see you again. I mean it.

857
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,030
Do you want to keep going?

858
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,130
If you don't want me to distance myself even further from you,

859
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,500
you need to leave.

860
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,370
And just know that I've never been attracted to you,

861
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,340
and I never will be in the future either.

862
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,650
What can I do to make you attracted to me?

863
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,150
Be born again,

864
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,550
and I'll think about it.

865
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,160
Move.

866
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,959
Min Joo, please look at me.

867
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,160
I said, move. I'm going to scream.

868
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,030
Help!

869
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,300
Help me...

870
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,440
(Epilogue)

871
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,440
("The Origin and End of the Universe")

872
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,460
- Isn't this coffee so good? - Yes.

873
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,660
- So, where did you end up joining? - Pardon?

874
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,439
You must've found a company you liked better.

875
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,569
That's probably why you didn't join us.

876
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:36,009
Oh, that's not what happened.

877
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,039
It's okay.

878
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,980
It's not like I own this company.

879
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,910
It's just that...

880
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:44,110
I really wanted to work with you, Ji Eun.

881
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,880
Me too.

882
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,250
I really wanted to work here too.

883
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,660
Did something happen?

884
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,860
Well, it's...

885
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,800
There was something wrong with my body.

886
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,270
Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

887
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,339
Are you okay now?

888
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,000
Yes, I'm all better now.

889
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,309
I promise you I'll come back here.

890
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,810
I must, for this coffee, at least.

891
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,880
All right.

892
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,880
- Enjoy the coffee. - Thank you.

893
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,530
(Special thanks to Park Myung Sin)

894
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,790
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

895
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,230
My parents are away on a trip. I wanted to hang out with you.

896
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,029
But what will you two do, alone at home?

897
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,659
What's your type?

898
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,470
I'll do my best to find the perfect match for you.

899
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,399
There's a guy I have feelings for.

900
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,469
There's a guy I have feelings for too.

901
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:15,540
He's my first love.

902
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,070
What's she doing here?

903
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:20,210
I think I'm getting used to living as a man.

904
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,110
Oh, this is for you.

905
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:23,950
What am I going to do about her?

906
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,450
Don't tell me you have feelings for me!

907
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,220
You two... What's going on?
