00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,580
Hey, get out of my house.

The person you have reached is unavailable.

5
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,740
You'll be directed to voicemail.

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,070
Please leave...

(Kim Ji Hoon)

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,660
The person you have reached is unavailable.

9
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,260
You'll be directed to voicemail.

10
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,830
(Kim Ji Hoon)

11
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,540
The last 4 digits, 6734. It's you, isn't it?

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,240
Kim Ji Hoon.

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,860
The last 4 digits, 6734.

14
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,730
Yes. It's me.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,740
Kim Ji Hoon.

(Kang Min Joo)

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,920
Yoon Jae knew all about this, didn't he?

18
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,060
Yes.

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,360
Even when he knew everything...

20
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,720
You two must have had a blast watching me.

21
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,250
You must have gotten a kick out of watching me...

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,960
easily be fooled.

23
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,430
I'm sorry about deceiving you.

24
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,670
I know better than anyone how much you cared...

25
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,240
about Ji Hoon.

26
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,650
(Episode 11: Yoon Jae's Prayer)

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,400
(Royal Bungeoppang: Custard and Red Bean)

28
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,670
Bungeoppang?

29
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,810
Ji Eun will love these.

30
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,780
- Hello. - Hello.

31
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,980
I'd like a bag of bungeoppang.

32
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,650
Which flavour would you like?

33
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,390
I only want red bean.

34
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,260
But could you add only a little bit of the red bean paste?

35
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,130
You only want a little bit of the paste? Why is that?

36
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,700
My girlfriend isn't a fan of red beans.

37
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,160
How odd.

38
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,500
Or should I make them without any red bean paste?

39
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,170
Could you do that for me? I'd love that.

40
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,570
But I'm charging you the same price.

41
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,870
Sure.

42
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,810
Park Yoon Jae!

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,580
I picked up some bungeoppang.

44
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,650
Yes!

45
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,320
I bought a lot of them.

46
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,990
So enjoy them with your sister.

47
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,260
Okay.

48
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
You're leaving?

49
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,730
I should.

50
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,630
My sister is working late tonight.

51
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,570
You won't come in?

52
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,670
Gosh, you should have led with that!

53
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,870
It's so cold out here.

54
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,850
It really doesn't have any red bean paste.

55
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,150
I asked her not to add it.

56
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,450
But you like red beans.

57
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,790
Watching you enjoy the food makes me happier.

58
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Here.

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,100
- Do you like it? - It's not bad.

60
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,100
You know,

61
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,140
Kang Min Joo found out everything.

62
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,480
Find out what?

63
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,510
That I'm Kim Ji Hoon.

64
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,880
How did she find out?

65
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,180
It just happened that way.

66
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,460
I see.

67
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,930
I promise to be a good person from now on.

68
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,230
I will be grateful for everything...

69
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,870
I have taken for granted.

70
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,210
So let me stay as Kim Ji Eun for the rest of my life. Please?

71
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,050
I'm in big trouble now, right?

72
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,780
I don't know what to do.

73
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,620
There's nothing you can do. Just enjoy this bungeoppang.

74
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,120
Another bite. Here.

75
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,390
Give me a bite too.

76
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
It's tasty.

77
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,440
Right. You filed your application to Corning University, right?

78
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
What?

79
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,880
Of course.

80
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,080
Picturing you study at that university...

81
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,550
gives me goosebumps...

82
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,590
because you're so cool.

83
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,790
I want to stay by your side,

84
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,060
but this is your wish.

85
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,760
I will grant you that wish.

86
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,000
That's so cool.

87
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,950
It's getting really late.

88
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,980
I'll get going. You should get some sleep.

89
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,050
No. I know I'm sleepy,

90
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,490
but I don't want you to go.

91
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,720
I'll leave once you fall asleep.

92
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,990
- Really? - Yes.

93
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,960
Close your eyes now.

94
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,630
Okay. I will.

95
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,880
My gosh.

96
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,050
Oh, my.

97
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,030
It's 3am now.

98
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,460
Slave Kim Ji Hye has been granted permission to get off work.

99
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,260
Slave Kim is on her way back to work.

100
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,680
Oh, I fell asleep.

101
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
What?

102
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,070
She just prayed not to change back.

103
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,040
This is too mean.

104
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,010
Yoon Jae.

105
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,320
- You're up? - Yes.

106
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,350
What time is it?

107
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,340
Did I change back again?

108
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,940
Is this a dream?

109
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,280
Or is this real?

110
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,350
What do you want it to be?

111
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,050
A dream.

112
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,020
I wish this was a dream too.

113
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,930
So you're telling me an acquaintance of yours...

114
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,040
turned into a man overnight?

115
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,170
Did I understand you correctly?

116
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,510
Yes.

117
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,670
How many times must I tell you?

118
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,840
I saw it happen with my own eyes.

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,210
Environmental factors...

120
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,150
such as extreme stress and sensory overload...

121
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,590
may sometimes prevent the brain from functioning normally.

122
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,520
Are you telling me I'm not normal?

123
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,530
Well, no one in this world can switch between being a man...

124
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,290
and a woman.

125
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,630
However, you can fix this with regular therapy...

126
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,470
- and treatment... - Gosh, forget it.

127
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,170
Do you think I came all the way here to get your run-of-the-mill lecture?

128
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,540
I might be better off asking AI for some help.

129
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,380
Yoon Jae.

130
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,620
I need to talk to you.

131
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,530
You probably heard that I found out about everything.

132
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
Yes.

133
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,530
I just saw a psychiatrist.

134
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,500
The psychiatrist said that...

135
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,770
my brain wasn't functioning normally.

136
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,070
Are you all right?

137
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,780
How could you date someone whose gender could change?

138
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,650
Doesn't that bother you?

139
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,820
Is it because I have no choice but to be okay with it?

140
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,490
I'm okay with it.

141
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,760
Why do you say you don't have a choice?

142
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,690
That way, I can protect Ji Eun.

143
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,470
Wait. Please don't tell the others...

144
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,440
about this.

145
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,880
Even if I do, they won't believe me.

146
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,050
Besides, you don't have to ask me that.

147
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,780
I have no intention of using her flaw as a weapon against her.

148
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,940
- Yu Ri. - Is she all right?

149
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,740
No, she's not.

150
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,710
Don't leave her alone.

151
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,210
Oh, my. I'm late.

152
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,720
- I must get going. - Okay.

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
Hey!

154
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,990
I knew this is what you would be doing.

155
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,100
- What? - Gosh. Look at you moping around.

156
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,460
Anyway,

157
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,600
isn't it about time you got used to this?

158
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,100
Why don't you experience it...

159
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,440
and see if you can get used to this?

160
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,840
It wouldn't have taken me a second to get used to it.

161
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,110
I would go and visit all those girls who bullied me.

162
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,640
I would seduce them and then dump them.

163
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,940
I would have lived my life getting my satisfying revenge.

164
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,480
That's so you.

165
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,350
Let's go out.

166
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,250
- No. - What are you going to do here?

167
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,390
- Let's go out. - I said no.

168
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,130
What's gotten into you? Have you gone mad?

169
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,300
- Gosh. Hey. Darn it. - Come on. Let's go out.

170
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Hey. I said I didn't want to!

171
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
Run.

172
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,710
Run until you can barely breathe.

173
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,580
Run until you feel like you might die.

174
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,220
That's it!

175
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,330
My gosh. That was super fast.

176
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,860
You're so fast!

177
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,380
Yoon Jae.

178
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,450
I'm sorry. But who are you?

179
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,950
I'm your girlfriend.

180
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,260
It's me, Kim Ji Eun.

181
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,560
A person...

182
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,630
shouldn't change overnight.

183
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,730
But...

184
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,370
Mom, but you see...

185
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,470
But I feel most self-conscious around you.

186
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,210
- What? - Honestly, I feel...

187
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,280
most self-conscious around you.

188
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,080
I didn't realise I made you feel that way.

189
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,660
I wish this was a dream too.

190
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,050
Here.

191
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,980
Do you feel a little better now?

192
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,250
Yes, thanks to you.

193
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,390
It helped me sort out my thoughts too.

194
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,090
I feel much better too.

195
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,660
Well,

196
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,630
Ji Eun.

197
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,200
So you're stuck with this switcheroo for the rest of your life, right?

198
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,170
It seems that way.

199
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,540
I can't be certain about anything when it comes to that now.

200
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,780
Then...

201
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,780
shouldn't you approach your situation differently now?

202
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,450
How?

203
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,620
Is Yoon Jae your whole world?

204
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,920
He's not.

205
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,630
I was relieved and grateful that Yoon Jae stayed by your side...

206
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,090
even when you turned into a man.

207
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,830
But if this is a permanent thing in your life,

208
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,730
Yoon Jae might be...

209
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,440
what weakens you in the end.

210
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,310
And I will be what weakens him in the end too.

211
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,150
Hang in there.

212
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,850
I will support any decision you make.

213
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,150
What? Should I do the spoon worm dance?

214
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,760
Next time. Thanks, though.

215
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,370
(Yoon Jae's Mother)

216
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,940
Mr. Kim. Do you have some time for a phone call?

217
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,260
(Park Woo Sung)

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,070
Are you out of your mind?

219
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,870
You're really not going?

220
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,970
No, I'm not.

221
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,910
Is it because of Kim Ji Eun?

222
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,910
Yes.

223
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,550
Was this dream of yours that easy to throw away?

224
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,680
Do you know what you just threw away?

225
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,750
I know.

226
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,390
Yoon Jae. I'm being serious right now.

227
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,390
It's not about my jealousy or envy. I'm asking you a serious question.

228
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,470
Do you see Kim Ji Eun and Kim Ji Hoon as the same person?

229
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,570
Yes.

230
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,870
No. I'm asking you if you can love them the same way.

231
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,290
You must be surprised to hear from me out of the blue.

232
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,330
Gosh, no.

233
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,530
I've been feeling bad about quitting so abruptly too.

234
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,140
Well, Mr. Kim. I sent you...

235
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,810
the photo of Yoon Ah's report card. You saw it, right?

236
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,510
It's remarkable that...

237
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,410
her grades improved only in the subjects you tutored.

238
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,920
Yoon Ah studied hard too.

239
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,090
Well, Mr. Kim.

240
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,520
There's only a month left...

241
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,490
until her college entrance exam.

242
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,860
Could you tutor her only for one more month?

243
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,260
What?

244
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, that...

245
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,040
Mr. Kim. I'm begging you.

246
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,610
Please, I'm begging.

247
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,850
Just tutor her for one more month.

248
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,810
- Ma'am. - Mr. Kim.

249
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,120
This may be difficult to believe, but this was...

250
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,790
the first time her grades ever improved in her life.

251
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay. I'll do it.

252
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,810
Thank you so much.

253
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,140
Gosh, Father.

254
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,680
Thank you, Father.

255
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,450
What? My gosh.

256
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,890
What are you doing by the door?

257
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,360
I'm curious about his secret...

258
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,160
to tutoring Yoon Ah. Her grades improved so much.

259
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,800
My goodness.

260
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,730
What?

261
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,480
Since I'm tutoring you again, let's do our best until the exam.

262
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,220
- You two fought, didn't you? - What?

263
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,190
No.

264
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,290
Mr. Kim.

265
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,590
What will happen to you two when my brother goes to the US?

266
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,590
What?

267
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,670
My gosh, Yoon Ah. Your mother is here too.

268
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,140
Oh, her? But even if she were to hear me,

269
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,470
she would never be able to put the pieces together...

270
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,940
because she's the most closed-minded person.

271
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,640
You and Yoon Jae being an item?

272
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,310
Gosh, never.

273
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,310
But still.

274
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,910
You should follow him to the US.

275
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,150
Well, that's the perfect country...

276
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,950
where you guys can freely be a couple without being judged.

277
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,990
You can hold hands too.

278
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,590
Out of sight, out of mind. You know that saying, don't you?

279
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,960
My gosh. What's wrong?

280
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,930
- Mom! - Ma'am.

281
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,800
Wait.

282
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,370
What did I just hear?

283
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
- Oh, no. Honey. - Mom!

284
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,510
Call 911. Let go of her.

285
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,910
Give her some space.

286
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,080
Here you go. Have some water.

287
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,430
Yoon Jae!

288
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,280
Mom.

289
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,960
Are you two...

290
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,260
really in a romantic relationship?

291
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,730
Is that true?

292
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay. Let's say that you are.

293
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,140
But he still tutored Yoon Ah...

294
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,810
while deceiving all of us!

295
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,320
That day when the house was a mess,

296
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,090
you got Yoon Ah to leave the house.

297
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,120
It was just you two in the house...

298
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,090
My gosh. Oh, no.

299
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,990
- Mom. - No!

300
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll come back after I walk Ji Hoon out.

301
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,310
- Park Yoon Jae! - Oh, no.

302
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,710
Mom!

303
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,680
- My gosh. - Oh, no.

304
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,390
Let's go.

305
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,860
Gosh.

306
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,730
Oh, no. Mom!

307
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,340
Go back home.

308
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,610
Don't worry.

309
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,580
I'll take care of it.

310
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,750
Let's go.

311
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,480
You can't go anywhere.

312
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,490
Go back home.

313
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,490
I'm sorry,

314
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,560
but can you just go home?

315
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,260
Why are you crying?

316
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,770
Yoon Jae.

317
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,510
We must have thought lightly of this whole thing.

318
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,680
Ji Eun.

319
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Go home.

320
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,260
Kim Ji Eun!

321
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
How did you hide it so far?

322
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,120
Why did you call me up here? I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

323
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,620
I feel the exact same.

324
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,020
So why did you call me over?

325
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,690
Do you know Yoon Jae's not going to Corning?

326
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,520
What do you mean?

327
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,860
He told me he'd applied to go.

328
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,100
He told the professor today that he wouldn't go.

329
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,630
He said he couldn't for personal reasons.

330
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,170
Don't you think you're too selfish?

331
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,510
How much longer will you trouble Yoon Jae...

332
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,540
just for your own happiness?

333
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,280
Studying astronomy...

334
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,610
at Corning is a dream for people like us.

335
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,410
Yoon Jae gave up on that because of you.

336
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,890
I'll...

337
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,060
I'll talk him into going somehow.

338
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,630
How, when the deadline's closed?

339
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,830
Do you think this is the only thing...

340
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,700
he gave up on because of you?

341
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,200
Did you think about what he'd have to give up in the future?

342
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,370
If you love him, please, let him go.

343
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,610
I'll take care of what comes next.

344
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Take a seat.

345
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,860
Are you okay?

346
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,270
I should ask you that.

347
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,670
Were you okay?

348
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,010
I'm fine. I don't feel bad at all.

349
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,750
But...

350
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,850
my mom hasn't recovered yet.

351
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,620
Why don't you feel bad?

352
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,590
Because...

353
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,620
I'm me.

354
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,230
Why are you okay with anything?

355
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,300
You're not going to Corning?

356
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,670
How did you find out?

357
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,710
That's what you care about?

358
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,780
You're staying here because of me.

359
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,820
I saw you change as you sat in my lap.

360
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,950
- How can I go and leave you behind? - Why can't you?

361
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,320
Am I dying?

362
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
I'm not, so why can't you go?

363
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,030
It's not that I can't go. I won't go.

364
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't want to go.

365
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,300
How much more miserable do you want to make me feel?

366
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,210
I can't stand myself...

367
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,040
for still trying to be with you.

368
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,210
Your dream and your family.

369
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,080
I'm ruining everything.

370
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
You're not.

371
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,750
Nothing's ruined.

372
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,430
Park Yoon Jae.

373
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,600
I have a favour to ask you.

374
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,170
Please break up with me.

375
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,510
What?

376
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,450
Not that again.

377
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,390
I can't do this anymore.

378
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,630
I can't help it if you call me...

379
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,800
selfish or a coward.

380
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,540
Park Yoon Jae.

381
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,040
Being with you...

382
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,610
doesn't make me as happy.

383
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,620
Hey.

384
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,050
Kim Ji Eun.

385
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,590
Let's really break up this time.

386
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,400
Please.

387
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,900
I beg you.

388
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,020
I'm home.

389
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,420
Welcome back.

390
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,780
Your mom's on strike, so I did what I could.

391
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,680
Okay.

392
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,850
Did you have dinner?

393
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,780
- Yes. - If not,

394
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,250
- how about an udon... - Dad.

395
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,650
I'm tired.

396
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,890
Sorry.

397
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,730
Okay.

398
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,790
That's fine.

399
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Yoon Jae.

400
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,780
Your life is your responsibility.

401
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,880
If you can handle it, do what you want.

402
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,390
Sleep well.

403
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,940
Hey.

404
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,310
An awesome chicken feet place opened near my office.

405
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,880
How about us two sisters...

406
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
have a drink?

407
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,190
How about a movie?

408
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,890
A really fun one just got released.

409
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,790
No.

410
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,390
Let's go to Eurwangni Beach for some grilled shellfish.

411
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,830
Wouldn't that be great?

412
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Ji Hye.

413
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,600
I'll stay with Yu Ri for a while.

414
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,070
Okay, then.

415
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,970
If you want.

416
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,710
Don't you dare touch my stuff while I'm gone.

417
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,610
Why don't you lock your room?

418
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,790
Ji Hoon.

419
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,840
I love you lots and lots.

420
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,140
I wish you luck.

421
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,180
Don't. That's gross.

422
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,150
Why feel embarrassed?

423
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,550
Wear something warm.

424
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,750
What's up?

425
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,120
You told me...

426
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,920
to just break up with him and that you'd handle the rest.

427
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,690
Right.

428
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,960
I broke up with Yoon Jae.

429
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,730
Really?

430
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,700
You guys broke up?

431
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,530
Yes.

432
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,470
That said,

433
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,940
is there any way Yoon Jae can still go to Corning University?

434
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,280
Admission is already closed.

435
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,550
I'll look into it.

436
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,290
Thanks.

437
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,670
Here.

438
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,200
My sister doesn't like spicy food.

439
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
(Get a stamp with any order over ten dollars.)

440
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,610
(Chunchun Malatang)

441
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,180
All right, then. Take care.

442
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,310
What? Are you going somewhere?

443
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,450
You can stop bothering with me now.

444
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,660
What?

445
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,370
(That moment, when the morning sunlight poured in...)

446
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,150
Here.

447
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,190
When did you start writing?

448
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,490
I told you. You have the talent.

449
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,060
I'm just giving this a shot.

450
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,100
I decided to follow your advice and try a different approach.

451
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,470
You're doing the right thing.

452
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,070
What? Who's here?

453
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,480
Hey, Min Hyuk.

454
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,420
Sweet and crunchy fried chicken.

455
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,060
Ji Hoon.

456
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,630
Hey, Min Hyuk.

457
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,800
When did you come back from the US?

458
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,270
You just vanished suddenly, and it made me really sad.

459
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,800
What's going on?

460
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,540
Hey.

461
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,680
So, why are you here?

462
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,380
Well, he has a bit of a situation,

463
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,050
so he'll live with me.

464
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,080
He'll live here?

465
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,920
You two will live here together?

466
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,350
Oh, well...

467
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,890
I've got something going on, so I'll be staying here briefly.

468
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,930
Hey, my place is better than here.

469
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,390
Let's go.

470
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,630
What?

471
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,030
I know you're close friends,

472
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,630
but it's not right for an adult man and woman to live together.

473
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,070
Let's go to my place.

474
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,800
It'd be more comfortable to stay with a guy friend.

475
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,470
Wait, the thing is...

476
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,170
No way!

477
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,550
No, he can't do that.

478
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,150
Yu Ri, do you really not know why I'm doing this?

479
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,450
What?

480
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,590
The thing is...

481
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,970
(From Kim Ji Hye)

482
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,520
Kim Ji Hye, seriously...

483
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,830
Oh, yes.

484
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,400
Hey, friend!

485
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,100
Kim Ji Hye, what is all this?

486
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,270
My gosh. Did you receive the package already?

487
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,540
It's just a little something I sent to cheer on my friend...

488
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,050
before his exam.

489
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,020
I thought you understood how I felt.

490
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,450
I told you not to do these things.

491
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,790
You told me not to confess my feelings.

492
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,790
You never said I couldn't send a gift.

493
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,590
Then next time, I'll do something different.

494
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,330
Bye for now!

495
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,600
Hey.

496
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,580
What? What's this?

497
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,350
She still had this?

498
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,360
Our friendship is forever.

499
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,750
Hey.

500
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,150
- What? Seriously. - Hang on.

501
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,370
Hey! I told you to let go of my hand.

502
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
You missed class and didn't even pick up your phone.

503
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,090
What are you doing here?

504
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,160
Right, I forgot I had class.

505
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,870
Seriously...

506
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,540
Do you have to make it that obvious you broke up?

507
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,070
How did you know?

508
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,280
That's not important right now.

509
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,910
I just spoke with our professor.

510
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,820
About Corning University,

511
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,750
you might be able to apply again.

512
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,690
What?

513
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,590
What do you mean?

514
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,090
I think Professor O'Connor...

515
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,990
was pretty disappointed to hear that you weren't coming.

516
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,700
Instead of staying in the same place,

517
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,010
wouldn't it help you move on from the breakup...

518
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,340
by getting a change of scenery and focusing on something new?

519
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,680
The decision is yours,

520
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,080
so think it over.

521
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,730
Hey, do you know that Ji Hoon is back in Korea now?

522
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,230
- You saw him? - Yes.

523
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,070
He's staying with Yu Ri.

524
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,740
I mean, I get that they're super close friends,

525
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,870
but how can a grown man and woman live together?

526
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,980
Is he doing well?

527
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
Ji Hoon?

528
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,850
Yes, he seemed to be doing fine.

529
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,750
Right, I heard he was preparing for some kind of contest.

530
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,090
Yu Ri said he was working way harder on it than she was.

531
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,620
I thought he'd be like me,

532
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,430
but I was worried for nothing.

533
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,300
(My Ji Eun)

534
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,870
Being with you doesn't make me as happy.

535
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,580
Hey. Kim Ji Eun.

536
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,180
Let's really break up this time.

537
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,990
Please.

538
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,460
I beg you.

539
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:52,360
(My Ji Eun)

540
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:13,950
Jeong Ja!

541
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,730
- I realised I still had this, so... - Oh, right.

542
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,560
Sorry. I should've picked it up.

543
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,200
By the way, we were drunk last time,

544
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,400
and I was honestly too stunned to ask.

545
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,410
Why do you want to stop seeing me?

546
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,710
At first, I was grateful to you because you made me feel like...

547
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,120
I could finally be a good son to my parents.

548
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,620
And?

549
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,860
At some point,

550
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,790
I realised I was relying on you.

551
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,730
That's fine. You can rely on me.

552
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,070
Rely on me all you want.

553
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
No.

554
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,670
From this point on,

555
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,210
I want to rely on myself and be totally independent.

556
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,380
But if I have you next to me,

557
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,450
I'll never learn to be independent.

558
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,120
I'm sorry for being so selfish until the very end.

559
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,890
You've got it wrong. You're not sorry for being selfish.

560
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,360
You're selfish for apologising until the end.

561
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,100
All you say is sorry, from beginning to end,

562
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,270
and I can't hold on to someone like that.

563
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,580
From now on, try to grow strong on your own.

564
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,840
I apologise for complicating the situation, Professor.

565
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,020
So, you won't change your mind this time, right?

566
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,450
I won't. I really want to go...

567
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,350
to Corning University.

568
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,690
All right, then.

569
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,900
Yoon Jae.

570
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,070
Let's go!

571
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,180
You've made the right decision. Cheers.

572
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,410
I've quit drinking.

573
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,910
What? Why?

574
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,350
Just because.

575
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,090
I want to avoid making mistakes.

576
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,220
What kind of mistake...

577
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,260
Oh, forget it. I'm not curious.

578
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,430
But I need to drink today.

579
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:14,930
Cheers!

580
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,710
Hey, if you need any help while working...

581
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,180
on your Corning University application, just let me know.

582
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,520
All right, I will.

583
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:34,450
Thanks.

584
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,820
Once you're there, everything will get better.

585
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
Trust me.

586
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,870
I hope you're right about that.

587
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,140
Gosh, seriously.

588
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,480
Pull yourself together now, will you?

589
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,410
Why? What's wrong with the way I am now?

590
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,010
I'm totally fine.

591
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,980
Fine. Just get drunk. That might be better.

592
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,760
Drink up.

593
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,930
- Come on. - Gosh.

594
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,500
- Do you weigh 100kg or something? - Let's grab another drink.

595
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,470
- Another drink, my foot. - One more round!

596
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,570
- That's a cafe. - Oh, is it?

597
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,680
- One more round. - Hey! Park Yoon Jae.

598
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,210
Sober up, will you? Goodness.

599
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,950
I'm not drunk.

600
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,780
Whatever. Come on!

601
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,490
Min Joo, for real. I'm not drunk.

602
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:44,990
Okay.

603
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,090
I swear, I'm not okay.

604
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,690
Goodness.

605
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,560
Ji Eun.

606
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,340
I'm really not okay.

607
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,400
Goodness.

608
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,640
Ji Eun.

609
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,240
Ji Eun!

610
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,150
Seriously, if I didn't have a crush on you,

611
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,850
I'd punch you right now.

612
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,960
I'm going home.

613
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,090
- My gosh. - I have to go home.

614
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,130
Yoon Jae!

615
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,060
Are you sure you can go home alone?

616
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,730
- Gosh. - Should I come with you?

617
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,600
I'll be fine.

618
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,500
No problem.

619
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,880
- Take me home! - What? Oh, dear.

620
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,380
Ouch, that hurts.

621
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,150
Bye.

622
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,720
- Let's go! - My goodness.

623
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,320
Whatever.

624
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,700
What?

625
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,090
Honestly, this is nuts.

626
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh, gosh.

627
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,100
Yoon Jae.

628
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,010
Hey, get up.

629
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,280
Yoon Jae, get up. Wake up.

630
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,410
Yoon Jae.

631
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,220
Come on. Get up.

632
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,520
One, two, three. Come on.

633
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,490
My goodness.

634
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,960
Gosh, hold on. One moment.

635
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,800
Goodness. Hey!

636
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,400
I'm exhausted.

637
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,370
My goodness.

638
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,510
Take your socks off.

639
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,480
Gosh.

640
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,790
Goodness.

641
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,180
What a fool.

642
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,450
But then again, who am I to call him a fool?

643
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,820
Why do I even like a guy who can't forget his girlfriend,

644
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,160
especially when she keeps turning into a man?

645
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,180
Ji Eun.

646
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,070
Park Yoon Jae, you are the worst.

647
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,650
Hey.

648
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,460
- Let me explain what happened. - No need to explain.

649
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,590
"No need?"

650
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,970
That's right.

651
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,370
As you know, we're nothing now.

652
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,540
Right.

653
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,080
It's over...

654
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,020
between us.

655
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,870
(Epilogue)

656
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,330
My Ji Eun.

657
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,540
If you let her stay like this without turning back into a man,

658
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,340
I, Park Yoon Jae,

659
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:28,980
will do anything.

660
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,980
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

661
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,740
Should I really go?

662
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,880
Ji Eun. Do you really want me to leave?

663
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,950
You should just have a drink.

664
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,750
Tonight at 9:20pm. It's Hana Air.

665
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,420
Goodbye, Park Yoon Jae.

666
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,060
Didn't you hear something just now?

667
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,530
For some reason, you always show up when Min Hyuk is here.

668
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,760
You guys are dating, right?

669
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,760
- Yes. - No.

670
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,300
No?

671
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,200
You can start today, right?

672
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:57,770
I'll work hard.

673
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,770
Excuse me, sir?
