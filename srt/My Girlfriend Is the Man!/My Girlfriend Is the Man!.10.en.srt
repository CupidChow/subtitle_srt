1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,080
(Yoon San Ha)

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,720
(Arin)

3
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,230
(Yoo Jung Hoo)

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,470
(Chuu)

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,040
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

6
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,650
You've really aged, my dear grandpa.

7
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,660
My grandma.

8
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,810
So, it is because of your girlfriend.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,550
No.

10
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,450
It's because of me.

11
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,649
Yoon Jae. If she truly loves you,

12
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,590
she'll stand by you and encourage you to follow your dreams.

13
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,020
Are you not even getting the treatment you deserve from her?

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,190
Let's drop this.

15
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,410
There's one thing I know for sure.

16
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,810
At least in this very moment, no one cares about you...

17
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,720
more deeply than me on this planet.

18
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,400
Who are you?

19
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Hey.

20
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,970
Hi.

21
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,240
Sorry I'm late.

22
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,390
Well, this is...

23
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,150
Let me explain what happened.

24
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,760
You don't need to explain.

25
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,190
Come on.

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Yoon Jae's girlfriend, right?

27
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,339
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,400
We can talk later.

29
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,080
Come on.

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,280
That's right. I'm Yoon Jae's girlfriend.

31
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,950
I'm pretty close with Ji Hoon's grandpa too.

32
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,960
Hold on. You came here dressed like that?

33
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, why?

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
Where is Ji Hoon?

35
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,470
Ji Hoon?

36
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,050
Well, Ji Hoon is...

37
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,420
Oh, Ji Hoon!

38
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,620
He went back to Seoul.

39
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
He went back to Seoul?

40
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,460
When?

41
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,660
Earlier.

42
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,899
He said something urgent came up and left.

43
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Right.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,070
My gosh.

45
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Aren't those Ji Hoon's shoes?

46
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,550
Darn it, they are.

47
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,189
Maybe he got mixed up and put on the wrong shoes...

48
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,530
since it was so dark?

49
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,560
- What? - Oh, yes.

50
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,160
That must be it.

51
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,400
Am I the only one who thinks this is weird?

52
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,200
This girl shows up out of nowhere,

53
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,769
and Ji Hoon suddenly disappears without a word? What's going on?

54
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,040
All sorts of wild and unexpected things can happen in life.

55
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,330
The important thing now is that...

56
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,830
Kim Ji Eun, Park Yoon Jae's girlfriend,

57
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,030
has returned.

58
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,710
I missed you,

59
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,550
Yoon Jae.

60
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Sorry for making you wait so long.

61
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,580
(Episode 10: 6734)

62
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,910
Here.

63
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,150
I made this all-natural syrup completely from scratch.

64
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,289
It's nice to add it to hot water and drink as tea on cold days.

65
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,959
Grandpa, how come you're giving me so many things?

66
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,789
Perilla leaf kimchi, mustard leaf kimchi,

67
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,030
and sweet potato vine kimchi.

68
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,500
I only packed the things you absolutely love.

69
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,230
By the way, are you really Yoon Jae's girlfriend?

70
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,700
Oh, yes.

71
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,110
I told you about him.

72
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,370
This is Min Hyuk, my co-worker at the cafe.

73
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
Yes.

74
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,410
I've heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you.

75
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,449
Anyway, Grandpa. What happened to Ji Hoon?

76
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,349
What was so urgent that he left us at your place...

77
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,489
and rushed back to Seoul alone?

78
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,459
Oh, what happened was...

79
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,060
Goodness, what was it?

80
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,600
Oh, dear. He told me, but I forgot the moment I turned around.

81
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,930
This is why it's hard being old sometimes.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,940
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the tone.

83
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,570
Well, his phone is off.

84
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,310
What if something happened to him?

85
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,410
I let it slip my mind briefly,

86
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,549
but he's never straightforward with anything.

87
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,620
No, you're wrong about that.

88
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,050
My grandchild is genuinely honest and kind.

89
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,990
Did he call or text you at all?

90
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
No, he didn't.

91
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,930
Stop asking so many questions.

92
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,730
I'm sure he had his reasons.

93
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,260
Let's go.

94
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,570
Well...

95
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,199
You guys can go ahead.

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,470
I need to stay and take care of something.

97
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,140
Me too.

98
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,940
What do you need to do?

99
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,670
As if that's any of your business.

100
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,180
Come on. Let's go.

101
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,179
What's your problem?

102
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,479
- What's with you, Yu Ri? - Get going. I'll call you.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,949
- Get going, guys. - I'll call you.

104
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,250
- Let go! - Bye.

105
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,850
What's your deal?

106
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,520
My gosh.

107
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,660
Hey, seriously.

108
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,260
Don't worry.

109
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,929
It's beyond what ordinary people...

110
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,070
could ever imagine, even in their wildest dreams.

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,540
Oh, boy.

112
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,880
You must have been really shocked.

113
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,810
You must've been shocked.

114
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,349
This isn't my first rodeo, so it was all right.

115
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,090
What? "First rodeo?"

116
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,290
You're adorable.

117
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,999
Oh, I need to go to the bathroom.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Sure.

119
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,470
My gosh.

120
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,440
You're so beautiful.

121
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,310
When I see you,

122
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm reminded of your mother when she was young.

123
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,920
- Grandma. - You know, Ji Eun,

124
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,220
you were so cool yesterday too.

125
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,860
Yu Ri said the same thing.

126
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,030
Except for the fact that I changed into a man, it's still a win.

127
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,070
Of course. That's still you too, you know?

128
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,970
Ji Eun.

129
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,510
If you ever change back into a man, try not to resent yourself too much.

130
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,449
You can't expect others to acknowledge you...

131
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,750
if you don't love yourself.

132
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,150
This is true for everyone, ordinary people included.

133
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,659
Okay, I'll try.

134
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
Good.

135
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,800
Oh, my.

136
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,350
Ji Hoon!

137
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,380
Hey, Ji Hoon.

138
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,950
My gosh.

139
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,229
What did Grandpa pack for you in here?

140
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,929
Hey, are you sure this is kimchi?

141
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,430
- Put them here. - Oh, boy.

142
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,040
Thanks.

143
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,340
Grandpa's kimchi is to die for.

144
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,140
Do you want to stay for some ramyeon?

145
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,210
Well...

146
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,380
Shall I?

147
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,959
Hey, your place is really nice.

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,290
Oh, wait.

149
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,129
Can you give me a moment to get ready?

150
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,130
What?

151
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,560
Don't turn around. Stay right here, okay?

152
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,470
Hey, get ready for what? I thought we were just having ramyeon.

153
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Goodness.

154
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,310
Gosh, this is nuts.

155
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,870
Get ready for what?

156
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,050
Actually, forget it.

157
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,779
Today, you should just go.

158
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,549
I'll invite you over next time.

159
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,220
What's there to get ready for if we're eating ramyeon?

160
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,319
Oh, you don't have any ramyeon? I can pick some up.

161
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,290
No, there's plenty here.

162
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Sorry.

163
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,789
- I'll invite you when I'm ready. - What?

164
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,160
Hey, wait... What?

165
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,999
I'll just go alone from here.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,929
Why? I don't like that.

167
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,000
Let me walk you home.

168
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,470
Have you forgotten who my neighbour is?

169
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,310
Darn it.

170
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,140
But why does that matter?

171
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,480
What do you mean? What will you say, then?

172
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,280
Well, I'll just say...

173
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,750
you two are cousins?

174
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,320
How about that?

175
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,790
He was only staying temporarily because of his circumstances.

176
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,829
Ji Hoon has returned home.

177
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,600
The farther the better, right?

178
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,070
How about the US?

179
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,740
Come on. That's too random.

180
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,070
We need to set things up properly from the start.

181
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,940
When it comes to Kang Min Joo,

182
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,180
I don't want to just wing it or handle things sloppily.

183
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,550
Hey, didn't you get my text?

184
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,190
We meet again.

185
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,230
What are you doing here?

186
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,060
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,169
All right. Come and sit here.

188
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,940
Hey, sister. Leave us alone.

189
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,200
"Sister?"

190
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,110
Are you sure?

191
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,310
Yes.

In situations where we shouldn't be meeting...

193
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,800
I mean, why do we keep crossing paths in places we shouldn't?

194
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,130
Why are you here?

195
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,470
I live here now.

196
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,740
Ji Hoon is...

197
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,410
He's my cousin.

198
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,910
He was staying here temporarily because of his circumstances.

199
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,650
You two are cousins?

200
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,990
And you expect me to believe that now?

201
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,460
It's up to you whether you believe me or not.

202
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,030
So, where is Ji Hoon now?

203
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,200
Well...

204
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,030
I guess he went back home.

205
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,070
Oh, right.

206
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,440
Just so you know, his home is in the US.

207
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,540
Just by looking, you can tell he grew up in the US.

208
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,590
Does Yoon Jae know about this situation too?

209
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,290
Yes.

210
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,960
He walked me home just now.

211
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,230
Can you please leave now?

212
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,170
I'm quite tired.

213
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,950
Hey, the door isn't that way!

214
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,320
I see that he left all his stuff.

215
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,890
Well...

216
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,430
He probably left those because he didn't need them.

217
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm sure he took all the important things with him.

218

00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,449
I'm sad.

223
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,850
I want to make sure you're okay.

224

What?

226
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,960
So she wasn't suspicious?

227
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,920
She was just worried?

228
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,230

- Here, this is for you. - What is this?

232
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,970
Socks.

233
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,439
I got matching socks for you and Mr. Kim.

234

Oh, right. Ji Hoon is done tutoring you.

237
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,450
- I mean, he can't do it anymore. - What? Why not?

238
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,880
Ask no more.

239
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,319
I'll let Mom know, so don't say anything.

240
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,519
Something's fishy about this. Did you guys fight?

Did I miss your call?

367
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,830
Hello there.

368
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,000
Why are you suddenly so polite?

369
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,840
Be your old self.

370
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,870
Why are you being so scary?

371
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,850
Ji Eun. Let's go.

372
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,450
Okay.

373
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,520
Yoon Jae. Let's have an awesome date today.

374
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,120
Yes, let's do that.

375
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,590
Email the rest. I'll go over it for you.

376
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,230
Let's go.

377
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,609
- This is the one. - This is it?

378
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,979
- Doesn't it look good? - It's huge.

379
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,340
- Can you give us this one? - Sure.

380
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,449
I wanted to eat this with you so badly.

381
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,580
You should've asked me sooner.

382
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,950
It fell.

383
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,920
How is it?

384
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,360
We didn't take a photo.

385
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,130
Where is it?

386
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
- It's this one. - This one?

387
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,600
Yes.

388
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,929
- Have you done this before? - No, it's a first.

389
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,939
- Is it? - Yes.

390
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,200
Do we put this here?

391
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,140
It's working.

392
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,980
And then this thing...

393
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,080
- What do we press next? - This.

394
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,520
Let's sit down.

395
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,960
Put this on.

396
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,830
- I hear it. - Yes.

397
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,330
It's so nice.

398
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm happy.

399
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,299
- Hey. - What?

400
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,440
What was that?

401
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,970
What's wrong?

402
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,710
There are lights on the ground...

403
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,920
and stars in the sky.

404
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,590
What a perfect end to a day.

405
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,420
I'm so happy today.

406
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Me too.

407
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,230
I looked it up.

408
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,700
Corning's astronomy department...

409
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,370
is pretty famous.

410
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,300
You'd be awesome if you got to research there.

411
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,770
NASA is just 30 minutes away too.

412
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,710
Ji Eun.

413
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,050
My grandma sent me this.

414
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,980
It's a photo of her mom.

415
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,320
Do you know the poet...

416
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,790
Kim Pil Hyun?

417
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,230
That's my great-grandmother.

418
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,860
This was her when she was young.

419
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,740
As a woman, she was an ordinary housewife.

420
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,510
Then she became a man and wrote frantically.

421
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,710
That...

422
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,720
gave me lots of courage.

423
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,489
While I was Ji Hoon,

424
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,250
I worked on something for a competition.

425
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,220
- A competition? - Yes.

426
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,730
The truth is,

427
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,160
I'd wanted to be a writer like Yu Ri.

428
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,070
Even though I'm not good at it.

429
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,240
When I realised I couldn't do anything else,

430
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,110
the dream I'd put aside came to mind.

431
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,480
You can give it a go.

432
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,850
Yes.

433
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,480
So I will.

434
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,480
Yoon Jae.

435
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,820
You should go to the US.

436
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,700
I don't have to go abroad.

437
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,970
I can study here.

438
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,010
Yes. You could do that.

439
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,050
But the thing you want to study...

440
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,320
is space that's out there.

441
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,250
Where we are...

442
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,020
is farther away from space.

443
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,070
We can talk every day.

444
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,970
I'll visit you too.

445
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,910
If I don't turn back into a guy.

446
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,580
If I turn into Ji Hoon,

447
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,180
I can't use my passport.

448
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,720
I really hope it never happens again.

449
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,290
Why is that?

450
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,860
I think I'll miss Ji Hoon every now and then.

451
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
What?

452
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,800
Ji Hoon...

453
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,370
was a cool guy.

454
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,510
Even when things were tough, he always tried to smile.

455
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,180
He stayed brave.

456
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,610
I say this now,

457
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,080
but he was a real man.

458
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,119
I'm still bothered that our last chat...

459
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,160
was a fight.

460
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,390
I didn't get to apologise.

461
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,400
It looks like you miss me already.

462
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,900
No.

463
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,630
It's not that.

464
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,470
Anyway, you have to go to the US.

465
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,749
I said I'd get you a star...

466
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,320
when we went to Chuncheon.

467
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
I meant to give this to you then, but it took a while.

468
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,030
It's beautiful.

469
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,830
Even while we're apart,

470
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,200
I'll look at this and think of you.

471
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,510
Thank you, Yoon Jae.

472
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,269
I wanted to buy you something expensive at a nice place.

473
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,030
I like places like this.

474
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,240
Can you pour me a shot?

475
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,010
You don't drink.

476
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,720
I think I need liquid courage...

477
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,050
to speak my mind today.

478
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,070
You won't drink?

479
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
I'll take my time.

480
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,510
Something tells me...

481
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,080
tonight will be unforgettable.

482
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,320
Jeong Ja.

483
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,060
Actually, there's something I must tell you today.

484
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,960
Go ahead, whatever it is.

485
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,100
Before I do that,

486
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,100
I would like to express my gratitude for what you did for my father.

487
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,270
Well, there are a lot more things I should thank you for.

488
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,680
But the problem is that...

489
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,510
gratitude isn't the only thing I feel now.

490
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,050
What do you mean?

491
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,350
Jeong Ja.

492
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,460
Now,

493
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,890
I need to go back to who I used to be.

494
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,500
The test taker who's been studying for eight consecutive years,

495
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,270
Hong Young Seok.

496
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,240
I'm sorry.

497
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,780
So do you not want to see me anymore?

498
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,870
"Corning University?"

499
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,399
This will be 100 times more accurate than what Yoon Jae will tell us.

500
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,640
(Translate)

501
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,670
Look.

502
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,049
"I sincerely hope you will come to Corning University..."

503
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,050
"and join my research."

504
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,820
"If you decide to join me,"

505
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,990
"you will receive a year's tuition..."

506
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,259
"and a small stipend."

507
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,630
- My gosh. - No way!

508
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,660
- Goodness. - What...

509
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,559
Honey. Did you hear that?

510
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,069
Yes, I heard that.

511
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,529
- My gosh. - This is crazy.

512
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,899
I can't believe this!

513
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,940
My gosh. That hurts!

514
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,440
- My gosh. - You guys are so loud.

515
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,649
My dear son.

516
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,820
- What's going on? - My gosh.

517
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,850
We heard that you got into Corning University.

518
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,259
My gosh. Look at my genius son.

519
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,789
Good job, my smart boy.

520
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,229
Wait, Mom. How did you know that?

521
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,729
- Well done. - Good job.

522
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,159
Good job, my son.

523
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,429
- Way to go, Yoon Jae! - My son.

524
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,069
- Yoon Jae. - Yes?

525
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,769
- Take me with you! - What? Take you where?

526
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,569
- Take me with you. - Me too.

527
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,640
- Okay. - Let us come with you.

528
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,620
(Exchange Student Application for Semester 1, 2025)

529
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,330
(Congratulations Gosiwon)

530
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,450
Kim Ji Hye.

531
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,910
Hey. Hello.

532
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,820
My gosh. You look so handsome today.

533
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,860
What are you doing here?

534
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,460
What?

535
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,459
I was waiting for you.

536
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,289
Me? Why?

537
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,390
To confess my feelings to you.

538
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,159
What? To do what?

539
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,200
To confess.

540
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,240
Young Seok.

541
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,970
I like you.

542
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,610
I've never forgotten you for even a moment...

543
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,510
since the day we met in tenth grade.

544
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,289
- Ji Hye. - But...

545
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,120
I'm not asking you to return my feelings.

546
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,389
I'm telling you how I feel because today is an auspicious day...

547
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,490
for a romantic confession.

548
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,929
What on earth are you saying?

549
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,060
I don't know either.

550
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,529
But I don't want to spend my life regretting again...

551
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,240
because I never told you how I felt about you.

552
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,909
Telling my feelings to you and getting dumped...

553
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,540
is an improvement.

554
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,080
I believe being rejected can also be an improvement.

555
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,780
Did you drink?

556
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,650
Can you smell it?

557
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,650
I was super nervous, so I only had a can of beer.

558
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,960
But alcohol has nothing to do with this.

559
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,030
Are those flowers for me?

560
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,360
Yes.

561
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
How beautiful.

562
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,410
Flowers in a gosiwon.

563
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,380
They're just like you and me.

564
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,320
But I'm really sorry, Ji Hye.

565
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,150
I can't return your feelings.

566
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,630
I see.

567
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,460
My gosh. It's okay.

568
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,770
Don't worry about it. Let's put a pin on it and...

569
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,700
Ji Hye. You see,

570
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,070
being able to think of you...

571
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,410
during my difficult times...

572
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,280
helped me a lot.

573
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,480
Even when I was in a tough spot,

574
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,280
I was able to smile thanks to you.

575
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,420
When my future seemed bleak,

576
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,620
I remembered my high school days with you by my side...

577
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,490
and used it as my escape.

578
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,660
I'm sincerely grateful to have a great friend like you.

579
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,270
I will do my best...

580
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,840
to live a good life, so I can be a friend...

581
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,910
you can rely on too.

582
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,910
I see.

583
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,750
I already feel like you are.

584
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,490
My gosh, you look like a soccer player.

585
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,230
- A soccer player? - Yes.

586
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,560
Hey, you dropped that.

587
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,169
My gosh. I wasn't so good at soccer.

588
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,200
Right.

589
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,269
- Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

590
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,270
These flowers are beautiful.

591
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,639
If you dry them carefully, you can keep them for a long time.

592
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,680
- Really? - Yes.

593
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,479
It's a pity they will wither away. These are fresh-cut flowers, right?

594
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,520
I'm like a fool

595
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:12,259
I can only watch you from afar

596
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,190
Because

597
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,929
I'm afraid that you might turn away

598
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,230
From me

599
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,870
Hey, you...

600
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,110
I can't be drinking with you.

601
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,409
I can't be talking to you.

602
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,540
You already drank a lot.

603
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,150
I'm not in the mood to talk to you either.

604
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,850
Let's just stick to our own drinks.

605
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,820
It must be because

606
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,860
I'm afraid to face those sad days

607
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Thank you.

608
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,900
My gosh. What? You must be a singer!

609
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,370
Ji Hye, you sang it better.

610
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,240
- Ji Hye. - Yes?

611
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,610
What's the deal with Kim Ji Hoon and Kim Ji Eun?

612
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,379
They are cousins. Ji Hoon is in the US.

613
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,480
Ji Eun is working on her personal growth.

614
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,349
They are cousins.

615
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,350
Ji Hoon is in the US.

616
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:16,420
Ji Eun is working on her personal growth.

617
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,060
Are you rapping or what?

618
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,230
And I got dumped.

619
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,060
Min Joo.

620
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:32,070
I confessed my feelings to a guy for the first time in my life.

621
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,970
But I got rejected.

622
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,810
Ji Hye!

623
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
You know what?

624
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:44,420
Yoon Jae rejects me every time I talk to him.

625
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,650
Let's hang in there.

626
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,460
Hey.

627
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,130
Park Yoon Jae...

628
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,599
You can't get in between those two.

629
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,630
Why not?

630
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,140
You know what?

631
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,050
You're the only person...

632
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm going to say this to. Are you sure you can keep a secret?

633
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,020
Ji Hye.

634
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,620
Do you know where I keep my lock and key?

635
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,690
It's under my lips. What is it?

636
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,960
Just tell me.

637
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,970
You see, the secret is...

638
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,270
Go on.

639
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,670
- Ji Eun. - Okay.

640
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,640
- Ji Hoon. - Okay.

641
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,580
- The truth is, - Okay.

642
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,580
- they are the same person. - Okay.

643
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,650
So...

644
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,390
they're the same person.

645
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,020
You must be completely wasted.

646
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,560
What on earth are you talking about?

647
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,129
Turning into a man runs in our family...

648
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,000
from generation to generation.

649
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:14,540
I got lucky and didn't turn into a man.

650
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,310
Okay.

651
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,179
Hey, I'm serious.

652
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,049
You're the only person I'm sharing this with.

653
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,249
So you must keep it a secret.

654
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,920
You can't tell anyone about this. It will be a disaster, Min Joo.

655
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,059
- Okay. - Never tell a soul. Okay?

656
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,330
I got it.

657
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,700
She smells.

658
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,240
Park Yoon Jae.

659
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,540
Park Yoon Jae...

660
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,619
My goodness.

661
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,320
Ji Hye, wake up.

662
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,890
Oh, dear.

663
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,090
Did you drink all this?

664
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,660
Are you drunk too?

665
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,070
I get it.

666
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,039
- Hey, Ji Hye. Wake up. - Yes.

667
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,039
- Ji Hye. Hey. - Okay.

668
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,170
Wake up.

669
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,510
Gosh, it's my sister!

670
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,179
Let me see. Are you Ji Eun? Or are you Ji Hoon?

671
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,619
You must be out of your mind.

672
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,019
- My gosh. - Get a grip.

673
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,189
- That hurts. - Let's go down now.

674
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,059
What's wrong with you? Seriously.

675
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,390
- My gosh. That hurts! Mom. - Come on.

676
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,950
Who are you?

677
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,010
You should...

678
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,750
because...

679
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,220
I'm Yoon Jae's girlfriend.

680
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,560
Hi.

681
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,760
Sorry I'm late.

682
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,330
No way. That makes no sense.

683
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,670
But...

684
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,310
it sounds weirder...

685
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,910
if that's not the case.

686
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,160
I have you to thank for that.

687
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,270
She was already quite drunk by the time I joined her.

688
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,569
Hey, make up your mind.

689
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,009
Don't keep mixing honorifics when you talk to me.

690
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,810
I should be telling you to make up your mind.

691
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,080
Are you Kim Ji Eun? Or are you Kim Ji Hoon?

692
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,120
What do you mean?

693
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,019
Are you asking me that because of what my sister said?

694
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,990
- She's completely wasted. - I thought so too.

695
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,729
When I considered her ridiculous claim...

696
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,130
in light of the absurd situation I experienced, I got my answer.

697
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,840
Who are you?

698
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,810
Who on earth are you to make me and Yoon Jae feel off?

699
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,540
Reveal yourself.

700
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,320
What's your problem?

701
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,720
- What? - I made you feel off?

702
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
Hey.

703
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,589
Yoon Jae told you many times he had a girlfriend,

704
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,300
but you still hit on him.

705
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,130
Making someone feel off is better than hitting on a taken man.

706
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,929
Since you brought it up, should we go over...

707
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,270
which one of us is crossing the line?

708
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,640
Remember the ER?

709
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,139
Who do you think you are?

710
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,080
Pretending to be his girlfriend in front of his parents?

711
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,649
What? You'll have the meal as his girlfriend?

712
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,050
My gosh. That was just ridiculous.

713
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,050
How do you know that?

714
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,120
Oh, that?

715
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,860
Ji Hoon told me everything.

716
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,530
And the malatang restaurant.

717
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,099
Who are you...

718
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,500
to tell my boyfriend to get you fish balls?

719
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,239
His parents and I are the only ones...

720
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,269
who can ask Yoon Jae to do things.

721
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,370
And that day,

722
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,010
you know that you totally lost the malatang battle, right?

723
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,980
How do you know about that?

724
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,180
Oh, that?

725
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,780
Ji Hoon told me.

726
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,090
Let's talk about what happened at my grandpa's place.

727
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,090
It was already irritating that you tagged along cluelessly.

728
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,260
How dare you kiss Yoon Jae?

729
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,860
- Did Ji Hoon tell you that too? - No.

730
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,930
Yoon Jae told me about that.

731
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
- Who on earth are you? - Lastly,

732
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,470
you must think you'll be able to win him over in the US.

733
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,010
Don't even think about it.

734
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,510
That will never happen.

735
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,379
Hey, you sound like a nutjob right now.

736
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,180
Fine! I'll be a nutjob.

737
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,420
But let me make this clear.

738
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,519
You knew he was already taken.

739
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,960
But it was pathetic and shameless of you to try to seduce him.

740
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,520
So being a nutjob is better.

741
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,930
You little...

742
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,329
Let go of my hair.

743
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,900
I liked him first.

744
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,470
- Let go of me. - You little... Let go!

745
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,269
- Let go of me! - My gosh.

746
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,939
Hey, I liked Yoon Jae first.

747
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,970
You're unbelievable.

748
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,539
- Are you crazy? - Gosh, let go of my hair.

749
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,710
- Hey! - Let go.

750
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,650
Hey, you. Do you have a death wish?

751
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,480
What's wrong with you?

752
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,620
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

753
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:05,920
Hey.

754
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,790
You're crazy.

755
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,229
- Hey. - What does Yoon Jae see in you?

756
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,359
- Hey. - Let go.

757
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,970
Is this the police?

758
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,770
The dogs in the neighbourhood are fighting like crazy.

759
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,739
I'm going to get all the dogs in the neighbourhood!

760
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,169
- Hey! - Let go!

761
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,280
- Min Joo! - Hey.

762
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,310
Are you crazy?

763
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,180
Let go!

764
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:34,320
(Department of Astronomy)

765
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,420
Yoon Jae.

766
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,190
What?

767
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,360
What happened to you?

768
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,330
Your girlfriend is a total nutjob.

769
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,530
What?

770
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,670
It's not about seducing you anymore. It's a rescue operation now.

771
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,210
Hey, did you have another fight with Ji Eun again?

772
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,470
- Yes. That girl... - Forget it.

773
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,040
I'll talk to Ji Eun.

774
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,320
He's not coming back.

775
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,400
Look at these scratches on your face.

776
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,970
What on earth did you guys do to each other?

777
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:23,870
This must have hurt.

778
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,870
This is between two girls.

779
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,740
Seriously. Who told you to be this handsome?

780
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:41,919
But still.

781
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,590
It feels great that I finally got to say everything I wanted.

782
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,630
How am I supposed to leave you here and go to the US?

783
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,660
Don't worry about me. You should go.

784
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,130
The worst enemy is a romantic rival.

785
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,230
I'm taking down my romantic rival first.

786
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,440
Don't you have your part-time job today?

787
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,179
It's already 4pm. You should hurry.

788
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,250
I don't want to go.

789
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,680
Why not? You should still go.

790
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,090
Let me recharge.

791
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,259
Let's hurry. I'll walk you to the bus stop.

792
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,000
- Okay. Let's go. - Okay.

793
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,270
Min Joo.

794
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,640
What is it this time?

795
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,040
I told you not to come here again.

796
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,710
You're stalking me.

797
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,040
I didn't want to do this. But...

798
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,280
you won't answer my calls and are ignoring my texts.

799
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,620
Leave. Seriously.

800
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,050
Are you going to the US with Yoon Jae?

801
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,289
Yes.

802
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,460
No. Don't go to the US with him.

803
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,689
As you know, he already has a girlfriend.

804
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:57,329
It makes no sense that he's planning to study abroad with you.

805
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,860
Don't mention him.

806
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,370
Okay. But please reconsider.

807
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,970
Why must you suffer because of a loser like him?

808
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,910
Who told you I was suffering?

809
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,610
You're the one making me suffer, not Yoon Jae.

810
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,280
Please get out of my sight. Let go.

811
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,850
Come on!

812
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,079
Why do you like him so much?

813
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,180
Are you crazy?

814
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,250
Let go of me!

815
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,550
This isn't the first time. You should've tried to get away.

816
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:50,980
Why were you just standing there?

817
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,020
Get back inside.

818
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,359
I'm not done talking to her.

819
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,360
She doesn't like you!

820
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,760
It's you again?

821
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,200
You'd better not show up in my neighbourhood again.

822
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,690
Your name was Min Dong Gi, right?

823
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,490
Who are you?

824
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,360
Who am I? I'm the protector of justice.

825
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,290
Are you Park Yoon Jae's girlfriend?

826
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:39,830
You must know who I am.

827
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,570
I'm telling you this because you know who I am.

828
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,670
This better be the last time you mention Yoon Jae's name.

829
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,140
Or I'm going to make you pay.

830
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,810
I'll make you pay too.

831
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,840
Beat it. Seriously.

832
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,140
My gosh.

833
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,520
Come inside now.

834
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,750
Stay here for a bit and then go.

835
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,860
It's not because I'm worried about you or being thoughtful.

836
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,560
It's just that the guy you were dealing with is a total psycho.

837
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,760
Well, if you want to go home, you can.

838
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,500
I kept telling myself...

839
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:21,410
that it couldn't be and it just wasn't possible.

840
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,840
But only Ji Hoon and I know about what happened before.

841
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,680
How did you know about Min Dong Gi?

842
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,930
I took pity on you and helped you.

843
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,660
You're talking nonsense.

844
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,700
Hey, get out of my house.

845
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:52,070
(Kim Ji Hoon)

846
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:09,920
(Kang Min Joo)

847
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,119
The person you have reached is unavailable.

848
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,090
You'll be directed to voicemail.

849
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360
Please leave...

850
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,360
(Kim Ji Hoon)

851
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,809
The person you have reached is unavailable.

852
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,710
You'll be directed to voicemail.

853
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,920
(Kim Ji Hoon)

854
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,590
The last 4 digits, 6734. It's you, isn't it?

855
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,460
Kim Ji Hoon.

856
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,020
The last 4 digits, 6734.

857
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,890
Yes. It's me.

858
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,820
Kim Ji Hoon.

859
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,960

(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

862
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,780
Did I change back again?

863
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,549
How much longer will you trouble Yoon Jae...

864
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,520
just for your own happiness?

865
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,220
Please don't tell the others about this.

866
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,620
Are you two really in a romantic relationship?

867
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,090
We must have thought lightly of this whole thing.

868
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,630
I have a favour to ask you.

869
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,230
Please break up with me.

870
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,100
I need to drink today.

871
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,230
Ji Eun!

872
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,870
Right. It's over...

873
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,210
between us.
