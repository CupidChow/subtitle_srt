Penis fish!

187
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,430
Stop it.

188
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,500
Stop it!

189
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,270
- Stop it!
- Penis fish.

[Questions about our memories]

191
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,280
<i>The name of the bathhouse that
Kim Ji Eun and Choi Yu Ri used to go to.</i>

192
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,590
<i>The Fairy and the Woodcutter.</i>

193
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,380
The Fairy and the Woodcutter?

194
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,780
<i>Choi Yu Ri's first love.</i>

195
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,570
<i>Gu Jae Yi, your tutor in seventh grade.</i>

196
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,650
<i>He's now married with three kids.</i>

197
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,420
Gu Jae Yi?

198
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,830
- You passed.
- Thank you.

199
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,760
Sure, look.

200
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,340
Stare a hole into my head.

201
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,020
My sister was the same as you.

202
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,590
I feel like I'm seeing a pumpkin
turned into a carriage.

203
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,590
This is incredible.

204
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,140
Can I touch you?

205
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,510
Touch what?

206
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,230
Get me some water.

207
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,830
Water? Okay.

208
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,290
Was it in fourth grade?

209
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,490
You told me you might turn into a guy one day.

210
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,130
I thought you were just crazy.

211
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,280
If you hadn't warned me back then,

212
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,250
this would be a lot more awkward.

213
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,240
What do I do with my life now?

214
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,900
I know you must feel incredulous,

215
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,190
but I don't think this is a disadvantage at all.

216
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,320
First of all, you will benefit from your looks,
and people will be nice to you.

217
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,530
Just look at me.

218
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,010
I can't help but be nice to you.

219
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,180
I can't go to school.

220
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,700
I can't get a job.

221
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,510
Most of all...

222
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,240
Yun Jae...

223
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,210
I'm afraid...

224
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,430
Yun Jae might want to break up.

225
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,330
If he wants to break up, just date me.

226
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,230
I'll take care of you.

227
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
Are you okay?

228
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,310
I'm Ji Eun. Kim Ji Eun!

229
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,780
You're not Ji Eun.

230
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't think so.

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,500
Could you just say you're not?

232
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,170
You're crazy.

233
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,530
No, no!

234
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,720
Wow.

235
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,510
I know that's my friend, but he's so hot.

236
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,080
So hot.

237
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,770
Extremely hot.

238
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,190
You're amazing.

239
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,290
Aren't you tired?

240
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,960
Hyung, did you leave the lights on in the cafe?

241
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,110
What are you saying?
We cleaned up and turned them off.

242
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,820
The lights are on.

243
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,230
Is the Boss okay?

244
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,830
Did the blind date go south?

245
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,870
I know, huh?

246
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,830
Did it not go well?

247
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,010
Jeong Ja, right?

248
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,940
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,450
I've never been here before, so I got a little lost.

250
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,050
That's okay. It happens.

251
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,700
My goodness.

252
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,020
N-Nice to meet you.

253
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,410
You're a beauty, like Yun Jae said.

254
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,860
Sure.

255
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,230
You're very tall, like I heard.

256
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,430
Maybe he's a lottery ticket that
hasn't been scratched yet.

257
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,710
Right. I can change him.

258
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,720
Did I shave and everything just to meet a guy

259
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,400
who has a class at 9 p.m.?

260
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,740
It's good to be hardworking.

261
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,270
He is very tall.

262
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,670
Hardworking.

263
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,850
He's just tall.

264
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,240
Should I fire my part-timer?

265
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,950
Can we just leave her like that?

266
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,260
What would going inside do?

267
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,060
Let's go.

268
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,120
We need to get a second round.

269
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,280
You said you'd buy fruit punch.

270
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,900
It's too late.

271
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,970
Let's go next time.

272
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,960
Fruit punch!

273
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,050
If I buy you fruit punch, would you kiss me just once?

274
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,330
would you kiss me just once?

275
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,750
If you buy me a house, I'll think about it.

276
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,420
If I kiss you once,

277
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,030
it might be easier next time.

278
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,030
Close your eyes.

279
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,790
Help me use the cheat key you told me about.

280
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,000
So, you'll buy me a house?
Gangnam, at least 33 pyeong.

281
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,070
Facing south. Two-minute walk
to Gangnam Station. No, one minute.

282
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,410
45 pyeong! 63 pyeong! Let me go!

283
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm going to cuss you out! I will!

284
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,530
I can't do this with a guy.

285
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,630
Come on. Why are you saying
what I should be saying?

286
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,140
[My Ji Eun]

287
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,000
<i>I couldn't answer.</i>

288

<i>If I heard his voice,</i>

289
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,910
<i>I might tell her we should break up.</i>

290
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:04,350
<i>♫ Beyond the fading sunset ♫</i>

291
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,530
[Want to come outside for a second?]

292
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:19,000
<i>♫ Your eyes looking at me ♫</i>

293
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,970
<i>♫ A familiar memory ♫</i>

294
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,880
<i>I couldn't even call out her name, either.</i>

295
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,060
<i>If I saw his face, I might say
we should break up.</i>

296
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,010
<i>He is definitely my Ji Eun,</i>

297
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,830
<i>but he's not my Ji Eun.</i>

298
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,680
<i>He is definitely not my Ji Eun,</i>

299
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,850
<i>but he is my Ji Eun.</i>

300
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,730
<i>♫ I see you ♫</i>

301
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,330
<i>♫ Always I know, more than I see ♫</i>

302
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,400
<i>Good night, Yun Jae.</i>

303
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,430
<i>The cosmos and love...</i>

304
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,750

307
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,730
[Yun Jae is mine]

308
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,340
<i>Can I see you tomorrow?</i>

309
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,190
<i>I'll come over to your house.</i>

310
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
Hey.

311
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,650
I must've had too much sashimi in Busan.

312
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,210
I feel nauseous.

313
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,000
Want to order tteokbokki together?

314
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,730
What?

315
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,860
Sleeping already?

316
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,120
Are you crying?

317
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,370
No. I just have sinusitis.

318
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,060
Get out.

319
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,890
My gosh...

320
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,400
Your sex changed,

321
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,070
but you still act like Kim Ji Eun.

322
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,660
If it's bad, don't just suck it up.

323
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,340
Take some medicine.

324
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,530
I'm sorry about last time.

325
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,930
I shouldn't have come onto you like that.

326
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,730
You don't have to apologize.

327
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,980
It might have been different for you,

328
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,100
but it wasn't for me.

329
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,280
It's something that could happen between lovers.

330
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,370
I gave it some thought...

331
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm trying to understand it with my head,

332
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,190
but when you look like a guy... how do I put this?

333
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,700
It's confusing.

334
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,260
Honestly,

335
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,620
I don't think we can keep going like before.

336
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,920
Yun Jae.

337
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,530
I gave it some thought, too.

338
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,450
Why don't we just be friends for a while?

339
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,960
- Friends?
- Yes. Friends.

340
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,260
Until I'm back to being a woman again,

341
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,110
let's be friends.

342
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,420
What's up?

343
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,870
What is this fast plot development?

344
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,230
Don't guys come here to play games together?

345
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,120
You're adjusting so quickly.

346
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,040
I tend to do that.

347
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,920
Have you played this game before?

348
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,040
- It's a really hard one.
- Yes.

349
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,960
I did with my sister way back when.

350
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,090

351
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,950

How many times can you die in one round?

363
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,070
Wait. Let me save you.

364
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,550
I died!

365
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,430
Wait.

00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,360
<i>I could make my boyfriend like me</i>

547
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,310
<i>even in my current state?</i>

548
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,640
What are you talking about? That wasn't me.

549
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,880
Sure, PF1004.

550
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,960
Penis Fish Angel*, I liked your post.
(1004 sounds like angel in Korean)

551
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,620
Let me teach you a thing or two.

552
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,390
Strategy number one.

553
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,890
Take a shower. Create a natural kind of sexiness.

554
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,610
This is insane!

555
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,760
Stop it!

556
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,070
You came.

557
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,510
Hey.

558
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,970
Come on in.

559
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,980
Okay.

560
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,830
Did you just wash up?

561
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,610
I broke a sweat while working out.

562
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,350
I got...

563
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,250
so hot.

564
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,480
You might catch a cold.

565
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,870
Go get dressed.

566
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,550
You need to dry off more.

567
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,690
Okay, I'll go change.

568
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,590
Strategy number two.

569
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:23,690
Appeal to him with gentle charisma and drive.

570
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,900
Appeal!

571
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,830
Appeal!

572
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:43,440
Appeal!

573
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,290
- Move over. I'll do it.
- Huh?

574
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,590
I can do it.

575
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,020
It's dangerous.

576
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,150
I said, move over.

577
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,690
Are you okay?

578
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,290
Hey. Where's the first aid kit?

579
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,390
I'll do everything from now on.

580
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,340
Just sit back.

581
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,760
Okay.

582
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,600
Strategy number three.

583
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,790
Subtle touch...

584
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,290
and give off a gentle gaze.

585
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,490
And...

586
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,120
<i>♫ I'll tell you ♫</i>

587
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,440
<i>♫ I'll tell you my heart ♫</i>

588
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,180
<i>♫ I keep smiling for no reason ♫</i>

589
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,210
Wow, looks so good.

590
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,900
Thank you for the food.

591
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,010
<i>♫ Can you hear my heart? ♫</i>

592
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,270
<i>♫ It's beating for you ♫</i>

593
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,650
<i>♫ Love is you, my heart is beating ♫</i>

594
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,950
Does your eye hurt?

595
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,660
<i>♫ I have sweet fantasies ♫</i>

596
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,700
- No.
- You keep blinking.

597
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,570
Go ahead, eat.

598
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,290
Okay.

599
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:22,410
<i>♫ 'Cause I love you, I'm curious about you ♫</i>

600
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,540
<i>♫ When I keep looking ♫</i>

601
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,890
Lastly...

602
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,360
the ultimate card.

603
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,900
<i>♫ My heart is going crazy ♫</i>

604
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:42,590
<i>♫ This feeling, this anticipation,
I love all of it ♫</i>

605
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,070
It's ten already. I have to go.

606
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,660
What? You're leaving already?

607
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,090
We're already here, and it's late.

608
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,330
Want to stay over?

609
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,330
My sister isn't home.

610
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,890
I have to get permission
if I sleep somewhere else.

611
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,600
We're dead if you let them know
on the day of. No one is excused.

612
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,850
Right.

613
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,320
Saving your life is more
important than a sleepover.

614
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,830
Kim Ji Eun, you're driving me crazy.

615
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:39,290
What kind of thing was she going for?

616
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,180
Oh, no.

617
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,410
You scared me. What? What's wrong?

618
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,340
Seung Hun has a girlfriend.

619
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,100
He can't go to the group date tonight.

620
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,130
He wants me to bring someone else.

621
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,090
Geez. Just bring whoever.

622
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,740
You don't know anyone?

623
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,520
Want to go? You have a cute face.

624
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,900
If I fix up your hair, it might work.

625
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,070
I am cute, but no.

626
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,330
- Plus, I said I have a girlfriend.
- Then...

627
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,360
is there someone you know?

628
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,150
Please. I don't care if it's
a perfect stranger to you.

629
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,850
I told her I was bringing someone super handsome.

630
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:22,810
Hyung! Please!

631
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,810
- What are you doing?
- Please save me...

632
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,810
Why do I need to save you?

633
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,480
Hey! Just wipe the glass so we can go home.

634
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,630
Welcome.

635
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,490
Yun Jae.

636
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,490
- What brings you here?
- Oh, um...

637
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,630
Hyung, do you know him?

638
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,620
Yeah. He's my...

639
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,000
friend.

640
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,620
- A f-friend.
- Hello.

641
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,420
I'm Yun Jae's best friend,

642
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,540
Lee Min Hyeok.

643
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,860
I told you a while ago. We work together.

644
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,360
Hello, I go to school with Yun Jae...

645
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,880
This is great.

646
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,760
Hyungnim, by any chance, do you have a girlfriend?

647
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,500
- N-No.
- Then...

648
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,120
could you help me out this one time?

649
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,520
I don't know.

650
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,370
I don't think so. Sorry.

651
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,390
Then, I have no choice.

652
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,520
Yun Jae, give me an hour of your time today.

653
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,890
Me?

654
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,390
- I said I'm not doing it.
- Hyung, your ideal type is Han Ji Min.

655
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:53,910
One of them looks exactly like Han Ji Min.

656
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,010
So, your ideal type isn't Ji Eun,

657
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,040
but Ji Min.

658
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:04,810
No... No, that's a lie.

659
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,480
He saw her drama when he was six

660
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,840
and he still remembers how pretty Han Ji Min was.

661
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,320
You knew she was pretty at age six?

662
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,040
I thought rhinoceros beetles
and stag beetles were pretty, too.

663
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,250
Giant Asian Mantis, too.

664
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,220
Even cockroaches?

665
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,740
You know...

666
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,940
I'll do it. The group date.

667
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,040
I'll go instead of Yun Jae.

668
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,750
Really?

669
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,500
Hyungnim, you will?

670
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,720
Just an hour, right?

671
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
Yes. Thank you so much.

672
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,170
Let's share numbers right now.

673
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,520
I'll let you know the location right away.

674
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,220
Cockroaches?

675
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,000
I told him I would, so I'll just go for an hour.

676
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,450
<i>You didn't have to do that.</i>

677
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,900
If I didn't go, you would have had to.

678
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,190
I don't want that.

679
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,960
You're not upset about it, right?

680
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,200
Me?

681
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,090
Not at all.

682
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:18,080
Have fun, and tell Min Hyeok
to treat you to something tasty.

683
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,860
Look at you acting chill.

684
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,470
I mean, it's a girl meeting a girl.

685
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,970
Hyungnim!

686
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,220
Yun Jae, Min Hyeok is here. I'll call you later.

687
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,670
Let's go.

688
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,580
I'll stay here only for an hour and leave.

689
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,990
Hyungnim, don't be so sure.

690
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,330
I'm telling you, they're gorgeous.

691
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,980
It's 6:10 right now, so...

692
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,550
I'll leave at 7:10.

693
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,730
Hey, Ye Sol.

694
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,960
We're here already.

695
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,440
I brought a guy who's a total 10.

696
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,900
What?

697
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,850
Our plans got canceled. Min Hyeok is really upset.

698
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:31,500
He asked me to get a drink with him.

699
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,520
That's okay, right?

700
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,300
Sure. Of course, it is!

701
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,970
Sure. Call me when you're done.

702
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,950
Or you don't have to. Or do if you want to.

703
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,470
Okay.

704
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,970
You're warm.

705
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,690
My face gets warm when I drink.

706
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,630
I get cold when I drink.

707
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,320
Come here.

708
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,170
Here's the chicken stew you ordered.

709
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,570
Wow, it looks so good.

710
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:59,610
Eat up, Hyungnim.

711
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,030
Here you go.

712
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,840
Wow. It's so good.

713
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,330
There are so many tasty main ingredients here,

714
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,950
but you like the B-list items.

715
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,470
How did you know?

716
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:26,150
I'm usually like that.

717
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,880
Even at a sashimi place,
I like the penis fish side more.

718
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,640
I prefer the fish cakes in tteokbokki.

719
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,530
I prefer the supporting character
more than the main.

720
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,340
You are so funny.

721
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,060
Should we do cheers?

722
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,550
Hyungnim...

723
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,590
this is so wrong.

724
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:05,050
How can she cancel our plans on the day of?

725
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,320
I bought this shirt.

726
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,080
I got my hair done this morning.

727
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,240
Don't waste your feelings
on someone who doesn't respect

728
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,890
their promise to you.

729
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:20,690
Especially if you don't know her that well.

730
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:27,390
You must have way more people
around you who care about you.

731
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,780
It's my first time.

732
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,730
Huh? What is?

733
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,200
Someone who genuinely comforts me like an adult.

734
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,110
Hyung, can I speak informally?

735
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,380
Yeah. Sure.

736
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,060
But Hyung, with a face like that...

737
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,590
and your body...

738
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,680
why don't you have a girlfriend?

739
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,080
I have someone I'm seeing.

740
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,160
I knew it.

741
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,690
Do you have a picture?

742
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,140
One second.

743
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,640
I guess I can't...

744
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,610
- Hey, I'm going to the restroom.
- Okay.

745
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,130
<i>This is the ladies' room!</i>

746
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,760
[Men's room on the third floor]

747
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,890
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

748
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,990
[Men's room on the third floor]

749
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,690
[Gents]

750
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,930
Hyung! What took you so long?

751
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,580
What's up with your face?

752
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,750
Did something happen?

753
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,010
What?

754
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,930
Where are you?

755
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,250
J-Just you wait.

756
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,760
Oppa, let me ask you one last thing!

757
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,390
Can you give this to Ji Hun? Please?

758
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,600
He ignored me again.

759
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,640
So annoying.

760
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,650
Darn it.

761
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,070
He did get it!

762
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,800
Yay.

763
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,340
Wait a second.

764
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,790
Hey!

765
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,320
You bastard. Hey, what are you doing?

766
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,510
Where's Ji Eun? Huh?

767
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,860
Hyung, what were you imagining?

768
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,510
I'm so hurt.

769
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,350
You shouldn't have let him drink so much.

770
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:27,390
He went to the restroom, and suddenly,

771
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,340
he kept drinking by himself and passed out.

772
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,430
Anyway, I'll take Ji Hun home,

773
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,770
so you can get some rest now.

774
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,370
Let him sleep here tonight.

775
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,410
It's just us guys here. What's the big deal?

776
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,160
Guy or girl...

777
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,380
he should sleep at home!

778
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,000
Hyung, you'll never carry him alone.

779
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,380
The taxi driver and the security
guard had to help me.

780
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,530
Hey. We are not the same.

781
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,330
Don't you know I work out these days?

782
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,660
Hyung, are you asleep?

783
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,270
Yeah, I am.

784
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,710
Ji Hun really cares about you.

785
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,260
What are you talking about?

786
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,070
Once he got drunk,

787
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,460
he called your name once a minute.

788
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:43,120
"Yun Jae..."

789
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,690
Like that.

790
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,230
He said he was sorry and then thankful...

791
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,450
and that he loves you.

792
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,020
He did?

793
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:59,850
Usually, when guys do that, it's gross.

794
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,830
But it wasn't coming from Ji Hun.

795
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,370
I just met Ji Hun today,

796
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:09,270
but he seems like such a sweet, good person.

797
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,060
Right?

798
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,840
Go to sleep. I'm going to sleep.

799
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,140
What do I do about my brother?

800
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,650
[Epilogue]

801
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,700
Do you know...

802
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,640
why I've never been dumped by a guy?

803
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,600
You know the Game of Reading the Air, right?

804
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,460
To win, you have to say it
before the other person does.

805
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,270
Since it looks like Yun Jae is going to dump me,

806
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,900
are you saying to break up with him first?

807
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,590
Can you live without Yun Jae?

808
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,530
No.

809
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:55,100
So, beat him to the punch
and say, "Let's be friends."

810
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,260
If Yun Jae wants to break up,

811
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,060
you'll be strangers forever,

812
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,640
but if you say let's be friends,

813
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,560
you can stay friends.

814
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,000
Yun Jae.

815
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,680
I gave it some thought, too.

816
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,110
Why don't we just be friends for a while?

817
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,590
Friends?

818
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:22,090
