Min Joo.

2
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,660
Dong Gi? Why are you here?

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,280
- Let's watch a movie this weekend.
- I have plans.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,150
And I don't want to, even if I didn't.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,520
- You probably know, but I like you.
- What's going on?

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,320
It was love at first sight,
and I have my eyes set on you.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,500
Must be nice to know so many oppas.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,910
That's your problem.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,220
I'll treat you well.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,480
Why am I hiding?

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,270
I'll treat you way better than
that bastard, Park Yun Jae.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,240
Why are you bringing up Yun Jae?

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,980
- Yun Jae?
- I have a better GPA and

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,200
a brighter future than he does.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,020

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,250
Oppa.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,060
Say a few more words,

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,580
and I don't think I'll ever want to see you again.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,360
Want to keep going?

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,390
If you want to maintain the
distance we're currently at,

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,130
leave.

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,820
I've never thought of you as a man,

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,120
and there's no chance I ever will.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,430
What should I do to make you see me as a man?

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,440
Be born again.

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,130
I'll think about it then.

27
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,260
Step aside.

28
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,010
Min Joo, please give me a chance.

29
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,830
I'll scream.

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,150
Help!

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,370
Help!

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
- Oppa!
- Op-

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,460
- Hey, who are you?
- Who are you?

34
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,960
- Who is he?
- Don't worry about him. Let's go.

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,010
Seriously...

36
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,910
- Let's go.
- Get your hands off Min Joo!

37
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,010
Gosh, some people just ask for it.

38
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,630
Are you okay?

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,190
Of course.

40
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,900
I might look fragile, but I'm strong.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,870
You don't look fragile.

42
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,640
Who was that?

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Min Dong Gi. He's in my major.
I guess he followed me.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,450
Min Dong Gi?

45
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,470
Crazy things happen to you.

46
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,080
Do you know martial arts?

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,970
I noticed it at the festival part-time job,

48
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,680
but your angles are sharp.

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,830
I did kendo in elementary school.

50
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,970
I thought I had forgotten it,
but I remembered once I held this.

51
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,160
Are these bubbles?

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Are they yours? Really?

53
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,150
I picked it up on the way.

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,420
I want to blow it, too!

55
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,510
Wow, daebak.

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,500
Wow, I haven't done this in so long. It's so fun.

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,780
It's so nice here. I'm so glad I moved here.

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,190
You sure? You got followed
as soon as you moved here.

59
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,560
The night air...

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,070
It's so nice.

61
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,760
You really have no idea
how to have a conversation.

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,710
I want beer.

63
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,860
Oppa, want to have beer?

64
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,570
- I'll buy the chicken.
- You go ahead.

65
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,570

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,930

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,790
I'll buy chicken.

69

You have a guest.

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,960
The vixen next door?

71
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,750
Half marinated, half fried!

72
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,590
Great!

73
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,190
Seriously?

74
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,790
So pretty!

- Huh?

Mom and Dad went to see

92
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,140
I know. I told them about it.

- Yeah.

94

Hey. Don't you have tutoring today?

95
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,440
Yes. But I'll ask him to reschedule.

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,730
- Why?
- Why tutor when Mom and Dad aren't here?

97
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,080
I'll go to the movies and karaoke with my friends.

What kind of question is that?

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,510
I don't know how you got into Yeonhee University.

101
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,600
Then, what if you don't reschedule tutoring

102

Excuse me?

119
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,690
When you say more creative...

120
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,060
A wrestler, an inspector, a charity donor.

121
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,240
They're jobs, too.

all apart from their careers.

I only have my mom.

127
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,850
I come from a single-parent family.

128
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,700
Even when my dad was alive, I've never seen them get along.

129
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,290
That probably impacted my character, I'm sure.

130
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,540
That's why I'm cynical about marriage

131
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,650

that in the matchmaking.

184
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,880
We can go there. Let's go together.

185
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,340
Hawaii, right?

186
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,810
Yeah.

187
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,120
I have to get back to being Kim Ji Eun soon.

188
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,500
So, I can get on a plane with my passport.

189
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,810
Right.

190
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,110
Should we watch the movie in the living room?

191
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,050
Sure, sounds good.

192
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,660
I need to connect this to the TV.

193
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,660
I'll never go on a trip with you again.

194
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,620
I feel the same.

195
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,500
I should've known when you
suggested fall foliage all of a sudden.

196
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,960
You were talking so much while I was driving.

197
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,390
That's why I took the wrong route.

198
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,800
So it's all my fault?

199
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,190
Darn it.

200
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,930
Oh, my gosh!

201
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,430
W-What is all this?

202
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,540
Mom, so... what happened was...

203
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,500
Oh, no!

204
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,160
This...

205
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,470
This is my favorite wine!

206
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,660
Was someone here?

207
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,150
No.

208
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,720
So, you did this by yourself?

209
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,830
Oh, the thing is... so...

210
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,370
What happened was...

211
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,180
Yun Ah. I ate with Yun Ah.

212
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,890
She's been so stressed as a 12th-grader lately.

213
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,330
As her brother, it's been bothering me.

214
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,050
Where is Yun Ah?

215
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,640
Yun Ah?

216
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,350
She stepped out to see a friend.

217
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,990
Gosh, my goodness!

218
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,930
Why is the house such a mess? Seriously.

219
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,370
I wish ghosts would take away these Parks.

220
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,560
Parks? Why bring that up now?

221
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,040
- Geez!
- Mom, Mom, Mom...

222
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,710
Go to your room and come out in 30 minutes.

223
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,140
I'll clean everything back up. You, too, Dad.

224
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,300
Hey!

225
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,740
You think I want to be around your dad right now?

226
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,410
Same here.

227
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,280
Hey, your mom has a personality issue.

228
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,340
- So why did you go on a trip and fight?
- Hey.

229
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,160
From the moment we left, she
complained that the car was dirty,

230
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,170
that the rest stop food was bad,

231
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,750
asking why we were paying money to sleep outside,

232
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,160
fussing and nagging.

233
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,510
How do you think I felt?

234
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,400
You think I was in my right mind?

235
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,760
- Geez.
- Dad!

236
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,970
Gosh, you look exhausted.

237
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,770
Go to my room and get some rest.

238
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,980
Get some sleep.

239
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,990
Get some rest.

240
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,150
Ji Hun...

241
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,010
T-Teacher?

242
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,030
Ma'am, hello.

243
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,160
Hi...

244
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,890
Right, it's tutoring day today.

245
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,660
I'm a little frazzled.

246
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,720
But did you come in that way?

247
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,210
Pardon?

248
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,590
Oh, that...

249
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,740
It was open, so...

250
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,150
Mom, do you know what floor we're on?

251
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,000
How could he get in through the window?

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,120
He just got here.

253
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,750
I'm so frazzled right now.

254
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,190
But this brat.

255
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,670
Where did she go after making such a mess?

256
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,990
Wait until this brat gets home...

257
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,750
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,070
Ma'am, it's okay.

259
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,650
I'll see you next week.

260
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,390
Sure, sure.

261
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,290
Teacher, hi.

262
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,850
Hey, Yun Ah.

263
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,180
Did you have fun with my brother?

264
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,360
Mom, when did you get home?

265
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,560
- You brat. Stay right there.
- Why?

266
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,930
- Hey! Can't you see?
- What's wrong?

267
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,280
- Ma'am.
- You!

268
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,760
You skip tutoring just because I'm not here?

269
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,960
What? Park Yun Jae told me to leave.

270
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,420
What? You're blaming your brother again?

271
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,220
Hey! And!

272
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,940
If you cooked...

273
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,890
you should clean up after yourself!

274
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,290
No, no, no!

275
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,350
- Honey!
- Mom!

276
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,220
Use your words!

277
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,960
You're a Christian. Why are you so violent?

278
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,350
That's right! You're an elder!

279
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,350
Are you for real?

280
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,360
Honey...

281
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,110
I'm okay.

282
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,150
You should've moved.

283
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,600
Geez!

284
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,130
Noona.

285
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,980
Hi.

286
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,430
Hi.

287
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,680
It's good.

288
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,800
It's warm.

289
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,170
It's getting chilly outside.

290
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,740
What are you doing after?

291
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,030
I should rush home.

292
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,700
It's my favorite time of the day.

293
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,590
Really?

294
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,810
You look forward to the end of the day...

295
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,160
I'm jealous.

296
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,410
If I had to choose between the
deadline or the world ending,

297
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,270
I'd choose the world ending.

298
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,420
I see how that might be for you.

299
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,490
But don't be too stressed.

300
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,490
You have one life. Have fun and enjoy.

301
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,720
I know, but... I don't go to school.

302
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,440
I only have one friend.

303
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,420
My parents live far away.

304
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't really know what fun is.

305
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,440
There are so many fun things in this world.

306
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,560
Club. Karaoke. Escape room. Bowling.

307
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,020
I've tried them all. But they
don't really work for me.

308
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,890
Good.

309
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,750
You're wearing sneakers.

310
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,860
I'm almost done. Just wait 10 minutes.

311
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,400
Is there something fun here?

312
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,560
Doesn't look like it.

313
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,060
Just trust me. Your boredom will go away.

314
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,840
All right.

315
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,860
We're going to run.

316
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,330
No need to run fast.

317
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,940
Slowly, keeping the pace for 30 minutes.

318
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,150
Run for 30 minutes?

319
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,450
I'm too lazy to go to the convenience
store near my house.

320
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,160
I get it delivered.

321
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,600
That's why your life is boring.

322
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,730
I can't do this.

323
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Trust me. You can do it.

324
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,370
Come.

325
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,590
I'm going to die!

326
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,060
We're headed in the right direction.

327
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,160
Hey. You go ahead. I really can't do this.

328
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,690
You feel like you can't, but you will.

329
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,990
Okay. Come on!

330
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,270
Hey, run by yourself.

331
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,920
Come on! Run!

332
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,970
What, what, what? Come on, Yu Ri. Come on.

333
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,940
Come on! Let's run!

Let's go! Run, I said!

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,190

You did it in the end.

you didn't feel bored, right?

but that didn't cross my mind.

See?

359
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,410
But if you tell me to do it again,

360
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,160
I don't think I can.

361
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,480
I'll do it with you. Like today.

she said she liked my blush.

One of the reasons I don't want to be hospitalized

422
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,050
is that I can't take this guy.

Yes.

That exam is making you do all kinds of things.

442
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,490
I'll pass this year.

443
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,500
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

444
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,840
I have no desire for that.

445
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,080
Thank you...

446
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,550
for letting me see

She's not...

It's not like that yet.

450
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,170
And why would you die?

451
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,500
You're going to the hospital to live.

452
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,980
I mean, I can die happy now.

453
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,090
My life's wish

454
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,240
was for you to have someone

455
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,520
who could eat with you face to face.

456
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,210
Do you get married to eat together?

457
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,250
You have no idea how important that is.

458
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,400
Being a fool,

459
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,390
I realized that way too late.

460
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,630
It's fine.

461
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,200
I made enough money for you to spend,

462
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,990
so you make memories instead.

463
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,210
Make your family happy.

464
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,820
Your money isn't my money, Father.

465
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,320
Stop talking nonsense and go rest.

466
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,520
We need to leave early tomorrow
to get to the hospital.

467

473
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,410
Eliminated, I said!

474

Eliminated! Eliminated!

475
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,210
Ms. Go Yeong Mi?

476

Yes? It's me, and?

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,570
Yes, I'm Wang Chun Bae.

<i>Get me a stepdad.</i>

482
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,740
Could I sit?

483
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,750
Aigoo, it just happens that I got
fluid drained from my knees today.

484
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,140
That brat!

485
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,830
She must be out of her mind.

486
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,410
That little...

487
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,370
Damn it!

488
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,020
Thank you so much.

489
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,620
You should've seen my mom's face.

490
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,760
Must be crazy at the office, right?

491
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,990
Yes.

492
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,210
She says she'll sue us.

493
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,990
That old lady. Don't worry.

494
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,020
My friend will take care of it.

495
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,310
But...

496
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,750
why did your relationship with
your mother get so bad?

497
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,120
I don't know.

498
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,440
I hated my mom ever since I was born.

499
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,360
I think my mom felt the same.

500
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,770
No. Your mother really cares for you, Jeong Ja.

501
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,380
You know what my mom hates the most?

502
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,450
My dad. But I'm exactly like him.

503
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,020
My looks, my personality.

504
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,170
But what I'm really upset about is,

505
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,580
my dad loved my mom until
the very end before he passed.

506
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,110
That makes me so mad.

507
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,600
Well.. what's your type?

508
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,670
If you tell me in detail, I'll really look.

509
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,350
I just told you my sad family story.

510
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,410
But you're still doing business?

511
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:12,310
- I'm really not into this.
- W-W-Wait!

512
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,140
There's one thing I told myself when
I joined this matchmaking company.

513
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,990
Regarding a client's complaints,

514
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,490
if the reason is love, not qualifications,

515
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,440
I will take on that responsibility in any case.

516
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,600
I will do my best to take care of you.

517
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,300
I like you.

518
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,270
It must be time for you to get off work soon.

519
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,590
Do you have plans?

520
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,910
Sir, do you have someone with you?

521
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,180
Oh, it's just me.

522
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,890
Let me explain how you're shooting.

Come over here.

525

Have a seat.

526
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,050
The camera is over there.

527

528
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,580
Oh, yes.

529
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,900
Bye now.

530
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,860
- Father!
- Son-in-law! Have you been well?

531
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,160
You didn't tell us you were coming.

532
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,000
- Come on in.
- Okay.

533
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,260
Honey!

534
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,910

- Aigoo, my daughter!

536
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
But what is this?

537
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,210
I got my funeral portrait taken.

538
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,110
- Dad!
- Father.

539
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,990
It's trendy to get it taken when
you're healthy these days.

540
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,560
Come over here.

541
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,240
Look.

542
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,190
This outfit fits me.

543
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,810
I tried it on, just in case.

544
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,370
Look.

545
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,400
Didn't the photographer say something?

546
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,980
I went to a self-portrait place just in case.

547
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,150
Say cheese.

548
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,530
You should have told us. We would have taken you.

549
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,520
There you go again. Treating me like an old man.

550
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,610
You don't need to take me.

551
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,500
- Get me something to drink.
- Okay.

552
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,810
Father, you're staying over, right?

553
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:42,070
- I'll see.
- Come on. It's been a while. We should...

554
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,480
play a round. You're staying over!

555
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,860
Listen to him.

556
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,320
Mom.

557
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,820
What, my daughter?

558
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,150
Why would you take a photo like this?

559
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,680
You can be so melodramatic, Mom.

560
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,140
It's not melodramatic, it's romantic.

561
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,230
How's Ji Eun?

562
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,140
I don't know.

563
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,060
She's pretending to be well.

564
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,990
Let me meet with her.

565
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,880
Unlike you, I tend to be cool-headed
in dealing with problems.

566
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,890
Why? You're going to meet her and say,

567
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,980
"Actually, I'm not your grandpa.
I'm your grandma"?

568
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,260
Come on.

569
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,900
You think I'm an idiot?

570
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,590
You know Ji Hye is exactly like you, Mom.

571
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,750
Her lifelong nickname is "idiot."

572
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,510
She can be like that.

573
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,380
Being in your position,

574
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,300
I get how hard it must have been for you.

575
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,140
It's hard enough just being a mom.

576
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,340
Our Ji Eun is so sweet.

577
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,930
And so is her dad.

578
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,440
Your husband ran off, your daughter resented you.

579
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,530
How did you survive, Mom?

580
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,220
I'm too old to remember.

581
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,370
Gosh, hey, hey.

582
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,200
Wow. This is a great color.

583
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,110
Mom.

584
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,780
Have you ever thought...

585
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:17,870
that you want to be a woman again before you die?

586
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,040
If not for Ji Eun, I would have lied until I died.

587
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,120
Of course, I want that every day.

588
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,090
Ji Eun must be lying, too.

589
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,700
Ji Eun!

590
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,340
Ji Eun!

591
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,600
J-Ji Eun!

592
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:44,570
I'm sorry.

593
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,030
Let's talk later.

594
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,610
Ji Eun, let's talk.

595
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:02,160
You knew, too, Dad?

596
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,630
That Grandpa was a woman, not a man?

597
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:17,010
Ji Eun, your parents did nothing wrong.

598
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,220
Unni and I both...

599
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,840
called you grandpa our whole lives,
but you're our grandma.

600
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,550
But our parents did nothing wrong?

601
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,880
I'm sorry.

602
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,090
It's all because this grandpa wanted them to-

603
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,830
You're not Grandpa!

604
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,810
I'm sorry.

605
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,780
How long were you going to lie to me?

606
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,840
You should have at least told me
when I became a guy.

607
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,300
That I might have to...

608
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,820
live as a man for the rest of my life.

609
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,410
Maybe my parents couldn't tell me,

610
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,320
but Grandpa...

611
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,930
No. Grandma, you should have told me.

612
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,630
It's all my fault.

613
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,010
I'm sorry, my daughter.

614
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,410
No. I'm sorry.

615
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:32,610
- Ji Eun.
- I'm going to go home alone today.

616
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,360
Give me some time.

617
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:40,460
[Yun Jae is mine]

618
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,120
This is a special alcohol that was gifted to me.

619
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,760
But I didn't have the right glasses.

620
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,260
It's what's inside that matters, not outside.

621
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,410
Oh, my. My little sister and I will get along.

622
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,060
Cheers!

623
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,560
This is so delicious.

624
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,730
Really?

625
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:47,820
Maybe I'm not used to it. It's bitter.

626
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:52,490
But alcohol tastes the same after a while.

627
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,570
So, what's your type, Unni?

628
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,860
I'll do the follow-up properly.

629
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,120
Tell me everything.

630
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,660
I might...

631
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,870
come across as someone shallow,
who only cares about qualifications,

632
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,640
but when it comes to love,

633
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,430
I become endlessly hopeless.

634
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,920
You become hopeless when it comes to love?

635
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,760
I like that wording.

636
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,350
But I already like someone.

637
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,490
I met his parents, too.

638
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,380
My gosh! That's great!

639
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,710
How about you? Single?

640
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,410
Well, right now, yes.

641
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,410
But I also like someone.

642
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,720
Actually, I finally found him.

643
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,810
What do you mean you found him?

644
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:46,080
He was my first love.

645
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,070
I missed him for 10 years,
and we finally met again.

646
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,240
How cute.

647
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,350
Then, if that love comes true,

648
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,170
I will throw you a wedding.

649
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,480
What? Unni, I'm recording this.

650
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,600
Go ahead. I'll pay for the honeymoon, too.

651
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,730
What? Listen to this Unni!

652
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,860
You're a rich unni, aren't you?

653
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,490
If things go well for you,
I will sing at your wedding.

654
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,560
I was going to hire an orchestra.

655
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,450
I'll save money and make a friend.

656
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:24,810
One second. It might be work.

657
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,420
Go ahead.

659
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,350
Oh, no, Unni...

660
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,870
Something urgent just came up.

661
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,960
I have to go...

662
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,900
Is it work?

663
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,240
- Is it because of my mom?
- No.

664
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,740
Father passed away.

665
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,180
Really?

666
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,220
Then, I'll go with you. Give me a moment.

667
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,170
Not my father. My friend's father.

668
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:01,170
My first love.

669
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,740
My goodness.

670
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,650
Go, go. Hurry.

671
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,460
I'll call you, Unni.

672
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,220
I'm sorry.

673
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,210
You scared me!

674
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,290
What are you doing here?

675
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,420
Oppa, what's wrong?

676
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,560
My goodness! Are you okay?

677
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,930
I'm fine.

678
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,830
You don't look fine.

679
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,720
What are you doing? Get up! Can you get up?

680
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,050
Huh? One, two, three!

681
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,590
Careful.

682
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,800
What is going on?

683
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,200
This won't do.

684
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,750
I'm calling 911.

685
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,410
No.

686
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,010
I'm fine.

687
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,590
What do you mean? You need to get to the ER.

688
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,560
Not the hospital.

689
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,510
- I'm fine.
- Why not? This is so frustrating.

690
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,960
Here?

691
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,660
Aigoo! Oppa!

Oppa!

693
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,810
Oppa, wake up!

694
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,040
What do I do?

695
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,760
Getting surgery was out the window, to begin with.

696
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,960
It was a miracle that he was even alive.

697
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,680
But how could he overnight...

698
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,560
In life,

699
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:01,910
there are many more unexpected
deaths than natural deaths.

700
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:08,360
Despite that, your father gave us a lot of time.

- Aigoo...
- How could this be...

- Aigoo...
- I'm sorry...

706
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,260
How could this happen...

707
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,800
He was sick.

708
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,710
I didn't know he'd pass away so quickly.

709
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,530
Thank you for coming, Ji Hye.

- Thank you for coming all this way.
- No, no.

00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,870
It's all thanks to you, Jeong Ja.

00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,310
<i>My first love.</i>

727
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,540
Thank goodness.

728
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,640
His fever went down a bit.

729
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,090
I don't think he's a criminal or anything.

730
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:52,710
Why can't he go to the hospital?

731
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,840
No...

732
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,810
I don't want to live like this.

733
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,640
Mom...

734
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,110
Mom...

735
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,020
Cold...

736
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,580
So, to summarize,

737
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:53,270
we like the same person. Is that it?

738
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:58,800
Yeong Seok doesn't know that I like him.

739
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,250
I hope you don't take it the wrong way.

740
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,740
- How so?
- I know you already met his parents.

741
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,580
I don't want things to sour

742
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,940
between you two because of what I said.

743
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,830
It was a total coincidence.

744
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,420
There's nothing between us.

745
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,490
We were also getting to know each other

746
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,890
through a blind date that my employee set up.

747
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:25,560
I met his parents, but there was a reason.

748
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,770
I don't want to get between you two at all.

749
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,670
You said you become hopeless
when it comes to love.

750
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,240
So, it's true.

751
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,580
Are you a criminal or something?

752
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,310
Yeong Seok is a really good person.

753
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:45,770
Innocent, honest...

754
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,760
and handsome.

755
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,160
I know.

756
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,920
But the person who holds the key

757
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,840
is not us, but Yeong Seok.

758
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,140
Let's not decide this by ourselves.

759
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,900
Let us both love him.

760
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,370
It could be one of us or neither.

761
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,570
Yeong Seok will figure it out.

762
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:12,650
I never played sports or studied
because I don't like competition.

763
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,380
But this time, I'll willingly participate.

764
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,670
Seems like it'd be worth it.

765
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:23,910
My main weapon is money.

766
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,050
What is yours, Ji Hye?

767
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:33,940
Nostalgia?

768
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,820
Money versus time, huh?

769
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,460
I'm at a disadvantage.

770
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:45,260
- But you're pretty, Unni.
- You're young.

771
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,100
Noonim, the door is open.

772
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,840
I'll check and let you know.

773
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,420
Okay.

774
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,690
Yun Jae.

775
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,890
What are you guys doing?

776
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,450
What?

777
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,690
S-So...

778
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,440
Yun Jae?

779
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,700
Why are you he-

780
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,960
So, why are you asleep next to me, Oppa?

781
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,800
Why are you asking me?

782
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,030
Are you pulling my hair right now?

783
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,060
Hey!

784
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,060
- Let go!
- Let go!

785
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,200
- You let go!
- You first!

786
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,760
Hey, hey, hey! Guys! Wait!

787
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,280
- Let go!
- Wait, guys!

788
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,460
You little skank!

789
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,470
Watch this skank kill you!

790
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:10,960
- Let go!
- Use your words.

791
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,160
- This is our house.
- So why am I asleep here?

792
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
- What would I do to you?
- Stop it!

793
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,850
- Why would I make a move on you? Come here!
- What the heck!

794
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:19,900
You guys! You guys!

795
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,230
- Wait, wait.
- Get over here.

796
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,820
- Are you crazy?
- Get over here.

797
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,980
Are you crazy?

798
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,420
Guys! You guys!

799
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,800
<i>Let go! The hair, hair!</i>

800
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,710
<i>Wait! Let go!</i>

801
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,420
<i>♫ 'Cause I love you, I want to tell you ♫</i>

802
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:55,760
<i>♫ I want to tell you about my excited heart ♫</i>

803
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:01,020
<i>♫ I keep smiling for no reason ♫</i>

804
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,260
<i>♫ It's all because of you ♫</i>

805
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,060
<i>♫ Can you hear my heart? ♫</i>

806
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,460
<i>♫ It's beating for you ♫</i>

807
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,080
<i>♫ Love is you, my heart is beating ♫</i>

808
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,430
<i>Come and help out this weekend.</i>

809
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:19,560
<i>I told Grandpa I'll work hard.</i>

810
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,760
<i>- Are you okay?
- Oppa, come with me.</i>

811
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,330
<i>So, you've never seen me as a woman?</i>

812
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:27,060
<i>Did you two kiss?</i>

813
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,190
<i>Just get mad. Like Kim Ji Eun would do.</i>

814
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,250
<i>I don't look like Kim Ji Eun to anyone.</i>

815
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,320
<i>How can I be like Kim Ji Eun like this?</i>

816
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,640
<i>I should tell Yun Jae we need to break up.</i>

817
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,780
<i>At least in this moment,</i>

818
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,640
<i>no one cares about you more than I do.</i>

819
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:47,760
<i>♫ Sometimes I worry I'm too
much pressure for you ♫</i>
