I'd like to have that meal,

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,380
Sure.

By the way,

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,319
Yoon Jae is dating someone else?

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,159
Seeing how you didn't know about her,

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,790
their relationship can't be that serious.

14
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,389
Don't worry about him. I'll take good care of him.

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,630
No, it is serious.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
They can't live without each other.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,039
How can I believe what you say?

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,070
You should...

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,610
because I'm Yoon Jae's girlfriend.

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,390
Are you serious?

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,060
Don't you understand the gravity of the situation?

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,740
Of course, I do.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,970
Yoon Jae's collapse must've given his parents quite the scare.

24
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,840

Don't you remember, Yoon Jae?

32
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,100
You fainted at the bar. You had acute indigestion.

- This is a big relief. - I'm sorry.

38
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,550
You should be careful with what you eat.

39
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,820
Thank you for your help.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,220

What are you doing out here?

47
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,409
I should be asking you that.

You're a patient. You can't be out here.

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,279
It was only acute indigestion.

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,450
Exactly. You shouldn't be outside.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,350
- I'm fine. - No, you're not.

52
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,180

53
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,190
Come with me.

54
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,060

Of course. He's still a patient.

61

If you saw him outside, you should've brought him inside.

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
What were you thinking?

63
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,450

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,970

I get that he's kind. But he came to the ER for you.

That's a cool friendship you guys have.

111
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,549
Hey, you also brought me to the ER.

112
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,980
So it's similar to what you did.

113
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,790

By the way, that guy, Ji Hoon,

116
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,660
said something odd at the ER.

117
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,100
He said he was your girlfriend.

118
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,200

Okay.

123
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,120
Here too.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,900
Oh, there. I can see that.

129
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,900
But you should wipe that part yourself.

130
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,970
Come on. This is my favourite shirt.

131
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,940
I'm sorry. I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

132
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,580
It's fine. I was just teasing you.

You did?

140
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,940
Your message...

141
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,840
Wait.

142
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,270
How come I missed that?

143
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,470
Because I didn't text you.

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,340
Even if I did, you probably would have missed it anyway.

145
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,880
What?

146
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,920
I see. You came here to collect your things.

147
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,220
Well, you should have told me you were coming.

148
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,390
Hello again.

149
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,590

No comment.

151
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,900
So you're not going to answer uncomfortable questions?

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
I've been wondering since I met you.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Is trying to pull the mysterious guy vibe your thing?

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
What?

155
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,009
I'm only saying that because...

156
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,210
every time I see you, you seem to have something to hide.

157
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,880
Did you hear that? She thinks I'm always hiding something.

158
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,280
I can't believe I'm being accused of being fake.

159
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,950
You didn't eat, right?

160
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,989

163
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
What?

164
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,859
Are you trying to take me to the place...

165
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,890
that girl told you about?

166
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,899
"That girl?" Did you seriously just call me that?

167
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,130
Yes. What?

168
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,700
"That girl."

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
"That guy." That's how I address everyone.

170
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,970
You're the perfect example...

171
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,840
why one shouldn't judge someone by their looks.

172
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,640
Are you talking about yourself?

173
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,110
I guess you also think I'm pretty.

174
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,210
I'm prettier.

175
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,710
Cut it out, you two.

176
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,980
- You're both pretty. So... - What?

177
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,020
We're both pretty?

178
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,490
I mean...

179
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,190
The pretty ones are talking right now. You stay out of this.

180
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,330
You're ridiculous.

181
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,500
I should be saying that to you.

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
Stop it. Let's just go and have some malatang. Please?

183
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,400

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,240
You're not done with your experiment.

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,410
I'll stay up all night after having malatang.

188
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,549
Hey, could you let go of my arm?

189
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,180
- Let's go. - Hey. You're coming too?

190
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,920
Let go of me.

191
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,090
Hey.

192
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,999
We have to go in now. Let go of his arm.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,330
You let go of him first.

194
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,739
Both of you, let go of my arms.

195
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,900
What's wrong with him?

196
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,540
- You little... - Hey.

197
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,340
Hey, wait!

198
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,390
Let's go inside.

199
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,090
What is this? Come on.

200
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,930
(What is malatang?)

201
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,459
What's wrong with you?

202
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,700
Let it go.

203
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,230
What are you doing?

204
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,230
- Let it go. - This is my seat.

205
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,899
I don't like to sit by the window.

206
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,840
Same here. I'd get tanned by the sun.

207
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,739
You won't, given how thick your makeup is.

208
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,579
What are you talking about? I'm barely wearing any makeup.

209
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Coming.

210
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,110
Hurry up and sit over there. People are watching us.

211
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,150
- What? - What?

212
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Sit down.

213
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,179
You're overdoing yourself.

214
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,710
Me? No, I'm not.

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The mala flavour is just starting to hit me now.

216
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,140
You know what? I'm still not tasting it.

217
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,540
Yoon Jae. Could you go and get more fish balls?

218
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,580
Fish balls here are tasty.

219
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,279
If you want fish balls, you go and get them yourself.

220
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,580
Why are you making him go and get them?

221
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,620
Should I go and get the fish balls?

222
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,640
I'll go and get them.

223
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,840
Gosh, that's spicy.

224
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,520
It did seem like you were pushing it.

225
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,790
Don't hang out with her. I really don't like her.

226
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,460
Who hung out with whom?

227
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,330
It seemed you two were spending more time together.

228
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,400
Why did you suggest going to the malatang restaurant?

229
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,630
Besides, how could you let her come just because she invited herself?

230
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,900
Seriously, Yoon Jae.

231
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,400
- Gosh, that's spicy. - Here.

232
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,920
It's so spicy.

233
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,760
But you saw that I won, right?

234
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,530
It was me who finished the soup.

235
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,199
But that was way too spicy, Yoon Jae.

236
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,740
I think my lips are swollen from the spicy soup.

237
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,310
It had been a while...

238
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,410
since we felt like ourselves...

239
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,080
around each other.

240
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,210
You and I were whining about silly things,

241
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,150
just like any other ordinary couple.

242
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,590
I want to kiss you.

243
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,930
What?

244
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,460
What?

245
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,530
What?

246
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,230
What did you just say?

247
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,870
Me?

248
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,970
I don't know. Did I say something?

249
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Hey.

250
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,230
What are you doing right now?

251
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,470
It's no big deal. There aren't a lot of people here.

252
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,170
You should have just told me.

253
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,910
(What is malatang?)

254
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,520
(Open)

255
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,050
Thank you.

256
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,589
But I didn't leave behind this book.

257
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,960
Really? It was on the floor by your table.

258
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,939
If your father keeps refusing to go to the hospital for treatment,

259
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,969
he could die any day,

260
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,610
and it wouldn't come as a surprise.

261
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,910
What do we do, Young Seok?

262
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,579
I'll take him to the hospital.

263
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,279
Don't bother coming home unless you're bringing a fiancee.

264
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,079
It's one thing that your father is sick.

265
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,150
But I can't watch him beat my son to death.

266
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Bye.

267
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,190
Mom...

268
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,230
(Good luck with the exam, I can do this!)

269
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,970
Yes, Jeong Ja.

270
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,220
I'm sorry. Did you have to wait long?

271
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,420
But why did you want to see me at this hour?

272
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,360
What do you think I'm doing here at this hour?

273
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,260
I'm here to see you, of course.

274
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
Get in.

275
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,870
Take it.

276
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
What's this?

277
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,380
If you're curious, you can open it.

278
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,189
You're giving this to me? Why?

279
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,090
My gosh, hearing that is worse than a guy asking me to buy him a watch.

280
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,730
- Did you really ask me why? - I'm sorry.

281
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,829
I mean, I'm not sure if I deserve a watch like...

282
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,900
You totally deserve it.

283
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,140
Don't you remember?

284
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,639
You kept me waiting for 13 minutes on our 1st date...

285
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,340
and 45 minutes at the braised monkfish restaurant.

286
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,380
That's a total of 58 minutes.

287
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,610
I'm sorry about that.

288
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:59,350
I've been late to my meetings.

289
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,480
It had been a while since I had to wait that long for anyone.

290
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,489
The watch is your punishment for making me wait.

291
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,620
So you'd better take it.

292
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,690
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,490
I'm usually punctual and don't make people wait.

294
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,500
No. It's all an excuse.

295
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,860
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,270
Could you stop saying you're sorry?

297
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,540
It's a habit of mine.

298
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,370
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,340
I mean, I'm not sorry.

300
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,439
Gosh, that's not what I meant.

301
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,540
I've had enough.

302
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,780
Hey, is that the only thing you want to say to me?

303
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,320
You're acting more like my dad today than ever.

304
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,090
If you apologise to me again,

305
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,559
I'm going to scold you.

306
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,720
I'm warning you.

307
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,130
I easily get startled when people raise their voices.

308
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,170
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,540
My gosh.

310
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,110
I told you I would scold you if you said you were sorry again.

311
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,880
It won't end with a kiss next time.

312
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,530
(Noblesse Lovlige)

313
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,270
Hello.

314
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,879
I'm the team leader at Noblesse Lovlige,

315
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,779
the number one company in the matchmaking industry...

316
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,580
with 700,000 successful matches. My name is Kim Ji Hye.

317
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,419
(Noblesse Lovlige)

318
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,550
Shin Dong Hoon.

319
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,690
His ideal type is...

320
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:51,019
someone who graduated from a prestigious school,

321
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,130
has a professional career, and takes good care of herself.

322
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,000
He wants her to be over 170cm tall for the sake of his future babies?

323
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,329
He doesn't want anyone with blood type B...

324
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,439
because his mother was blood type B, and people with blood type B...

325
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,840
fight often. He doesn't want there to be conflicts between them.

326
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,970
Do you have a cigarette?

327
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,470
Let's go.

328
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,950
My gosh. Thank you.

329
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,790
(Smoking isn't good for your health. You should quit smoking!)

330
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,970
Seriously. Work is fun for you, isn't it?

331
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,200
You should either drink or smoke. Just pick one.

332
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,240
Your health shouldn't have to suffer because of work.

333
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,010
Thanks.

334
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,180
You're the only one who looks out for me...

335
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,580
at this company.

336
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,390
Ms. Kim.

337
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,390
I'm going to quit.

338
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,360
Have you made up your mind for good this time?

339
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,230
I'm going to look for...

340
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,000
my true dream and love before it's too late.

341
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,240
Your dream and love.

342
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,040
That's so cool.

343
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,180
Wish me luck.

344
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,650
Hello.

345
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,460
Hello, Yoon Jae.

346
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,190
Hello, Ji Hye.

347
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,530
You must be surprised that I came to see you at work.

348
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,070
Well, a bit.

349
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,470
But what brings you here all of a sudden? Is it about Ji Eun?

350
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,670
Of course, it must be about Ji Eun.

351
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,009
If you want to break up with Ji Eun...

352
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,450
and can't find the courage to do it yourself...

353
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,850
It's nothing like that.

354
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,190
Even if I wanted to,

355
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,220
I'm not a coward to ask you to do it for me.

356
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,560
- Right? - Yes.

357
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,029
Then why did you want to see me while keeping it...

358
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,630
a secret from her?

359
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,910
(Public Restroom)

360
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,050
- This is the women's restroom! - My gosh.

361
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,149
- I'm sorry. - Unbelievable.

362
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,249
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,550
The hardest part?

364
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,420
She turned into a man.

365
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,260
So everything probably feels awkward,

366
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,160
and she must often feel flustered.

367
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,460
See? Your bras and panties don't match again.

368
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,770
Give them to me. Besides, how can you say stuff like that...

369
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,569
with that face of yours?

370
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,399
Then what am I supposed to call them? They're bras.

371
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,500
Okay. Shut it.

372
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,610
What's gotten into her?

373
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,379
Well, things can't be the same around her family...

374
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,920
and friends.

375
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,929
(Everything About Part-time Jobs)

376
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,160
And she must be worried about her future too.

377
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,199
Forget about getting a proper job.

378
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,230
Getting a part-time job isn't easy.

379
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,469
Her situation makes it impossible for her to build any kind of credit.

380
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,100
(Looking for part-timers to distribute flyers)

381
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,329
- Should we get that? - Yes, it was good.

382
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,869
It's been so long since I had it.

383
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,000
- Where should we go? - Wait.

384
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,300
- Yoon Ah. - Let's go.

385
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,370
- Where should we go? - Who was that?

386
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,810
- Where... - I don't know. Let's hurry.

387
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,210
Yoon Ah.

388
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,810
Yoon Ah.

389
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,379
Yoon Ah, I need to talk to you.

390
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,520
What do you want?

391
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,820
It's the cosmetic product you wanted a while ago.

392
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,030
You know what? You're scaring me.

393
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,660
I'm scaring you?

394
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,630
I'm being super sweet to you now.

395
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,899
What do you think about my kind smile?

396
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,600
You look like a child monk, possessed by an evil spirit.

397
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,540
Why are you suddenly being nice to me?

398
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,310
The thing is,

399
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,610
I'd like to help remind you that you're a high school senior.

400
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,849
People say it's hard to spit on someone who's smiling at you.

401
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,780
But here I am with a mouth full of spit.

402
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,660
It's not easy.

403
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,730
Who taught her to be like that?

404
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,209
Kim Ji Hoon, Yeonhee University

405
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,369
Currently taking time off

406
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,469
Reasons are personal

407
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,639
Likes to read books

408
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,839
Was discharged from the army after serving full-time

409
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,880
I was based at

410
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,880
I was based at

411
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,720
Yangpyeong. That's where I served.

412
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,090
You were assigned...

413
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,390
- as a tank operator. - What's that?

414
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,660
A tank driver.

415
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,769
No. You memorize up to Yangpyeong.

416
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,430
I'll cut the conversation short.

417
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,339
Yoon Jae. I'm interviewing to be a tutor.

418
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,040
Will he ask about the military?

419
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,010
My dad cares more that you served our country...

420
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,450
than the fact that you attend Yeonhee University.

421
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,680
He was a non-commissioned officer for 30 years.

422
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,750
I hope you understand.

423
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,790
Remember. It's Yangpyeong.

424
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,690
- Yangpyeong. - Okay.

425
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,460
Yangpyeong.

426
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,740
Say hello.

427
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,309
I'm Kim Ji Hoon, and I go to Yeonhee University.

428
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,609
I'm currently taking time off for personal reasons,

429
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,880
and I like to read books.

430
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,179
Goodness.

431
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,319
You tutor so many kids that your greeting...

432
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,820
is almost robotic.

433
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,619
There's no need to be nervous.

434
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,450
We met once before.

435
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,460
He'd have to be nervous.

436
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,260
They're accomplices of sorts.

437
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,770
Shall we have some fruit?

438
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,540
Take a seat.

439
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,910
We don't want or expect much.

440
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,819
Her grades might go from C to C plus,

441
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,120
but that wouldn't mean anything.

442
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,519
You're hiring a tutor,

443
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,060
and that's all you expect?

444
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,290
She's never studied in her life,

445
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,260
but for some reason...

446
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,200
she suddenly said she wanted a tutor.

447
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,470
When I heard...

448
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,970
that pretty-faced Ji Hoon was a known tutor,

449
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,310
I caught on right away.

450
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,980
My daughter is like me.

451
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,210
She likes handsome men.

452
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,080
What? Mom.

453
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,090
That lie is reserved for people who have never met Dad.

454
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,760
She's funny. She has a weird sense of humour.

455
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,059
Honey.

456
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,999
When was the last time...

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,500
our son brought one of his friends home?

458
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,440
Let's see. The last time was when he was in middle school.

459
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,839
It has been a long time.

460
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,810
That's what guys are like.

461
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,779
You're the one with zero friends,

462
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,980
and you're framing all Korean men.

463
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Mr. Kim.

464
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,150
That's hasty generalization, right?

465
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,820
Yoon Ah, you're smart.

466
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,660
Have another piece of fruit.

467
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,790
Thanks.

468
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,430
So, Ji Hoon. Did you serve in the army?

469
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,700
Yes. I was discharged after serving full-time.

470
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,340
Were you?

471
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,070
Well,

472
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,039
I'm not sure if you heard,

473
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,280
- but I... - Father.

474
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,080
I told him already.

475
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,450
You served our country for over 30 years.

476
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,650
You told him.

477
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,680
Where were you stationed?

478
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,090
What was your position?

479
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,960
Yes, sir. I was stationed in Pyeongyang.

480
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,589
- Up in... - I drove a tank...

481
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,860
and trained hard!

482
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,310
He's funny.

483
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,280
I can't believe you said Pyeongyang.

484
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,550
Stop laughing.

485
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
I didn't laugh.

486
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,190
Wait and see.

487
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:19,389
I'll make fun of every single mistake you make,

488
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,630
however small.

489
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,829
Wasn't that...

490
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,760
an issue of national security that wasn't small at all?

491
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,470
- Stop it. - Okay.

492
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,170
I'll stop.

493
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,070
Pyeongyang...

494
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,910
Hi.

495
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,640
Choi Yu Ri. What's wrong?

496
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,850
Stop crying and talk.

497
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,520
Are you drinking? Where are you?

498
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,690
Hey, Choi Yu Ri.

499
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,760
What? It's my best friend.

500
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,230
Hey, the puppy dog's here too.

501
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,659
- I'm a puppy dog? - Wherever Kim Ji Eun goes,

502
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
I go too.

503
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,299
Ring, ring, ring

504
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,940
The bell on the dog's collar rings

505
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,010
Have you lost your mind?

506
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,180
You can't finish even one shot.

507
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,179
How much did she drink?

508
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,580
She can't handle a shot of soju.

509
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,490
We don't refund opened bottles.

510
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,290
- What was that about? - This looks good.

511
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,330
It's good.

512
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,370
Puppy Dog, have a drink.

513
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,770
Leave it.

514
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,700
What's going on?

515
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,639
I write romantic web novels,

516
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,010
and I've never dated.

517
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,680
It's sad and miserable.

518
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,380
That's your identity.

519
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,379
You're drinking over that?

520
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,020
How dare you talk like that?

521
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,950
Puppy Dog, why are you together?

522
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,559
Why won't you break up?

523
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,989
She's a man now.

524
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,790
Hey. Keep quiet.

525
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,660
Someone stays together when his girlfriend becomes a boy.

526
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,600
Compared to that, my life's pretty pathetic.

527
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,340
Did someone make fun of you?

528
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,940
Never dating is another trend of our era.

529
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,239
It's not that you weren't chosen. You made the choice yourself.

530
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,310
Be proud of that.

531
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,680
Right, Yoon Jae?

532
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,220
What? Well, yes.

533
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,289
It's not bad to never date.

534
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,220
You're torturing your liver and soul...

535
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,890
and you don't have to.

536
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,990
Right, Yoon Jae?

537
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,260
Well, yes.

538
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,570
Why would you ask him?

539
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,500
I had a blind date today.

540
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,710
No way. For real?

541
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,610
You're telling me that now?

542
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,739
Who set it up?

543
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,910
Min Ah, a fellow web novelist who's a bit older than me.

544
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,220
And? How did it go?

545
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Not bad.

546
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,690
Over here.

547
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,260
Hi.

548
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,900
Ms. Choi Yu Ri?

549
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,870
Who are you?

550
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,840
Min Ah set me up with you.

551
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,710
I'm Yang Seung Won.

552
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,510
Hello.

553
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,680
No. Please, no.

554
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,589
He looked about 1,100 years old,

555
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,320
but he was just 14 years old.

556
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,889
Isn't that incredible?

557
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,019
Once he marries,

558
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,130
he'll move in with his parents and grandparents.

559
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,960
It's one big, happy family.

560
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,630
Do you know what's hilarious?

561
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,900
That wasn't the first time.

565
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,180
And I'm Buddhist.

566
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,520
Hey. Am I not attractive at all?

567
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,690
Puppy Dog. Am I the worst woman ever?

568
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,490
No.

569
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,020
You're professional, and you're cool.

570
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,630
But not pretty?

571
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
No.

572
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,400
What?

573
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,130
Yu Ri, the blind date went well, right?

574
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,160
You left early on urgent business?

575
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
You're spoiled rotten.

576
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,270
Don't forget my birthday party this weekend.

577
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,970
I invited your date too, so dress nicely.

578
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,670
Oh, no.

579
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,380
You need tissue.

580
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,610
No.

581
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,950
I'll do it.

582
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,690
Okay.

583
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,320
What the heck?

584
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,190
There's some right here.

585
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,590
I know, but you should get that yourself.

586
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,450
What a nuisance.

587
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,290
Ji Eun.

588
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,890
Since you're a man now, can't you be my boyfriend?

589
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,400
You don't seem that drunk. How about you get down and walk?

590
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,070
No. I'm drunk.

591
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,799
Then quit talking nonsense and hold on tight.

592
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,140
- I'm exhausted. - I'm not talking nonsense.

593
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,680
I'll treat you better than Puppy Dog does.

594
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,410
I'll shower you with love.

595
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,380
You won't even have to lift a finger.

596
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,380
I'll treat you well.

597
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,620
Whatever you end up looking like,

598
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,260
I can love you.

599
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,360
Thanks for saying that, my friend.

600
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,130
But I have to go back to being a woman...

601
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,430
to be Yoon Jae's girlfriend.

602
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:21,970
Right, Yoon Jae?

603
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,710
Yes.

604
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,460
Gosh, you're heavy.

605
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,620

(The Night the Universe Shines)

607
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,010
It has been revealed that Titan, the largest moon of Saturn,

608
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,349
is drifting away from the planet...

609
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,390
at a faster rate than the Moon is from Earth.

610
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,319
Based on detailed measurements...

611
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,060
from the Saturn probe,

612
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,089
Titan is moving about 12cm farther...

613
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,700
from Saturn each year.

614
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,400

- You woke up? - What?

622
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,549
- Yes. - Go and wash up.

623
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,720
I made kimchi fried rice.

624

You can see that?

630
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,640
I have 15-12 vision.

631
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,579
Then why do you wear your glasses?

632
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,010
You always wear glasses.

633
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,149
Well, just because.

634
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,920
I'd say they define my identity.

635

Why, all of a sudden?

I won't do it if it makes you uncomfortable.

00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,970
- Here, let me. - What are you doing?

730
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,640
Don't move.

731
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,680
I apologise for calling you a sea bream. I'm sorry!

732
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,020
Kim Ji Hye.

733
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:04,889
Open your eyes and look at me.

734
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,390
Gosh, don't call my name like that.

735
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,400
What? Why? What do you want?

736
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,700
Am I really that good-looking?

737
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Yes.

738
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,470
- Happy birthday, dear Min Ah - Happy birthday, dear Min Ah

739
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,410
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

740
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,349
- Thanks, girls. - Happy birthday!

741
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,720
- Thanks so much. - Happy birthday.

742
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:35,890
Here, cheers.

743
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,360
- Cheers! - Cheers!

744
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,029
Thank you all for coming.

745
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,590
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

746
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,270
Happy birthday, Min Ah.

747
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,099
Who is she, Min Ah?

748
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Well...

749
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,940
Don't you know her?

750
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,870
She's like a little sister to me.

751
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,609
She received the popularity award.

752
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,450
Writer Crystal Shoes who wrote "The Private Life of the Goddess."

753
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,749
- Writer Crystal Shoes? - Oh, it's her?

754
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,780
Oh, right.

755
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,480
You've always stayed anonymous as a writer. Did I make a mistake?

756
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,590
I told you she was really pretty in person.

757
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,220
Right?

758
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,730
- I see. - She is...

759
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:16,690
Hey, Min Ah.

760
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,599
- Hey, you! Thanks for coming. - Hi.

761
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,029
Happy birthday, Min Ah.

762
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,130
Thanks.

763
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,840
Hi, Yu Ri.

764
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,069
Oh, yes. Hello.

765
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,640
I got stuck in traffic, so I'm a little late.

766
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,949
Why are you here?

767
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,280
What? She said...

768
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,120
Didn't you get my message?

769
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,150
I told you he was coming.

770
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,150
He likes you.

771
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,120
You should just marry him.

772
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,630
They say you should marry young to have a smart child.

773
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,060
- Hey, you two should catch up. - All right.

774
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,100
Girls. Let's give them some space.

775
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,540
Yu Ri, in this area,

776
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,009
there's a really good goat stew place.

777
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,839
I'll treat you to a full-course dinner today.

778
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,449
- Come on. - No, it's okay.

779
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,850
What? Come on. We'll have goat stew, and then...

780
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,979
There's a nice wine bar close to the restaurant.

781
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,119
- Come on. It'll be fun. - No, I...

782
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,590
We'll have goat stew.

783
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,820
- Goat stew. - Seriously, I'll pass.

784
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,530
Yu Ri.

785
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,740
Hey, you...

786
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,870
You said you were meeting someone.

787
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,340
Who are you meeting, all dolled up like this?

788
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,650
- He's hot. - Isn't he so good-looking?

789
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,910
What's going on?

790
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,090
My gosh, hello.

791
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,720
- Who is she? - Oh, she is...

792
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,390
This is Min Ah.

793
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,329
I told you about her the other day.

794
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:00,059
Oh, the one who wrote "Poonsoo OB-GYN Clinic," right?

795
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,200
Yes, that's right.

796
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,900
My gosh, I'm a fan of yours.

797
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,400
- Oh, my. - What?

798
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,910
My goodness. I see.

799
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,579
Who is he?

800
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,849
Oh, this is my friend...

801
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,950
I'm Kim Ji Hoon.

802
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,350
I see, Mr. Kim Ji Hoon.

803
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,720
I'm Yu Ri's boyfriend.

804
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,200
What? Boyfriend?

805
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,800
Didn't Yu Ri tell you?

806
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,400
This is my first time hearing about this.

807
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,969
Oh, it's not that...

808
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,040
Choi Yu Ri.

809
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,670
I'm really hurt.

810
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,810
So, you agreed to go on the blind date when you had a boyfriend?

811
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,520
No, that's not the case.

812
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,660
Hey, I had no idea either.

813
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,620
Darn it.

814
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,290
Hey, wait.

815
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,070
- Hey. - There's been a misunderstanding.

816
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,799
He's not my boyfriend. He is...

817
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,440
Actually, I'm not really her boyfriend.

818
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,910
She's my crush, but it's completely one-sided.

819
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,850
- She is his crush? - "Crush?"

820
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,849
So, you have a crush on Yu Ri?

821
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:24,880
That's right.

822
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,550
It's been ten years.

823
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,220
Hey, you can't drink. What's with the wine in your hand?

824
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,960
And what is this in your hair?

825
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,100
Also, your skirt is too short.

826
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,330
That's not short.

827
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,040
Min Ah's skirt is shorter.

828
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,860
I miss her.

829
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,530
Hey, I miss you.

830
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,470
I wonder if it's going well.

831
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,350
What do I like about her?

832
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,020
Well, I just like everything about her.

833
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,390
The large eyes behind her glasses,

834
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,360
the strength hidden behind her modesty,

835
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,770
and the feminine charm that even her cuteness can't hide.

836
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,940
It sounds like you're saying a line from a script you memorized.

837
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,370
I hope Yu Ri didn't plan all this...

838
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,080
and hire you to do this.

839
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,050
- Did you put him up to this? - What?

840
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,949
No wonder you're a successful web novelist.

841
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,480
You have such a vivid imagination.

842
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,620
But I can also see why your work isn't as popular as Yu Ri's.

843
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,460
- Sorry? - Romance is all about the emotions,

844
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:50,030
but you seem to like plotting more...

845
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,560
and don't really have a grasp on the emotions.

846
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,840
Otherwise,

847
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,380
you wouldn't be able to ask her if she hired me...

848
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,180
or put me up to this, especially seeing how I'm looking at her.

849
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,890
I truly like Choi Yu Ri.

850
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:17,890
My gosh.

851
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,330
Now, if you don't mind, can I steal her away?

852
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,940
Sure, I don't mind.

853
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
Thank you. Let's go.

854
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,750
Oh, my!

855
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,290
- He's really hot. - My gosh.

856
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,650
Look at that.

857
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,860
I swear on my ten-year career as a writer...

858
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,360
that he's not her boyfriend.

859
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,830
He said he was Kim Ji Hoon from Yeonhee University, right?

860
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,070
Hey.

861
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,639
You should be thanking me if anything. Have you no manners?

862
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,940
I never asked you to do this.

863
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,109
What are you talking about?

864
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,450
I avenged you in the name of justice.

865
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,679
Min Ah was fuming mad. Didn't you see her?

866
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,790
Right, so...

867
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,990
why would you take revenge on my behalf?

868
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,960
Oh, I see.

869
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,260
Do you look down on me too?

870
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,760
Hey, Choi Yu Ri.

871
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,900
- You're out of line. - You know I've never dated anyone.

872
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,029
If I were to fall for you...

873
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,840
and confess my feelings, what would you do?

874
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,740
See? You just froze.

875
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,050
I hadn't thought of it that way.

876
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,579
It was reckless of me.

877
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,890
You should've thought it through.

878
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:56,790
I bet...

879
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,359
I'm trying so hard not to fall for you.

880
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,430
I bet you have no idea.

881
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,460
When I'm with you,

882
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,600
I keep forgetting what I look like now.

883
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,399
I'm sorry.

884
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,199
No, don't apologise.

885
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,010
Why are you apologising? What are you sorry for?

886
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,280
I know you did it for me.

887
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,619
Honestly, I don't understand why I'm so angry right now,

888
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,690
but I'm so mad.

889
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,760
Let's just call it a day and part ways here.

890
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,530
I'll call you tomorrow.

891
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,740
Oh, no.

892
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,950
How do I look?

893
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,320
Pretty.

894
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,860
- What? - I said, "Pretty."

895
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,230
Then I should've come here earlier.

896
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,840
Oh, hey.

897
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,040
I thought you were someone else when you walked in.

898
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,980
And you still think that?

899
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:30,950
What?

900
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,180
Are you still confusing me with someone else?

901
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,290
No, I'm not.

902
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,220
Then it's all good.

903
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,260
What's all good?

904
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,360
You're no longer confused,

905
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,970
yet you still gaze at me just like when I first walked in.

906
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,279

We look like a couple who just had a fight.

909
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,940
What?

910
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,910
Why? Why do you think that?

911
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,010
Because of my face?

912
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,720
- Should we retake it? - No.

913
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,950
Other couples usually stand closer,

914
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:54,190
hold hands, and look all sweet.

915
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,730
Oh, I see.

916
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,200
Sorry. I've never done this before, you know.

917
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,070
No need to stutter like that.

918
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,680
I can just hold your hand like this.

919
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,970
(Special thanks to Park Myung Sin and Yewon)

920
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:14,300
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

921
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,669
I stayed up all night because of you.

922
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,310
Did you break up with your girlfriend?

923
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,479
The doe-eyed guy from Yeonhee University.

924
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,850
Isn't he so handsome?

925
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,149
He is Writer Crystal Shoes' boyfriend!

926
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,080
Baby, you're here.

927
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:30,289
- Kiss! - Kiss!

928
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:32,159
They're all busy talking about that guy, Kim Ji Hoon, now.

929
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,829
You two truly care for each other, right?

930
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,260
- Yes. - And you, Park Yoon Jae?

931
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,630
- What? - What? A motel?

932
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,159
Is he cheating?

933
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,030
Ji Hoon, what are you doing here?
