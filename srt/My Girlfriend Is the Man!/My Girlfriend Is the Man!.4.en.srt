Why jelly all of a sudden?

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,710
Someone told me jelly might give you courage.

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,540
There's nothing that requires more courage

- What did you say?
- It's a good thing.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,020
You were going to tell our parents

It's best to rip off the band-aid.

Just do it while you can.

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,780
What...

187
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,120
is going on here?

188
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,700
Honey.

189
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,490
Our Ji Eun...

190
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,800
likes tangerines.

191
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,490
- Go get the best ones.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,900
Okay.

193
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,300
- I'll come with you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

194
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,910
Are you okay?

195
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,040
That must have scared you.

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
If I say no, that would be a lie.

197
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,660
Where's the energy you had
when you taught us about this?

199
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,000
I was worried you'd throw me a party or something.

200
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,710
You know...

201
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,260
now that it's happened to me,

202
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,570
I don't feel like it.

203
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,900
I'll go back to the way I was, like you.

204
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,950
Time will take care of it.

205
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,510
Right?

206
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,880
But I'm super handsome, right?

207
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,460
I surprise myself, too.

208
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,470
Except for the part where I'm a guy,

209
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,150
I'd be saying thank you to God.

210
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,090
- Dad, you're okay, right?
- Huh?

211
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,210
Of course, I'm okay.

212
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,950
I think Mom was pretending to be okay.

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,500
If you pretend long enough, it becomes true.

214
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,210
While we're at it,

215
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,430
want to hear a secret from me?

216
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,660
What?

217
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,540
I...

218
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,900
love our daughters, of course, but...

219
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,500
I used to wish we had a son, too.

220
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,930
Why is that a secret?

221
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,700
Your mom and I have been trying until recent.

222
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,940
This whole time,

223
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,710
I've been having eel, blackberries, live octopus...

224
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,010
No, no, aigoo. Okay, okay.

225
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,500
I know daughters are the best,

226
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,400
but when my friends with sons would
go to the bathhouse together,

227
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,980
or bring them along to soccer,

228
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,100
I would get jealous and envious.

229
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,000
Dad.

230
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,720
Even if Ji Eun is a guy,

231
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,340
she would never go to the bathhouse with you.

232
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,280
I feel the same way.

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,150
My goodness.

234
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,920
Dad!

235
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,760
It's so nice out.

236
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,360
I know.

237
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,150
Your husband told me.

238
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,390
It's okay.

239
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,720
We knew this could happen at any given point.

240
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,880
If she weren't my daughter,

241
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,380
it would be unimaginable.

242
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,060
It's the card we were dealt.

[Must bring ID and Driver's License]

245
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,660
I wonder how Yun Jae is doing.

246
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:18,700
I think it would be good to explain
the concept a bit more here.

247
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,600
All right. I'll do that. Okay.

248
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,990
The presentation is coming up so soon, right?

249
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Here, too.

250
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,050
I think we should explain it here in more detail.

251
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,750
Okay.

252
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,840
- One second.
- Okay.

253
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,190
Hey, Ji Eun.

254
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,990
How are your parents?

255
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,620
- You saw them?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

256
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,940
It didn't go the way I predicted,

257
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,200
but it turned out well in the end.

258
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,390
- How's the prep going?
- Yeah.

259
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,740
I'm still at school.

260
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,150
I want to go to school, too.

261
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,240
How did I end up with this unlucky fate?

262
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,150
You know...

263
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,730
in quantum mechanics,

264
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,100
there is no such thing as predestined fate.

265
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,570
Unless something is measured, it doesn't exist.

266
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,240
Our individual futures

267
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,460
depend on what we see and choose.

268
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,470
Why are you bringing up quantum mechanics?

269
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,460
The minute you think this is your unlucky fate,

270
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,060
that is also a choice.

271
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,080
When I struggle,

272
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,280
I think of Kim Ji Eun.

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,710
Then, strangely, I feel better.

276
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,810
I become happy pretty fast.

278
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,100
can also be that choice for Kim Ji Eun.

279
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,210
Oppa!

280
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,870
What are you doing in the middle
of making the presentation?

281
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,500
We don't have much time.

282
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,900
Okay.

283
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,760
Sorry, Ji Eun.

284
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
I'll call you back when I get home.

285
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,470
No, it's okay. Good luck.

I'm so sorry.

I was on the subway

291
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,080
and it stopped out of nowhere.

292
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
It started running again after 32 minutes.

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,040

Of course.

a magazine while you wait?

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,180
If you're a man, you should read this stuff.

368
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,900
Hyung.

369
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,400
You're so cool.

370
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,100
- Just sit here for a second.
- Okay.

371
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,490
Ta-da!

372
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,940
What? Flowers?

373
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,860
Thank you.

374
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,730
Your place is so clean.

375
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,520
It smells nice, too.

376
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,170
Really? It's always like this.

377
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,050
You must be hungry. Sit on the couch.

378
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,580
Okay.

379
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,550
Drink this.

380
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,770
Thank you.

381
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,690
Cheers!

382
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,440
I hope you like it.

383
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,010
You made all this?

384
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,450
I like to cook.

385
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,690
You're totally my ideal type, Hyung.

386
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,330
Ideal type?

387
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,470
He's just an older brother to you.

388
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,190
How long have you two known each other?

389
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,220
College friends?

390
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,380
It's been a little more than a year.

391
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,500
453 days.

392
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,440
You keep track of that?

393
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,930
Wow, Min Hyeok, this looks
so good. Try it. Say ah.

394
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,860
- Say ah. That's right.
- I'll eat.

395
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,140
What is wrong with you?

396
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:01,180
You don't look like it, but you act so rough.

397
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,390
Not with me.

398
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,080
How is he with you?

399
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,000
Someone's here.

400
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,690
One second.

401
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,200
Coming!

402
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,670
You made it.

403
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,570
Thank you, Yu Ri. I've been struggling.

404
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,940
Hello. I'm Lee Min Hyeok.

405
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,750
I work with Yun Jae.

406
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,150
Yes.

407
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,500
- I'm-
- Wow.

408
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,060
Your glasses are huge.

409
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,280
They're fake, right?

410
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,570
Damn it!

411
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,630
They're real. Sorry.

412
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,780
This is my friend Choi Yu Ri.

413
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,590
We've been friends since elementary school.

414
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,240
This is my boyfriend, Yun Jae.

415
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,850
Boyfriend?

416
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,880
I guess so.

417
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,030
Hello, his boyfriend Park Yun Jae.

418
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,910
I'm his friend who's a girl. Choi Yu Ri.

419
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,940
I've heard a lot about you.

420
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,100
Oh, yes. I've heard a lot about you, too.

421
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,120
I see that we're raising

422
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,270
a unicorn together.

423
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,810
Yes.

424
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,450
Where's the unicorn?

425
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,200
Hey.

426
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,500
You said you guys met on a blind date, right?

427
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,870
Who is "you guys"?

428
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,040
Who would have met on a blind date here?

429
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,270
I think Yu Ri is a bit drunk.

430
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,530
Hey, stop drinking.

431
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,090
This is non-alcoholic, though.

432
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,660
Sorry.

433
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,050
This is so nice.

434
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,150
Invite me over often, Hyung.

435
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,410
Well...

436
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,590
Maybe I will sometime.

437
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,850
Hey, stop squeezing that!

438
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
- Sorry.
- What was that?

439
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,240
It's all over Ji Hun's clothes.

440
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,500
I was going to change anyway. It's so hot.

441
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,600
- Let me go change.
- Sorry...

442
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm going to the bathroom.

443
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,720
Geez.

444
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,200
What? Hey, it wasn't on purpose.

445
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,990
Hey.

446
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,090
What?

447
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,440
There's no...

448
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,340
toilet paper in the bathroom.

449
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,010
Really?

450
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,540
One second.

451
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,410
Hey, I thought you had non-alcoholic beer.

452
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,410
Your face is so red.

453
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,220
Even your ears are red.

454
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,340
So warm.

455
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,560
Also, blind date?

456
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,540
Be careful.

457
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,560
Yeah.

458
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,600
I'll stop drinking.

459
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,020
Did you guys get into a fight downstairs?

460
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,800
Why are all of you acting like this?

461
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,450
Nothing.

462
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
It's been a while since I've had a drink.

463
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,800
I'm tired.

464
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,080
Should we go?

465
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,670
Yes. That's a good idea.

466
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,500
Let's go now.

467
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,700
What? We're just getting started.

468
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,260
Ji Hun, I can stay longer, right?

469
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,960
I'm a little tired, too.

470
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,900
I haven't even gotten started.

471
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,640
Come on. Let's hang out more.

472
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,800
Huh?

473
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,870
[Yu Ri 3]

474
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,600
Who's Yu Ri 3?

475
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,510
Yu Ri 1, Yu Ri 2, Yu Ri 3, Yu Ri 4.

476
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,680
Hey. Right now?

477
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,050
You miss me?

478
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,670
Yu Ri?

479
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,460
Yeah.

480
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,110
Hey.

481
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,120
Keep tabs on your boyfriend.

482
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,560
Birds of a feather flock together.

483
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,250
What are you trying to say?

484
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,360
You can't trust your boyfriend

485
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,580
as long as a player is by his side.

486
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,770
Hey.

487
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,610
Yun Jae is not like that.

488
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,570
Nice line.

489
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,360
Can I use that as my new novel's title?

490
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,860
The genre is dramatic romance thriller.

491
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,290
Anyway, it's too late.
I think I need to call a cab.

492
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,800
- Which way are you going?
- Me?

493
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,670
Yu Ri is staying over tonight.

494
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,560
That's right, but...

495
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,300
it might be okay to go home and sleep.

496
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,700
Don't fall asleep on your way again
and make me worry.

497
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,310
Just stay over.

498
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,600
D-Do that.

499
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,800
It's better to stay over safely
at a friend's than to be out so late.

500
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,990
Go on in.

501
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,720
Good night.

502
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,620
Let's go.

503
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,200
I've been waiting for this moment
to be alone with you.

504
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,580
Choi Yu Ri. We're friends.

505
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,830
We can't do this.

506
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,740
Do I still look like a friend to you?

507
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,920
Look.

508
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,090
We look pretty good together.

509
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,440
No. No!

510
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,090
What am I thinking?

511
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,900
They've been friends since elementary school.

512
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,680
So what? That doesn't matter
between a guy and a girl.

513
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,930
But they're not a guy and a girl.

514
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,210
Right?

515
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,480
Park Yun Jae.

516
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,790
Get it together.

517
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,800
Are you possessed by Satan?

518
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,210
- It'd be nice to sleep in the bed together.
- What?

519
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,730
Why are you so shocked?

520
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,880
We always slept together.

521
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,500
But I'm too big now. I should sleep on the floor.

522
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,640
Okay.

523
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,910
I'm going to bed, then.

524
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,030
Already?

525
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,020
I think I drank too much.

526
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,360
I'm a little tired.

527
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,700
But you didn't drink.

528
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,380
Hey!

529
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,400
Let's talk a little before bed.

530
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,880
Hey.

531
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,250
Stop drinking the non-alcoholic stuff, too.

532
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,260
My stupid life...

533
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,140
All I do is celebrate and pay
condolences to other people.

534
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,550
No special event since my first birthday party.

535
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,700
No event.

536
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,560
Excuse me.

537
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,630
Could I get a light?

538
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,980
Thank you.

539
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,100
Are you...

540
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,720
It's you. My deskmate Kim Ji Hye.

541
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,690
H-Hong Yeong Seok?

542
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,560
You look exactly the same.

543
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,130
But do you recognize me?

544
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,800
I've changed so much.

545
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,770
I don't know if you'd recognize me.

546
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,090
<i>No way.</i>

547
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,200
Is that human?

548
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,780
He's so hot.

549
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,300
- What?
- Is that him?

550
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Who is that girl?

551
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,560
- She's glaring at us.

00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:06,030
Yun Jae! Are you okay?

736
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,610
Mom is here.

737
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,150
Wait.

738
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,570
You're the friend from last time, right?

739
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,120
You brought him home blackout drunk last time.

740
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,690
You look so normal, and...

741
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:21,230
You must party way too hard.

742
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,100
I'm sorry.

743
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,860
Hello.

744
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,110
W-Who are you?

745
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:31,470
I'm Yun Jae's hoobae who called you earlier.

746
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,880
He just got here.

747
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,830
Yun Jae passed out from indigestion
during the seminar afterparty.

748
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:43,020
They said he's fine, and he can
go home as soon as he wakes up.

749
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:48,270
Goodness, what use was raising
him on organic food?

750
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,020
He just eats anything and gets indigestion!

751
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,170
Seriously...

752
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,880
Yun Jae...

753
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,300
Yun Jae, wake up.

754
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,990
Mom is here!

755
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,880
Excuse me.

756
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,900
So many of you are here now.

757
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,890
His girlfriend must have been scared.

758
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,800
W-Well...

759
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,300
I...

760
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,100
Yes. Well...

761
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,570
We're getting to know each other.

762
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,440
Aigoo.

763
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,000
Maybe it's because you're Yun Jae's hoobae.

764
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,660
Not only are you pretty, but you
must have gotten good grades.

765
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:45,300
I know it's under these circumstances,

766
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,230
but nice to meet you.

767
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,780
We should treat you to a meal
with Yun Jae sometime.

768
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,560
Really?

769
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,210
That sounds nice.

770
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,620
Aigoo. My goodness.

771
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:03,040
I had no idea such a smart and sweet
girl was by my Yun Jae's side.

772
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,700
- Right? You had no idea, right?
- Of course not.

773
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,410
I had no idea.

774
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,590
Yun Jae is so popular. I guess you didn't know.

775
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,380
By the way, would you like something to drink?

776
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,600
You must have been scared. Give me one minute.

777
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,430
Excuse me.

778
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,100
As far as I know, Yun Jae has a girlfriend.

779
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,030
You're still here.

780
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:43,210
Yun Jae has a girlfriend.

781
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,760
Did I say something?

782
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,980
There's been a big misunderstanding.

783
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,500
It seems like you told the hospital
you were his girlfriend.

784
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,710
If I said I was a friend,
it wouldn't have felt urgent.

785
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,480
That's why I told them I was his girlfriend.

786
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,800
Is that a problem?

787
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,300
That's a lie.

788
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,660
Why is this your business?

789
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,880
People might think you're his girlfriend.

790
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,980
What I mean is...

791
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,030
If this is how you set things up,

792
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,250
Yun Jae will be so confused when he wakes up.

793
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,680
As his friend, I'm concerned-

794
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,570
Technically, it's not a complete lie.

795
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,570
What do you mean?

796
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,560
Maybe not now,

797
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,700
but someday, it will happen.

798
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,700
Just wait a bit longer.

799
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,600
I'll share a meal with you as
his girlfriend, not as his hoobae.

800
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,220
S-Sure, anytime. We can eat anytime...

801
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,220
But excuse me. Are you saying...

802
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,910
Yun Jae is seeing someone else?

803
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:02,700
If he hasn't told his parents,
it must not be serious.

804
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,900
Don't worry.

805
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,340
I'll take good care of him.

806
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,550
It is serious.

807
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,830
They can't live without each other.

808
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,940
Why should I believe you?

809
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Believe it.

810
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,300
I am Park Yun Jae's girlfriend!

811
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,990
