(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

6
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,120
Hey, Ji Hye. I was able to open the door.

7
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,920
I'll check and then call you back.

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,250
Okay.

9
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,210
Yoon Jae.

10
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,750
You two...

11
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,650
What's going on?

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,320
What?

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,320
What?

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,990
This is...

15
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,230
Yoon Jae?

16
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,990
- What are you doing... - Gosh.

17
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,330
Darn it.

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,000
I mean... Why are you sleeping next to me?

19
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,870
Why are you asking me?

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,709
Did you just pull my hair?

21
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,439
- Gosh, hey. - What?

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,509
- Let go of me. - You let go.

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,350
- You let go of me 1st. - No, you 1st.

24
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,219
- Hey, guys. Hold on. - Let go of my hair!

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,750
Guys, hold on!

26
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,389
Kang Min Joo, you sly witch!

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,959
Do you want this sly witch to teach you a lesson?

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,020
- Hold on. - My gosh.

29
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,359
- Let's talk it out. - This is my house.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,599
Why am I sleeping here?

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,929
Why would I do anything to you?

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,969
- I... Move. - Why would I make a move on you?

33
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,169
- You come here. - I've got nothing to lose.

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,100
Guys!

35
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,199
- Hold on. - Come here.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,769
- You really don't know? - You come here.

37
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,369
- I've got nothing to lose. - Hey.

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,279
Hey, no! The hair!

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,550
(Episode 9: Grandpa and Pink)

40
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,319
You little... Seriously. What do you want?

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,480
That's enough.

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm serious. Nothing happened between us.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,660
You're not getting the wrong idea here, right?

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,959
I'm not that kind of girl who wakes up in the same bed...

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,230
with some random man.

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,599
He was running a high fever.

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,530
I was simply staying by his side to help and keep him safe.

48
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,240
When I was keeping him company, I fell asleep before I knew it.

49
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Ji Hoon! You don't have any feelings for me, right?

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,880
Me?

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,309
I'm the flustered one here.

52
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,249
I feel like my personal space was violated...

53
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,419
in the name of help and safety.

54
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,480
Unbelievable.

55
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,749
You would've died on the stairs if it weren't for my help.

56
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,750
Did you know that?

57
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,019
I'd rather end the romance...

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,089
the right way with death than with dirty affairs.

59
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,990
Did you hear him? He called it romance.

60
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,129
I have no interest in having any romance with you.

61
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,560
You're not the main character in my romance.

62
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,029
And could you stop calling me Ji Hoon?

63
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,570
That is your name, isn't it? What am I supposed to call you then?

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Stop it!

65
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,870
If nothing happened, it's fine.

66
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,210
I'll tell Ji Hye that you're all right.

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,419
You're leaving?

68
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,650
Yes. And you need to rest up a bit more.

69
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,020
I need to wash up.

70
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,190
Let's go, Yoon Jae. Gosh, what time is it?

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,860
I'll never come back here.

72
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,400
I'll get going. Rest up.

73
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,570
Okay.

74
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,690
You passed. Sleep tight.

75
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,040
You passed one last time.

76
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,680
Sleep tight.

77
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,960
My gosh. That hurts. This is so annoying.

78
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,560
Come on.

79
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,330
What are you doing outside?

80
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,500
To see you off.

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
There's no need. Just get back inside.

82
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,800
I'll do what I want.

83
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,140
And let me tell you one more time.

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
Don't get the wrong idea.

85
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,639
He was passed out on the stairs.

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,940
I just couldn't ignore him.

87
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,780
I fell asleep while looking after him.

88
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,019
There was nothing I could do after I fell asleep on the bed.

89
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,780
I get it. I understand.

90
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,550
I understand that you were shocked. But you went too far...

91
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,620
by slapping him in the cheek.

92
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,490
Didn't you see how he pulled my hair?

93
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,530
He almost pulled out all of my hair. I'm serious.

94
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,400
How could a man come after a girl's hair?

95
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,539
Hey. Gender has nothing to do with this.

96
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,599
When you're under attack...

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,970
Ji Hoon isn't a polar bear.

98
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,970
Is he a penguin from the Antarctic?

99
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,069
What? That was random.

100
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,439
This is odd. It's not like he's an endangered species.

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,050
Why are you so set on protecting him?

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,750
Does your girlfriend know how close you guys are?

103
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,359
I understand that you're friends. But if I were your girlfriend,

104
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
I would've really hated this.

105
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,130
Well, that's possible.

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,900
"That's possible?"

107
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,940
If you don't care about her that much, date me!

108
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,810
But not today.

109
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,690
Let's not settle this between us.

110
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,320
Let's pursue our own hearts.

111
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,390
He might choose one of us or pass on both of us.

112
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,960
Young Seok will decide.

113
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,570
Did you eat anything?

114
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,080
Is your mother okay?

115
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,650
Yes. She's resting.

116
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,880
By the way, do you two know each other?

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,620
Well,

118
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,390
we started out as client and employee,

119
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,989
became friends,

120
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,830
and somehow ended up competing.

121
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,460
What?

122
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,430
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,360
Young Seok.

124
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,520
Yes.

125
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,660
Stay here. Please stay.

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,430
Thank you so much.

127
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,100
You want to thank me? For what?

128
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,140
For saying we'll have a fair game.

129
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm definitely participating.

130
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,920
Take this.

131
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,160
- Oh, my. - What's all this?

132
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Oh, this?

133
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,230
I brought some side dishes...

134
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,260
and braised ribs.

135
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,700
Your grandpa...

136
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,429
No. I mean, they're from your grandma.

137
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,840
She knows this is your favourite.

138
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,740
Of course.

139
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,240
But isn't this too much food?

140
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,680
How will Ji Hye and I finish all this food?

141
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,650
Seriously. Cooking big portions runs in the family too.

142
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,820
Passing down only those traits would've been nice.

143
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,490
Right.

144
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,740
From now on,

145
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,510
I'm not going to hide anything from you.

146
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,540
If you have any questions, ask me.

147
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,410
Now that you're suddenly giving me full access, I can't think of any.

148
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,980
I had a whole list of them.

149
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,420
You can take your time with it.

150
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,419
I'm going to close the salon today.

151
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,450
The salon?

152
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,020
You should have told me in advance. I should've written them down.

153
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,730
Well...

154
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,330
Mom.

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,830
Do you still fear it?

156
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,440
I used to.

157
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,540
But...

158
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,510
I'm not afraid of turning back into a man.

159
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,750
I always feared that this might happen...

160
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,680
to you or your sister.

161
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,950
And look what happened to me.

162
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,660
Right.

163
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,660
That's why...

164
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,990
I have no fear.

165
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,200
Nothing scares me either.

166
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,800
I feel braver because now,

167
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,900
I have to protect my girl.

168
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,240
But I might have to live as a man for the rest of my life, right?

169
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,980
Like Grandma.

170
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,860
Yes.

171
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,360
I should break up...

172
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,970
with Yoon Jae, right?

173
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,540
That's Yoon Jae's decision.

174
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,910
But you should tell him the truth.

175
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,310
You like him.

176
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,980
He might stay with me because he's too kind...

177
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,250
while pretending he's okay when he's not...

178
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,220
and this is nothing when it is too much on him.

179
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,120
But he can't pretend forever.

180
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,460
I experienced it too.

181
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,480
Come on.

182
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,650
Why does the professor want to see me?

183
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,850
You'll know once you get there.

184
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,950
Come on in. Sit down.

185
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,790
- Mr. Park. - Yes.

186
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,459
- Ms. Kang. - Hi.

187
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,690
Nice to see you.

188
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,130
So...

189
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,870
I've got good news for you.

190
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,170
I have a very special proposal for you.

191
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,210
How would you like to come study at Corning University?

192
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,910
- Of course. - Of course?

193
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,709
Well, there you go.

194
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,480
(Yeonhee University)

195
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,430
Yoon Jae, this is crazy. Are we really going to the US?

196
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,230
I can't believe this is happening.

197
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,369
You heard him, right?

198
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,439
He was so impressed with our presentation,

199
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,140
so he came all this way just to see us.

200
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,840
Right.

201
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,210
I can't believe this is happening either.

202
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,010
It's not just any university. It's Corning University.

203
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,380
It's only 20 minutes away from the NASA Research Center.

204
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,750
This is awesome.

205
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,590
But...

206
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,490
I need to think about it for a bit.

207
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Are you mad? You need to think about this?

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,060
Why?

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,970
This isn't an easy decision to make.

210
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,629
Why isn't it?

211
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,840
We were offered a great opportunity other people would die for.

212
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,610
No one loves space as much as you.

213
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,810
Park Yoon Jae.

214
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,650
Whatever the reason is,

215
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,250
you would be a fool to waste this opportunity.

216
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,850
Get a grip.

217
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,290
If you say no, I'll drag you to the US.

218
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,280
This is cool, indeed.

219
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,610
Yoon Jae.

220
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,480
- You're here. - Did you have to wait long?

221
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,350
No. I could have come to you.

222
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
I wanted to check out the campus since it had been a while.

223
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,059
And there was something I had to tell you too.

224
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
Really?

225
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,960
Let's take a walk.

226
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,990
Sure.

227
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,740
Instead of holding hands or linking arms,

228
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,180
I'll do this instead.

229
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,580
Okay.

230
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,700
I can do it.

231
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,860
I must do it.

232
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,040
It's from a new cafe on campus. It's pretty good.

233
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,140
Thanks.

234
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,150
Yoon Jae.

235
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,850
I'm getting used to living as a man now.

236
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,860
Being a guy is definitely more comfortable than being a girl.

237
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,490
Yes.

238
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,059
Some things I struggled with as a woman...

239
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,530
are starting to get easier now.

240
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,840
And this guy seems to pull off the things Ji Eun couldn't.

241
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,570
What did this guy do exactly?

242
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,380
You know,

243
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,610
he can carry out all the recyclables in one go.

244
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,779
He can wear clothes...

245
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,980
Ji Eun couldn't wear because she was too short.

246
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,219
He can take out plates...

247
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,720
from the upper cabinet without a chair.

248
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,430
He's tall enough to put his arms around your shoulder.

249
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,670
And he might be brave enough to say things...

250
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,140
Ji Eun would never be able to say.

251
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,110
Things Ji Eun would never be able to say?

252
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,810
Like what?

253
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,120
Listen, Yoon Jae.

254
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,629
I recently found out about this too.

255
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,700
Be careful.

256
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,330
- My gosh. - Goodness.

257
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,899
- I'm sorry. - Sorry.

258
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,830
- Are you all right? Are you hurt? - I'm sorry.

259
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,700
No. What about you?

260
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm good.

261
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,980
Yoon Jae.

262
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,750
I need to tell you something.

263
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,780
You're getting a call.

264
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,650
(Spoon Worm)

265
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,120
I don't need to take it.

266
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,060
There's a chance...

267
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,630
that I might never be...

268
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,730
(Spoon Worm)

269
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,500
(Power off)

270
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,810
Yoon Jae.

271
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,580
I might never...

272
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,519
Come on. I turned off the phone. Is my phone going crazy?

273
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,560
No. It's mine this time.

274
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
What?

275
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,190
It's Lee Min Hyuk.

276
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:09,300
(Lee Min Hyuk)

277
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,370
What are you two doing? How did you get in here?

278
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,939
Why bother asking me when it's so obvious?

279
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,510
I punched in the passcode to get in.

280
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,110
Your mother insisted that I have braised ribs with you.

281
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,649
Min Hyuk, try this.

282
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,250
- It's so good. - Okay.

283
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,320
His grandpa is the best chef in Pohang.

284
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,399
But when did you two become so close?

285
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, so you don't know yet.

286
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,870
We work up a good sweat by running together at night.

287
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,869
Come on. We just run.

288
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,280
We're running mates like in a running crew.

289
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,980
Oh, right.

290
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,159
Ji Hoon. Did you find my earring on your bed?

291
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,489
Why are you looking for your earring on my bed?

292
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,689
What's gotten into you?

293
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,730
Because we slept together that night.

294
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,830
No way.

295
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,870
This isn't true, right?

296
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,170
So everyone is here.

297
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,040
What? Gosh, can I join you?

298
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,480
(Grandpa)

299
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,579
It's your grandpa. I want to answer it.

300
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,220
Hey, I'll get that later.

301
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,549
Grandpa. This is Yu Ri.

302
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,689
My gosh, Yu Ri.

303
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,389
It's been a while. So you guys are together.

304
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,889
I came to have the braised ribs you sent over.

305
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,359
By the way, it's so good.

306
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,059
Is that so? That's great to hear.

307
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,000
What? Are they still dating?

308
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,670
I'm with my friends. I'll call you back.

309
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,909
- Hello. - Hello.

310
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,970
Hello.

311
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,010
There are a lot of you. That's great.

312
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,250
So all of you had the braised ribs I sent over.

313
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,720
Come down this weekend and give me a hand.

314
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,079
What do you mean? Is something going on over there?

315
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,520
There's always something going on over here.

316
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,389
Come down here for some nice food and a nice stargazing session.

317
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,659
Come for a nice, relaxing trip!

318
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Okay. See you this weekend.

319
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,630
He hung up.

320
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,429
I already have plans this weekend.

321
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,599
I also have a meeting.

322
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,870
Did he invite me too?

323
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,899
I'll adjust my schedule.

324
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,869
No. You don't have to worry about that.

325
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,010
I can go down by myself.

326
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,380
Let's talk about this after we have some braised ribs.

327
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,509
I don't want our food to get cold. Are you staying for the ribs?

328
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,680
Yes. It smells great.

329
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,150
When you live alone, you don't get to eat braised ribs that often.

330
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,719
Do you have rice? Should I go and buy some?

331
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,090
No. When I checked earlier, there was rice too.

332
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,560
Let's go over there. This table is too small.

333
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,999
Gosh, look at this.

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,010
- So where's the rice? - It's over there.

335
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,909
The perilla leaves looked good too.

336
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,179
Let me get some.

337
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,210
Who made all this?

338
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,029
(How many times did you turn into a man?)

339
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,159
(How did you turn back to a woman?)

340
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,900
(Did you have to fake your identity?)

341
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,600
I have to ask all of these questions this time.

342
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,469
What are you doing here?

343
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,500
What do you think? We're here to help.

344
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,840
You didn't have to.

345
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,770
You said you all had plans.

346
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,670
How are you guys here together?

347
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,439
How long have you been out here?

348
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,239
I started a group chat.

349
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,379
I got the information from your grandpa.

350
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,679
I want to eat a lot of tasty food, see the stars,

351
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,850
and have a relaxing trip.

352
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,020
I'm here because Yoon Jae said he was going.

353
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,859
Some clueless fool invited her to the group chat.

354
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,030
Well, your grandpa invited everyone in the house.

355
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,429
Hey, let's go. We don't have time to waste.

356
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,929
We're going to miss the bus.

357
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,970
- Let's go. - Let's go.

358
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,500
- Let's go. - Let's go.

359
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Let's go.

360
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,980
Do you see that over there?

361
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,219
- There? - Yes.

362
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,220
That?

363
00:21:57,221 --> 00:21:58,620
Things are looking good.

364
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,889
Can you take a picture of us? Let's go!

365
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,490
- Let's go! - Let's go!

366
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,320
One, two, three.

367
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,930
Come on, take it!

368
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,870
- Let's go! - Let's go!

369
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,079
The loser will wash the dishes.

370
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,210
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

371
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,820
- It's you. - You didn't play anything.

372
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:30,850
Rock-paper-scissors.

373
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,520
One, two,

374
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,530
three.

375
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,040
The weather is great today. We'll get to see some stars today.

376
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340
Right.

377
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,150
- Hey. - Come and sit here, Yu Ri.

378
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,409
All right, let's go!

379
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,249
One, two, three.

380
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,150
- Let's go! - Let's go!

381
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,730
All right. Come inside.

382
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,700
- Check out the view. - It's so beautiful.

383
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,780
Okay. We'll work by the waterfront for five hours.

384
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,339
And you can relax for the rest of the day.

385
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,649
So let's hurry.

386
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,180
We'll have to work for five hours?

387
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,650
Oh, no. I had to stay up all night to meet my deadline.

388
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,490
I should've just worked my shift.

389
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,790
I'll give you a cup of coffee. Let's meet back in five.

390
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,089
The first room you see in the house is for the guys.

391
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,560
And the room farther in is for the girls.

392
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,459
Only a monster would make us work on an empty stomach.

393
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,299
They woke up early in the morning, so they must be hungry.

394
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,369
If you're full, you'll get sleepy and won't be so efficient.

395
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,040
I totally agree. Yes, sir. I got it.

396
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,340
Let's go. Come on.

397
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,140
Come with me.

398
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,580
All right. It's the room farther in when we go inside.

399
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,080
No, the first room.

400
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,710
Come on. Hurry.

401
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,450
You'll sleep in my room.

402
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,220
The room only for the host.

403
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,990
Let's go.

404
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,370
I'm glad you're here.

405
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,379
We last met at the hair salon...

406
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,710
and that led to this?

407
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,050
Instead of consolation or support, I get labour?

408
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,380
It's love.

409
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,590
I'll make the coffee. Get ready and join me.

410
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,930
Oh, right. I need sunscreen.

411
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,160
Let's see...

412
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,630
Don't you forget to wear sunscreen.

413
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,000
You get sunburned easily by the sea.

414
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,820
You.

415
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,990
You sweet thing.

416
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,020
Why didn't I notice?

417
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,830
Here you go.

418
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,330
- Gosh. - Isn't it fresh?

419
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,499
Hello, sir.

420
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,530
Hey.

421
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,629
- Hello. - Hello.

422
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,999
Your job for the day is to sort out these fish by kind.

423
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, gosh.

424
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,640
- What? - Sir?

425
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,440
We don't have to do all this, do we?

426
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,910
You have to do all that.

427
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,950
Mr. Kim here will tell you what to do.

428
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,720
- Are you ready to work? - No.

429
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,550
- Good luck. - "No?"

430
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,219
Come on. Hurry up.

431
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
- Good luck. - Let's go.

432
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,260
- Come along. - Let's go.

433
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,329
Keep going.

434
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,959
- Here we go. - Here we go.

435
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,600
- Here. - Here we go.

436
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
- Here we go. - Oh, gosh.

437
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,510
- It looks heavy. - It's fine.

438
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,670
Are you sure?

439
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,040
- Help. - You're doing pretty good.

440
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,539
- Take your time. - Okay.

441
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,040
Go slow, but be careful.

442
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,810
What was that?

443
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,680
What am I supposed to do?

444
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,620
- What's this? - What is this?

445
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,820
- Look. - No!

446
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,090
Sorry.

447
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,860
- Here you go. - Thanks.

448
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,260
Here.

449
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,460
- Get that. - Gosh.

450
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,840
You're doing well.

451
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,870
Take that one.

452
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,680
- I'll do it. - Thanks.

453
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,690
- Pick it up. - Are you blind?

454
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,720
Help the one who needs help.

455
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Oh, right.

456
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,329
He's weaker than...

457
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,899
He's stronger than you.

458
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,170
He's trained in kendo.

459
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,240
Help me instead.

460
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Come on.

461
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,180
Fine.

462
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,190
How are you doing?

463
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,720
Is it manageable?

464
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,190
- Watch out. - Hey!

465
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,890
- Keep that away from me! - What's wrong?

466
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,030
Why is she scared of fish?

467
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,900
Help!

468
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,000
Darn it.

469
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,710
Well done.

470
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,910
Hey, Ji Eun.

471
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,610
Ji Hoon.

472
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,380
Kim Ji Hoon.

473
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,719
You got it mixed up again.

474
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,590
Yes, Kim Ji Hoon. Everyone's like this at my age.

475
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,220
Ji Hoon, you come with me.

476
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,900
See you.

477
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,170
Boo.

478
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,080
I don't know how or where to start.

479
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,450
Say anything there is you need to say.

480
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,120
I knew this would happen,

481
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,460
so I brought a list of stuff to ask.

482
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,599
Mom asked me the same thing,

483
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,930
but my mind went blank.

484
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,270
Good for you. You're a smart girl.

485
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
Okay, then.

486
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,710
Read it through.

487
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,980
When and how did you become a man?

488
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,350
How many times did you switch?

489
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,980
How did you make a living after you became a man?

490
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,850
What was your mom like?

491
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,620
How did you fake your identity?

492
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,859
What do you do...

493
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,030
when you need an ID?

494
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,460
What was your husband like,

495
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,260
and how did you end it?

496
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,400
If you could make a choice now,

497
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,330
would you go back to being a woman?

498
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,510
I'm drained.

499
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm exhausted.

500
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,980
Oh, my gosh.

501
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,050
How much longer...

502
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,790
Yoon Jae, pull this up for me.

503
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,530
Thanks.

504
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:12,130
- Will that do? - Yes. Thanks.

505
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,699
I think something got in my eye. Blow it out for me.

506
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
- In your eye? - Yes.

507
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:18,740
My eye.

508
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,570
- Again. - Is it gone?

509
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,610
No.

510
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,980
- Blow again. - Open your eyes, then.

511
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,250
- There's something on my cheek too. - Is it gone?

512
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,150
I don't see...

513
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,649
Where did she go,

514
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,390
leaving a fish with the cat?

515
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,319
- What? There's a cat? - I don't see anything.

516
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,390
My gosh.

517
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,190
- What? - Do you see something?

518
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,999
- There's a cat? - Look carefully.

519
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,230
- Where? - You said there was a cat.

520
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,970
I first...

521
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,140
became a man at 40 years old...

522
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,870
and stayed this way.

523
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,480
Your mom was 19 years old then.

524
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,550
It must've been hard on you.

525
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,680
What was your husband like?

526
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,790
My husband?

527
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,060
That word is so awkward to say now.

528
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,760
He was a good man.

529
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,430
When I was a woman, that is.

530
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,900
He was a fisherman. A pretty cool guy.

531
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,770
He was tall and kind.

532
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,540
Your mom is just like her dad.

533
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,680
So can you imagine just how handsome he was?

534
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,080
Yes.

535
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,090
He was such a sweet, kind man.

536
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
And he left.

537
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,660
I don't think we fought about it much.

538
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,800
I explained the situation,

539
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,570
and he honestly said he didn't think he could stay.

540
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,670
I understood.

541
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,610
But...

542
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,780
I'm grateful that he left your mom with me.

543
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,250
I'm thankful to my daughter who stayed as well.

544
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,620
Right.

545
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,860
You asked about my mom.

546
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,960
"The Reed's Greeting," "Sunset Circumstances,"

547
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,230
"The Fast Tortoise." Do you know those poems?

548
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,270
"The Fast Tortoise?"

549
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,170
I think it appeared in the college entrance exam.

550
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,370
Kim Pil Hyun was her name.

551
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,040
Your great-grandmother.

552
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
What?

553
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,880
No way.

554
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,480
My mom had an impressive life as a man.

555
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,980
She had fun.

556
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,520
She enjoyed this strange life.

557
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,590
It's up to you to suffer through or enjoy it.

558
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,530
Just so you know,

559
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,230
I'm trying to enjoy it.

560
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,710
Good for you, Grandma.

561
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,680
Look around you.

562
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,950
Isn't the world...

563
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,420
just too beautiful to live in despair?

564
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,880
Still,

565
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,449
you were born into this family...

566
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,820
and must live a life others can't even imagine.

567
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,990
For that, I'm sorry.

568
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,290
It's not your fault.

569
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,630
Okay, then.

570
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
Hey.

571
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,940
Isn't that your boyfriend?

572
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
What?

573
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,280
How did you know he was my boyfriend?

574
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,220
He told me so.

575
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,690
What? Do you need something?

576
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,690
No. I came to introduce myself.

577
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,530
We did all that already. Is there more to say?

578
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,700
I'm Ji Eun's boyfriend, Park Yoon Jae.

579
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,640
Ji Eun?

580
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,040
Ji Eun's boyfriend?

581
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,579
Then do you know everything?

582
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,850
Yes, I know everything about your family's secret.

583
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,820
Please look kindly upon me. Feel free to ask me to do anything.

584
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,260
He's very handsome.

585
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,360
He's such a decent young man.

586
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,500
Grandpa.

587
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,240
Do me just one favour.

588
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,220
What is it?

589
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Hey.

590
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,730
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

591
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,730
Yoon Jae.

592
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,760
This was what I wanted to tell you.

593
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,430
The thing I've been wanting to tell you.

594
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,840
My grandpa...

595
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,670
The truth is,

596
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,080
he was my grandma.

597
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,450
I only found out a few days ago at my mom's salon.

598
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,249
What?

599
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,950
I figured it'd be better if you saw him instead of me explaining it.

600
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,460
Sorry, Grandpa.

601
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,160
No, don't be. I'm totally fine.

602
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,400
Well, I should let you two talk.

603
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,140
I apologise.

604
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,840
I assumed you were Ji Eun's grandfather since I had no idea.

605
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,140
But I should...

606
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,510
continue to call you "grandpa" in front of the others, right?

607
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,250
What?

608
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,880
Well, yes, I guess.

609
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,350
Hey.

610
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,290
Do you not understand what I'm saying now?

611
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,990
I do.

612
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,319
Your grandfather was actually your grandmother.

613
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,900
No. Don't you understand the intention behind what I'm saying?

614
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,230
Intention?

615
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,960
What is it?

616
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,530
Well, I'll head back, then.

617
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,000
You guys can talk.

618
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,750
To sum it up,

619
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,980
what I wanted to say but couldn't was that...

620
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:16,860
I might never go back to being a woman.

621
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,490
But I really didn't know either.

622
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,399
Had I known about this, I wouldn't have felt so confident...

623
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,560
asking you to stay with me.

624
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,410
All right. We should head back too.

625
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,240
We should go back and wrap it up.

626
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,440
What? "All right, we should head back?"

627
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,780
The work isn't important now.

628
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,150
Then...

629
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,520
what am I supposed to do here?

630
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,420
What?

631
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,759
I mean, obviously...

632
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,030
Do you want me to break up with you?

633
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,630
- What I'm saying is... - You might have your standpoint,

634
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,740
but I have mine too.

635
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,410
Did you think I'd break up with you...

636
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,640
as soon as I heard this?

637
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,879
No, I just...

638
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,450
I mean, I am shocked,

639
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,090
but I don't want to decide anything right now.

640
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,220
I don't even know what to do.

641
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,700
This must've been difficult for you.

642
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,400
Thanks for telling me the truth.

643
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,240
Let's go. I told Grandpa...

644
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,380
I mean, I told Grandma...

645
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,780
I would work hard.

646
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,850
So, just come with me.

647
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,870
Where did Yoon Jae and Ji Hoon go?

648
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,929
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

649
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,400
I'll go look for them.

650
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,140
You're going to slack off too? No way.

651
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,340
- Why? - You little...

652
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,440
- Hey, you guys! - What?

653
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,709
We still have so much work to do. Where have you been?

654
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,780
We just stepped away for a quick chat. Sorry about that.

655
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,919
- Gosh, it hurts! - Hey. Oh, no.

656
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,360
- It hurts! - Take off the glove.

657
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,259
- It hurts. - Are you all right?

658
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,530
No, it hurts.

659
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,560
Oh, no. You should see a doctor.

660
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,630
- Are you all right? - No, it hurts.

661
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,030
Let's go. I'll drive you.

662
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,340
One of you should come with us.

663
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,309
I'll drop you guys off at the hospital and pick you up...

664
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,610
once we wrap up here.

665
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,579
Could you come with me?

666
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,780
- What? - I'll come too.

667
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,309
Why would you go with them too?

668
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,750
If you guys all go, we won't finish this today.

669
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,490
Go with her.

670
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,950
She'll need someone by her side.

671
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,920
You can go.

672
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,060
All right.

673
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,529
- Let's go. - Let's hurry. Come on.

674
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,600
- Let's go. - Oh, boy.

675
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,969
How did that happen?

676
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,539
- I said I wouldn't touch fish. - Are you all right?

677
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,570
Come on. Let's go.

678
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,210
Hurry.

679
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,990
This will sting a little.

680
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,730
It'll be over quickly.

681
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,400
Gosh, it hurts.

682
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,300
Just count to 100.

683
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,030
One,

684
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,170
two...

685
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,810
- Good girl. - Three.

686
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,740
It hurts.

687
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,320
Is your hand okay?

688
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,380
It's still throbbing.

689
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,450
You should've been careful.

690
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,730
I only did it because I was annoyed you kept helping just Ji Hoon.

691
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,859
What?

692
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,060
He's much taller and stronger than I am.

693
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,300
But you're always looking out for Ji Hoon, never me.

694
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,870
All right.

695
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,440
If you need my help, just say so. I'll help you too.

696
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,480
Can't you please look at me?

697
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,750
I know you're not with your girlfriend anymore.

698
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,920
I don't know what happened, but you're not together now.

699
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,620
I don't think this is something I should discuss with you.

700
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,260
Fine, then I'll just talk about myself.

701
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,000
I like you.

702
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,499
I've had feelings for you since freshman year,

703
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
way before you met your girlfriend.

704
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
I meant to tell you how I felt after my exchange program ended.

705
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,510
That was my plan, but...

706
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,749
I never imagined, not even in my dreams,

707
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,250
that you'd date someone else, and not me.

708
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,560
You had feelings for me too.

709
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,359
We always pulled all-nighters studying, shared meals,

710
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,060
and checked out exhibitions together.

711
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,659
That was just because we were close friends...

712
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,060
with similar interests.

713
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,900
You really never felt romantically attracted to me?

714
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,000
That's right.

715
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,610
- You're lying. - I'm telling you the truth.

716
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,820
Let's go!

717
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,650
We're here.

718
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,990
Hey.

719
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,560
Are you okay? Did the doctor say it was serious?

720
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,890
I'm okay.

721
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,300
I guess I gave you guys quite a scare.

722
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,430
I got five stitches, but I'm totally fine now.

723
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,039
Sorry for worrying you, sir.

724
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,570
Gosh, don't say that.

725
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,170
Try to keep it dry...

726
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,669
and apply ointment regularly to prevent scarring.

727
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,680
- Will do. - My goodness.

728
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,139
You Seoul students came to visit Grandpa...

729
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,750
but ended up doing tough work and going through all that stress.

730
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,649
Hey, thanks for your help.

731
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,519
Oh, sure thing, sir. I'll be off, then.

732
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,750
- Thank you. - Thank you.

733
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,020
Oh, right.

734
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,560
Sorry about earlier.

735
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,590
For interrupting your kiss.

736
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,660
Good night.

737
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,240
Oh, right. You guys said you wanted marshmallows.

738
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,250
I'll go get some firewood.

739
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,530
Did you two kiss?

740
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,700
What? Answer my question.

741
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,530
Did you two kiss?

742
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,039
Hey, Park Yoon Jae.

743
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,940
Why should we tell you that?

744
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:48,610
"We?"

745
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,850
Sorry.

746
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,080
Should we chill by the fire together?

747
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:57,620
I feel hot.

748
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,190
- I feel hot! - Hey.

749
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,250
I'm really hot right now.

750
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,870
Do you need a hand?

751
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,810
No, I'm good.

752
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,110
Let's talk.

753
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,980
Yes, talk.

754
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,650
So...

755
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,690
I don't know where to begin to explain this,

756
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,530
but that wasn't a lie.

757
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,000
It did happen, but...

758
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,429
- I mean... - If what I think is true,

759
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,370
Kang Min Joo probably just kissed you out of nowhere.

760
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,710
You didn't see it coming, so what were you supposed to do?

761
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,540
I get it.

762
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,050
You should just get mad at me...

763
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,390
like Kim Ji Eun would.

764
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,460
Hey.

765
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,400
Could you do that if you were me?

766
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,340
Would you be able to?

767
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,270
It's clear to everyone that I'm not Ji Eun.

768
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,440
How can I behave like her while looking like this?

769
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,910
Do it. Just go for it!

770
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,409
Don't hold back, at least when you're with me.

771
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,680
But I feel most self-conscious around you.

772
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,650
What?

773
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,220
Honestly, I feel most self-conscious around you.

774
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,870
I didn't realise I made you feel that way.

775
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,440
- It must be stressful for you. - Pardon?

776
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,609
It's a big deal even for an ordinary man and woman...

777
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,010
to date.

778
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,219
There are a lot more burden that come with this. Am I wrong?

779
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,320
Oh, no.

780
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,850
Ji Eun has it much harder. I'm totally fine.

781
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,290
No, you can't be fine with this.

782
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,500
You don't have to lie to me, you know.

783
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,130
No, I really am...

784
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,300
The truth is,

785
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,070
it is a bit stressful.

786
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,850
I'm at a loss for what to do to help Ji Eun.

787
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,950
Don't help her at all.

788
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,320
Just focus on your own life.

789
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,189
- Pardon me? - That's what's best...

790
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,690
for both you and Ji Eun.

791
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,959
Happiness built on someone's sacrifice...

792
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,530
can't last long.

793
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,330
You're...

794
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,700
not meant to live your life making sacrifices for Ji Eun.

795
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,670
If you do that, she'll end up being the reason...

796
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:45,740
behind every crisis you face in life.

797
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,220
And that will make her incredibly miserable.

798
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,820
Right.

799
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,820
All right.

800
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,590
Anyway, thank you.

801
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,360
For staying by Ji Eun's side during the most difficult time in her life.

802
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,230
There are so many stars!

803
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,430
Hey, Park Yoon Jae. Look at that.

804
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,500
What's that moving star?

805
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,270
That's an airplane.

806
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,700
Oh, is it?

807
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,330
It's fine.

808
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,330
Just wear it.

809
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,310
I'll use this.

810
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,720
Hey, guys.

811
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,419
Look at the stars in the sky. Aren't they beautiful?

812
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,820
There are so many!

813
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,490
My first love was named Byeol, like the word for "star."

814
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,469
You always bring up the most irrelevant things.

815
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,669
First love, all of a sudden?

816
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,770
Why? This is the perfect time and place for that topic.

817
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,110
Isn't that what people usually talk about around the campfire?

818
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,579
People also talk about their parents by the campfire,

819
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,610
and then they break down in tears.

820
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,849
So? You've made up your mind to go...

821
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,020
to Corning University, right?

822
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,130
- No. - No?

823
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,259
The Department of Astronomy at Corning University in the US.

824
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,029
It's like a dream come true for people like us.

825
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,140
- Let's talk about it later. - Why later?

826
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,410
Since this topic has come up, let's ask for their opinion.

827
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,870
Hey, Ji Hoon.

828
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,369
Imagine Yu Ri got an offer...

829
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,539
from a world-famous writer to collaborate on a project...

830
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,680
that will take three years.

831
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,679
She'd be able to read every book in the world...

832
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,280
and debate with some of the greatest authors.

833
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:38,950
Wouldn't you let her go?

834
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,650
What?

835
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,449
Why ask him by using me as an example?

836
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:44,520
What?

837
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,430
Aren't you guys together?

838
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,069
Didn't I tell you that we broke up?

839
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,130
What?

840
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,240
You guys broke up, yet you still came here together?

841
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,470
I mean, we were close friends to begin with.

842
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,410
Isn't this how people in Gen MZ...

843
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,650
usually do things these days? Right?

844
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,510
Right, sure.

845
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,050
I feel like Gen MZ is the most abused label.

846
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,420
Sorry, guys.

847
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:19,790
I'm going to bed.

848
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,970
I'm tired too.

849
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,770
- I'm heading in too. - What?

850
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,010
Nothing's going my way.

851
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:38,380
Darn, on this happy day.

852
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,009
What's up with everyone?

853
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,580
No idea.

854
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,380
They're driving me nuts.

855
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,650
Oh, no. My eyes are burning.

856
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:52,790
Are you all right?

857
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:56,960
Goodness.

858
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,330
Hey, my eyes hurt.

859
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,130
- Are you okay? - Can you blow on my eyes?

860
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,969
So? You've made up your mind to go...

861
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,210
to Corning University, right?

862
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,480
- No. - No?

863
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,779
The Department of Astronomy at Corning University in the US.

864
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,879
It's like a dream come true for people like us.

865
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,380
Let's talk about it later.

866
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,690
I was just thinking I wanted to see you,

867
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:31,860
and here you are.

868
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,930
Min Hyuk snores like crazy.

869
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,200
You have that problem too?

870
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,270
It's the same situation in the girls' room.

871
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,100
I got annoyed, so I came out.

872
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,370
I guess they were all exhausted.

873
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,380
The stars look so beautiful.

874
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,150
I know, right?

875
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,880
There are so many stars out right now.

876
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,390
Hey.

877
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,660
Can I ask why you're feeling torn and thinking about...

878
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,000
giving up on going to the US?

879
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,610
You went silent again.

880
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,310
So, it's not about your family or money.

881
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,010
Here's my guess.

882
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,650
It's probably something to do with your love life.

883
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,420
Is your girlfriend terminally ill or something?

884
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,320
Is she dying?

885
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,889
Or is she acting immature,

886
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:44,400
putting her love against your dream?

887
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,430
Don't jump to conclusions.

888
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:57,210
So, it is because of your girlfriend.

889
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,850
No.

890
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,720
It's because of me.

891
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
Yoon Jae.

892
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,429
If she truly loves you,

893
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,560
she'll stand by you and encourage you to follow your dreams.

894
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,730
Are you not even getting the treatment you deserve from her?

895
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,000
Let's drop this.

896
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,070
There's one thing I know for sure.

897
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:07,540
At least in this very moment, no one cares about you...

898
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,410
more deeply than me on this planet.

899
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,610
Who are you?

900
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,510
Hey.

901
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,710
Hi.

902
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,020
Sorry I'm late.

903
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:06,400
(Special thanks to Yoon Joo Sang)

904
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,040
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

905
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,540
Yoon Jae's girlfriend, right?

906
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,070
Where is Ji Hoon?

907
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,209
The important thing now is that Kim Ji Eun,

908
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,880
Park Yoon Jae's girlfriend, has returned.

909
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,950
Am I the only one who thinks this is weird?

910
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,579
Something tells me...

911
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:56,620
tonight will be unforgettable.

912
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,260
The final face-off is today?

913
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,189
Are you sure you can keep a secret?

914
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,930
Ji Eun. Ji Hoon. The truth is...

915
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,600
Reveal yourself.
