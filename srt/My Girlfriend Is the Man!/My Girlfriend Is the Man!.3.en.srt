00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,590
No way.

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,300
It's really Ji Eun.

8
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Ji Eun.

9
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,290
Ji Eun.

10
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,760
She's burning up.

11
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,410
What? What's going on?

12
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,759
Min Hyuk. I'll explain everything later.

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm sorry!

14
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,430
Are you Ms. Kim Ji Eun's guardian?

15
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,229
- Yes, that's me. - All right. Let's see.

16
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,770
Her blood work and CT scan look normal.

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,370
Well, nothing seems out of the ordinary.

18
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,079
Her fever is dropping thanks to the IV drip.

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,210
You can take her home as soon as she wakes up.

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,880
Doctor, wait. You're sure there's nothing wrong with her?

21
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,280
Yes, she's fine.

22
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,790
Ji Eun.

23
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,690
Are you awake?

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Yoon Jae?

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,970
Why am I in a hospital?

26
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,610
Ji Eun. Everything is okay. Yes.

27
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,940
You became a woman again.

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,950
What?

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,659
Everything is fine. Okay?

30
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,390
- Get her a psychiatric consult. - Okay.

31
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,560
- I'm really back to being a woman? - Yes.

32
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,360
- Doctor, thank you. - Yes?

33
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,000
- Thank you. - Don't mention it. Congratulations.

34
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,630
- Gosh. - Ji Eun.

35
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,139
- I'm really a woman again. - Yes.

(Episode 3: The Selfish Gene)

37
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,979
I haven't told my sister yet.

38
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,350
She'll be surprised no matter what, right?

39
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,780
Even I can't still believe it.

40
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,080
I bet you can't either, Yoon Jae.

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,190
By the way, why are you so quiet?

42
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,690
What? Hold on.

43
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,590
I think my screen froze.

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,389
I'll call you later.

45
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,300
No, it didn't freeze.

46
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,899
What? Why are you just staring at me? You're acting weird.

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm just happy to be looking at you.

48
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,310
We were together until just a moment ago.

49
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,910
No.

50
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,940
I can totally understand that.

51
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,480
Yoon Jae. Can I come inside?

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,090
Hold on. I'll call you later.

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,150
Okay.

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,990
Yes, come in.

55
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,290
My gosh.

56
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,800
Did you finally learn to knock?

57
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,530
I don't believe this.

58
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,640
Who were you talking to? You're smiling.

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,370
Why do you want to know?

60
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,440
Well,

61
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,310
that's because I'm your only sibling.

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,550
Listen, Yoon Jae.

63
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,850
I'll support you no matter whom you love.

64
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,590
- What? - No love is wrong in this world.

65
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,589
It's only different.

66
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,390
What's gotten into you?

67
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,530
I'm sorry for overstepping. I was clueless.

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,170
Hey, let go of my pants. Let go.

69
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,870
Hang in there, Yoon Jae!

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,809
Hey, get off me!

71
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,510
Hey. Stop hugging me.

72
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,980
Ji Hye.

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,880
Okay.

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,250
- My gosh. - She's so mean.

75
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,749
Here you go.

76
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,889
- I thought you'd never get married. - That's crazy.

77
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,189
I see. So this is your wedding venue.

78
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,420
- Their parking space is nice. - Parking space is important.

79
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
By the way,

80
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,430
are you dating anyone, Ji Hye?

81
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,970
Right. You've been single for quite a long time.

82
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,199
- We're getting old. You know? - I feel bad that...

83
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,900
you'll catch my bouquet when you're not dating anyone.

84
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,580
Actually, I am dating someone.

85
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,950
- Really? - Yes. Of course.

86
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,350
I don't buy it.

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,349
- Show us his picture. - Yes.

88
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,780
My gosh. I guess you've been lied to all your lives.

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
- Picture? - Yes.

90
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,430
Right.

91
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,070
Here.

92
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,970
There you go.

93
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,340
- What? - Gosh.

94
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,829
He looks like an idol star. How old is he?

95
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,830
When did you meet him?

96
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,530
We met a long time ago.

97
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,630
And we started dating.

98
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,070
This is amazing.

99
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,370
Who knew you had such good game, Ji Hye?

100
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,099
But how come you didn't take any pictures together?

101
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,110
How sharp.

102
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,880
You know that I don't like to take pictures.

103
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,310
That's fishy. Call him.

104
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,779
- What? - Yes, call him.

105
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,850
Why don't you video call him if you can?

106
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,090
Yes, that's a good idea.

107
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,159
Video call him?

108
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,190
Just for a minute.

109
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,490
- Let me ask him. - Okay.

110
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,500
Go ahead and eat.

111
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,530
Where are you guys going for your honeymoon?

112
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,829
- We're going to Africa. - Africa?

113
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,369
(My Sister)

114
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,699
That suits you guys.

115
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,210
Why Africa?

116
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,709
You guys are clueless.

117
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,839
People go to Africa a lot these days.

118
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
- Video call me. - Really?

119
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,049
Am I the only one who hasn't been there?

120
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,280
You haven't been there?

121
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,920
He's calling me. Look.

122
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,519
Hey, honey. I told you...

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,419
I was meeting up with my college friends today.

124
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,759
Say hello to them.

125
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,559
- Hello. - Ta-da.

126
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,629
I'm back!

127
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm a woman again!

128
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,600
- Wait. - What?

129
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,299
- Hey. - It still feels surreal.

130
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,370
But I'm so happy.

131
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,439
I peed in the bathroom just now.

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,210
I got so emotional that I almost cried.

133
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,140
Living with me must've been uncomfortable for you.

134
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,540
I'll be really good to you now.

135
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,150
I love you.

136
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,480
Bye.

137
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,420
My gosh.

138
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,049
You know what? I guess this is a new kind of scam.

139
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,120
Right, girls?

140
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,830
Sorry. I'm just so shocked.

141
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,549
Ji Hye! Your lovely sister is back!

142
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,480
Get lost!

143
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
My gosh.

144
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,090
(My Yoon Jae)

145
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,960
We talked all night last night.

146
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,379
I'm taking a bath right now. So I can't video call you now.

147
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,409
(My Ji Eun)

148
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,020
(I'm taking a bath right now. So I can't video call you now.)

149
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,660
My gosh.

150
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,510
Thank you.

151
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,070
Thank you.

152
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,060
Thank you!

153
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,330
Yes.

154
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,830
Come at me!

155
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,650
- What? - Just give me three seconds.

156
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,460
Could you get out of my way if you're satisfied?

157
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,060
I knew it. The deity does exist.

158
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,670
Starting now, I'm open to believing anything. Proven or not.

159
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,339
The Almighty, Buddha, aliens, and so on.

160
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,370
I'll believe in everything.

161
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,769
Yes. Believing in something will be better than having no faith.

162
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,310
Don't you miss the days when you were a guy?

163
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,749
What? Like do I miss the days when you devoured me...

164
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,450
- with your eyes every day? - When did I do that?

165
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,819
You just didn't touch me.

166
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,550
But you practically undressed me dozens of times with your eyes.

167
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,150
My gosh. Unbelievable.

168
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,260
You're ridiculous. When did I do that?

169
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,430
My goodness.

170
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,829
That's just absurd. Oh, my.

171
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,260
(Help us keep the street in Noryangjin clean.)

172
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,500
It's you, Young Seok. Thanks.

173
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,070
- Did you eat? - I'm on my way to eat.

174
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Thanks for asking.

175
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,670
Hello.

176
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
Hey, it's been a while.

177
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,410
Bye.

178
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,680
Hello.

179
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,649
- Hello, Young Seok. - Hi.

180
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,920
Young Seok. Have a yogurt drink.

181
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,420
Gosh, thank you. You didn't have to.

182
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,590
- Thank you. Bye. - Sure. Bye.

183
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
(Gosi Udon)

184
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:07,890
- Hey, that's all right. - I got it.

185
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,230
My goodness. I told you I got it.

186
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,869
Leave the heavy things outside.

187
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,270
I'll bring them in whenever I come around.

188
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,739
You should try to get yourself out of this neighborhood.

189
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,639
How much longer will you stay here?

190
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,810
Do you like me that much?

191
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,240
Mark my word.

192
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,380
This will be the last year you see me...

193
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,079
in this street of Noryangjin.

194
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,380
My gosh. That's what you said last year too.

195
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,019
And the year before that and the one before that.

196
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,250
You said that practically every year.

197
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,420
How come you never change?

198
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,130
Sit down. I'll fry up a pork cutlet for you.

199
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,290
My gosh.

200
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,870
Hello, Jeong Ja. I'm about to have my meal.

201
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,740
What? You're in Noryangjin now?

202
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,950
(Salt-Grilled Meat)

203
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,180
Here you go.

204
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,790
Oh, wait.

205
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll stick with this.

206
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,369
You can't hold down your liquor?

207
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,500
Alcohol affects my studies.

208
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,269
So I stopped drinking.

209
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,270
I see.

210
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,079
Did you say you've been studying to be a civil servant for a decade?

211
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,040
To be precise, it's been 7 years and 8 months.

212
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,510
I plan to pass the exam this year no matter what.

213
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,590
Young Seok. You seem to live diligently with a clear goal...

214
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,460
and a sense of confidence.

215
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,190
I envy you.

216
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,160
My gosh.

217
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,760
You're indirectly telling me that you find me pathetic, right?

218
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,030
I'm not that smart.

219
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,440
I envy people who live diligently.

220
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,880
That's a real-life skill and a gift.

221
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:07,110
I've never had a single diligent moment in my life.

222
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,650
Except for the moments when I drink.

223
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,160
Don't just drink. Have the meat too.

224
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,630
You'll have a nasty hangover.

225
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,100
Are you...

226
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,970
usually this nice to just any woman?

227
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,570
You and I had a blind date together.

228
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
You're not just any woman.

229
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,800
A blind date is nothing.

230
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,280
It can't be your first blind date anyway.

231
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,610
You're old enough to have had more.

232
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,510
No comment.

233
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,720
Hearing that now...

234
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,050
is scaring me a bit.

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,460
- Wait. - My gosh.

236
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,770
From now on, I'm going to pour the drink for you.

237
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,120
Suit yourself.

238
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,990
Do you like...

239
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
braised monkfish?

240
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,630
Unbelievable. My goodness.

241
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,930
This stinks.

242
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,099
There are two of you living in the house.

243
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,269
But look at the fridge.

244
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,369
Mom. You know that...

245
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,309
going through other people's fridge is rude, right?

246
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,310
Right.

247
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,550
Are you telling me I'm just a stranger to you?

248
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,880
You, 22 hours.

249
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
You, 15 hours. That's how long it took me to give birth to you.

250
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,719
Am I still a stranger?

251
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
Ji Hye. Why would you say that?

252
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
What?

253
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,429
- Honey. - Yes?

254
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,789
- Let's start from here. - Okay.

255
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,800
Okay.

256
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,800
- I'll wash this in the bathroom. - Okay.

257
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,270
My goodness.

258
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,770
My gosh.

259
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,250
- Dad. - Dad.

260
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,479
You should've kept the house clean. You're all grown up now, princesses.

261
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,449
You should've given us a heads-up if you were coming.

262
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,749
We would've cleaned then.

263
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,960
That's why I didn't. So I could do it for you.

264
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,560
I missed you so much, Dad.

265
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,229
You're sleeping over tonight, right?

266
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,699
It's your day off today.

267
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,300
I'd love to.

268
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,629
But we have appointments in the afternoon.

269
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,839
So we must open the salon later.

270
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,799
- Tell Mom to go alone. - Should I?

271
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,809
- Yes. - Yes. What will you do there?

272
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,810
Let's tell her then.

273
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,540
Don't move.

274
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,130
What?

275
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,630
We're all grown up. We are adults too.

276
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,900
Finding stuff like that here is perfectly normal.

277
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,170
It's fine. There's nothing wrong with that.

278
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,940
But he shaves and leaves behind his underwear...

279
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,139
in my daughters' house. So I ought to know...

280
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,580
who this bold guy is.

281
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,980
Is it the guy whose pictures are all over your room?

282
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,320
Gosh, no.

283
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,790
Yoon Jae is a pure-hearted guy.

284
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,290
Then he must be your guy.

285
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Who is he?

286
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,659
Since she found everything, let's just tell her the truth.

287
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,329
What are you talking about? No.

288
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,670
What is it? Tell me now.

289
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,969
Mom. Let me tell you what really happened.

290
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,110
- A while ago, she turned... - My gosh.

291
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,210
They belong to her boyfriend.

292
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,819
- Is that true? - Yes.

293
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,880
Do they really belong to your boyfriend?

294
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,120
Boyfriend?

295
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,619
Now that they know, show them some pictures.

296
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,060
You have so many pictures of him on your phone.

297
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,029
Yes. My dear eldest daughter,

298
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,660
let me see some pictures of your boyfriend.

299
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,470
I've never seen him before. So I'm very curious.

300
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,910
If I find any more of that stuff in your house again,

301
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,140
then...

302
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,139
tell him to come see me...

303
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,279
- after booking a wedding venue. - Okay.

304
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,609
Don't skip your meals.

305
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,610
Make sure to call us if something happens.

306
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,079
- You should go now. - I packed side dishes for Yu Ri.

307
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,150
Don't forget to give them to her.

308
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,990
Ji Hye.

309
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,240
Open the door while I'm still being civil.

310
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,339
I can't let Mom and Dad worry!

311
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,509
Then you should've told them they belonged to Yoon Jae.

312
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,569
Why sell me out?

313
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,040
I can't let them think he's got a dirty mind!

314
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,979
Then it's okay for them to think I have a dirty mind?

315
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,080
Open the door now.

316
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,779
I never said you could take pictures of me. You're getting punished!

317
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,380
- What's wrong with you? - What?

318
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,950
Hey!

319
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,750
My gosh. After turning into a man, you've gotten so strong.

320
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,019
- Gosh, come on. - Oh, my.

321
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,260
Okay. So this is how you want to play? Move!

322
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,899
- Come on, that's enough. - Hey! Mom! She's so strong.

323
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,960
What am I going to do?

324
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,610
Why won't you tell Mom and Dad about what happened?

325
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,510
- What do you mean? - That you turned into a man.

326
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,609
You're a woman again.

327
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,810
So it wouldn't matter if you told them.

328
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,930
If someone has to go through it, I'd rather it be me,

329
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,160
not my girls.

330
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,910
I'm back to my old self. So I don't have to tell them.

331
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,610
Why make them worry about something that already happened?

332
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,080
It won't happen again.

333
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,550
I see.

334
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,190
What happened?

335
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,590
Ta-da!

336
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
Watch.

337
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,500
This is the last time.

338
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:44,140
Spoon worm.

339
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,750
You've gone mad.

340
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,290
Cross.

341
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,000
Does our boss come from an affluent family?

342
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,270
Or is she a divorced woman with a massive alimony?

343
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,440
- What? - Think about it. It makes no sense.

344
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,679
All she does at her own cafe is sigh.

345
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,909
Then she spends money at other cafes.

346
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,149
She doesn't seem to care whether or not her cafe is making money.

347
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,619
But she's covered in luxury brands and drives a convertible.

348
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,479
Hey, we're part-timers.

349
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,949
We should only care about getting paid on time.

350
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,890
Why do you want to know about her financial status?

351
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Or could she be...

352
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,230
a building owner?

353
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,490
Or the daughter of a building owner?

354
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,899
Hey, stop making wild guesses.

355
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,930
Let's get to work.

356
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,800
We have no work to do here.

357
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,170
Right.

358
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,909
Could it be another double yolk?

359
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,910
(My Ji Eun)

360
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,510
- I'm scared for some reason. - "Could it be?"

361
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,850
It's those uncertain hunches that turn out to be true.

362
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,490
Seriously. She might be the building owner.

363
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,090
Those uncertain hunches...

364
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,320
could turn out to be true.

365
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,260
Could it be that...

366
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,800
she turns into a man again because of the double yolk?

367
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,530
I cracked an egg so I could add it to my ramyeon.

368
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,400
It was another double yolk.

369
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,870
Then...

370
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,540
I became a man again.

371
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,450
Yoon Jae, are you okay?

372
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,520
You're coming over now? Aren't you working at the cafe?

373
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
My gosh.

374
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,560
Yes. I'll be there soon. So wait for me.

375
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm buying a lot of food. So don't eat anything else.

376
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,930
I'll take tteokbokki, sundae, and dumplings for to go.

377
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,970
You said flour wasn't healthy.

378
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,840
Aren't dumplings and tteokbokki made of flour?

379
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,920
Oh, this? This tteokbokki was made with rice cakes.

380
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,890
As for the dumplings, just have the stuffing.

381
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,930
My gosh. Look at you sweating.

382
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,860
You fool.

383
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,930
I couldn't have turned into a man because of an egg.

384
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,140
So you knew?

385
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,510
Was it that awful...

386
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,140
when I turned into a man?

387
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,950
After becoming your guy friend, I had some fun moments with you.

388
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,480
I wouldn't say it was awful.

389
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
No.

390
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,450
I'm sorry.

391
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,360
No. I should apologize.

392
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,700
Thank you.

393
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,600
And I love you.

394
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,810
That day,

395
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,910
because we didn't know...

396
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,880
how to fill in the space between the past us...

397
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,850
and the present us,

398
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,190
we held each other and kissed.

399
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,630
We kind of missed our short but powerful...

400
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,630
memories of the past.

401
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,160
We were fortunate it was short,

402
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,730
and therefore, it became a comma...

403
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,970
and not a full stop in our relationship.

404
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,940
That's how we comforted each other.

405
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,770
We had no idea how many things...

406
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,140
Sleep well.

407
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,280
- were awaiting us... - Were awaiting us...

408
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,580
- in the future. - in the future.

409
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,720
Yes.

410
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,520
How do I feel?

411
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,190
I'm fine.

412
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,890
I'm almost there.

413
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,930
Yes.

414
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,530
Yoon Jae.

415
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,170
I missed you.

416
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,340
- When did you fly back? - A week ago.

417
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,470
- Are you doing well? - Yes. I missed you.

418
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,980
I was going to call you.

419
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,710
What do you do today. How about...

420
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,520
- You're here. - Yes.

421
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,090
- Who's she? - Right.

422
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,620
Say hi.

423
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,530
My girlfriend Kim Ji Eun.

424
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,230
She's Kang Min Joo, a junior.

425
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,130
- Hello. I'm Kim Ji... - Yoon Jae.

426
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,870
You got yourself a girlfriend while I was away?

427
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,540
You couldn't wait just one year until I got back?

428
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,340
Is that true?

429
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,879
- No. - I told everyone...

430
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,810
that you were mine before I left.

431
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,350
How could you?

432
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,650
Hey.

433
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,450
You didn't call dibs on me.

434
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,990
What are you talking about?

435
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,960
You know our department's getting together this Friday, right?

436
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,290
It'll double as my welcome party, so be there.

437
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,630
It's at Star Club near the entrance of Yeonhee University.

438
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,230
If you don't come, I'll call until you do.

439
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,070
- A club? - What?

440
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,770
It's a Department of Astronomy gathering.

441
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,480
- We sometimes... - You did nothing wrong.

442
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,880
Why are you so antsy?

443
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,780
You can come too if you're free.

444
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,220
Though I don't think you'll like it.

445
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,660
That was a department secret.

446
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,270
See you on Friday.

447
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,240
Darn it.

448
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,480
Ji Eun.

449
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,150
Ji Eun!

450
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,890
Ji Eun!

451
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,290
Ji Eun.

452
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,160
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

453
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,720
- Let go. - It's not okay, is it?

454
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,529
I don't know what happened, but...

455
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,090
- Min Joo. - Wait up.

456
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,960
That girl. Is she Yoon Jae's girlfriend?

457
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,999
Yes. They've dated for a while.

458
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,870
- Forget it. I'm leaving. - He only hangs out with her.

459
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,269
- So they're for real? - Ji Eun.

460
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,270
Yes.

461
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,840
Whatever.

462
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,170
Ji Eun.

463
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,979
Oh, you said you didn't want to go clubbing on Friday...

464
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,310
or have a welcome-back party.

465
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,079
How about you and I go see a musical instead?

466
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,380
When did I say I didn't want to go?

467
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,750
I'll be there.

468
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,750
- But you just told me... - I changed my mind.

469
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,019
I suddenly want to go clubbing.

470
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,059
(Yeonhee University)

471
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,130
Come on.

472
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,430
I'll come all dressed up. You should be there too.

473
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,200
Okay.

474
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,780
Ji Eun.

475
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,380
Why don't you just drink beer?

476
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,980
My dad told me not to drink alcohol when I'm angry.

477
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,680
What's that department secret?

478
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,720
Oh, that?

479
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,460
I was so flustered, I didn't hear her properly.

480
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,090
Don't mind it.

481
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,030
Give a beer.

482
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,699
- No, two beers! - My gosh.

483
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,270
This looks deliciously fried.

484
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,770
Here's a drumstick. Enjoy.

485
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,540
You eat it since you called dibs.

486
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,980
Hey.

487
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,579
You study Korean Literature.

488
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,250
Don't you know what idioms are?

489
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,109
She didn't call dibs on me.

490
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,480
I guess something is up.

491
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,619
She's known to crack silly jokes...

492
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,290
and get along with everyone.

493
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,420
She's loud and cheerful, but she's not a bad person...

494
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,830
Are you defending her right now?

495
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,600
Ji Eun. You know I have a weak heart.

496
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,500
Be gentle.

497
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,870
So what? You'll go clubbing on Friday?

498
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,900
No. I won't go.

499
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,739
I won't even go to paradise if you tell me not to.

500
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,210
No. You should go.

501
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,880
You must go clubbing on Friday, okay?

502
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,400
This?

503
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,770
What are you doing?

504
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,010
Ta-da.

505
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,350
What? You don't like it?

506
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,660
What about this?

507
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,560
- No. - Not this either?

508
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,700
No way.

509
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,930
This?

510
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,499
Why does it look like you're taking a bubble bath?

511
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,810
Do you have to go clubbing?

512
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,210
A bubble bath?

513
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,380
What about this? Ji Hye?

514
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,780
What is wrong with you?

515
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,550
Hey, Ji Hye.

516
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,520
Ji Hye.

517
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,290
Oh, pass. Will you stop it?

518
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,860
Kim Ji Hye. Take a good look.

519
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,130
This is torture. Stop it.

520
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Ji Hye.

521
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,530
Will you stop it already?

522
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,710
- How's this? - Hey.

523
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,680
Simple is best.

524
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,479
This look suits you perfectly.

525
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,020
- Is it okay? - Come here.

526
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,850
Your lips.

527
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,150
Smush them together. Okay.

528
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Let's see.

529
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,330
Not bad.

530
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,230
- Thanks. - Now go.

531
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,970
I'll kill you all.

532
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,070
The person you have reached...

533
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,540
Yoon Jae!

534
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,850
- Yoon Jae. - Hey.

535
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,379
You made it.

536
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,079
- I knew you'd come. - Yes.

537
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
- Let's go inside. - Okay.

538
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,120
Everyone's waiting.

539
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,520
We actually placed a bet...

540
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,620
as to whether you'd come or not.

541
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,689
- Only I said you'd come. - Hey.

542
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,360
We'll get free drinks all night.

543
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,200
- Let's go. - No.

544
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,600
I'll wait here for my girlfriend.

545
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,700
I see.

546
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,970
She said she'd come?

547
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,940
Yes. She said she would.

548
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,440
She'll come in when she gets here or call you.

549
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,050
- Let's go inside. - What? Hey.

550
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,680
But...

551
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,139
- Min Joo. - Min Joo.

552
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,840
- Hi. - Hey, Min Joo.

553
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,480
- Gosh. - Park Yoon Jae.

554
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,550
You never joined when I invited you,

555
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,320
but one invite from Min Joo and you're here?

556
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,450
It's not like that.

557
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,989
I need to use the restroom.

558
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,290
Okay. It's over there.

559
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,490
He's embarrassed.

560
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,360
What's going on between you two?

561
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,160
You're so cruel.

562
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,170
(My Ji Eun)

563
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,340
I'm loving my drink.

564
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,940
- Isn't it nice? - Shall I order more?

565
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,340
I had no idea...

566
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,209
that Yoon Jae would come because I invited him.

567
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,980
He's a guy after all.

568
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,150
He knows you're pretty.

569
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,150
Didn't he say he had a girlfriend?

570
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,779
Hey, didn't you see him...

571
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,420
walk in arm-in-arm with Min Joo?

572
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,849
- It's game over. - What?

573
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,090
(My Yoon Jae)

574
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,459
Why? What is it? What's wrong?

575
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,690
Oh, my gosh!

576
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,100
Why haven't you changed yet?

577
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,970
What should I do now?

578
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,500
Oh, dear...

579
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,010
I don't know either.

580
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,280
I took a pill to calm my nerves too.

581
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,249
Yoon Jae went clubbing with that vixen.

582
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,979
Hey, that's the problem right now?

583
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,480
That is the problem right now!

584
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,290
I have no time to waste.

585
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,290
Hi, Min Hyuk, it's me.

586
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,290
I need to ask for a favor.

587
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,430
Are you free right now?

588
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,959
- Cheers. - Cheers.

589
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,699
Drink up. Cheers.

590
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,330
- Bottoms up! - Drink!

591
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,300
- Come on. - Drink up.

592
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,310
- Cheers. - Cheers.

593
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,310
Drink until you die.

594
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,820
- Cheers! - Cheers!

595
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,689
I feel better now.

596
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,630
Ji Eun. Did something happen to you?

597
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,699
We have two more...

598
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,370
(Ji Eun. Did something happen to you?)

599
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,929
- You got it? - Yes.

600
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,470
I missed you a great deal, but I guess you didn't.

601
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,570
- I'm happy to see you. - Are you sure?

602
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,740
- I'm so upset. - Hey.

603
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,180
I can't reach my girlfriend.

604
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,580
Sorry.

605
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,220
If you're sorry, drink this.

606
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,829
Come on. Drink up.

607
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,030
Yes. Cheers.

608
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,330
Hey!

609
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,400
Hi.

610
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,840
Let's go.

611
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,770
Let's drink!

612
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,009
My gosh.

613
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,249
- Glasses, please. - Gosh...

614
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,480
- Hey. - Glasses, please.

615
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,379
- No thanks. - Drink.

616
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,579
- Come on. - Cheers.

617
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,119
- Cheers. - Let's drink.

618
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,150
Go on.

619
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,530
I won't kill you.

620
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,530
Dance with me instead.

621
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,270
Okay?

622
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,800
What?

623
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,370
You're adorable. Come with me.

624
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,550
You're so cute.

625
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,610
You're adorable.

626
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,090
What are you doing?

627
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,060
Hey, you. You are Kang Min Joo, right?

628
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,000
Lee Min Hyuk.

629
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,570
Hey, do you know her too?

630
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,570
Is he your friend?

631
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,640
Then can you tell your friend to let go of my hand?

632
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,790
What is Park Yoon Jae doing? My gosh.

633
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,970
- Yoon Jae. - Park Yoon Jae!

634
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,840
What?

635
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,580
I'm sorry. My bad!

636
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,410
Sorry. I apologize...

637
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,650
I'm here.

638
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,090
But why are you here?

639
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,190
I mean, why... Again?

640
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,770
Sorry. This happened.

641
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,430
Hey.

642
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,970
It's been a while.

643
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,940
It's good to see you again!

644
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,340
Hey.

645
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Let's...

646
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,210
Hey, let's dance.

647
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,120
What, Lee Min Hyuk?

648
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,250
You're here too?

649
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,560
Hey, the three of us should dance together.

650
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,200
Goodness. Don't do that.

651
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,470
Hey, give me your hand.

652
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,630
Hand!

653
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,440
Good boy.

654
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,070
You're really drunk. Let's get out of here.

655
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,280
No!

656
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,909
- Go straight ahead! - My goodness.

657
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,580
- What on earth happened? - Make a right!

658
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,949
- I'm home! - What happened to him?

659
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,050
Oh, Eun Sook Bear.

660
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,790
Il Jo Bear is here too.

661
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,360
Who are you?

662
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,600
I'm sorry. Yoon Jae is quite drunk.

663
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,159
This world makes it tough to stay sober.

664
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,430
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

665
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,339
This way. Come this way. Be careful.

666
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,140
- My goodness. - Be careful.

667
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,510
- Oh, boy. - My gosh.

668
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,680
Goodness. Thank you.

669
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,940
Hey.

670
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,350
What?

671
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,090
Am I in space?

672
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,360
Floating in zero gravity?

673
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm in space!

674
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm floating out here.

675
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,770
I'm Neil Alden Armstrong.

676
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,340
That's one small step for man,

677
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,080
one giant leap for mankind.

678
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,990
What's he blabbering about? Hey, come on.

679
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,220
- Dad, jump! - Hey...

680
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,219
- Hey! - Mom, jump with us!

681
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,159
- Okay. Jump! - Let's jump!

682
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,629
- Jump all you want! - That's the Moon.

683
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,659
- That's Earth! - Oh, my goodness. Hey!

684
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,000
You punk! What is the matter with you?

685
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,530
Sober up, you punk!

686
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,370
My gosh, what was that?

687
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,410
Mom, that hurts.

688
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,310
You see, my mom is...

689
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,510
always so consistent.

690
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,950
I've asked her over and over to knock first,

691
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,890
but she forgets every single time.

692
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,690
And that helmet hair.

693
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,530
She's had the same hairstyle since I was born.

694
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,360
She hasn't changed her hairstyle even once.

695
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,000
It's like it's tattooed on her head.

696
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,340
Shut it, will you?

697
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,739
- Oh, dear. Honey, do something! - Yes, I'll deal with him!

698
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,879
- Get up! - Leave him to me.

699
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,980
You punk! How dare you.

700
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,450
- Get out! - My gosh.

701
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,619
- My goodness! - What was that?

702
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,580
Oh, dear. What is wrong with him? Goodness me.

703
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,389
Hey! Enough is enough!

704
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,290
You. Go to your room. Go!

705
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,319
- Mom, it hurts. - Hey! That is enough!

706
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,960
- That hurts! - How much did you drink?

707
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,760
- You punk. - Hey, ouch!

708
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,130
Mom.

709
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,310
Right.

710
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,140
A person...

711
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,250
shouldn't...

712
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,120
change overnight.

713
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,780
But...

714
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,460
- Mom, but you see... - Yes.

715
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,830
Gosh, it's okay.

716
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes, it's okay.

717
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,330
Yoon Jae?

718
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,370
Park Yoon Jae!

719
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,910
Hold on. Hey, let me go.

720
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,310
My gosh!

721
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,760
You scared me.

722
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,330
Come out in five minutes.

723
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:25,870
Okay.

724
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,379
There's nothing like ramyeon for a hangover.

725
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,610
Here, eat up.

726
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,290
Do you remember what happened last night?

727
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,220
Kind of.

728
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,689
Your mom couldn't sleep a wink...

729
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,090
and went to the early morning service to pray.

730
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,769
I'll apologize to her when she gets home.

731
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,770
Yes, you should.

732
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,500
Hurry up and eat.

733
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,710
Are you going through something?

734
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,980
No, I'm not.

735
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,380
How's your girlfriend? Is she doing well?

736
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,420
No, she's gone.

737
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,120
I don't have a girlfriend.

738
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,400
All right. Hurry up and eat before the noodles get soggy.

739
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,300
Hey, don't forget to apologize to that friend who brought you home.

740
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,370
He helped you take off your clothes and even washed you. Goodness.

741
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,910
Okay.

742
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,750
He undressed me and washed me?

743
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,150
Washed me where?

744
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,220
Here and down here...

745
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,690
- Is that important? - Yes, it is important!

746
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
No way. I'm so out of shape right now!

747
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,700
Hey, Park Yoon Jae.

748
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,270
Come on. Don't let that get you down.

749
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,469
It's all right.

750
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,009
Hey, square your shoulders.

751
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,509
- Dad, stop. - It happens when guys get drunk.

752
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,139
It's fine. Square your shoulders!

753
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,210
Hey.

754
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,850
Are you all right?

755
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,820
The rumors are rampant.

756
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,919
Are you dating a scammer?

757
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
I don't know.

758
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,329
Let them talk and gossip.

759
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,030
This stop is Noryangjin Park.

760
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,630
The next stop is Exit Three of Noryangjin Station.

761
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,290
Sorry. Excuse me.

762
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,600
My gosh.

(Hong Young Seok)

766
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,440
Why do you want to be a civil servant?

767
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,320
I like stability.

768
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,180
Things that don't fall apart.

769
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,390
Things that never change.

770
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,020
But why?

771
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,529
If I had your face,

772
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,060
I wouldn't want to become a civil servant and waste my looks.

773
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,400
What a way to waste such good genes.

774
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,530
You're a fool.

775
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,740
Well, my kids...

776
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,740
can inherit my good genes.

777
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:49,570
I want to have at least three kids.

778
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,580
Three kids?

779
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,550
You want three kids?

780
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,880
Three kids...

781
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,190
To raise three kids, I guess...

782
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,890
I'll need to get a job as well.

783
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,219
- What? - It'll be tough...

I just meant that...

787
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,170
Be a stay-at-home mom.

788
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,270
I'll become a high-earning civil servant.

Mom said to give you this.

795
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,540
It's some kind of detox juice made with spinach.

798
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,450
Drink up.

799
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,950
Ji Hoon must be mad at you.

800
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,430
How did you know?

801
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:49,960
Oh, right.

802
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,160
My singing was terrible, wasn't it?

803
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,730
And why did I dance?

804
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,539
Why didn't you stop me?

805
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,740
What? You know that's not the reason.

806
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,610
That's not the reason?

807
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
Then why...

808
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,550
Oh, is it because of how he had to help me wash up?

809
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,980
Don't you remember?

810
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,420

Check this out.

812
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,390

816
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,099
You, punk! What is the matter with you?

817
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,240
You really don't remember anything?

818
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,100
No.

819
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,240
What is all this?

820
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,180

Try to sober up, okay?

824
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,180
People shouldn't change, you know?

825
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,880
But you've changed again.

826
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,650
I mean...

827
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,789
I mean, like my mom,

828
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,130
people shouldn't change.

829
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,340
So, why do you keep switching between being Ji Hoon...

830
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,410
and Ji Eun? Why is this happening?

831
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,980
Why do you change into a man...

832
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,110
and then back into a woman?

833
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,680
How's it possible?

834
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:55,990
I mean, why?

835
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,760
Why are you doing this?

836
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,730
Why? Just why?

837
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,900
You keep toying with my feelings...

838
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,070
Oh, hold on.

839
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,900
Is this a dream?

840
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,810
Right, it must be.

841
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,850
Oh, no. It hurts!

842
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,820
It hurts, so it means it's not a dream!

843
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,030
I'm sorry, Yoon Jae.

844
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,600
I guess I was being selfish.

845
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,600
I'm sorry.

846
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,650
Gosh, this is nuts.

847
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,700
Even we are this flustered. Think about how she must be feeling now.

848
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,730
I'm sure she just needs to blow off some steam. She'll be back soon.

849
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,470
It's my fault.

850
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,670
Last night, I got drunk and said some mean things.

851
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,780
I totally get it.

852
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,850
And maybe, you should take this as a chance to think things over.

853
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,050
Sorry?

854
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,860
I mean, if you feel like there's something to think through.

855
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,560
What if Ji Eun...

856
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,330
She wouldn't be having dark thoughts, would she?

857
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,970
My gosh, don't worry too much. Let's just wait for now.

858
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:52,200
I'm sure she'll shake it off and come back before you know it.

What did you say?

865
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,330
- There's a typo here. - What?

866
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,760
Look. The coordinates are different, right?

867
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,670
- You're right. - We'll redo it.

868
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,500
Okay.

869
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,080
You didn't forget where it was and found your way here.

870
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,480
Of course. How could I possibly forget this place, of all places?

871
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,350
This is where we first met.

872
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,590
You've been well, right?

873
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,060
Yes. Well, you know,

874
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,500
I've been deeply reflecting on my actions.

875
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,400
Hey, I'm sorry about my drunken antics that night.

876
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,610
I'll never drink that much again.

877
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:46,139
I hear there's a super famous tteokbokki place around here.

878
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,180
How about we go there?

879
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,080
Yoon Jae.

880
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,250
I thought it'd be nice to end things where we started.

881
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,290
Then the happy memories from when we started...

882
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,660
and the painful ones from the end would both be softened.

883
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,830
Park Yoon Jae.

884
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,170
Let's break up.

885
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,779
I think I've only been thinking about myself...

886
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,080
because I didn't want to break up with you. I'm sorry.

887
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,150
But...

888
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,120
because I love you, I don't want to keep showing up as someone...

889
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,860
who causes you pain and keeps hurting you.

890
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,829
If this is because of that night, I drank way too much, and...

891
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,860
It's not about that.

892
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,540
This is different from the first time I changed into a man.

893
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,070
I didn't think it would happen again.

894
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,940
Now, even I have no idea...

895
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,480
what might happen to me.

896
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
So,

897
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,020
if I stay with you in this situation,

898
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,290
then I'm just being too selfish.

899
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,030
Have you...

900
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,000
thought this through?

901
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,780
Yes.

902
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,150
Why don't we go...

903
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,020
and play some video games?

904
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,770
I've gotten so good at this, right?

905
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,280
I played this every day while you were gone.

906
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,080
So, you've been having fun.

907
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,119
Last time we played this together,

908
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,650
I couldn't protect you, even though I know it's only a video game.

909
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,660
It didn't feel good to see you die.

910
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,129
It's just a game. Don't you think you went a bit too far there?

911
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,060
I know. Funny, right?

912
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,200
I'll be honest.

913
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,270
It's a shame that you're a man now, and I'm at a loss.

914
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,139
I know.

915
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,040
Now, you're stronger and taller than me.

916
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,950
I really don't like this.

917
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,880
Yes, I know, so let's end things now.

918
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,920
No. Not yet.

919
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,590
Hey, hold on.

920
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,160
Someone's firing at us.

921
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,160
Hurry up and hop on. Nice.

922
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,860
Why can't we end things now?

923
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,100
Just because you changed into a man overnight again,

924
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,770
does that mean I have to cut off my feelings, just like that?

925
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,469
You know that's not what I meant. Park Yoon Jae, you really...

926
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,780
Even in my dreams, I never imagined you turning into a man.

927
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,810
But losing you would be worse than that.

928
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,250
So for now, let's just deal with this, okay?

929
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,820
I don't want your life to get complicated because of me.

930
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,830
My dad, who even sides with my mom during their fights,

931
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,670
once said...

932
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,940
his life would be unbearable without her.

933
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,070
That's why he's still with her, and that's exactly how I feel too.

934
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,240
If I were to lose you now,

935
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,350
my life would feel too unbearable and empty.

936
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,250
Oh, someone's firing at us.

937
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,220
Where is this person?

938
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,390
If we don't get out of the car now, we'll both die.

939
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,690
No, if we go our separate ways, we'll both die.

940
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,360
You two. Stop wandering off and get out of the car already.

941
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,729
People without driver's licenses...

942
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,600
always act like tough drivers when playing games.

943
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,800
Are you guys on a date or something?

944
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,850
I don't know where this will lead us, but for now, let's...

945
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:23,990
No.

946
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,960
For my sake, let's just keep things this way for the time being.

947
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,130
I got them.

948
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,840
- I'm so much better now, right? - Yes.

949
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,110
(Epilogue)

950
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:48,850
(Hong Young Seok)

951
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:50,450
He hasn't changed at all.

952
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:10,330
The Lovers card.

953
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:51,340
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

954
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,140
I want to go to school too.

955
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,810
If she weren't my daughter,

956
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,680
she wouldn't even have had to imagine going through this.

957
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,319
Yoon Jae and his friend are coming over later.

958
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Perfect.

959
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:01,619
You're totally my type.

960
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,749
How long have you known each other?

961
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,720
- It has been 453 days. - You count that?

962
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,930
You came. I was so stressed out.

963
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,230
Are you possessed by an evil spirit?

964
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,730
She said she'd sleep over.

965
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,039
I'm trying so hard not to fall for you.

966
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,040
I bet you have no idea.
