(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

6
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,970
Make me a cup of coffee.

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,570
A hot Americano with a double shot of espresso.

8
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,010
I don't want to fall asleep tonight.

9
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,340
I am Park Yoon Jae's girlfriend.

10
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,549
I look like this now, but it's only temporary.

11
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,880
I'll go back to being a woman in no time.

12
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,279
So, stop messing around, okay?

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,920
I know Yoon Jae has been telling you that he has a girlfriend.

14
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,460
I am that girlfriend, okay?

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,590
Don't you get it now?

16
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,530
It's me! I am Park Yoon Jae's girlfriend!

(Episode 6: Utter Chaos)

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,830
What a mess.

19
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,700
It's so messed up.

20
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,769
Everything's so messed up.

21
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,530
You're the biggest mess of all right now.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,940
My gosh, what's that on your face? Is that a dry patch?

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,640
No, it's the weight of my worries blooming across my face.

24
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,940
Lucky you. You've got nothing to worry about.

25
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,610
Your face is literally glowing.

26
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,380
Hi, Yoon Jae.

27
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
Hey.

28
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,390
I stayed up all night because of you.

29
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,860
But I don't feel tired at all.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,470
What? Why?

31
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,640
Thanks to the coffee you made for me.

32
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,740
Right, I see.

33
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,340
What...

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,680
Hey, I'm a customer. Why do you always say that when you see me?

35
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,310
Make me a latte.

36
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,550
Yoon Jae, did you sleep well last night?

37
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,520
What is going on here?

38
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,730
Did you two perhaps...

39
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,890
Perhaps, what?

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,830
You said you didn't get any sleep, but you want coffee again?

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,040
What's with you? Yesterday, you told me...

42
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,140
that I was pretty.

43
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,810
- That was... - She was here yesterday?

44
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,640
Something's definitely going on between you two.

45
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,549
Did you break up with your girlfriend?

46
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,820
I look exactly the same as I did yesterday.

47
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,450
But I guess I don't look pretty in your eyes today.

48
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,830
- Min Joo. - Yes?

49
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,670
I had a bit of a situation,

50
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,240
so I couldn't really tell you.

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Tell me what?

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,170
I have a girlfriend.

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,310
Are you joking right now?

54
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,690
You always made it very clear that you had a girlfriend.

55
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,620
Right, I mentioned it to you,

56
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,630
but I don't think I ever told you that I'm serious about her.

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,930
I guess you're feeling the danger.

58
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,260
What?

59
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,430
You're not saying this to warn me not to cross the line.

60
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,770
You're trying to stop yourself.

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,510
Here, look.

62
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,759
(Looking for this pretty boy with doe eyes)

63
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,889
What? That's me and Ji Hoon.

64
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,289
What is going on here?

65
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,360
It was posted last night on Yeonhee University's anonymous forum.

66
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,600
People keep reposting it.

67
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,400
What? I can't believe this.

68
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,810
Fine, I get that Ji Hoon stands out a bit.

69
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,369
Is he really that much of a heartthrob?

70
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,380
- Yes. - Yes.

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,110
And they blurred both your face and mine.

72
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,050
But...

73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,890
can they just use our photo like this?

74
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,290
Let's help them.

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,060
- But how? - It's simple.

76
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,760
Just tell them who he is and where to find him.

77
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,070
It's something you can definitely do.

78
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,000
Did you solve the problem?

79
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,970
I did, but I'm sure I got it wrong.

80
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,310
Let me see.

81
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,880
Hey, Yoon Ah. Stop staring at my face...

82
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,350
and keep your eyes on the book.

83
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,390
But your face is way prettier than the book.

84
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,620
I am flattered, but seriously, Yoon Ah.

85
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,489
If you don't step it up, we won't be able...

86
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,290
to cover all the chapters before the midterm.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,600
So, how far have you two really gone? You and my brother.

88
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,340
- What? - I know everything.

89
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,070
The nature of your relationship with my brother.

90
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Really?

91
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,339
Did Yoon Jae tell you everything?

92
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,910
It was obvious at a glance.

93
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,780
Hey, you see...

94
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,779
It's difficult to explain.

95
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,920
Don't you worry. Your secret's safe with me.

96
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,860
I understand there's a tough path ahead of you,

97
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,900
but I'm rooting for you two.

98
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,200
Good luck.

99
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,030
Yes.

100
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,200
Good luck.

101
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,550
You should've thought it through.

102
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,680
I bet...

103
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,519
I'm trying so hard not to fall for you.

104
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,590
I bet you have no idea.

105
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,430
Why is everything so messed up?

106
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,940
I got some tteokbokki for us.

107
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,840
My, that was one satisfying meal, wasn't it?

108
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,610
Hey, pass me some tissue.

109
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,150
Hey, how long do you plan to keep this up?

110
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,690
Do you know you haven't said a single word to me today?

111
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,059
My gosh, you're so cute.

112
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,060
Stop!

113
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,000
You're not allowed to do stuff like that anymore.

114
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,209
"These rules must be followed by both parties..."

115
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,950
"while Kim Ji Eun is living as a man."

116
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,920
Keep on reading.

117
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,189
"First, Kim Ji Eun will never show up in front of Choi Yu Ri..."

118
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,719
"like something out of a romantic comic."

119
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,830
I came too late, didn't I? Happy birthday.

120
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,500
- Hey, Yu Ri. - "Second."

121
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,459
"Kim Ji Eun will do the spoon worm dance..."

122
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,899
"anytime and anywhere if Choi Yu Ri wants."

123
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,369
Spoon worm.

124
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,870
Please don't do this. Stop!

125
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,409
- Please stop! - "Third."

126
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,440
Hey.

127
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,909
"When Kim Ji Eun is a man,"

128
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,139
"she must refrain from touching Choi Yu Ri in any way."

129
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,210
You're burning up.

130
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
"Fourth."

131
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,720
"Choi Yu Ri must never fall for Kim Ji Eun."

132
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,089
I'm trying so hard not to fall for you.

133
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,090
I bet you have no idea.

134
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,030
I can see that you've been under a lot of stress.

135
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,970
Yesterday, I was out of line.

136
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,339
No, I was. I'm sorry.

137
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,480
No, I owe you an apology.

138
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,060
(My Yoon Jae)

139
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,830
Why isn't he picking up?

140
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,069
My gosh. The post about Ji Hoon is now ranked seventh...

141
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,870
on Nite Pann's trending chart because it's so popular.

142
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,600
What?

143
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,409
(Looking for this pretty boy with doe eyes)

144
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,180
Honestly, I can't believe this.

145
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,350
I mean, he's not a celebrity. So, why?

146
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,550
Gang Dong Won wasn't a celebrity until he debuted,

147
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,650
and neither was Timothee Chalamet.

148
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,820
Everyone's obsessed with good looks.

149
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,300
I bought some tteokbokki for us.

150
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Oh, come on in.

151
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,810
Maybe I should've picked up something else.

152
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,420
No, I had a craving for tteokbokki.

153
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,190
But this is too much food.

154
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,319
Oh, I thought Ji Hye was home too.

155
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,590
I think she's busy these days.

156
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,390
She's been coming home late often.

157
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,260
I see.

158
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,529
Hey, did you check out the link I sent?

159
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,870
About the doe-eyed guy from Yeonhee University?

160
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,970
It was funny.

161
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,240
- Are you okay with that? - It's not like I'm a celebrity.

162
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,670
I'm sure the buzz will die down soon.

163
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
It's fine.

164
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,310
It will, right?

165
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,420
Yes, I'm sure it will.

166
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,690
Hey, Yoon Jae.

167
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,550
Yes?

168
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,620
Last night,

169
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,760
- nothing happened, right? - Last night?

170
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,330
Yes. Nothing, really.

171
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,729
"Nothing, really?"

172
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,870
I worked my shift.

173
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,700
Then I went home and went to bed.

174
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,910
I texted you. Didn't you see it?

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,110
I sure saw it.

176
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,880
You looking at that minx so lovingly.

177
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,980
Do I have something on my face?

178
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,190
No.

179
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,190
This tteokbokki is actually way too spicy for me.

180
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,030
My stomach is upset now.

181
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,730
Really?

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,430
- Should I get you some antacids? - No, it's not that bad.

183
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,870
I want to get some rest, though.

184
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,770
Oh, sure.

185
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,370
All right.

186
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,080
But it's her favourite tteokbokki.

187
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,050
Why is she mad?

188
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,140
Hey, Kim Ji Eun!

189
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,180
Hey, did you see this?

190
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,780
So, the doe-eyed guy from Yeonhee University.

191
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,809
Many say they've seen him,

192
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,220
but his true identity remains unknown.

193
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,420
A reliable source says...

194
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,119
he is the secret son...

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,359
of a powerful business tycoon.

196
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,359
According to A, Mr. Doe Eyes' close friend,

197
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
he's an idol trainee.

198
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,059
He's a male host who caters...

199
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,029
exclusively to wealthy women at a high-end bar in Gangnam.

200
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,900
I hear he's insanely popular.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,070
Can you cut his hair like this?

202
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,840
Sorry. One moment, please.

203
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,369
- Honey. - Yes?

204
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,440
Come here for a second.

205
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Sure.

206
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,210
Look. Isn't this our kid?

207
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,290
What? Why do you have a picture of our kid?

208
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,120
Is he someone you know?

209
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,990
He's Doe Eyes from Yeonhee University.

210
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,560
Isn't he so handsome?

211
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,460
- Doe Eyes? - Doe Eyes?

212
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,430
Doe Eyes, was it? I saw him in real life.

213
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,239
My gosh, he's so manly.

214
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,769
- Manly, my foot. - But why was he there?

215
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,339
He must've come because he knew someone there.

216
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,470
That's right.

217
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,509
Hey, didn't he carry Yoon Jae out in his arms?

218
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,579
In his arms? What is with Park Yoon Jae?

219
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,379
Hey, he doesn't remember.

220
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,479
Do you know how heavy he is?

221
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,820
He was literally like a zombie.

222
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,750
Oh, man. I really struggled to help him up.

223
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,360
- Yoon Jae. - Yes?

224
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,900
What are you reading so intently? You look serious with that grimace.

225
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,530
It's nothing.

226
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,370
They're all busy talking about that guy, Kim Ji Hoon, now.

227
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,239
If you go in now, you'll be in a pickle.

228
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,039
I hear he's the youngest son of a rich business magnate.

229
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,879
No, he's an idol singer.

230
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,450
I really don't understand...

231
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,310
all this fuss.

232
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Right?

233
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,190
Honestly, you're the only guy I'm curious about.

234
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,420
I should just go to the library, then.

235
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,690
Really?

236
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,390
Oh, that's Park Yoon Jae.

237
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,660
Now, you know.

238
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,140
My gosh. Isn't he that guy, Doe Eyes?

239
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,809
Hold on. He's insanely handsome.

240
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,139
- Oh, my. - He's really good-looking.

241
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,880
He's so handsome!

242
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,110
- Scoot over. - My goodness.

243
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,650
- Oh, no. He saw us. - Take more pictures.

244
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,050
- My gosh. - Over there.

245
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,560
- I want his face in the photo. - Gosh, hold on.

246
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,029
Hello?

247
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,330
Mr. Kim Ji Hoon, right?

248
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,229
- Who is this? - Hello.

249
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm a YouTuber.

250
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,099
So, I hear you're the doe-eyed guy from Yeonhee University.

251
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,500
No, I'm not that guy.

252
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,309
By the way, how did you get my number?

253
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,240
You know Min Ah, right? The webtoon artist.

254
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,110
I didn't really want to do this,

255
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,349
but I couldn't think of a safer place than this,

256
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,510
so I told you to meet me here.

257
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
I had no time to find a proper gift, so I got you some toilet paper.

258
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,790
Thank you. Let's sit down.

259
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,030
Hey, about Min Ah. What's her deal?

260
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,829
Who does she think she is, giving out my number?

261
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,900
She's an attention seeker through and through and a villain.

262
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,800
You know how we put her in her place that day.

263
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,370
I bet she's swinging her knife around, all fired up right now.

264
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,240
When did you get so many pictures taken?

265
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,539
What? This is from today.

266
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,150
My gosh. Seriously, what do I do now?

267
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,590
You two.

268
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,320
You two truly care for each other, right?

269
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,459
Well, yes.

270
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,560
And you, Park Yoon Jae?

271
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,929
What? Yes.

272
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,129
You guys love each other so much that you don't care what others...

273
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,330
might say or think about you, right?

274
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,100
Answer at the same time. One, two, three.

275
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,870
- Yes. - All right, then.

276
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,910
Since I made this mess, I should be the one to clean it up.

277
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,580
What are you going to do?

278
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,610
I'm putting together the finale...

279
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,450
for Yeonhee University's Doe Eyes.

280
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,550
Hello, Chief Editor. It's me, Writer Crystal Shoes.

281

About the fan meet-and-greet you mentioned last time.

282
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,330
I've changed my mind.

283
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,760
I'll do it. And of course,

284
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,330
I'll reveal my face too.

285
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,020
That looks nice.

286

(I really like you.)

287
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,330
Nice.

288
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,300
Don't open your mouth that much, though.

289
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,310
Yes, that's it.

290
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,340
That's sexy!

291
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,180
That's it. Perfect.

292
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,480

Thanks. Now, you know.

302
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,720

I thought about it and realised you always came to me to meet up.

That's because I don’t really have to go to work, per se,

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,420
I just asked you to get married like everyone else your age.

360
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,089
Your father is on the verge of dying.

361
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,159
You can't even do that for me?

362
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,430
Why would anyone want to marry someone with a father like you?

363
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,829
- What? Why, you... - My goodness, honey.

364
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,269
Hey, are you done talking?

365
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,799
- Come here. You punk! - Honey, please.

366
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,970
Honey.

367
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,340
Who are you?

368
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,379
Mother, Father.

369
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,940
It's very nice to meet you.

370
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,910
I'm Ham Jeong Ja.

371
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,250
Jeong Ja, what are you doing here?

372
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,860
Do you know our son, Young Seok?

373
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,290
I'm not a bad person.

374
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,360
I just happened to hear you were in this hospital,

375
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
so I came to see you.

376
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,300
My goodness.

377
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,270
Then, does this mean...

378
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,840
So, put your worries to rest.

379
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,910
Just trust me and focus on your treatment.

380
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,309
Then we'll all be happy...

381
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,420
My goodness.

382
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,350
I knew it.

383
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,220
Look here.

384
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,960
We don't need insurance.

385
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,259
- Pardon me? - Dad, you're being rude.

386
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,730
This world is falling apart.

387
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,569
Do you really want to sell an insurance policy...

388
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,500
to a dying old man?

389
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,140
I know it's tough to make a living, but still.

390
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,570
You little...

391
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,970
"You little?"

392
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,840
Don't yell at my sweetie.

393
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,990
You don't even need to bring anything.

394
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,590
Not even a spoon.

395
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,030
Our son has been studying for the exam for a long time,

396
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,900
and he's not well-dressed, so people might get the wrong impression.

397
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,929
We only eat Hanwoo beef, you see.

398
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,969
- We never even touch regular beef. - That's right!

399
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,240
Oh, my. I love beef.

400
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,310
Well...

401
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,050
Let's...

402
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,620
set a date first.

403
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,819
Wait, Dad.

404
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,020
Set a wedding date? But you just met her.

405
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,370
This silly boy is clearly head over heels for you.

406
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,369
I was just saying we should pick a day to butcher a cow,

407
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,540
but he interpreted it that way.

408
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,509
Yes! That's the way it should be.

409
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,610
Yes, this is great.

410
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,290
Since this has already happened,

411
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,720
let's go ahead and set a date for your wedding.

412
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,360
What? Dad.

413
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,530
Well, that's totally fine with me.

414
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,870
Really?

415
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,970
Yes! You did it!

416
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,940
This is great! You did it!

417
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,369
- My gosh, Father! - I could die in peace now.

418
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,210
- Oh, my. I'm delighted. How nice. - Father!

419
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,079
- Dad. - Father, are you watching us?

420
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,889
Your grandson is getting married at last.

421
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,149
- This is amazing. - Dad, you'll get hurt. Get down.

422
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,590
- Amazing! - Oh, my!

423
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,859
You didn't have to get us anything. That must've been expensive.

424
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,860
You're a student, so I doubt you have much money to spend.

425
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,300
It wasn't expensive.

426
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,330
It's from a famous bakery near Yeonhee University. It's good.

427
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,840
You're both boys, so how are you so different?

428
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,510
Don't you have to go, Mom?

429
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,110
I wish you could be my son-in-law.

430
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,649
I always dreamed of being...

431
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,519
the greatest mom-in-law a guy could want.

432
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,289
Get out of my room, Mom. I have to study.

433
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,520
I will leave soon, okay?

434
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,160
Take care, then.

435
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,130
I'm leaving. My goodness.

436
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,500

440

Oh, right.

441
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,450
You want to be a web novelist too.

442
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,150
Don't think of talking your way out.

443
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,720
Mr. Kim, I...

444
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,399
I wished you good luck with my brother not that long ago,

445
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
and you're cheating already?

446
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,869
Yoon Ah. It's not like that.

447
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,600
She's my favourite web novelist.

448
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,770
Forget Yoon Jae who has a cheating girlfriend.

449
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,239
I feel worse for myself, a fan who's lost her star...

450
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,980

451

Wait.

454
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,700
You and my brother are in love,

455
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,360
and Crystal Shoes is your best friend,

456
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,300
and she put on an act for the two?

457
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,940
Is that it?

458
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,940
Yes. If you don't mind,

459
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,470
can you keep it down?

460
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,879
Be quiet.

461
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,979
No. Don't squeal so loud.

Run right back before I yell.

541
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,759
I might even video call Mom.

542
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,970
I hate how uptight you are.

543
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,400
See you around, Mr. Kim.

544
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,900
Sure. Bye.

545
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,669
Did we have to meet here?

546
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,810
Get out of here.

547
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,580
Darn you.

548
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,450
She's such a troublemaker.

549
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,609
- How are you? - Hello.

550
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,620
Hello.

551
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,279
- Hey, how are you? - Hi.

552
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,049
- I'm a fan. - Hello.

553
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,890
- Thank you. - I love your novel.

554
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,519
- It's great to see you. - Hi. Thank you.

555
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,919
- You're beautiful. - Thanks.

556
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,160
I love your work.

557
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,400
Hey.

558
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,970
Who's this?

559
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,970
It's Crystal Shoes' boyfriend.

560
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,839
- What? - The guy on social media?

561
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,039
- "Doe Eyes?" - No way.

562
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,379
- What? - For real?

563
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,410
Hello.

564
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,449
I noticed your good looks back then,

565
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,250
and you're the doe-eyed guy?

566
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,280
I don't believe it.

567
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,350
Who's she?

568
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,490
She's Min...

569
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,960
Min Ah.

570
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,790
Why are you all here?

571
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,160
We were about to get in line.

572
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,129
Why would her boyfriend wait in line?

573
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,499
You get a free pass to the front.

574
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,570
Come with me.

575
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,899
- I don't mind waiting. - Come along.

576
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,139
I really don't mind.

577
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,740
Don't you know who this is?

578
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,940
He is Writer Crystal Shoes' boyfriend!

579
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,480
He's the doe-eyed guy.

580
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,610
Look. Doe Eyes.

581
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,980
This isn't good.

582
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,220
Let us through.

583
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,589
Let Crystal Shoes' man through.

584
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,590
Excuse us, please.

585
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,819
- Yu Ri, say hi. - What...

586
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,289
Your boyfriend's here.

587
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,389
("The Private Life of the Goddess")

588
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,190
- Are they together? - For real?

589
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,269
- I don't believe it. - Hey.

590
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,499
("The Private Life of the Goddess")

591
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,540
Here.

592
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,770
I'm a fan.

593
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,910
You can't say that. That's too unfriendly.

594
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,410
Talk like you did the last time we met.

595
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,279
Everyone. This is Crystal Shoes' boyfriend.

596
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,449
- What? - Is that true?

597
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,049
Who knows the doe-eyed guy?

598
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,849
- Me! - Me!

599
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,920
Right?

600
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,430
Hey. Do something.

601
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,630
Baby, you're here.

602
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,610
Yes. Baby.

603
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,369
- My gosh. - "Baby."

604
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,280
- How sweet. - They're adorable.

605
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,909
Everyone.

606
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,080
How does "The Private Life of the Goddess" end?

607
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,390
- With a kiss! - With a kiss!

608
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,749
That's right. With a kiss.

609
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,760
Crystal Shoes.

610
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,890
Your fans want it.

611
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,730
- Kiss. - Kiss.

612
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,299
- Kiss. - Go on, kiss.

613
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,869
- Hurry up. - Kiss.

614
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,339
- Kiss. - Kiss her.

615
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,170
- That's it. - Kiss.

616
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,309
- What is this? - Kiss.

617
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,909
- Kiss! - Kiss!

618
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,580
- Come on. - Kiss!

619
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,549
- Kiss! - Hurry up.

620
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,220
- Go on and kiss. - Kiss!

621
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,949
- Kiss! - Let's do it.

622
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,420
- Kiss! - Get to it!

623
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,649
- Are you crazy? - Put a full stop...

624
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,990
so the story can end.

625
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,719
What are you talking about?

626
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,960
I have more to lose here.

627
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,460
You know I've never dated.

628
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,589
This is my first kiss.

629
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,800
So why do you want to do that now?

630
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,330
Don't you see the crowd?

631
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,770
Actions...

632
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,870
are more powerful than words.

633
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,239
- Three seconds is all it takes. - Kiss!

634
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,940
- Hey. - Yes!

635
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,340
- Kiss! - Kiss!

636
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,010
- Do it! - Kiss!

637
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,410
- Kiss! - Kiss!

638
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,650
("The Private Life of the Goddess")

639
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,740
Hey. Smile.

640
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,810
Smile, okay?

641
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,150
("The Private Life of the Goddess")

642
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,760
They're kissing.

643
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,490
It looks like Doe Eyes.

644
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
It's him.

645
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:54,389
- Are they together? - They kissed.

646
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,390
No way.

647
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,869
What's this?

648
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,200
(Posts)

649
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,070
This was what it was about?

650
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,109
(Gosi Udon)

651
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,709
(Gosi Udon)

652
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,249
(Gosi Udon)

653
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,149
(Gosi Udon)

654
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,220
Welcome.

655
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,789
You can sit over there.

656
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,790
(Gosi Udon)

657
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,230
Can I have one gosi udon?

658
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Hey.

659
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,099
You don't look like someone studying for an exam.

660
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,300
Is this your first visit?

661
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,900
Yes.

662
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,710
I have a friend who studies in Noryangjin,

663
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,079
and he said your udon was the best.

664
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,109
Did he?

665
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,080
Whoever that friend is, he'll become someone great.

666
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,320
But we care more about cost-effectiveness than taste.

667
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,820
Our portions are big.

668
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,419
What is your friend's name?

669
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,259
It's Young Seok. Hong Young Seok.

670
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,360
Young Seok? Hong Young Seok?

671
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,260
I know him.

672
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,730
You're Young Seok's friend.

673
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,799
He was here yesterday, the day before, and the day before.

674
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,139
He had udon here.

675
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,640
He's always the same. He always has udon.

676
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,080
How about we chat over some soda if you're free?

677
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,680
Preservation of data...

678
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,620
Preservation of data is paramount...

679
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,059
Since this has already happened,

680
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,489
let's go ahead and set a date for your wedding.

681
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,360
Well, that's totally fine with me.

682
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,610
Darn it. I'm out.

683
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,250
What?

684
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,950
Hello.

685
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,620
Gosh, you.

686
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,530
You must be quite surprised to see me at a place like this.

687
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,159
Yes. What are you doing here?

688
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,230
Oh, that?

689
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,869
The Gosi Udon owner told me about this place...

690
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,370
and that I'd find you here.

691
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,040
I see. The restaurant owner.

692
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,539
Yes. I come to this old bookstore from time to time...

693
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,550
because it's quiet.

694
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,680
But how do you know her?

695
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,879
She's quite popular...

696
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,289
on the test-taker forum for civil service exams.

697
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,150
She's like the president of Noryangjin.

698
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,020
Yes, that's true.

699
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,829
Wait. Are you preparing to take the civil service exam too?

700
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,160
No. I signed up to find you.

701
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Me?

702
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,129
When we ran into each other last time,

703
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,600
we couldn't exchange numbers.

704
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,540
I've been curious about what you've been up to all these years.

705
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,240
I see.

706
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,120
Punch in your digits.

707
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,190
You're not married by any chance, right?

708
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,490
- No. - Or are you engaged?

709
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,120
But I don't mind if you have a child.

710
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,830
Ji Hye, you're still off-the-wall as ever.

711
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
Here's my number.

712
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,380
- I got it. - Yes.

713
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,990
We used to laugh so much together when we were in school.

714
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,120
I must've used up all my laughter chips.

715
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,160
I'm still very funny.

716
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,530
What?

717
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,969
When my colleagues go out with me for team dinners,

718
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,769
they call in sick the next day...

719
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,770
because their belly buttons are gone.

720
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,310
They call in sick for that?

721
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,810
Why would their belly buttons be gone?

722
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,209
My gosh. That hurts.

723
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,810
- Come on. - My gosh.

724
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,550
Your slaps still hurt a lot.

725
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,760
Can I call you from time to time?

726
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,470
Sure.

727
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,840
But it will be hard to reach me a lot of the times.

728
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,940
But I'll call you back.

729
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,450
Right.

730
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,920
It seemed you were out of cigarettes.

731
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,260
Hey.

732
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,830
I...

733
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,380
What's this?

734
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,750
Smoking isn't healthy for you. So smoke only a few. From Ji Hye.

735
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,130
Gosh, she's so unpredictable.

736
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,820
What's she doing?

737
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,100
Should I just woman up and make him mine?

738
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,330
No, Choi Yu Ri.

739
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,299
That will make you a nasty friend.

740
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,400
Ji Eun is going through so much right now.

741
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,810
But...

742
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,080
I'm going through a hard time too.

743
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,650
You're so loud.

744
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,610
Let me join you.

745
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,749
- Excuse me. - Yes.

746
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,660
A can of Coke and a rolled omelet too.

747
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,530
- Right. A bowl of rice as well. - Sure.

748
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,130
What are you doing?

749
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,239
Stop filling up your stomach on liquid. Have some food first.

750
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,840
I doubt you had anything to eat today.

751
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,280
Cheers.

752
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,940
What's all this?

753
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,320
- Hey, what's going on? - Gosh, be quiet.

754
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,619
A world war has broken out.

755
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,489
Dad bought stocks behind Mom's back.

756
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,289
What's wrong with buying stocks?

757
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,260
How can she kick him out because of that?

758
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,660
He lost 30,000 dollars.

759
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,729
What's this? This is Dad's!

760
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,330
- I found it outside. - My gosh.

761
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,200
Unbelievable.

762
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,210
Dad?

763
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,750
Check the top shelf of the bookcase in the living room.

764
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:11,349
Find "Investment Guru's Tips Your Wife Will Love You for."

765
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:15,620
Check Pages 78, 88, and 98.

766
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,560
Page 78.

767
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,890
(50 Dollars)

768
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,000
(50 Dollars)

769
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,270
(10 Dollars)

770
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,320
Hey.

771
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,730
("Investment Guru's Tips Your Wife Will Love You for")

772
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,909
Excuse me. Can I get one more shot glass?

773
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:12,980
Sure.

774
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,380
Come on, Dad.

775
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,620
Square your shoulders.

776
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,720
It's natural for men to take risks like investing in stocks.

777
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,360
You know?

778
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,930
You only lost 30,000 dollars, not 300,000 dollars.

779
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,030
It's 50,000 dollars.

780
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,560
Did you say 50,000 dollars?

781
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,269
Dad, you've been a soldier all your life.

782
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,470
Why did you invest in stocks?

783
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,299
You told me not to think about making money...

784
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,810
unless I worked for it.

785
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,740
After all those speeches...

786
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
My gosh.

787
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,350
What do I do?

788
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,800
Go home.

789
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,770
Dad.

790
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,839
Let's go back home.

791
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,910
No.

792
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,140
I must stay out of your mom's sight at least today.

793
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,150
I'm sorry...

794
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,350
that you had to see this disappointing side of me.

795
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,420
Go home.

796
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,170
Welcome.

797
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:05,020
Do you know what life and soju have in common?

798
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,230
Yu Ri. You didn't even have a drop of soju.

799
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,630
What they have in common is... Drumroll, please.

800
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,800
It has two syllables.

801
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,670
My gosh. Should I just leave her here?

802
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,810
You know what happened today?

803
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,580
I had my first kiss today.

804
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,520
But this kiss wasn't the start of anything.

805
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,720
It was the end.

806
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,920
You decided to help them anyway. So it's nice to make it look real.

807
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,890
Besides, I already had a feeling that...

808
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,630
Yoon Jae and Ji Hoon were more than just friends.

809
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,200
But it was my first kiss.

810
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,239
Is it a problem because it was your first kiss?

811
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,840
Of course! The first time is very important.

812
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,780
If I had been kissed before, it wouldn't have upset me this much.

813
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,720
I'm not doing this because I have feelings for you,

814
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,550
but because I'm your fan.

815
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,210
That crazy jerk.

816
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,080
Come with me.

817
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,220
What are you doing? Yu Ri, where are you taking me?

818
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,350
I'm not ready for this yet.

819
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,120
Isn't that Park Yoon Jae?

820
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,490
What? Yoon Jae?

821
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,030
Why is he entering a motel?

822
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,170
- Is he with Ji Hoon? - He left to visit his mom earlier.

823
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,570
Then...

824
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,969
I stayed up all night because of you.

825
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,540
What's with you? Yesterday, you told me...

826
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,510
that I was pretty.

827
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,209
- He must be with Kang Min Joo. - What? Who?

828
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,280
Kang Min Joo.

829
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,350
This girl has feelings for Yoon Jae.

830
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,350
So he came to a motel with her?

831
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,819
I knew it. Something was going on between them.

832
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,920
What? What do you mean?

833
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,530
Is he cheating?

834
00:49:21,531 --> 00:49:23,360
They asked each other if they had a good night's sleep.

835
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,359
"You told me I was pretty last night."

836
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,370
She said stuff like that.

837
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,920
- Mom. - Yes?

838
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,420
Can you teach me how to do hair?

839
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,350
Why do you want to learn that?

840
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,390
Well,

841
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,559
I can't get a job while I'm living as a guy.

842
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,790
I thought about working here and learning how to do hair.

843
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,730
You should teach her, honey. I think it's a good idea.

844
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,700
Gosh, do you think anyone can become a hairstylist?

845
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,370
You're not good with your hands.

846
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,510
That's why I'm asking you to each me.

847
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,920
What is it, Yu Ri?

848
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,160
I'm at my mom's hair salon.

849
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,630
Yoon Jae? I talked to him on the phone earlier. Why?

850
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,760
What? A motel?

851
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,400
He's with whom?

852
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,770
(High-end computers available)

853
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,180
Where is he? Where's Yoon Jae?

854
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,189
Did he really go in there with Kang Min Joo?

855
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,260
Yes.

856
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,289
Hello, Ji Hoon.

857
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,830
It's a shame to meet in this circumstance.

858
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,160
How could Yoon Jae do this to me?

859
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,400
Call him right now.

860
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,070
Hey, it's Yoon Jae.

861
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,080
He wore a jacket today.

862
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,210
But he's not wearing it now.

863
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,450
What a jerk.

864
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,449
- I can't let this slide. - Hey.

865
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,860
Hey, Park Yoon Jae.

866
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,460
Hey. Hello.

867
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,789
- What are you doing here? - What? "Hello?"

868
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,260
I caught you red-handed, but you're still acting so brazen.

869
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,100
Hey. Come on out, Ji Hoon.

870
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,340
Hey. What's going on with the three of you?

871
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,810
Ji Hoon, what are you doing here?

872
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,650
We saw everything.

873
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,620
You went in and came out of the motel.

874
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,619
My timer says you've been in there...

875
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,350
for 1 hour, 7 minutes, and 34 seconds.

876
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,190
I see. Yes. Did you even time me?

877
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,230
Were you in there with Min Joo?

878
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,460
Were you in there with Kang Min Joo?

879
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,900
What are you talking about?

880
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,340
I was in there with my dad.

881
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:19,839
Your dad?

882
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,910
Hey, wouldn't it be better to say you were in there with your mom?

883
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,780
I can see why you would misunderstand this.

884
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,650
But I was really in there with my dad.

885
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,290
Lead the way.

886
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,189
- That's it. - What?

887
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,559
If you can stand by what you said, lead the way.

888
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,630
Nicely said.

889
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,460
Are you sure about it?

890
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,300
What could I possibly lose at this point?

891
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,370
You have to come to my house to tutor my sister.

892
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,300
That's the least of my concern right now.

893
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,510
You're unbelievable today.

894
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,540
Let's go.

895
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,139
Hey, come with me.

896
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,480
What? Hey.

897
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:12,590
Yu Ri. Maybe, tagging along is a bad idea for us.

898
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,490
Yoon Jae is the one who had the bad idea.

899
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,790
Come with me now.

900
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,830
Hey.

901
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:23,700
- Watch carefully. - Okay.

902
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,910
Dad.

903
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,140
Dad?

904
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,390
Who are you?

905
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,959
- I see. You're Kang Min Joo. - No.

906
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,220
- No. - Gosh, no.

907
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,560
What's going on?

908
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,360
- Seriously. - Gosh, I'm sorry.

909
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,100
I got the wrong room.

910
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,530
Come on.

911
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,970
I'm sorry.

912
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,369
No. He's in the next room.

913
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,510
How dare you fool us? Open the door now!

914
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,979
I'm serious. He's in the next room.

915
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,750
I got the wrong number for the room.

916
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,350
Come with me.

917
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,020
Watch.

918
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,430
Dad.

919
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,430
Dad?

920
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,900
Your head is all over the place. You left it here...

921
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,380
See? This is my dad.

922
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,079
My dad!

923
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,579
This is my dad.

924
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,450
Guys, look. This is my dad.

925
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,120
- Guys, it's my dad. - Hello.

926
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,949
Here's my dad.

927
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,020
Yes.

928
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,260
This is my dad.

929
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,090
See? I told you he wasn't with Kang Min Joo.

930
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,790
Dad.

931
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,500
I'm sorry.

932
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,030
Yu Ri. Where are you going?

933
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,800
Come on.

934
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,610
My gosh. It's fine.

935
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,260
I'm a bit disappointed.

936
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,800
I understand how they might not have faith in me.

937
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,840
But I didn't know you'd doubt me.

938
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,310
I'm sorry.

939
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,340
I told them it couldn't be true.

940
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,840
But they were so certain.

941
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,279
I had no idea you didn't trust me at all.

942
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,620
Had I not seen you with Kang Min Joo, I wouldn't have...

943
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,190
What did you see us doing?

944
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,960
Actually,

945
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,930
I saw you two together.

946
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,170
And how sweetly you were looking at her at the cafe.

947
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,300
I was?

948
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,779
I see. That was nothing.

949
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,140
I knew you'd say that.

950
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,280
That's why I wasn't going to bring it up.

951
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,920
I'm sorry.

952
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,059
By the way, she really means nothing to me.

953
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,760
She's just my junior, and nothing more.

954
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,590
I'll be watching you.

955
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,700
Bye.

956
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,570
By the way,

957
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,810
I have something to say to you too.

958
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,340
Watching you and Yu Ri kiss...

959
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,610
wasn't pleasant either.

960
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,219
It wasn't a real kiss.

961
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,480
Our lips touched for a second.

962
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,620
No.

963
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,390
Maybe, three seconds?

964
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,730
I'm sorry.

965
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,700
I'll set the boundaries more clearly next time.

966
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,570
I'll be watching you.

967
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,440
Go inside.

968
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,400
What? Gosh, what are you doing here, Dad?

969
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,770
What's up with you?

970
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,910
Your mother told me to come home right away.

971
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,309
She told you to come home looking like that?

972
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,140
She'll forgive me if I'm cute.

973
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,280
You're totally off. You don't look cute at all.

974
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,120
Mom might ask you for a divorce.

975
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,520
Il Jo!

976
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,700
My goodness!

977
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,690
Park Yoon Jae.

978
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,090
What brings you here early in the morning?

979
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,730
What's that on your head?

980
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,720
Gosh, what are you doing?

981
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,450
- Do you want to join me? - What?

982
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,220
Raise your knee. And then kick.

983
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,890
- This? - Yes. Just like that.

984
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,029
All right. Link your arm with mine.

985
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,630
Let's turn. Come on.

986
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,200
Gosh, seriously. What's this?

987
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,540
Keep turning.

988
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,510
Now, hop.

989
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,540
- Keep turning. - Hey, this is fun.

990
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,850
Hey, let's do this again. One more time.

991
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,450
- All right. One, two, three. - What?

992
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,960
What are you doing here in the morning?

993
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,670
What about you, Min Joo?

994
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,100
What are you doing here at this hour?

995
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,270
Me? I'm moving here.

996
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,870
You're moving here? Where?

997
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:44,910
Right here.

998
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,650
Here?

999
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,880
This building?

1000
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,520
Yes. Room 202 on the 2nd floor.

1001
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,600
(Special thanks to Kang Shin Il, Park Myung Sin, and Yewon)

1002
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,670
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

1003
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,910
Yoon Jae! Help me.

1004
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,870
Jealousy is making me do all kinds of stuff I don't want to do.

1005
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,940
Actually, it's getting hot in here for me too.

1006
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,550
Should I just go home?

1007
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,850
That sly girl from next door?

1008
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:58,919
That hurts.

1009
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,849
I must've sprained my ankle when I tried to walk fast.

1010
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,520
I'd worry if I don't see you off...

1011
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,859
and wouldn't be able to focus on my studies.

1012
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,959
- Ji Hoon. - She acts super friendly around me.

1013
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,430
But how did you get my number?

1014
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,460
How did she even think of inviting you there?

1015
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:13,160
To seduce Yoon Jae?
