00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
Hey.

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,970
Let me explain what happened.

3
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,210
No need to explain.

4
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,610
"No need?"

5
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,550
That's right.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,550
As you know, we're nothing now.

7
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,520
Right.

8
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,990
It's over...

9
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,560
between us.

10
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,060
What?

11
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,060
We're nothing now?

12
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,350
(Episode 12: Love, the Miracle of the Universe)

13
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm coming in.

14
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,500
Hey, my goodness.

15
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,500
What is all this?

16
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,810
You should be writing with a clear mind.

17
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,810
Do you really want to depend on dopamine?

18
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,040
- You'll die at this rate. - Do you now know how I felt...

19
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,410
when beer cans were lying all over the house?

20
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,250
You should just have a drink.

21
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,010
Alcohol is the best remedy for a breakup.

22
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,180
It's not about that.

23
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,850
The contest submission deadline is this week. That's why.

24
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,990
Sure, whatever.

25
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,090
Hey, here.

26
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,530
I know I can't cook, but I tried my best.

27
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,100
I appreciate it,

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,670
but can you please get out?

29
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,140
Make sure you eat it.

30
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,710
- Okay? - Yes!

31
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,150
We'll really be leaving for the US in just three days.

32
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,590
Yes, that's right.

33
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,520
It feels like a dream, us going to Corning University together.

34
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,960
Right, I told my landlord today...

35
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,260
that I'd be moving out.

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,530
Good.

37
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,500
Hey, we should have dinner together this evening.

38
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,600
- My treat. - Sorry.

39
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,600
I have plans for the evening.

40
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,670
You do? With who?

41
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,470
Don't tell me... No, right?

42
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,940
With my family.

43
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,040
It's the last weekend before I leave.

44
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,580
I see. Then I should let you go.

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,980
I'll see you every day from now on anyway.

46
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,870
(Love Four Cuts)

47
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,010
Yes.

48
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,250
Let's eat.

49
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,820
Okay.

50
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,160
Hey, come and sit.

51
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,700
Honey, that's enough. Just come and join us.

52
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,240
There's no space left on the table.

53
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,170
Dad's right. That's enough, Mom.

54
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,410
Yes, I'm done. Here.

55
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,880
All right, let's pray now.

56
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,590
My eldest child, Park Yoon Jae, will be leaving...

57
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,860
for the US very soon to study at Corning University.

58
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,760
May the Lord be with him...

59
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,830
and watch over him so that his new journey...

60
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,730
will be safe and free from any problems.

61
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,760
Amen.

62
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,000
- Amen. - Amen.

63
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,140
All right, let's eat.

64
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,050
Should I have a cup of coffee?

65
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,480
I got this.

66
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,580
It's fine.

67
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,880
- I'll do it, Mom. - Goodness.

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,080
It's fine.

69
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,500
Stop it.

70
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,500
I'm sorry, Mom.

71
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,260
Thank you very much for everything.

72
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,200
I must admit, I'm sad, which isn't like me.

73
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,100
Where in the US will you be?

74
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,140
I'll be attending Corning University in Maryland.

75
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,140
Corning University?

76
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,910
You're that smart?

77
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,410
I never thought so.

78
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
Me neither.

79
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,280
Anyway, good luck with everything.

80
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,150
Here's your parting bonus.

81
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,320
What?

82
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,450
What employer gives a mere part-timer a parting bonus?

83
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,950
Please, it's fine.

84
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,790
Just do what your boss says and accept it.

85
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,220
Thanks for your hard work.

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Thank you.

87
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,300
Oh, Min Hyuk. Can you spare me a minute?

88
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,740
(Lee Min Hyuk)

89
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,880
Ji Hoon, the clothes you borrowed from me at the club.

90
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,950
When can I get them back?

91
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,820
Oh, right.

92
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,220
I really wanted to talk to you...

93
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,220
about something before leaving for the US.

94
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,830
So, you decided...

95
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,760
to go to the US after all.

96
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,730
Yes.

97
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,300
That's great. When do you leave?

98
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,210
Tomorrow.

99
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,180
Really?

100
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,820
That's really great. Congratulations.

101
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
And you...

102
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,420
You're doing well, right?

103
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,800
Yes, of course.

104
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,270
I'm doing really well.

105
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,970
I've been busy preparing for the contest,

106
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,200
but I'm still eating and sleeping well.

107
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,410
Yoon Jae.

108
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,250
Make sure you eat well in the US too.

109
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,190
And study hard.

110
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,400
I have something urgent to take care of, so I should get going.

111
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,130
Goodbye.

112
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,070
I...

113
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,570
That day,

114
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,980
I couldn't hold back any longer,

115
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,380
so I went to see you for the first time.

116
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,450
I heard I was drunk...

117
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,320
and passed out in front of your place.

118
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,160
I held out...

119
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,730
as long as I could.

120
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,370
I swear, it was the first time.

121
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,940
You said I didn't need to explain,

122
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,110
but I really wanted to.

123
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,880
Should I really go?

124
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,660
Ji Eun.

125
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,190
Do you really want me to leave?

126
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,150
What's up?

127
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,490
I came to say farewell.

128
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,420
I'm flying out to the US tonight.

129
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,960
I see.

130
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,360
With Yoon Jae.

131
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,900
I see.

132
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,400
Have a safe flight.

133
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,840
Don't worry about Yoon Jae.

134
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,410
All right, I won't.

135
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,180
Ji Hoon, you take care...

136
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,980
I mean, you take care of yourself too, Ji Eun.

137
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,890
You too.

138
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,650
Tonight at 9:20pm. It's Hana Air.

139
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,760
Hey, what are you doing?

140
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,230
Good luck with everything, Park Yoon Jae.

141
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,060
Don't worry about Mom and Dad. I'll take care of them.

142
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,670
All right.

143
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,640
I trust you'll take good care of them while I'm away.

144
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,580
Son.

145
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,980
We all believe in you.

146
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,720
I'll be fine, Mom.

147
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
How about a hug?

148
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,890
- Don't go. - Don't go.

149
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,600
Don't go.

150
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,580
(Spoon Worm)

151
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,320
- Hey. - So, did you submit it?

152
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,020
What?

153
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,830
Oh, right.

154
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,690
"Oh, right?"

155
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,500
Hey.

156
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,500
The deadline is in an hour.

157
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm working on it.

158
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,700
It's in an hour. You're still writing?

159
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,710
Read me the last three sentences you wrote before I called you.

160
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,710
Three sentences?

161
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,650
(At 9:20pm, Hana Air)

162
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,590
"At 9:20pm, Hana Air."

163
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,190
- What? - "At 9:20pm, Hana Air."

164
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,820
What are you saying?

165
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,230
What?

166
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,500
At 9:20pm,

167
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,070
Hana Air.

168
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,730
I guess he's not coming.

169
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,600
What?

170
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,770
What? Oh, nothing.

171
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,030
We should head in now.

172
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,070
All right, let's go.

173
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,480
Goodbye,

174
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,680
Park Yoon Jae.

175
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,740
My gosh.

176
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,540
What is this?

177
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,980
Goodness.

178
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,180
My gosh!

179
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,880
Hi.

180
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,080
Hey, I'm not Kim Ji Hye.

181
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,980
Hi, Hong Young Seok.

182
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,850
Good luck on your exam. Good luck!

(Exam Site 4)

184
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,160
- Well done. Bye. - Thank you.

185
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,990
- Well done. - Thank you.

186
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,360
Hi, bye.

187

- Well done. - Thank you.

Well done!

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,200
Hi, well done

190

(Rooting for You and Your Dream)

191
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,140
What's this?

192
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,460
(Dear test takers)

193
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,870
(Written Exam Held Here)

194
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,500
My gosh, I can't see.

195
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,970
How come I can't see a thing now?

196
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,510
I could see just fine earlier.

197
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,210
Oh, no. What's going on?

198
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,110
My goodness.

199
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,480
Where did you rent this from?

200
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,550
Hi.

201
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,490
Kim Ji Hye, seriously...

202
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,460
Did you do well on the exam?

203
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,730
Oh, it's totally fine even if you didn't do well on the exam.

204
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,200
I think I did pretty well.

205
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,030
Really?

206
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,640
Hey! That's amazing!

207
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,110
Anyway, how did you find me here?

208
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,640
How did you know I took the exam here?

209
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,380
Oh, you know I'm close with the President of Noryangjin.

210
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,580
- Auntie? - Yes.

211
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,550
Gosh, you.

212
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,590
Well, I should get going.

213
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,490
What?

214
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,420
(Exam Site 4)

215
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,490
- Gosh. - Hey.

216
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,300
Let's go eat something.

217
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,970
What?

218
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,970
I'm hungry.

219
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,170
You're...

220
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,410
You're hungry?

221
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,110
Yes.

222
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,510
Oh, you're hungry. That's not good.

223
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,850
Yes, let's eat something.

224
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,080
Yes, let's go. Let's grab a bite to eat.

225
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,680
Wait, then...

226
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,220
It's on me. I'm treating you.

227
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,160
Hey, Kim Ji Hye. You're so funny.

228
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,290
Where did you even find these things?

229
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,600
Where did you get this?

230
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,530
Yes, that's it.

231
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,870
I didn't know Hong Young Seok smiled so much.

232
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,640
Like this. Keep going.

233
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,070
What's so funny?

234
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,510
Kim Ji Hye, you're really something.

235
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,280
Actually, he looks ugly when he smiles.

236
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,380
Do you want something to drink?

237
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Oh, you have something?

238
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,590
(Kim Ji Hye)

239
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,530
Come on. This is nothing.

240
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,860
- What do you feel like eating? - What shall we eat?

241
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,630
- What shall we eat? - Oh, this...

242
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,930
- What shall we eat? - This is red ginseng.

243
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,140
That's right. Red ginseng is good for you.

244
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,670
(Congratulations on Mom and Dad's 30th wedding anniversary.)

245
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,780
Congratulations, Mom and Dad.

246
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,780
Here's my gift to you.

247
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,420
- Matching pajamas. - Oh, my gosh.

248
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,120
Thanks. My goodness.

249
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,990
And thank you, Ji Hye. We will enjoy this meal.

250
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,290
Oh, it's my pleasure.

251
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,830
Hey, Mom, Dad.

252
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,960
I'm 33 this year, you know.

253
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,200
So, how is it that this year marks your 30th anniversary?

254
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,500
What?

255
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,870
The answer is obvious. Do you really have to ask?

256
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,210
Oh, that...

257
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,010
Your mom was against having a wedding.

258
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,920
She said she didn't know what to expect, even after you were born.

259
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,790
I can understand why.

260
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Honey.

261
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,760
Do you regret marrying me?

262
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,030
I plucked up the courage to stay with you,

263
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,300
and it turned out to be the best decision of my life.

264
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,140
Thanks to that decision, we had our two daughters, Ji Hye and Ji Eun.

265
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,580
My gosh, that's cringey.

266
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,720
Hey, Ji Hye. Has something good happened to you lately?

267
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,290
- You're looking great. - What?

268
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,260
- I am? - There's someone she likes.

269
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,190
Really? Who?

270
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,390
Well...

271
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,430
It's someone you two know.

272
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,330
Who?

273
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,770
You know...

274
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,740
Hong Young Seok.

275
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,040
He sat next to me back in high school.

276
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,850
Yes, I remember him, of course. Your first love, right?

277
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,450
Hey, how did you guys meet again?

278
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,650
It happened somehow.

279
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,550
But we aren't officially dating yet.

280
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,450
I'll tell you more later.

281
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,060
And you.

282
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,330
Your grandma kept praising...

283
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,170
that friend of yours and went on about how reliable he is.

284
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,430
Really?

285
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,670
But Yoon Jae and I broke up.

286
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,510
There's a happy ending like yours,

287
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,280
but since I made the best choice for Yoon Jae and myself,

288
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,780
it's still a happy ending too.

289
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,190
My dear daughters.

290
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,420
When did you grow up like this?

291
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,460
Now, I can really put my worries about you two to rest.

292
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,700
All right, guys.

293
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,170
How about we say "Love you, cheers" and clink our glasses?

294
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,340
- Love you. - Love you.

295
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,310
- Cheers! - Cheers!

296
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,650
(3 months later)

297
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,830
I'll enjoy this meal.

298
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,540
Don't steal glances at me like that.

299
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,080
All right.

300
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,350
You're looking great these days.

301
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,920
I can't get sick, you know.

302
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,430
Hey, do you want to go watch a musical with me?

303
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,860
I still have a lot to do.

304
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,540
It's because you're volunteering to do things that you don't need to do.

305
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,770
Are you just going to study and do nothing else?

306
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,770
Yes.

307
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,510
I came here to study, you know.

308
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,040
You're annoying.

309
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,680
Let's go for pho.

310
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,420
I was just going to grab a sandwich.

311
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,450
Again?

312
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,150
I have to send this to the professor by 2pm.

313
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,130
I really am busy.

314
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,620
Brother. Are you doing okay?

315
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,720
I read an episode of something that Crystal Shoes recommended,

316
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,920
and the male lead reminds me of you...

317
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,060
that I can't get into it.

318
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,430
Am I the only one to find it weird?

319
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,830
(The first blind date of my life.)

320
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,530
(Crystal Shoes' Recommendation!)

321
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,770
(My Girlfriend is the Man! Episode 1)

322
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,140
(Publish on a portal, not a blog.)

323
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,340
(Why do our days off go by so fast?)

324
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,470
(When will the movie or TV drama come out?)

325
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,140
(I'll keep reading starting today.)

326
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,050
"Jellyfish. I'll keep reading starting today."

327
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,950
I'll treat you well and honor you,

328
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,750
Jellyfish.

329
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,790
You got quite a few comments this week.

330
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,320
Right?

331
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,360
I owe that to you, Crystal Shoes.

332
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,460
No need to thank a friend.

333
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,900
You won't go home?

334
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,700
What?

335
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,340
I'm going to eat dinner with you.

336
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,340
I...

337
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,680
ate dinner.

338
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,510
It's 2pm, and you had dinner?

339
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,880
I was hungry, so I ate ahead of time.

340
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,800
Didn't you hear something just now?

341
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
No.

342
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,140
The air is dry.

343
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,610
So dry.

344
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,180
Where are you going? No, wait.

345
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,010
What do you want?

346
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,680
- Step aside. - No, there's nothing in here.

347
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,750
You can't...

348
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,790
Oh, my gosh.

349
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,960
What are you doing here?

350
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,560
Hi, Ji Hoon.

351
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,930
It's Min Hyuk. Hey.

352
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,700
Are you all right?

353
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,970
For some reason, you always show up when Min Hyuk is here.

354
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes.

355
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,140
Today, I'm here to change come light bulbs.

356
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,680
You guys are dating, right?

357
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,710
- Yes. - No.

358
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,610
No?

359
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,510
Why would you hide when I'm not her parent?

360
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,320
- You're dating, aren't you? - We're not.

361
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,390
"We're not?"

362
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,320
I rush over when thunder strikes, fix your boiler,

363
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,090
change your light bulbs. Am I some janitor?

364
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,130
We never said we were dating.

365
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,670
Do you have to?

366
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,170
Of course, you do. It's important to define stuff.

367
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,600
Ji Hoon.

368
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,070
Why do you keep visiting her?

369
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,810
- She lives here alone. - What?

370
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
It's because...

371
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,720
I write better when I'm here, and it's quieter too.

372
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,490
It's quiet here?

373
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,350
I see.

374
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,560
Come with me.

375
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,390
I'll show you the quietest place in the world.

376
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,100
Boss. I can vouch for him.

377
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,170
Pass.

378
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,880
See? I was right.

379
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,940
It's not about you.

380
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,150
It's his face.

381
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
What?

382
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,220
Your face vouches for you.

383
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,950
It's perfect.

384
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,020
I was reluctant to leave Min Hyuk in charge.

385
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,620
Do your best for me.

386
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,730
I will. I'll work hard.

387
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,430
Are you going somewhere?

388
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,200
I'll travel for a few months.

389
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,330
You can start today, right?

390
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,870
Yes, I can.

391
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,950
Here.

392
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,590
(Park Yoon Jae)

393
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,220
Yoon Jae's old apron is the only spare we have.

394
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,960
It's fine.

395
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,450
Go sleep at home.

396
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,750
- What time is it? - Three o'clock.

397
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,790
What?

398
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,260
- Come home with me. - What?

399
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,860
I'll finish reading this.

400
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,630
Do you want a biography written about you?

401
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,240
I can't stay any longer. I'm going home.

402
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,870
Okay.

403
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,780
Take care. See you tomorrow.

404
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,990
(Crystal Shoes' Recommendation!)

405
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,290
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)

406
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,660
(Episode 12)

407
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,820
- Hello. - Hey.

408
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,690
That evening,

409
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,360
I waited for Yoon Su, perfectly prepared.

410
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,060
I sweated a lot during my workout.

411
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,860
I got...

412
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,960
so hot.

413
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,170
I will make you fall for me even as a man.

414
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,510
It's dangerous.

415
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,180
Stay away.

416
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,280
The ointment. Where is it?

417
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,750
I'll do everything from now on.

418
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,280
Just sit still.

419
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,690
Since you're here,

420
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,660
why not stay the night?

421
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,760
My sister's away.

422
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,500
I need permission to stay out.

423
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,250
(Jellyfish)

424
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,680
How did you think of that?

425
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,360
That went down as the worst day in Ji Yeon's life.

426
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,460
(Spoon Worm Angel)

427
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,360
(Jellyfish)

428
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,530
Yoon Su would've felt flustered,

429
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,730
but I think he would've found it cute.

430
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,710
(Yu Rim's lips touched mine.)

431
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,940
The kiss with Yu Rim.

432
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,040
Even at that moment, Yoon Su was all I could think about.

433
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,550
Hey!

434
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,390
I was afraid Yoon Su saw,

435
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,130
but I was relieved to see how calm he was.

436
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,800
(Spoon Worm Angel: I was afraid Yoon Su saw,)

437
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,460
(but I was relieved to see how calm he was.)

438
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,600
Who says Yoon Su was calm?

439
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,630
(Jellyfish)

440
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,140
Me, because I'm the writer.

441
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,350
That's not right.

442
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,380
I bet Yoon Su was furious.

443
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,350
How dare you?

444
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,660
Die!

445
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,490
The hanbok date with Yoon Su.

446
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,900
I'd imagined this day for so long.

447
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,030
But what am I even doing?

448
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,110
Even if it were just for show,

449
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,910
I think Yoon Su would've felt really hurt.

450
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,040
Do you think Ji Yeon wanted to play the guy?

451
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,750
She looked forward to the palace date with Yoon Su.

452
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,320
It was on Ji Yeon's bucket list.

453
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,420
(Spoon Worm Angel: She looked forward to...)

454
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,020

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,560

(Jellyfish)

457
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,590
I see.

458
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,060
(Jellyfish: I see.)

459
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,100
"I see?"

460
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,170
I mean, I guess so.

462
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,170

I'm here to report a death.

469

Is it yours?

470
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,120

471
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,760
Oh, dear.

472
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,900

What do you need today?

479
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,250
I need a resident registration certificate.

It's 60 cents, right?

You come here for one every other day.

Yes. It's a hobby of sorts.

484

Give me a moment.

485
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,370
Here.

00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,670
- No? - No.

487
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,980
Okay.

488
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,780
How would you want a guy confess his feelings?

489
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,820
Did you dream of something?

490
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,120
- You're asking that now? - Yes or no?

491
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,990
I did, actually.

492
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,530
What do you want?

493
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,660
It's a dream I had since I was a kid.

494
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,970
- All the lights are out. - All the lights are out.

495
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,240
At the amusement park.

496
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,140
- An amusement park? - Yes.

497
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,810
The moment I step into an empty amusement park,

498
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,510
the lights on the carousel turn on, and you...

499
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,350
No. The guy's standing there.

500
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,320
You're a writer after all.

501
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,950
Did you watch too many movies?

502
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,390
That's impossible in reality.

503
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,990
An amusement park isn't like a playground.

504
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,690
I shouldn't have asked.

505
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,260
That's just a dream I have.

506
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,270
In real life, you can just say it.

507
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,040
- Come on. - That hurt.

508
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,240
I'm embarrassed now.

509
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,470
Don't be upset.

(How much longer will you hold him back?)

512
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,140
(Ji Yeon decided to stop clinging to Yoon Su.)

513
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,680
("Should I really go?")

514
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,210
("Ji Yeon, Do you really want me to leave?")

515
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,160
("Ji Yeon, do you really want me to go?")

516
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,430
("Don't go. Please don't, Yoon Su.")

517
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,730
(Then Yoon Su ran back to me and embraced me.)

518
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,190
(I'm glad I told him. I'm glad I asked him to stay.)

519
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,880
But are you sure you won't regret this?

520
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,380
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,580
My universe is not here.

522
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,750
Your universe is not here?

523
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,990
No.

524
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm sorry.

525
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,360
Well, I don't know what to say, Yoon Jae.

526
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,030
It's very disappointing.

527
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,230
Hold on.

528
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,600
Yes. So you have to hurry up and come here.

529
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,500
What? Are you hurt badly?

530
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,470
No, not really.

531
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,470
It's hard for me to move.

532
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,600
Okay. Wait for me there.

533
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,270
- Yu Ri. - What?

534
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,110
By the way, you should consider freshening up before coming here.

535
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,250
- What? - Nothing. Hurry.

536
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,330
Hey! I'm here.

537
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,730
Where is she?

538
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,370
What's going on?

539
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
I couldn't rent the amusement park.

540
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,270
But will you still go out with me?

541
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,050
Yes. I'd like that.

542
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,620
My gosh.

00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,190
I'm sorry, but we're closing now.

00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:27,900
I got cut from the program.

We sacrificed our relationship for it.

555
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,110
You can get back into the program, right?

556
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,180
I can't.

557
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Open it.

558
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:12,710
"Yoon Jae is a student who has brought me great disappointment."

559
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,580
"However,"

560
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,550
"he is also someone who has reminded me..."

561
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,850
"of the meaning of the universe and love."

562
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,290
"The universe is so vast that..."

563
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,660
"I have to rely on mere probabilities."

564
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,730
"So I have decided to support your happiness..."

565
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,500
"that is closer to certainty."

566
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,870
"Yoon Jae's universe isn't here,"

567
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,000
"but it is where you are."

568
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,010
"John O'Connor."

569
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,350
Oh, this? I didn't ask him to write it.

570
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,080
He wrote it all on his own.

571
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,490
What do I do now?

572
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Right.

573
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,090
Do you want to go and watch some stars?

574
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,530
- What? - We never got to go to Chuncheon.

575
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,730
Let's go now.

576
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,450
Aren't you cold?

577
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,290
You're not hungry yet?

578
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,200
These are so good.

579
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,140
I'm in Chuncheon with you.

580
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,810
I'm not dreaming, right?

581
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,380
It's a dreamlike reality.

582
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,280
It only took an hour for us to get here.

583
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,350
But how long did it take us to come here?

584
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,790
There are so many stars.

585
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,270
This is it.

586
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,270
I love it.

587
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,070
What a fool.

588
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,680
What?

589
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,580
Nothing.

590
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,750
Oh, right. How's Min Joo doing?

591
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:31,690
Oh, right.

592
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:35,990
Yoon Jae.

593
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,160
Give this to your girlfriend.

594
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,800
- What's this? - It's not a bomb.

595
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Just give it to her.

596
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,170
Okay.

597
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,840
Thank you for everything, Min Joo.

598
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,110
Be honest. You're a bit disappointed, aren't you?

599
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,610
You thought I'd break down and beg you to stay,

600
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,150
but I'm letting you go without any drama.

601
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,350
I won't take you back even if you come back.

602
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,660
Okay. Never take me back.

603
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,560
Since this is it for us,

604
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,200
I want to end it on a good note.

605
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:20,070
So I'd like to ask you...

606
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,870
Give me a hug before you go.

607
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,120
Be healthy.

608
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,160
Don't get sick.

609
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,960
Take care.

610
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,700
Bye.

611
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,710
"I thought Kim Ji Hoon who stayed with Yoon Jae was the worst."

612
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,280
"But I was wrong. Yoon Jae without Kim Ji Hoon was the worst."

613
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,190
"I said I'd take care of Yoon Jae, but I'm taking that back."

614
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,820
"I'm returning him to you. Kang Min Joo."

615
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,720
What's this?

616
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,930
She's returning me?

617
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,660
Yes. Even you think this is crazy, right?

618
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,000
Yes.

619
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,500
By the way,

620
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,500
let me tell you this in advance. You can't trade me in.

621
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,210
You have to take care of me until the end.

622
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:33,710
What?

623
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,280
When my mom finds out that I'm in Korea,

624
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,510
she might want to return me too.

625
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,020
Oh, right. The unit next door.

626
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,950
Did someone take the unit?

627
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,920
If it's available, I'd like to rent that unit.

628
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,460
Right. Money.

629
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,330
How much is the deposit?

630
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,060
How much is the rent?

631
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,870
I think the cafe owner just might lend me money.

632
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,500
Does she still have the same phone number?

633
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,870
Does the cafe get busy? What about Min Hyuk?

634
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,770
How's he doing? Is he skipping work?

635
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,040
Be honest. I'm better than him, aren't I?

636
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,540
- What are you doing? - Did you not miss me?

637
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
What?

638
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,250
Did you not miss me?

639
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,690
I missed you.

640
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,140
Should I have fought for you harder like Yoon Su?

641
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,670
To impress you?

642
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,780
Or you should have been more honest like Kim Ji Yeon.

643
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,450
I could have hugged you harder.

644
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,020
Did you...

645
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,920
read my novel?

646
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,160
Jellyfish.

647
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,530
Who do you think that is?

648
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,000
I'm sorry I took so long.

649
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,150
Just five hours ago,

650
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,960
I believed that our breakup was the happy ending of our story.

651
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,160
When I was missing you like crazy and having the toughest time,

652
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,100
I pictured you being happy somewhere in this world.

653
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,000
That's how I put up with it, but...

654
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:47,940
But?

655
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,550
But I think I know now.

656
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,960
Our lives won't be all sunshine and rainbows.

657
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,130
But all the moments...

658
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,300
we spend together will remain as happy memories.

659
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,670
It's me.

660
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,770
Ji Eun.

661
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,370
From the first moment I turned into a man...

662
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,510
Remember.

663
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,280
- It's Yangpyeong. - Yangpyeong.

664
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,150
Yangpyeong.

665
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,880
Yes, sir. I was stationed in Pyeongyang.

666
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,690
- Up in... - I drove a tank...

667
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,990
and trained hard!

668
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,860
I could only get through this...

669
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,230
because you were by my side.

670
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,430
As long as I was with you,

671
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,170
it didn't matter if I were a woman...

672
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,340
or a man.

673
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,870
I was just happy.

674
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,680
I'm back.

675
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,660
That's why you came back too, isn't it?

676
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:14,930
Yes. That's right.

677
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,730
Precisely.

678
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,070
From now on,

679
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,970
it doesn't matter...

680
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,940
whether you are Kim Ji Hoon...

681
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,350
or Kim Ji Eun.

682
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,120
I just want you.

683
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,320
Come on. Hurry. We'll be late to the movie.

684
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,220
You'll still look pretty even without all that effort.

685
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,290
There are so many things I want to do today.

686
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,730
Please?

687
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:22,200
Hey, Kim Ji...

688
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,410
I'm ready.

689
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,250
My gosh, you and your nagging.

690
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,450
I'm not nagging you. We're running late.

691
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,820
Let's hurry.

692
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,020
I forgot to put on earrings. Hold on.

693
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,960
Let's just go. They aren't that important anyway.

694
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,570
Of course, you'll look pretty with earrings.

695
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,470
Hurry up and put them on.

696
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,170
You've changed.

697
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,610
How could he say that?

698
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,650
I didn't do anything. She's always running late.

699
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:17,450
It's been 98 days...

700
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,650
since Yoon Jae came back and I changed back.

701
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,720
Luckily, we are happy together...

702
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,490
in our own universe.

703
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Here.

704
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,500
What? What is this?

705
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,030
- It's finally out. - Yes.

706
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,870
You're the first one to get it.

707
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,600
Thank you.

708
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,240
"To my love, Jellyfish."

709
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,350
"Spoon Worm Angel and Jellyfish."

710
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,820
- Look at this. - It's funny, isn't it?

711
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,180
- Our lives aren't quite like... - This is funny.

712
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,250
everyone else's.

713
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,950
Our daily lives, far from ordinary,

714
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,490
actually became even more special.

715
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:56,520
It looks nice.

716
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,990
- It looks nice, right? - Yes.

717
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,130
I must dress better than Min Hyuk.

718
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,800
So cute.

719
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,480
Ji Eun.

720
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,780
Oh, hey.

721
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,680
- Who is this? - Oh, him.

722
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,790
Say hello. This is my boyfriend, Park Yoon Jae.

723
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,520
And he's from my department. Jang Jin Young.

724
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,830
Gosh, did you get a boyfriend when you were taking a break?

725
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,060
I'm disappointed.

726
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,730
We've been dating even before my break.

727
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,400
- You didn't know. - I wasn't in school then.

728
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:43,640
As if that would have made a difference.

729
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,880
They're waiting for us. Let's go.

730
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,380
What was that?

731
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,090
You're acting weird.

732
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,890
My gosh.

733
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,060
She doesn't know how to pick the right one.

734
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,200
I'm better than him. Darn it.

735
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,940
- Isn't that funny? - Yes.

736
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,570
That's so funny.

737
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,170
That's hilarious. Hey.

738
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,780
My gosh. Seriously.

739
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,810
- I'm tearing up. - I'm going to use the restroom.

740
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,920
- Let me come with you. - Go ahead.

741
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,120
Okay.

742
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,190
Yoon Jae.

743
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,060
What do I do?

744
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,790
What? Is something wrong?

745
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,430
I think Yu Ri is quite sick.

746
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,860
She's sick? What's wrong with her?

747
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,200
Her head.

748
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,500
Don't tell anyone.

749
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,570
Not even your girlfriend.

750
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,840
Why don't you explain to me what's going on?

751
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,100
She must've been devastated when Ji Hoon suddenly left.

752
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,240
She's been saying weird things lately.

753
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,640
Like what?

754
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,350
She said Kim Ji Eun and Kim Ji Hoon were the same person.

755
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:02,820
She said they went back and forth between Ji Eun and Ji Hoon.

756
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,950
I cut her some slack...

757
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,190
for having a creative mind since she's a writer.

758
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,120
But is this a delusional disorder or something?

759
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,360
I'm not sure.

760
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,560
I'm not sure about that.

761
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,510
Please reassure your girlfriend...

762
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,410
that she's not a weirdo.

763
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:34,950
Hey.

764
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:36,080
- And that she's a nice person. - What?

765
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,490
Okay. I got it.

766
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,010
Yoon Jae. Look over there.

767
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,980
My gosh.

768
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,580
Ji Hye.

769
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,180
Continue that inside.

770
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,550
Ji Hye. Continue that inside.

771
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,120
You guys...

772
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,690
If you guys are going to be together all the time,

773
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,520
you should start paying rent too, Yoon Jae.

774
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,260
Yoon Jae?

775
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,400
What? Hey, Yoon Jae.

776
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,630
What? Young Seok!

777
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,870
- How do you know him? - What?

778
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,570
Yoon Jae...

779
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,270
Hey, your face.

780
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,080
Oh, no. Is the lipstick stain that bad?

781
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,540
It's all over your face too. Oh, no. Let me wipe that.

782
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,810
- It's all over your face too. - Oh, no. What do I do?

783
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,580
Then... My gosh.

784
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,590
What? You two know each other?

785
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:49,560
Yes. I introduced him to the cafe owner.

786
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,090
- Things didn't work out, though. - Both of us.

787
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,060
He's my sister's first love.

788
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:58,570
Don't tell my sister about that.

789
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:00,170
Okay.

790
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,970
A life shared by Kim Ji Hoon and Kim Ji Eun.

791
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,770
We embrace miracles...

792
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,080
like they're part of our daily lives.

793
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,660
(Kim Ji Eun, Kim Ji Hoon)

794
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,570
- Are you ready to go? - Yes.

795
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,570
- Let's go. - Okay.

796
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,340
- All right. - That must be heavy.

797
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,610
It's fine. This is nothing.

798
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,080
Let's go.

799
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,910
- What should we eat? - What should we eat?

800
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,750
Oh, right. What time are we arriving in Chuncheon?

801
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,950
At 5pm.

802
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:51,850
- Our day-to-day lives... - It's going to be so tasty.

803
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,020
are miracles from the universe.

804
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,890
It's also love.

805
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,140
(Special thanks to Jinyoung for his appearance)

806
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:43,140
(Thank you for watching My Girlfriend is the Man!)

807
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,310
(My Girlfriend is the Man!)
