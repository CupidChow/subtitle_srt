Where did you get this car?

210
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,230
It's actually my boss' car.

211
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,040
I said I'm going away with you,
and she lent it to me. Wild, right?

she lent this expensive car
to a part-timer for no reason?

You could say it's the result
of my constant dedication and effort.

Really? Then, want to have me?

225
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,960

You know, since I have been

raised properly by my parents,

330
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,930
I am quietly enduring this ridiculous situation.

331
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,980
But actually, I wonder if it's not
too late to call the police.

332
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,560
Go ahead if you want.

333
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,780
I'm curious what happens next, too.

00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,420
Could you please close your legs...

00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,570
Let's be honest. This situation
does not make sense.

My very average little sister

337
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,430
turned into a hottie like you overnight.

338
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,330
What was the focus of that statement?

339
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,230
The problem isn't that your
average sister turned into a hottie.

340
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,600
N-No, that's not what I meant.
What I was saying is...

341
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,510
Why are you speaking to me
so casually when we've just met?

342
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,520
W-W-What? Oh, my.

343
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,410
I'll really call the police! I'll report.

344
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,400
Don't come near me! Don't come. I said I'll call.

345
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,580
- Look at this.
- I mean it!

346
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,130
Don't come near me. I'll make a report.

347
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,340
- Really. I will.
- Kim Ji Hye, look at this!

348
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,200
I can't imagine it, but if something happens to us

349
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,980
like Mom and Dad said, just in case,

350
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,800
let's show each other these.

351
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,110
Once we show these, we verify and

352
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,580
believe each other, no matter what.

353
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,070
Until we return to normal again.

354
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,760
But...

355
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,770
what if this goes away, too?

356
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,240
I hadn't thought about that.

357
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,350
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

358
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,750
Got it?

359
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,120
Sure.

360
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,800
- So cute.
- Cute.

361
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,350
Thankfully, this is still here.

362
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,620
W-W-Why is that on your shoulder?

363
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,250
What do I do?

364
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,590
What do I do now?

365

What are you talking about?

729
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,400

733
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,040
I need time.

00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,040
As long as you need.

735
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,070
You can take as long as you want.

736
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,680
But...

737
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,640
we're not... ending it like this, right?

738
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,650
