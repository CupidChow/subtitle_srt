1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:13,330

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,989

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,760

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,300

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,390

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,350

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,190
 Are you sure you want this?

8
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,100
 Even if she meets someone else,

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,270
 dates him, loves him,

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,320
 and eventually leaves your life forever?

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,530
 No.

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,120
 I'm not sure.

13
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,960
Dan, you should marry into my family.

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,649
You don't have a sister.

15
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,920
You can have my brother.

16
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,240
Stop talking nonsense.

17
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,979
Why are you here again?

18
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,939
I was about to get off the taxi,

19
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,969
then my eyes met with Jae Gang's eyes as he was coming back from work.

20
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,219
He said he'll kill me if I ever come home hammered again.

21
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,589
So I stayed in the taxi and came straight here.

22
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,759
I opened the door for him thinking he was with you, but he was alone.

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,019
He insisted on having a drink with you, but I managed to put him to sleep.

24
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,589
He said he needed the bed, so he slept on mine without showering.

25
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,399
Dongsaeng, don't be so critical of me.
 (T/N: meaning younger brother)

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,200
You'll be exactly like me once you go to college.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,020
My gosh, why are you cursing me?

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,539
Anyway, why were you late?

29
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,580
I fell asleep thinking you'd be back soon.

30
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:45,450
Oh, I was out taking a walk.

31
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,179
Goodness, why can't you come home earlier?

32
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,429
Think of your family who's waiting.

33
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,900
Hey, that's not for you to say after that trouble you caused yesterday.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,780
Trouble?

35
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,560
What trouble?

36
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,620
Really? I really broke Hye Sun's car?

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,029
I'm telling you.

38
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:11,249
Wait, and not only was that car expensive, but Professor Shin was there, too?

39
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,690
Correct.

40
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,390
Anyway, you should call Hye Sun.

41
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,299
Hey, how can you be so calm when your friend is about to go bankrupt?

42
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,189
You're bust, not me.

43
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,110
Darn it, my life is over.

44
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,879
Dam, can you tell my brothers

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,789
that it was a pure accident that I got hammered and broke that car?

46
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,109
They really adore you.

47
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,039
Stop pestering me. Go away.

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,199
Dam, you know that I love you, right?

49
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,570
I don't need your love.

50
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,890
Let's begin the class.

51
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,280
I didn't know Professor Shin was here.

52
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,780
Open page 201.

53
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,400
Today's subject is the philosophy of history.

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,680
 I like someone else.

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,169
 Is it Jae Jin?

56
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,760
May I borrow a pencil?

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,389
Thank you so much.

58
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,980
 He's her type? But she could do much better.

59
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,880
 I think I'm better than him.

60
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,470
We must continuously attempt to observe human history as a whole.

61
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,518
This is an effort to explain the essence and meaning of history.

62
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,350
That's why the philosophy of history

63
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,930
has become important.

64
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,320
 I shouldn't be curious.

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,120
 I'll watch over her for a short while, then I must move out of her life.

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,009
 There's nothing I can do, nor should I try to do anything.

67
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,200
That's all for today's lecture.

68
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,660
 - Thank you, Professor. 
 - Thank you, Professor.

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,839
Professor.

70
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,579
Are you coming to the history trip with our department tomorrow?

71
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,140
I have an important meeting to attend.

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,959
You have to come with us on our next trip, then.

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,610
- Are you going to meet with Hye Sun? 
 - Why is he meeting her?

74
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,130
Why do you look so uncomfortable?

75
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,150
I just feel really bad.

76
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,619
Was it that devastating to run into your ex-girlfriend?

77
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,780
So much that you drank up every single drop of alcohol in Seoul?

78
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,260
Well, I guess.

79
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,410
How much was the estimate?

80
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,209
The estimate?

81
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,109
Oh, I threw that car away.

82
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,080
You threw it away?

83
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,908
I thought I only broke the side-view mirror.

84
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,550
You're right.

85
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,370
But I never get anything fixed.

86
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,390
Then how much do I owe you?

87
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,109
 Is she going to demand I pay everything for her new car?

88
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,059
 Then what do I say to my brothers?

89
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,749
 It might be safer for me to sell my kidney off.

90
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,160
- Jae Jin. 
 - Yes?

91
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,720
Don't get scared. I won't ask you to pay me back.

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,069
What?

93
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,250
Just forget it.

94
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,550
I recently became fond of white cars, so I got a new one with this chance.

95
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,959
But still, that's a little...

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,599
A little what? You don't have any money.

97
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,670
- How can you tell? 
 - By the way you look.

98
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,239
But still, let me chip in a little.

99
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,279
I'll ask my brothers or work to make a couple hundred thousand won.

100
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,930
It's great that you're letting me off like this, but I know I'd always feel sorry for this.

101
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,760
 What an oddball.

102
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,380
 Most people tend to run off before I change my mind.

103
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,899
It's fine.

104
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,849
I don't need your pocket money.

105
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,450
I'm leaving.

106
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,080
See you at the history trip or whatever tomorrow.

107
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,660
Wait, Hye Sun.

108
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,699
Can you come with me for a second?

109
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,500
To where?

110
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,430
Hey, Hye Sun.

111
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,879
Since you seem to have all the money you could want,

112
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,079
I want to pay you back by doing something else.

113
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,270
First off, I brought you a book that might help you. Here.

114
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,460

115
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,419
Are you calling me stupid?

116
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,450
No, you aren't stupid at all.

117
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,889
I just wanted to do everything I can to pay you back.

118
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,840
I'll be good to you until the day I don't feel sorry.

119
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,330

120
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,489
Hello, Professor. Please excuse my behavior from yesterday.

121
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,129
I'm sorry you had to see that.

122
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,180
Young man.

123
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,100
You shouldn't drink so much and cause trouble to Dam...

124
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,490
And cause inconvenience to people around you.

125
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,080
Yes, sir. I'll be careful from now on.

126
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,230
 That's called jealousy.

127
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,940
Be honest with me. You were jealous to see them together.

128
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,609
Did you lose your conscience when you lost your Bead?

129
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,099
Not only did you fall for such a young kid, but you also got jealous of another kid.

130
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,690
You're far from becoming a decent human in many ways.

131
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,009
What? What do you want? What can you do anyway?

132
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,370
What I said is true.

133
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,430
You once said that

134
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,410
we never had a happy ending whenever we started having feelings.

135
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,660
You're right.

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,220
I've seen that bad ending once before,

137
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,610
then I lived for a very long time without showing affection to anybody.

138
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:25,820
Everything seemed futile since that day, and I couldn't see any hope.

139
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,930
What's going on? Why are you suddenly so sentimental?

140
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,370
You were in pain every time you were in love.

141
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,420
So how did you let yourself fall back in love?

142
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,050
What do you think about him?

143
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,340
Are you setting me up with him? He's not my type.

144
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,150
You're insane.

145
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,190
I just want to know how he seems compared to me.

146
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,400
In a nutshell, you want to know which one of you two is better.

147
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,320
You're better.

148
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,850
Honestly speaking, if you keep your mouth shut, you'd usually be the hottest guy.

149
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,440
Really?

150
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Hey, go buy yourself something you want to eat.

151
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,890
If I wasn't your sister, I'd date you right away.

152
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,990
You have huge eyes and cute dimples, too.

153
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,649
He can't be compared to you.

154
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,499
You didn't have to go that far.

155
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,100
Here.

156
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,880
So, what happened?

157
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,969
Did someone say he's better? Who's this crazy witch?

158
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,480
Cut it out before I take it back.

159
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,460
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,040
Please excuse me.

161
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,370
Well, yes. He's not even in my league.

162
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,340
 How are things going with Seon Woo Sunbae?

163
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,169
I set you up on a date with him.

164
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,870
Wasn't I right? Isn't he interested?

165
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,279
So? Are you going to date him?

166
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,010
Did you tell him that you have a close guy friend who comes and sleeps over after night outs?

167
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,510
Shut your mouth, dummy.

168
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,670
It's not what you think between that sunbae and me, so mind your own business.

169
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,230
What have you been printing?

170
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,689
It's for my presentation.

171
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,370
I have to give a presentation on the trip.

172
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,110
Why are you sighing?

173
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,550
Come to think about it, this is odd.

174
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,890
What is?

175
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,690
You used to love going on history trips

176
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,329
as if you were on an anniversary trip with a boyfriend.

177
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,759
You'd pack your cameras and bags a week before.

178
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,130
But you look depressed this time.

179
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,280
Depressed?

180
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,550
I'm not depressed.

181
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,200
Move.

182
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,570
What's going on? She has such a sad face and tone.

183
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,140
Are things not going well with Seon Woo?

184
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,130
Yes, it's disrespectful for history and artifacts

185
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,800
to go on a history trip in this mood.

186
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,610
I'll go, have fun, and get over him completely.

187
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,100

188
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,649
Dam, Jae Jin!

189
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,099
I went shopping for this trip. So? How do I look? Pretty?

190
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:43,929
You need a pretty face to look pretty.

191
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,870
Hello, Professor, TA.

192
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,029
I'm so excited to learn so much from you during this history trip.

193
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,469
Sure.

194
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,139
Seok, I'll follow with the professor.

195
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:01,429
- Make sure you keep everyone together. 
 - Yes.

196
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,759
It must be tough to be the student representative.

197
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,600
Don't mention it. I'll see you later.

198
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,109
"I'll see you later, Professor, TA." Hey.

199
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:18,199
Did you see how Seok was dying to get on the good side of the professor and the TA?

200
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,389
It looks like you're dying to do some Seok bashing.

201
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:21,540
Hey, be honest.

202
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,649
Something happened other than how you two always compete for the best grades.

203
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,310
There's no other reason to─

204
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,139
Forget it. Nothing else happened.

205
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,389
Is Professor Shin coming?

206
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,249
Professor Seo only adores Seok,

207
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,500
so I wanted to make sure I get on Professor Shin's good side.

208
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,929
He had an important meeting to attend.

209
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,249
It's a huge relief.

210
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,919
I think I got on his bad side.

211
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:45,349
Why? He hasn't been here for a long time.

212
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,850
Well, on the day I broke Hye Sun's car,

213
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,360
Professor Shin was there too.

214
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,779
Why was he there?

215
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,369
No idea. I'm not really sure, but he was in Hye Sun's car.

216
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:59,109
Wait, why would a professor meet with a student outside of school?

217
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,399
Hey, forget it. Stop asking weird questions.

218
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,490
Let's get on the bus.

219
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,970
Why not? Don't you want to know?

220
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,750
- May I sit here? 
 - Of course.

221
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,640
Hye Sun, I have a question.

222
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,439
When Jae Jin broke your car, why were you with Professor Shin?

223
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,020
What?

224
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,610
- There was a bit of an accident. 
 - Like what?

225
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,590
I'm so tired from studying TOEIC last night.
 (T/N: Test of English for International Communication; international standardized test of English language)

226
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,970
I think everyone is here. Let's take off.

227
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,039
Let's eat lunch on our way there.

228
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,930
What are we eating?

229
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,090
- It looks so good. 
 - One second.

230
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,349
Hye Sun, try this.

231
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,760
Drumsticks are the best when it comes to chicken.

232
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,200
What? I was going to eat that.

233
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,969
She lived abroad, so I'm sure she never had any Korean chicken.

234
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,130
Try to be more considerate.

235
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,349
And you already know how I'm indebted to her.

236
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,449
Hey!

237
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,010
Why do we have to pay her back for you with our braised chicken?

238
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,920
You can have it. I don't want it.

239
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,490
 Wait, why won't she eat chicken?

240
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,540
 Is there a reason why she can't eat it?

241
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,450
I like the wings better.

242
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,540
Really?

243
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,390
All right. The wings are so big.

244
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,550
- Thanks. 
 - Sure.

245
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,760
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

246
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,360
 She's fine.

247
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,680
Try to be more careful, okay?

248
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,919
Please, Moo Geun.

249
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,639
- Hye Sun, are you all right? 
 - Yes.

250
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,480
Enjoy your lunch.

251
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,930
 And she's okay after running into a Tiger.

252
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,330
 It doesn't seem like he hid his Bead in her.

253
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,460
 Then what was this accident that put them together?

254
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,000
 I'm no Arthur Conan Doyle or Sherlock.

255
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,060
 Why am I trying to put the puzzle together?

256
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,349
Hey, why are you only eating the soup? Have some meat.

257
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,950
Okay.

258
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,999
- It's good. 
 - Really? Do you want more?

259
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,189
Yes.

260
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:08,140

261
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,770
Hey, Dam.

262
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:22,170
Don't mind how I asked you out.

263
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,750
But don't tune it out completely.

264
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,750
What do you want?

265
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,159
Dam, what are you doing here? Let's go.

266
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:38,100
Hey.

267
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,729
Are you her manager?

268
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,629
Why do you always come and fetch her?

269
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,689
Because she's not comfortable around you.

270
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,480
No, we're fine.

271
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,350
I apologized to her many times, and we're all good now.

272
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,789
I wouldn't say we're good. We're in the process.

273
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,730
Gosh, Dam. You're so generous.

274
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,050
I wouldn't forgive him for life.

275
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,360
You're the petty type.

276
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,120
Much better than the immoral type, like you.

277
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,100
Stop that, both of you.

278
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,980
This is like a scene from a coming-of-age drama.

279
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,810
Hello.

280
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,309
 I thought you might be depressed to death, but you should be jealous instead.

281
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,830
 I think there's nothing more honest and healthy than jealousy.

282
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,240
 You wanted to know how I could love again, right?

283
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,479
 I didn't want to give up without even trying, fettered by my old history.

284
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,370
Then I'll begin my presentation on the Buddhist culture and palaces of the Goryeo era.

285
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,739
Buddhism in Goryeo succeeded its culture...

286
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,050
Why won't he respond?

287
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,469
Directly from Shilla.

288
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,480
Goryeo announced Buddhism as the state religion,

289
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,179
then the culture began to flourish.

290
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,609
Sutra plaque worked as a cover for annotations of "Tripitaka Koreana,"

291
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,679
but it's also created with exquisiteness beyond its purpose.

292
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,019
- It's carved with many shapes... 
 - How does she know that?

293
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,559
such as dragons, lotuses, and more.

294
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,810
- When you touch it, it─ 
  - "Touch it"?

295
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,160
- She couldn't have touched it. 
 - Tell me about it.

296
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,879
 And that's called a sutra plaque.

297
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,460
 It's a sort of a mark to discern what's written in the annotation.

298
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,270
 I'm sure no one else would get to touch this, right?

299
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,120
 You're right.

300
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,150
I meant that it's so exquisite that it feels like I've touched it.

301
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,770
So, let's move on.

302
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Here.

303
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,360
Oh, thank you.

304
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,790
Professor Shin!

305
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,449
You're here.

306
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:46,010
Goodness, we've all been waiting for you.

307
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,330
- I'm so glad he came. 
 - He's so tall.

308
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,730
And he's good-looking.

309
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,380
Why is he suddenly here?

310
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,509
Dam, may I ask you for a favor?

311
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,919
What is it?

312
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,039
Professor Shin will be in charge of your club from now on.

313
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,080
Since you're the president, you can hop on his car

314
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,540
and update him briefly.

315
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,859
Me?

316
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,929
Wait, I'm not ready to give him a briefing,

317
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:22,910
and it's still awkward.

318
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,060
Then I'll do it.

319
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,520
I was about to get sick from the bus ride. Is that okay?

320
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,060
Sure.

321
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,470
Is that okay, Dam?

322
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,929
Sure. Please do that for me.

323
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,480
Okay.

324
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,630
Professor Shin Woo Yeo.

325
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
Wait for me.

326
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,100
 Is there really something going on between them?

327
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,220
Please excuse me.

328
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,579
I can't believe you drove here just because of that picture.

329
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:06,390
A fox shouldn't be so clear about his intentions.

330
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,199
Who said I came here because of the picture?

331
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,440
It's all right. You can be honest.

332
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,240
I sent it to you to make you come.

333
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,269
Anyway, if you like her so much,

334
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,460
why don't you hurry and turn into a human so you can meet her again?

335
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,149
What's on your mind?

336
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:29,840
You drove down at once to see her, but you look so gloomy.

337
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,550
I'm concerned about something.

338
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,990
Concerned? What about?

339
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,550
Yes.

340
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,700
Yes, I understand. Yes, Ms. TA.

341
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,819
There has been a change in our next destination.

342
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:51,389
Why? Is there a problem?

343
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,929
There was a rockslide near Songni Mountain,

344
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,410
so we can't make it to Beopju Temple.

345
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,270
Then where are we going?

346
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,809
- Take one for me too. 
 - All right!

347
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,479
- Stop that. 
 - I want one with Seon Woo too.

348
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,329
- Let's take a picture. 
 - Let's do that.

349
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,389
- Let's do it over there. 
 - Okay.

350
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,419
- Okay. 
 - Let's take one, too, Seon Woo.

351
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,619
- All right. 
 - Okay!

352
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,240
Seon Woo, let's take a picture.

353
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,430
 I had no idea he brought me here to erase my memories,

354
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,050
 so I wished we could come back here together.

355
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,710
 I must've looked ridiculous

356
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,240
 as I wished for the impossible.

357
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:59,590
Why are you staring at her? Do you like her that much?

358
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,300
I don't think her memories are erased.

359
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,590
Right, I'm sure her memories aren't...

360
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,030
What?

361
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,589
 It's carved with many shapes such as dragons, lotuses, and more.

362
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:16,350
 When you touch it─

363
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,140
 "Touch it"?

364
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,890
 Right.

365
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,320
 I meant that it's so exquisite that it feels like I've touched it.

366
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,749
That's impossible.

367
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:36,640
If she knows everything, there's no reason for her to pretend she doesn't remember.

368
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,700
That's true, but...

369
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,110
Hye Sun, try this.

370
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,330
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes.

371
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,550
- Don't.
- Thanks.

372
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,529
- Gosh, it's so good. 
 - I'll do it.

373
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,170
No, it's okay. I will.

374
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,260
No, I'll do it.

375
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,529
Hey, what's going on between you two?

376
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:12,760
Do I smell love instead of pork belly? Good luck!

377
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,829
- Seon Woo Sunbae. 
 - Our meat is a mess too.

378
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:20,870
- Take a seat.
 - It's completely burnt.

379
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,309
 - A random game that we love. 
 - A random game that we love.

380
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:32,909
 - Which game? Game, start. 
 - Which game? Game, start.

381
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:36,019
Hey, are you sharing your soju with me?

382
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,209
What? You're drunk.

383
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,279
No, are you sharing your soju with me?

384
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,959
You're so drunk.

385
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,409
- I'm not drunk. 
 - Don't drink too much.

386
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,730
I've had just enough. It wasn't that much.

387
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,330
 Do you know what it's like to get drunk?

388
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,600
I'm not drunk.

389
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
Where are you going? 
  (T/N: informal speech)

390
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
To get some air.

391
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,400
Hye Sun.

392
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,770
I have a question.

393
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,990
Why did you

394
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,290
speak casually with the professor?

395
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,989
I did? Did I do that?

396
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,009
Yes, you did.

397
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,450
She did, right? Didn't she?

398
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,219
Hey, Hye Sun used to live abroad,

399
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,499
so the Korean language isn't easy for her.

400
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,380
You're so drunk.

401
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,820
Come on out. Let's get some fresh air.

402
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,519
Come. I'll buy you ice cream.

403
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,550
Okay! Dam, I'll be back.

404
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,680
Hey, Hye Sun.

405
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,310
May I ask you a question?

406
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,820
What is it?

407
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,920
Well,

408
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,220
you said you and Professor Shin got into an accident, right?

409
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,670
What happened?

410
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,589
It was just a minor collision.

411
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:16,450
I drove into his car and caused the accident,

412
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,310
so I gave him a ride.

413
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,800
I see.

414
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,490
Why do you want to know?

415
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,970
No, it's nothing.

416
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,169
Where's my wallet?

417
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,709
- It's so cold. 
 - It's really gone.

418
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,819
Why do you always lose your wallet?

419
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,039
- It's really gone. 
 - Come on.

420
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,370
Guys, I'm tired. I should go.

421
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,200
Hey, Dam, wait.

422
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,130
I remember putting it in my bag.

423
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,520
I think you were right. She remembers everything.

424
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,109
She asked why we were together that night.

425
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,820
She's very concerned about you,

426
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,810
which means she must remember everything.

427
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,310
Then why is she...

428
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,200
If that really is the case, I think I know why.

429
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:39,250
She must feel the same as I did back then.

430
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,949
 Goodness.

431
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,160

432
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,530
 Aigoo.

433
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,700
 Please erase my memories.

434
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,930
 I ask you.

435
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,880
 I guess he passed as we expected.

436
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,360
 Do you want me to erase everything?

437
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,690
 No, just...

438
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,020
 Just leave a little bit behind.

439
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,520
 Just enough so I wouldn't want to kill myself.

440
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,080
She probably didn't want to lose

441
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,740
all the memories she made with you,

442
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,340
so she is trying to hold onto at least some of them.

443
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,440
 Miss Dam. Do you remember what I said then?

444
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,330
 I said I had never had a family,

445
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,840
 but I felt like I got one now.

446
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,730
 I really meant what I said.

447
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,880
 You won't remember a thing.

448
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,280
 You just had a short dream, Miss Dam.

449
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,490
 As of now,

450
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,140
 our contract is over.

451
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,990
 He looked sad when he said that.

452
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,930
 Maybe he let me go

453
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,220
 because he cared about me.

454
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,320
- Miss Dam. 
 - Yes?

455
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,240
Your memories aren't erased, are they?

456
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,630
I'm not sure what you mean.

457
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,830
You remember everything.

458
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,730
Why do you want to know that, Sir?

459
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,059
Miss Dam?

460
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,170
Why do you want to know if my memories have been erased or not?

461
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,219
Why are you doing this to me, Sir?

462
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,729
It's not like I borrowed your money and never paid you back,

463
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,850
or stole your money, Sir.

464
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,849
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

465
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,130
 So she actually remembers me.

466
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,830
I told you I was a clingy person.

467
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,450
So why did you have to show up like this and...

468
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,769
We need to talk, Miss Dam.

469
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,439
Don't do anything.

470
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,249
Don't talk to me. Don't act like you know me.

471
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,739
Don't do anything.

472
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,420
You ended it without asking me. So why are you doing this to me?

473
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,119
Stop worrying about me.

474
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,840
Stop grabbing my hand so randomly.

475
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,600
Because that makes my heart flutter.

476
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,359
What did you say?

477
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,469
Whenever you do that,

478
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,060
my heart pounds like crazy.

479
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,099
Miss Dam.

480
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,439
Tell me, Sir. Was I nothing but just a Bead carrier?

481
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,420
Was I?

482
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,190
Have you really never had any feelings for me?

483
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,720
Miss Dam.

484
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,490
The reason why I don't say what you want to hear

485
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,030
is not because I don't care about you.

486
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
It's because you don't deserve me.

487
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,110
You should be with someone who is safer and more normal.

488
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,410
Miss Dam,

489
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,250
you are too good for me.

490
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,180
I don't think I'm too good for you.

491
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,388
And I don't want to be calculative and all

492
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,350
because I'm not taking this lightly.

493
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,750
I like you.

494
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,920
And I want you to like me too.

495
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,710
 A reckless and bold confession.

496
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,450
 Now that I think about it, she has always been like this.

497
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,638
 Now that we're on the subject, I want an agreement too.

498
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,120
 I'd like to make three requests.

499
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,889
 She never hesitates and she's daring.

500
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,408
 I'm 22. Born in 1999, the Year of the Rabbit.

501
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,160
 I'm 999. Born in 1012, during the reign of Hyeonjong of Goryeo.

502
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,870
 Living a thousand years,

503
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,960
 I have seen, heard, and touched many things,

504
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,530
 but I have never felt anything.

505
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,200
 Just like the sceneries out the window,

506
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,090
 everything in my life passed by so fast and hazily.

507
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,120
 Then I met her, and for the first time,

508
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,280
 I felt like I fell from clouds

509
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,610
 and bumped into reality.

510
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,129
 Can we talk about how we address each other?

511
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,019
 How about "sir"?

512
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,400
 I became

513
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,819
 a significant being to someone.

514
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,430
 "Sir"...

515
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,219
 Good morning, Sir.

516
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,899
 Good morning. Did you sleep well?

517
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,030
 I was no longer a dream that vanishes after a night.

518
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,760
 I became a part of someone's everyday life.

519
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,840
 I made it, safe.

520
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,389
 Hi, Sir. I'm home.

521
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,160
 - Did you have a good day? 
 - Yes.

522
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,560
 I had someone to wait for,

523
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,050
 so time stopped passing by meaninglessly.

524
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,140
 I'm in love.

525
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,080
 What has possibly made this girl so bold,

526
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
 clumsy,

527
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,570
 and true to herself?

528
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,750
 I found it very silly, yet at the same time

529
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,330
 very lovely.

530
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,630
♫  Don't erase me  ♫

531
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,540
♫  I am looking at you  ♫

532
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,110
♫  and I love you  ♫

533
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,290
♫  Let me protect you, like this forever  ♫

534
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,880
I warned you

535
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,750
that you're too good for me.

536
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,790
♫  If passed time stops for you  ♫

537
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,630
Now,

538
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,930
you can't take it back.

539
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:21,780
♫   Remember my heart, that spent nights filled with you   ♫

540
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,200
Woo Yeo reminded me of that stupid memory for nothing.

541
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,540
Hye Sun, what are you doing here alone?

542
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,120
I've been looking for you.

543
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,999
Me? Why?

544
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,899
Why? Because I couldn't find you.

545
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,420
Also, there's something I wanted to tell you.

546
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,990
- Something to tell me? 
 - Yes. The thing is,

547
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,729
you said you were fine, but it kept bothering me,

548
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,899
so I put all my useable items on the flea market app.

549
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,120
And they just got all sold out.

550
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,030
I think I can at least partly pay back what I owe to you.

551
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,770
Why can't you be more calculative?

552
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,079
I am being calculative.

553
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,650
I calculated how much I owed you and I'm paying it back.

554
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,640
Let's say you are then.

555
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,220
It's cold. Let's go now.

556
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,160
Gosh, it's so cold.

557
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,719
What are you doing? You said you'd pay the money back.

558
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,999
Then you don't need to be nice to me anymore.

559
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,820
This is not about the money.

560
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,060
I just don't want you to be cold.

561
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,999
I guess this is why your ex was so clingy.

562
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,650
What? What do you mean?

563
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,180
I mean this is good.

564
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,129
- Wait up. 
 - Stop following me.

565
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,150
- Come on. 
 - Stop it.

566
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,910
What are you doing?

567
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,510
Why do you think my memories haven't been erased?

568
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,640
Not sure.

569
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,870
I tried to, but it didn't work out.

570
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,400
Could it be because I'm a strong-minded person like my mom?

571
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,580
It might be.

572
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,200
Is there anything else you want to ask me? I can tell you everything.

573
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,650
What's the relationship between you and Hye Sun?

574
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,690
There seemed to be something going on between you.

575
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,259
We've just known each other for a long time.

576
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,830
For over 700 years.

577
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,640
Is Hye Sun a gumiho too?

578
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,209
Not anymore.

579
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,709
She became a human four years ago.

580
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,200
That's why she was too pretty to be true.

581
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,809
Did it bother you?

582
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:26,350
Of course. So much I had a hard time pretending to not remember anything.

583
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,429
How did you feel

584
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,260
when you realized I remembered everything?

585
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,740
Let's go.

586
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,080
Come on. Tell me.

587
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,119
Were you happy?

588
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,300
Or did you think you should cast a stronger spell?

589
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,820
Tell me.

590
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,560
I'm not sure.

591
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,230
Sir, let's say bye here.

592
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,020
I didn't mean we should break up. I mean we should go home now.

593
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,450
I got it.

594
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,390
See you tomorrow.

595
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,520
See you tomorrow.

596
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,700
Bye.

597
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,450
Bye.

598
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,520
♫  Thank you and I’m sorry, words I wasn't able to tell you   ♫

599
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,240
♫  Scared that you wouldn't like me, I still act calm around you  ♫

600
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,830
♫   But in case my feelings seep out of my heart, I bring my hands together and try to I hide my face   ♫

601
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,780
♫   But my laughter blossoms out   ♫

602
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,660
♫  Thank you and I like you, the last words I said to you  ♫

603
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,140
♫   Goodbye, let’s meet again  ♫

604
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,110
I guess I can't complain even if I get a punishment.

605
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,790
♫   And I’m worried I'll think of you again  ♫

606
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:16,360
♫   Of your face that looked at me and smiled. So I’m only looking at the sky   ♫

607
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,670
♫   The song I sang with you   ♫

608
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,980
 Guess who I am!

609
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,980
 It's you, Miss Dam.

610
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,140
 I didn't delete...

611
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,770
 I couldn't delete your contact.

612
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,779

613
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,650
 Yours was deleted by a certain someone without asking, but I remembered it.

614
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,180
 Good night, Sir.

615
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:38,209

616
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,660
 Good night to you too, Miss Dam.

617
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:41,110

618
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,340

619
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,629
- Let's get off the bus. 
 - I'm hungry.

620
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,710
- See you later. 
 - Gosh, I'm so tired.

621
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,649
Go ahead. I need to stop by the classroom.

622
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,059
Okay. Have a good weekend, Dam.

623
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,200
- Bye. 
 - Bye then.

624
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,720
Excuse me.

625
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,600

626
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,900
What?

627
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,500
I haven't seen him before in my major.

628
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,780
I wonder if he's finished.

629
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,590
You're back.

630
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,430
Sir.

631
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,840
I wanted to stop by your dorm to say hi,

632
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,430
but I didn't want to put you in trouble.

633
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,150
That's so thoughtful of you.

634
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,680
By the way, will you continue to work here?

635
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,920
For the time being, yes.

636
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,789
- Does it make you uncomfortable? 
 - No way. I love it.

637
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,480
I want to be with you all the time.

638
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,080
 Maybe I was too honest.

639
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,420
 But that's how I feel.

640
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,720
Sir,

641
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,079
as you know, I have never been in a relationship before.

642
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,330
So I don't know what I should do.

643
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,650
I may be a little clumsy, but please be understanding.

644
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,260
Of course, I will.

645
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,020
I might ask you weird things from time to time.

646
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:53,160
- What, for example? 
 - Can I hold your hand?

647
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,780
I've been controlling myself for a very long time,

648
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,800
and I can't seem to anymore.

649
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,430
Here. Hold it.

650
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,670
I got a little nervous, but it wasn't that weird.

651
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,260
I could have asked you something even stranger.

652
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,830
Even stranger?

653
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,519
Just kidding. Relax.

654
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,390
Now I want to tease you even more.

655
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,080
Go on and ask me anything.

656
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,575
I don't think...

657
00:45:56,576 --> 00:45:59,600
I have any further questions.

658
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,790
Just kidding.

659
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,220
Relax. Now I want to tease you even more.

660
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,410
 He's a fox after all. I should know my place.

661
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,280
Do you have any plans for this evening?

662
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,270
- I'll go home and unpack my─ 
 - How about we go on a date?

663
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,530
Yes, I'd love to.

664
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,789
He thinks it's important to be neat and dressed nicely,

665
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,939
so I'll skip those that don't look neat.

666
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,540
Something like this? Maybe this is too serious.

667
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,160
He thinks one must be clean-cut,

668
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,280
so I shouldn't be untidy.

669
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,590
It's so convenient because it's wireless.

670
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,890
He probably doesn't know high-tech products like this.

671
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,840
I should get him one too.

672
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,620
It looks nice.

673
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,540
If I look too formal we won't look good together.

674
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,400
Our first date.

675
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,050
Sir.

676
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,699
Wow. You look so young in that outfit.

677
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,030
You look amazing.

678
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,810
You look like you're only 800 years old.

679
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,050
Here.

680
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,310
Because this is our first date.

681
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,680
It's beautiful.

682
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,929
My mom also got a bunch of flowers on her first date with my dad.

683
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:03,820
I thought it was old-fashioned when she told me that,

684
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,460
but it's really nice to get one myself.

685
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,430
Right. What should we do now?

686
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,689
I thought you might not know good places,

687
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:16,400
so I did some research.

688
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Excuse me, Miss Dam.

689
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,310
This is our first date. You think I came here unprepared?

690
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,229
I've been keeping myself updated with the latest culture via news and books.

691
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,729
And I've been watching romantic comedy dramas,

692
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,570
so I'm very well aware of the latest dating trend.

693
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,860
Plus,

694
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,650
I can use magic.

695
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,650
You won't be disappointed.

696
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,050
Why sauna, all of a sudden?

697
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,860
I saw on dramas

698
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,400
that this is where many couples like to go when they go on dates.

699
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,740
 Sauna dates are kind of outdated.

700
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,800
Why did you talk about magic when we're coming to a sauna?

701
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,280
According to my research, this is a perfect place...

702
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,520
because there are nine different rooms made of nine different ingredients here

703
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,450
that help you with detox.

704
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,250
But there's one problem here.

705
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,220
Currently,

706
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,570
the ice room is out of order.

707
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,840
What?

708
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,010
What does that have anything to do with your magic?

709
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,090
How about we go and have a look?

710
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,400

711
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,150

712
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,830
It's warm in here. I guess you're right. It's out of order.

713
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,790
Sir, you're like Elsa.

714
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,590
I don't know who Ms. Elsa is, but I can tell from your tone it's a compliment.

715
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,260
Right. Let me show you something. Don't be surprised.

716
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,680
Now, you look like a lamb.

717
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,520
 Who does this these days?

718
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,169
What is the drama that you watched?

719
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:21,709
"My Lovely Sam Soon".

720
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,280
It's quite a popular one.

721
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,390
It was aired in 2005.

722
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,539
Oh. Time really flies.

723
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,699
Well, you've been living for almost a thousand years.

724
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,820
I understand fifteen years feels like a second to you.

725
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,819
Then saunas were popular...

726
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,220
Fifteen years ago.

727
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,010
It's cold. Shall we go out?

728
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:59,790
There's this place I've always wanted to go with you.

729
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:01,300
With me?

730
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,280
Shall we?

731
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,090
 Here's your chicken. Enjoy.

732
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,340
Is this the place you've always wanted to go with me? A chicken restaurant?

733
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,360
Well...

734
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,070
You couldn't have chicken because of me, so I wanted to make up for it.

735
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,910
I brought you here because I remembered this place was crowded,

736
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,170
but now that I think about it, that's more than forty years ago.

737
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,310
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

738
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:49,190
I tried to recall some of my memories for you,

739
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,441
but looks like I failed to catch up with the latest trend.

740
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:54,330
I'm sorry.

741
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,129
I messed up our first date.

742
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:59,100
I love it.

743
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,289
Until yesterday, I couldn't call you Sir and I thought I would have to act like

744
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,060
we're strangers for the rest of my life.

745
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,430
But today, we're sitting face to face.

746
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,410
No matter what we do and no matter where we go, I'm happy.

747
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,530
It looks delicious.

748
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,030
Sir, are you hungry?

749
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,650
What?

750
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,690
Because you're staring at me.

751
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,840
This is the first time that chicken looks tasty to me.

752
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,330
That's because I really enjoy it.

753
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:19,470
 What was that just now?

754
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,590
Appetite.

755
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,920
Appetite? What do you mean?

756
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,679
It means it's not necessarily a good thing

757
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,960
that things between you guys worked out that way.

758
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,720
Think about it.

759
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,610
What do you think will happen if a wolf falls in love with a sheep?

760
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:42,480
The more you want her, the bigger your appetite will grow.

761
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,700
 Miss Dam, where are you?

762
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,280
 I'm on my way to the library.

763
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:03,679

764
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,180
 Can I see you later for a second?

765
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,529
 No, I'm afraid that will be difficult today.

766
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:12,600
 I need to do some research for the group project.

767
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,360
 I know you don't eat, but enjoy your lunch.

768
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,840
I miss her already.

769
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,720
Ta-da. Surprise!

770
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,930
You don't look surprised.

771
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,270
I came because I missed you.

772
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:51,710
Could you at least act like you're surprised?

773
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,190
Wait.

774
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,670
Just a second.

775
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:57,280
This doesn't mean I don't like it. I'm just surprised.

776
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,630
 Think about it.

777
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:14,000
 What do you think will happen if a wolf falls in love with a sheep?

778
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,900
 The more you want her, the bigger your appetite will grow.

779
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,809
 You've been cultivating yourself for over a thousand years, but there's nothing you can do about it.

780
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:25,610
 You always crave human energy.

781
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:31,219
 As long as you're a gumiho and she's a human, your love will never work out.

782
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:37,890
 You'll have to keep walking a fine line between love and hunger.

783
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,380
Sir.

784
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,410
♫  One day,  ♫

785
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:02,820
♫  pain might make us cry again  ♫

786
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:07,230

791

792

~ Preview ~

793
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:40,870
 I'm not sure why this is happening all of a sudden.

794
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,809
 Do you want to know how to solve it?

795
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:44,849
 Just don't touch her.

796
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:46,519
 Platonic love...

797
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:48,179
 - Today's lecture has been canceled. 
 - What?

798
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:50,309
 I hope nothing bad happened to Professor Shin.

799
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:51,639
 Sir.

800
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,159
 One thing is for sure. You barely know who he is

801
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:56,959
 and what we are.

802
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,089
 If you lose more energy, you can be in danger.

803
00:59:00,089 --> 00:59:02,910
 For the time being...

804
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:06,130
 Let's stay away from each other.
