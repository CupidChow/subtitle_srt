1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:09,570

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,899

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,650

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,380

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,980

6
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,120

7
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,210
You won't remember a thing.

8
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,850
When you wake up,

9
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,470
everything will be over.

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,230
You just had a short dream, Miss Dam.

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,810
As of now,

12
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,130
our contract is over.

13
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,229
 Noona, come on out. Breakfast is ready.

14
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,070
Okay.

15
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,499
- Hey, you need to get up. 
 - Come on.

16
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,020
Are you a human or a slug?

17
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,659
Hey, what's for breakfast?

18
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,800
- Chicken porridge. 
 - Nice.

19
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,270
Chicken porridge.

20
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,899
I'm leaving. Wash the dishes before you go.

21
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,690
Okay.

22
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,119
Or at least leave them to soak.

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,840
Okay, you're nagging me so much!

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,490
This is good.

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,590

26
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,859
Dam!

27
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,820
- Hi. 
 - Hi. Doing okay?

28
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,649
- Going to the Cultural Studies lecture? 
 - Yes.

29
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,080
Going to the first period right after midterms is tough.

30
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,659
I'm so tired.

31
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,820
Right, have you heard?

32
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,720
- Hear what? 
 - Listen.

33
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,169
The Engineering Department cafeteria just added carbonara to the menu.

34
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,289
- Yes! 
 - Wow, hey.

35
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,669
We can't pass on a new menu item.

36
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,219
- Lunch is at Engineering today! 
 - Of course.

37
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,949
Whoever gets there first orders for everyone.

38
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,959
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,660
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,270
Hey, wait up!

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,409
So I'll eat lunch with those two.

42
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,619
Then I have a team project meeting for my major.

43
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,670
In the afternoon, work on the group assignment.

44
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,350
And...

45
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,380
And...

46
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,020
Shoot.

47
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,910
The least he can do is make me forget everything.

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,220
Lee Dam?

49
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,690
What are you doing here—

50
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,650
Hey, are you crying?

51
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,749
What's wrong? Is something going on?

52
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,870
Are you sick?

53
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,150
Just go, please.

54
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,360
How can I leave you here when you're like this?

55
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,420
Let's sit on the bench, okay?

56
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,180
You should at least sit and cry.

57
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,200
Get up. I'll take your bag.

58
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,040
Okay. Get up.

59
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,180
Hye Sun.

60
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,620
You know we have to go on one more date

61
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,489
for the project, right?

62
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,380
Really? We still have another one?

63
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,030
Yes, sadly, we have one more.

64
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,469
If you're free on Saturday, want to go on a date?

65
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,430
Whatever.

66
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,600
If it's annoying,

67
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
do you just want to say we did and make up the report?

68
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,690
Can we do that?

69
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,540
Yes, if we just get our stories straight, from mouth to mouth...

70
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,920
We have to... mouth to mouth?

71
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,960
Yes, kind of.

72
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,189
Wait, why do we have to mouth to mouth over some assignment?

73
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,649
Well,

74
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,079
we need to do well to get a good grade,

75
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,529
so that it's easier to find a job—

76
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,540
It'll even affect our job search?

77
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,620
All right. I heard employment is the top priority for young people these days.

78
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,440
If it's that important,

79
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,540
then fine. Let's do it!

80
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,060
What?

81
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,790
Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Let go!

82
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,439
Let me go. What's with you?

83
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,730
- No, hey. 
 - Let me go.

84
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,870

85
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,439
What are you doing? Have you gone insane?

86
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,409
How can you strangle my swan-like throat like you're killing a chicken?

87
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,390
Why did you...

88
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,560
 Right, she's not good at Korean because she lived abroad.

89
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,340
Hye Sun, listen.

90
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,779
There is this thing called "a figure of speech".

91
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,790
So when we say "take off our shoes and step forward,"

92
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,739
it doesn't mean we really take off our shoes.

93
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,419
It means we should do everything we can to help.

94
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,459
And to "mouth to mouth" means

95
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,259
to agree on a story ahead of time,

96
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,880
so that the stories coming out of our mouths match when we make things up.

97
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,340
Do you think you can teach me something?

98
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,908
- No. 
 - I'm not uneducated.

99
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,940
I even mastered the Thousand Character Classic! 
  (T/N: A poem used as a primer to teach Chinese characters to children since ancient times.)

100
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,070
I may not have finished Lesser Learning, but I got into college! 
 (T/N: an ancient introductory education textbook.)

101
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,950
Do you think I didn't even know that?

102
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,619
 Wait, she thinks Lesser Learning is related to going to college?

103
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,640
 She's a pretty funny girl.

104
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,169
I'll see you on Saturday. Instead of "mouth to mouth"—

105
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,379
I mean, instead of coming up with a story,

106
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,099
let's just meet up.

107
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,919
I get it. Go away.

108
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,400
All right. See you on Saturday.

109
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,260
 She's not the type to tell me why she's crying, even if I ask.

110
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,740
 How can I still be happy to see her in this situation?

111
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,630
What's this?

112
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,670
Why is she crying next to that Tiger Boy?

113
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,480
It can't be!

114
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,029
Please excuse me. You should get to class too.

115
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,920
Hey, wait. Do you want to meet this weekend?

116
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,540
No, that's not what I meant.

117
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,490
I mean, well, it is.

118
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,180
Let's do the couple assignment together. You don't want to?

119
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,090
I don't want to.

120
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,160
 Sir, I'm home!

121
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,680
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

122
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,600
You took the Bead out, didn't you?

123
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,609
I could tell from how she looked.

124
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,749
You saw Miss Dam?

125
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,339
So what if I did?

126
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,540
Why do you care? You won't be seeing her again.

127
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,009
If you decided to drain every drop of energy

128
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,240
from a stranger then abandon her,

129
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,270
you shouldn't have gotten attached.

130
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,639
And if you've let her go,

131
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,500
you need to move on and find the next target.

132
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,279
You don't have time to waste on wallowing,

133
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,410
and that goes for both of you.

134
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,420
Both of us?

135
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,169
She was crying.

136
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,460
She was? Why?

137
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,599
Why are you asking me?

138
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,700
It must be because of you.

139
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
That's impossible.

140
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,940
I erased everything about me from her memories.

141
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,650
I don't know if that's kind or cruel.

142
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,969
Are you sure your magic worked?

143
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,389
You said it didn't work on her mom.

144
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,250
No one will remember a thing.

145
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,020
Not her,

146
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,330
and not anyone else who saw me.

147
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,619
Please look after her, make sure she's doing well

148
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,700
and stays healthy.

149
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,599
You said you wanted me to keep her safe,

150
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,180
not pry into her private life.

151
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,000
She's safe now.

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,070
From whom?

153
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,850
From me.

154
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,550
So now you're worried about her private life

155
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,210
instead of her safety?

156
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,140
I used to think of her as family.

157
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,160
Do me this favor.

158
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,190
No. If you miss her, go see her yourself.

159
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,840
She won't recognize you anyway, so what's the problem?

160
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,650
Family, my foot.

161
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:13,030
No guy looks like that over a girl he considers family.

162
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,820
 Why, how do I look?

163
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,800
How can I put this?

164
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,179
I mean, you've been smiling,

165
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,159
but you look like you're empty inside.

166
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,760
What are you saying?

167
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,780
Are you sure nothing is going on?

168
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,040
- I'm fine. 
 - Okay.

169
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,230
 I lied.

170
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,950
 I knew how to take out the Bead

171
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,780
 from the beginning.

172
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,070
 But I lied to you.

173
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,060
 I needed energy to become human,

174
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,550
 and you, of all people, had to be there.

175
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,249
 Yes, I was just a consumable

176
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,490
 to be used for my energy and cast aside.

177
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,810
 So let's end it here.

178
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,700
 Why am I crying when I should be celebrating?

179
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,179
Soo Kyeong, are you free today?

180
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,589
Today?

181
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,539
I don't have to go to the academy.

182
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,799
And my phone English lesson isn't today either.

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,079
Then let's call Jae Jin and party all night.

184
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,770
Midterms are over too.

185
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,160
I'm going to do everything I couldn't do for a while.

186
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,940
That's the stuff!

187
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,840
Chicken and beer beat any kind of relationship.

188
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,339
I feel tipsy and satisfied,

189
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,199
satisfied and tipsy!

190
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,460
- I missed this so much. 
 - Well,

191
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,249
did you have time to miss it?

192
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,359
You do this practically every other night.

193
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,609
Tell me about it. You'd think she hasn't done this for months!

194
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,240
Excuse me, we'll take another garlic chicken

195
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,009
and another pitcher of beer.

196
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,819
 - Sure.  
 - You're eating more?

197
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,390
Do you plan to stop eating chicken after today?

198
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,089
I know midterms are over,

199
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,000
but we should review today's lecture and study for tomorrow!

200
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,880
Let's stop eating and get going.

201
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,470
Hey, go where?

202
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,119
My curfew's finally lifted. We have to stay out!

203
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,710
You had a curfew?

204
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,490
- I didn't know Dan was so strict. 
 - Right?

205
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,309
I don't have to avoid them anymore.

206
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,050
- What? 
 - What?

207
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,589
My life is filled with happiness,

208
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,810
I feel so free!

209
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,300
Hey, let's go to noraebang!

210
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,999
Noraebang sounds great.

211
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,830
Is it time for Jae Jin's trademark emotional ballads?

212
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,929
Hey.

213
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,789
I don't mean those drowsy slow songs.

214
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,220
Let's go with dance music. Dance!

215
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,790
Dance, dance!

216
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,269
Why is Dam so hyper today? She's scaring me.

217
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,810
I'm not sure.

218
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,400
She kept saying that she feels free.

219
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,769
Is it because exams are over?

220
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,770
I don't think she studied so hard

221
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,020
that she would feel this free.

222
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,930
We have a minute left. Let's go.

223
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,700
Let's not sing a long song to stretch it out,

224
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,750
- and leave with some class. 
 - Start.

225
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,030

226
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,760
What's with this song, Dam? Did your taste change?

227
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,810
Well, I guess trot music is big these days.

228
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,590

229
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,600
♫   Close your eyes and feel my dream   ♫

230
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,320
♫   Close your eyes and touch my soul   ♫

231
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,710
♫   A long day has passed   ♫

232
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,350
♫   And the night has come again   ♫

233
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:05,200
♫   Without fail, I’m thinking about you   ♫

234
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,350
♫   Memories of you, your breath   ♫

235
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,880
♫   Before I know it   ♫

236
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,510
♫  they've filled up my heart  ♫

237
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,950
♫  one by one  ♫

238
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,790
♫   It confuses me   ♫

239
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,450
♫   Because without even knowing   ♫

240
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,090
♫   You’ve   ♫

241
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,040
♫  grown so big  ♫

242
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,680
♫   All about you   ♫

243
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,250
♫  all about you my love  ♫

244
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:49,450
♫   I want to feel it without saying anything   ♫

245
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,760
♫   I want to get a little closer to you   ♫

246
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,910
Now that he took out the Bead, did he become human

247
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,830
with the energy I gave him?

248
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,580
I don't care either way.

249
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,020
But why am I here again?

250
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,490
Old habits die hard.

251
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,900
♫   Even if I wake up   ♫

252
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,760
♫  from this dream  ♫

253
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,420
♫   If you’re next to me   ♫

254
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,340
♫   I’m not afraid   ♫

255
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,980
 She was crying.

256
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:42,010
♫   You are my all   ♫

257
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,560
You're always either oversleeping or hung over.

258
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,330
Eat up. It's seonji hangover soup.

259
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,560
Can you make bean sprout or dried pollack hangover soup next time?

260
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,900
I don't want to see seonji anytime soon.

261
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,510
So hasty. I was just asking you to take note of it.

262
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,070
 Do you feel better now?

263
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,970
 Let's go eat something good to help you feel better.

264
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,870
 Let's meet up even if you don't want to.

265
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,139
 I know it sounds a little weird, but just think of it as an assignment.

266
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,600

267
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,880

268
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,860
What is it? Why do you keep staring at...

269
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,010
No way, you were getting clingy with a girl?

270
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,729
Are you crazy? Give it back!

271
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,830
No, I won't. Why would I give back something this hilarious?

272
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,510
Give it back.

273
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,170
You weren't turned down just once, but over and over again.

274
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,970
I can't believe these are the results, even with that face!

275
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,360
This is the power of personality!

276
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,580
I'm going to kill you, seriously.

277
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,010

278
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,220
What's this?

279
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,610
I sent that.

280
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:04,570
You've been turned down anyway, so keep trying and leave no regrets.

281
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,750
What's the difference between getting rejected a hundred times or a hundred and one times?

282
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,310
- Hey. 
 - Boo-ya.

283
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,780
- You little! 
 - Gosh!

284
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,280

285
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,030
What? Who is it?

286
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,370
- Just a sunbae. 
 - That's not what your face is saying.

287
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,200
He's interested in you.

288
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,130
I guess he's not into looks.

289
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,090
You psycho.

290
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,550

291
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,690
Man, he's crazy good-looking. What happened?

292
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,320
Stop talking nonsense.

293
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,700
It's not like that. He just messaged me for an assignment...

294
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,910
- What are you doing? 
 - Replying.

295
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,349
- Give it back. 
 - Hold on.

296
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,709
Give it to me now.

297
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,559
- Hey. 
 - What assignment? He's obviously into you.

298
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,510
Give it back, you psycho. Hey!

299
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,970
- Darn it. 
 - Here.

300
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,590
 I'd love to meet you anytime.

301
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,939
Hey, it's on.

302
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,910
He's a hundred percent into you.

303
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,589
I'm going to kill you!

304
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,510
Wash your hair before you go!

305
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,990
I hope you finally get your first boyfriend. Fighting!

306
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,090
I can't believe this.

307
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,480
 I'd love to meet you anytime.

308
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,839
Hey, I won't beat you. Open up.

309
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,520
 I don't believe you.

310
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,060
I really won't. I swear on my credit card.

311
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,520
Don't you dare lay a hand on me.

312
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,820
I'll use this flat iron to straighten your twisted mind.

313
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,250
Look at this.

314
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,220
How should I reply?

315
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,220
 I'll call you.

316
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,840
I should just kill Dan.

317
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,320

318
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,290
 He didn't have to delete the messages too.

319
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,100
 No, don't cry.

320
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,820
 It was just a total rejection.

321
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,420
 You had a crush on him, had expectations that couldn't be met,

322
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,390
 then got rejected.

323
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,540
- My gosh. 
 - It wasn't supposed to rain today.

324
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,350
 I'm like the heroine in a tragedy.

325
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,040
♫  The meaningless answer,  ♫

326
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,520
♫  that look on your face  ♫

327
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,780
♫   At some point   ♫

328
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,070

329

♫   Even though I try to find a reason   ♫

331
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,630
It's suddenly raining.

332
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,430
 Is this really him?

333
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,380
Where are you headed?

334
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,880
I'll share it with you until you get there.

335
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm headed to the Humanities Department.

336
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,440
♫   I have nothing left to say   ♫

♫   in the past  ♫

343
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,210
 She doesn't look well.

344
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,740
 Did something really happen?

345
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,990
 Since he ended it without any explanation,

346
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,230
 he probably planned on never seeing me again.

347
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,210
 In the end,

348
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,760
 that's how little I meant to him.

349
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,900
 I was like a passing shower.

♫   I have nothing left to say   ♫

351

352
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,900
I see a friend over there.

353
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,660
Thank you.

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,330
 This is probably the end.

359
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,120
Excuse me.

360
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,180
Don't walk in the rain. Take this.

361
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,560
Why should I take your umbrella?

362
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,620
Soo Kyeong!

363
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,420
Oh, hey!

364
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,499
- My gosh. 
 - You're all wet!

365
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,780
How did you...

366
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,040
Hey, it stopped raining.

367
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,330
Was that a fox shower? 
  (T/N: sunshower, rain when it's sunny)

368
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,140
It was pouring, and now it's sunny.

369
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,690
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

370
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,240
 Her kind voice.

371
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,230
 Her smile.

372
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,120
 Her playfulness.

373
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,600
 Seeing all that might have been a privilege.

374
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,580
 I have now become

375
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,130
 a nobody to her.

376
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,870
Dam, have you heard?

377
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,190
You know how Professor Jung recently went on leave because of his health?

378
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,880
So we're getting a new professor today.

379
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,890
Really?

380
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,530
Why? Are you worried?

381
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,720
Well, in my case, it doesn't matter who comes.

382
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,570
What's that? What's he doing? Jae Jin!

383
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,280
What are you doing?

384
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,020
My friends, I need advice.

385
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,280
What's wrong?

386
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,710
Our grades aren't in, so you can't be worried about having to repeat a class.

387
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,710
Well,

388
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,230
Jin Ah has been contacting me for the past few days.

389
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,190
Why won't you even hear me out?

390
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,929
I mean, she keeps texting me late at night asking if I'm asleep,

391
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,750
and sending old pictures and asking if I remember those times.

392
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,939
She's asking to meet. So what do I do?

393
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,070
What do you think? She's bored,

394
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,910
so she wants to lead you on.

395
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,759
Just ignore her. Why are you letting her get to you?

396
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,130
- It's not like that. 
 - Enough. Be quiet.

397
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,810
- Hey, are you serious? 
 - Yes, he's going to be here.

398
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,240
- Hey, let's sit in the very front. 
 - Stop that.

399
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,560
Hey, Yu Ri.

400
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,779
What's going on here?

401
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,189
It's the new professor.

402
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,320
I just saw him, and he's amazing.

403
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,160
Why? How is he amazing?

404
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,150
It's none of your business.

405
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,550
- Look! 
 - My gosh.

406
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,070
 He looks like an actor.

407
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,200
 He's really hot.

408
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,100

409
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,709
 - Gosh, he's so hot. 
 - Who is that?

410
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:08,130
I'm sorry, I'm late on my first day.

411
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,709
 - Don't say that. 
 - It's okay.

412
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,280
 - Don't say that. 
 - Right.

413
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,589
Dam, I'm considering retaking a lecture for the first time in my life.

414
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,960
No, I'd even re-re-re-re-re-take this lecture!

415
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,740
 Why is he here?

416
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,650
 If he's still using magic, is he not human—? No.

417
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,539
 That's not what's important right now.

418
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,310
Then let me call attendance first.

419
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,659
 - Okay. 
 - Yes.

420
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,259
- Jeon Da Young? 
 - Yes.

421
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,160
- Seo Jin. 
 - Yes.

422
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,100
- Gye Seon Woo. 
 - Yes.

423
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,930
 What on earth?

424
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,420
- Choi Soo Kyeong. 
 - Yes!

425
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:51,290
- Yes. 
  - Could it be because of me?

426
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,530
 Is he here to watch me?

427
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,220
Lee Dam.

428
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,340
Yes.

429
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,970
 So he's doing this to keep an eye on me?

430
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,789
I'm sure you've been informed,

431
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:12,340
but I will be teaching History 101 from now on.

432
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,070
Then let's start from page 178.

433
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,430
- Yes, Professor. 
 - Yes, Professor.

434
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,789
I've got to hurry to the next class. Bye.

435
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,780
Bye.

436
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,669
Professor.

437
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,410
Thanks for the lecture.

438
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,470
Hey, Dam. Want to get tripe after classes?

439
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,759
No. I have no money.

440
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,890
It's on me. I got my allowance.

441
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,809
- Stop annoying me. 
 - Come on.

442
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,940
- Go away. 
 - Come on.

443
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,220

444
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,920
I'm just watching her for a while.

445
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,580
Just a little while.

446
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,720
All right. I haven't said anything yet.

447
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,049
So you're watching her for just a little while.

448
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:20,599
Then what?

449
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
What are you going to do next?

450
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,269
You saw what happens when one fails to become human within a thousand years.

451
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,640
Haven't you learned your lesson?

452
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,159
Time is ticking.

453
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,900
Why are you still thinking about her?

454
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,599
- Because I cared— 
 - If you cared about her so much,

455
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:43,250
why did you erase her memories in the first place?

456
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,420
 Because I thought that,

457
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,930
 if she stopped looking at me the same way after I told her the truth,

458
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,550
 I wouldn't be able to stand it.

459
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,940
Are you sure you want her to go back to her normal life?

460
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:21,200
Will you really be okay, watching her do just fine without you?

461
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,540
Of course.

462
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,210
You know what?

463
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:34,380
I may lie to everyone else, but I don't lie to myself.

464
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,880
I'm saying I'll treat you to some really amazing tripe.

465
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,740
No! I said I'm not interested.

466
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,330
Don't think you can tempt me with just 20cm of tripe.

467
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,629
I know you want to talk about Jin Ah.

468
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,339
Just move on, you clingy punk.

469
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,529
I'm not being clingy. I just want to tell her off.

470
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,220
- That I'm not an idiot anymore so she should stop contacting me. 
 - Please.

471
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,729
I just want to discuss how I can make it sound

472
00:33:58,729 --> 00:34:00,530
more tough and ruthless, my friend.

473
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,360
- Whatever. 
 - Oppa Jae Jin!

474
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,429
Jin Ah, what are you doing here?

475
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:24,748
I was in the area, so I came by to see you.

476
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,678
By the way, Unni Dam, it looks like you're still single, 
  (T/N: Unni - how a female calls an older sister)

477
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,658
seeing as you're still hanging out with Oppa.

478
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,590
- You little... 
 - No, Dam. Don't.

479
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,429
My legs hurt.

480
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,069
Oppa, will you keep me waiting here? 
  (T/N: Oppa - older brother to a girl, also used for romantic partners)

481
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,959
Let's go somewhere and talk.

482
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,820
Talk about what? You should go.

483
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,150
Unni, are you someone who can tell me to stay or go?

484
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,409
I am that someone.

485
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:02,149
If you make him cry, I'm the one who'll have to handle his drunken antics.

486
00:35:02,149 --> 00:35:05,770
Unless you're going to cover those drinks, just go.

487
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,490
Oppa.

488
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,600
Should I go?

489
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,970
Sorry, Dam.

490
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,020
She came all the way here. How can I just make her go?

491
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,079
Let's go, Oppa.

492
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,669
I saw a nice cafe right over there. Let's go.

493
00:35:42,669 --> 00:35:44,670
I'll text you.

494
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,990
What am I going to do with that idiot?

495
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,659
 I'm sorry, Dam.

496
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,870
 I know I'm being stupid, but seeing her face makes me weak.

497
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,680
Hi, Sunbae.

498
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,580
Now?

499
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,510
Professor, what kind of coffee do you like?

500
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,880
Professor. Please have some snacks.

501
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,340
- Sunbae, what's this about? 
 - What do you like?

502
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,419
Obviously, we're welcoming our new professor.

503
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:56,600
You're the president of the student council.

504
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,540
 I wanted to avoid interacting with him.

505
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,740
Why are you here, though? You're not even a member of the council.

506
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,339
Do you have to be a member to greet our new professor?

507
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:16,479
Professor.

508
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:20,859
I have a question as the top-ranked junior of the History department.

509
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:24,219
Are you married?

510
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:25,599
Hey.

511
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,730
Can't you see he's not wearing a ring?

512
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,039
That's true.

513
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,830
Actually, you look so young that I thought you were a Sunbae.

514
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,340
What a surprise.

515
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,580
Dam, don't you have any questions to ask him?

516
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,200
How will our grades be calculated?

517
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,099
Sorry?

518
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:02,530
This is the first time we've changed professors in the middle of the semester.

519
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,430
We'll continue with what was originally laid out.

520
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,350
Yes, Professor.

521
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,330
I see.

522
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,890
Oppa,

523
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:37,360
you thought I was two-timing too, right?

524
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:43,349
But if you define my situation with such a cheap and simple word,

525
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,450
I'll be upset.

526
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:50,039
I was just honestly confused whether I liked you or him.

527
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,880
I see.

528
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,260
I feel like I've finally organized my thoughts now.

529
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,140
So I'm considering giving you another chance.

530
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,609
- Another chance? 
 - Yes.

531
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:11,779
A chance to make me feel safer and treat me better so  I don't get confused again.

532
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:13,839
To be honest, you weren't perfect either.

533
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,599
Hanging out with Lee Dam all the time.

534
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,409
Jin Ah, Dam is just a friend.

535
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,039
How many times do I have to tell you?

536
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,740
Dam is not even a female friend.

537
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,659
She's just a human friend.

538
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,920
I said I didn't like her.

539
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,840
How many times did I tell you that?

540
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,230
Fine.

541
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,630
I did see another guy while dating you.

542
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,199
But you weren't in the right either.

543
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,299
We were both at fault.

544
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:49,930
Choi Jin Ah, do you even hear yourself?

545
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,689
Not once did I put her before you.

546
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:57,340
You were always my priority,

547
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,480
and I always did my best for this relationship.

548
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,970
Don't use Dam as an excuse.

549
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,680
You may not be that good of a person, but you're not completely shameless.

550
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,710
How could you side with her in front of me?

551
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,990
I didn't know you were such a cold person.

552
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,210
Hye Sun.

553
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,780
Oh. I didn't expect to see you here.

554
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,940
Who is she, Oppa?

555
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,949
Did I interrupt? Sorry.

556
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:33,610
I'll leave you two alone.

557
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,839
See you on Saturday.

558
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,300
Okay. I'll text you.

559
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,410
Who is she? Why are you texting her?

560
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,769
- Well, she's just... 
 - What?

561
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:49,160
She's just someone I have an assignment with.

562
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,930
A friend.

563
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,510
If he tells you who I am, would you know who that is?

564
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,950
What?

565
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,950
Then what's the point of asking?

566
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,390
- Hey! What are you? 
 - Don't...

567
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,500
Oppa, meet me on Saturday.

568
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,740
 Seriously? Saturday?

569
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,069
I can't, Jin Ah. You heard that we're doing an assignment together.

570
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:26,320
You can do the assignment on Sunday.

571
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,830
I like Saturday.

572
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,140
I have to see you on Saturday.

573
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,540
I'm not going to cancel my plans for you.

574
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,940
And I won't be seeing you again either way.

575
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,940
Do you know that you haven't answered my question yet?

576
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,650
So who is this woman?

577
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,220
Do you want to know who I am? Why?

578
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,570
I don't care whether you're Jae Jin's ex or a utility pole.

579
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,320
You just need to know one thing.

580
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,860
On Saturday, he's mine.

581
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,690
Maybe I shouldn't have meddled.

582
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,560
It's okay.

583
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,890
Next time, don't be like that.

584
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,310
Don't completely open your heart to others.

585
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,760
You can't win the game if you show all the cards in your hand.

586
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,290
I didn't play a game.

587
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,860
I didn't want to win either.

588
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:12,370
I just liked her a lot.

589
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:33,920
♫  Again tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking of you  ♫

590
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,370
♫  Oh every night  ♫

591
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:41,680
♫  What am I to you? I’m curious  ♫

592
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,080
♫  Please tell me now  ♫

593
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,040
♫  Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper  ♫

594
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,350
♫  I’m seeping into you  ♫

595
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,900
♫  The longer I wait, they'll get deeper  ♫

596
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,060
♫  Ask the moon  ♫

597
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,720
♫  Tell me now, how are you doing it?  ♫

598
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,870

599
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:11,690

600
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,870
♫  Though I know I’m still awkward and inexperienced  ♫

601
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,520
♫  Still, I’ll hold out  ♫

♫   my hand   ♫

603

605
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,030
♫  and only you remain  ♫

606
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:38,910
♫  You’re behind the moon  ♫

607
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,900
♫  Now I will tell you  ♫

608
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,530

609
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,530
 Lee Dam.

610
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,300
 Yes.

611
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,240
♫  My world is filled with you  ♫

612
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,090
♫  Will you wait for me just a little?  ♫

613
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,620
♫  Although I’m so awkward  ♫

614
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,200
 How could he look so unaffected?

615
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,050
♫  Even so,  ♫

616
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,430
♫  if you’re okay with that  ♫

617
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:20,290
♫  I’ll brighten your nights every day  ♫

618
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,330
Aren't you getting in?

619
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:53,430
Why aren't you asking me why I didn't call you?

620
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,680
Pardon?

621
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,260
I said I would call you because we're having dinner together.

622
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,619
Oh, that...

623
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:04,430
Are you free today?

624
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,230
Today, I can't...

625
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,870
Thanks, Sunbae.

626
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,520
Let's do dinner next time, once you're feeling better.

627
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,639
What?

628
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,650
You don't look so well today.

629
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,629
Actually, when you cried so much the other day—

630
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,099
Sunbae, why don't we just have dinner tonight?

631
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,710
- What? 
 - Let's go.

632
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,249
This place is famous for their salmon steak.

633
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:14,849
For salad, the avocado salad and Cobb are good,
 (T/N: Cobb is a mixed salad)

634
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:17,830
And for the amuse-bouche...

635
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,180
Do you like ceviche?
 (T/N: marinated raw fish)

636
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,750
If you're uncomfortable with flour for your entree,

637
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,350
there are whole grain or tofu noodle options.

638
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,300
What's the matter?

639
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,720
I didn't get any of that.

640
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,399
What's with the muse and there's a bush?

641
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:36,260
What's Cobb and what's ceviche?

642
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,640
And can flour be uncomfortable?

643
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,870
Then I'll just order for you.

644
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,720
Okay.

645
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,790
Excuse me, I'd like to order.

646
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,340
I didn't send that message.

647
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,590
It was my brother joking around.

648
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,819
He has this crazy idea that you're interested in me.

649
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:12,620
I know. I figured it wasn't from you.

650
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:18,740
I didn't think you would ever talk so sweetly or send that kind of emoji.

651
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,800
In fact, that's why I hesitated to call you.

652
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,950
I was afraid you would take back the whole thing.

653
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,390
Sunbae, why are you doing all this?

654
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,239
- What? 
 - If it's because you feel bad about the bet—

655
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,740
I do feel bad about it, but that's not the reason.

656
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,999
Then is it because our project deadline is coming up?

657
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:47,140
I don't really care about assignments.

658
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,220
Then why...

659
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,770
Dam.

660
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,159
Aren't you just pretending that you don't know?

661
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:57,110
Don't know what?

662
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,350
That I like you.

663
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,850
Everybody knows I like you, except for you.

664
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,600
Really, you're the only one who doesn't know.

665
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,420
You said even your brother thought so.

666
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,330
So how come you don't see it?

667
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,590
 Is he messing with me again?

668
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,240
 You call that a confession?

669
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,460
 Even if it's real, that's still weird.

670
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,520
 Can I go back in time?

671
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,210
So, I didn't tell you expecting an answer.

672
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,490
I know. I'm not planning to answer either.

673
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,030
That's what I said. You're so precise.

674
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:04,800
I'm doing this not because I feel bad, but because I like you.

675
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:11,300
I just wanted you to know that.

676
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,950
 If I know that, does it change anything?

677
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,730
 Even when someone shows their feelings for me,

678
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:35,360
 I still only think of him.

679
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:43,950
- Hi, Professor. 
 - Hi.

680
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,270
 Then when I see him...

681
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,430
 Then...

682
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,500
Sunbae.

683
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,870
I think I should tell you this.

684
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,380
Okay.

685
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,070
I'm sorry,

686
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,110
but I already have someone I like.

687
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,860
 Someone she likes?

688
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:06,900
I knew it.

689
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,220
So why did you go with her?

690
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,100
It was nice seeing her.

691
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,080
I resented and hated her so much,

692
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,810
but we had good memories, too.

693
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,140
And I used to really like her.

694
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,720
I knew it was ridiculous for her to show up, but I was still happy.

695
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,660
It felt weird.

696
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,260
Yeah, emotions can be weird like that.

697
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,249
Why do you think she suddenly showed up?

698
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,809
Exactly. Why?

699
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:50,509
Why did she appear and shake me up just when I was getting over her?

700
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:53,730
Why shake me up?

701
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,269
What's this?

702
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:59,010
Why are you copying me like a parrot?

703
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,170
Who, me?

704
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,120
I'm just showing sympathy.

705
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,330
You know what?

706
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,750
I still have this stupid idea

707
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:28,960
that I might have been too harsh to her at the end.

708
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:34,070
And I even have this idea

709
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,150
that she might have come

710
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,150
because she missed me.

711
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,520
So pathetic.

712
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,380
 Could he also...

713
00:53:54,830 --> 00:54:00,900
 Is it pathetic of me to wish that he misses me too?

714
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,439
Jin Ah, I really want to forget you this time!

715
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,649
If you show up again, I'll act like I don't know you.

716
00:54:16,649 --> 00:54:18,019
I'll act like I don't know you!

717
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,120
I wish I could act like I don't know you, so please be quiet.

718
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,780
Come on! Walk on your own!

719
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,330
Hey!

720
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:38,910
You... No. Don't!

721
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,789
I'm not going to run. Don't worry. Sorry.

722
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:46,210
I'm not running. Don't worry.

723
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,379
Let's go have a second round.

724
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,270
- Let's go have a second round. 
 - What?

725
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,369
Hey, get up.

726
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:10,619
I might have to sell your kidney, so get up right now!

727
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,410
Have you lost your mind?

728
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,400
What's going on?

729
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,560
Hye Sun.

730
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,330
What are you doing here?

731
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,960
I didn't know it was your car.

732
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,420
Jae Jin got so drunk, and...

733
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,039
 Why are the two of them...?

734
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,100
Dam.

735
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,179
I feel sick and the ground is too soft. I can't walk.

736
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:53,420
Hey, wake up.

737
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,920
Come on. Goodness.

738
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,519
Let me help.

739
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,550
It's okay. We can take a cab.

740
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,760
Right. What do we do about your car?

741
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,460
I guess it was tough.

742
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,060
What?

743
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,719
Tell him to call me when he sobers up.

744
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,120
I'll talk to the perpetrator.

745
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,330
Dam, let's go have another round. Choo-choo!

746
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,519
Really, I'm going to throw you into the recycling bin.

747
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,810
Hold on!

748
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,959
Do you think you can handle him? Do you need a ride?

749
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,379
It's okay. I can take him to my place. I live near here.

750
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,570
No, really.

751
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,130
We'll drive him home.

752
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,199
Let's do that.

753
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,649
Where does Jae Jin live?

754
00:56:44,649 --> 00:56:46,779
It's really okay. If he goes home now,

755
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,190
his brothers might kick him out in his underwear to punish him.

756
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,940
But it's late and it's not safe.

757
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,190
You should go home first.

758
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,980
 I want to ask him why he still sounds so sweet,

759
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:03,430
 as if he worries about me.

760
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,890
 I want to ask him why he's with her

761
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:10,949
 and why I keep running into him, so I can't get over him.

762
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,200
 There are so many things I want to ask him, but...

763
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,899
It's really okay.

764
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,099
Hye Sun, I'm really sorry. I'll text you tomorrow.

765
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,370
- Bye. 
 - Okay. Bye.

766
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,650
I should go.

767
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,730
What?

768
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:42,090
I'm worried.

769
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,920
But...

770
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,040
 Is the person she likes...

771
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,900
 Why do I keep...

772
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,980
 It can't be.

773
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,990
 Do I like her in a different way?

774
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,349
I'll get going.

775
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,960
How will you go by yourself?

776
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,900
- I can... 
 - Ouch!

777
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,930
See? I said you might fall.

778
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:24,910
 How dare I...

779
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,870
 She's so young.

780
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,570
 Since when and how?

781
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,519
I can take care of things.

782
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:47,040
You can go, Professor.

783
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,810
Hye Sun must be waiting.

784
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,580
 Why, only now?

785
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,689
 You know what?

786
00:59:56,689 --> 01:00:01,029
 I may lie to other people, but I don't lie to myself.

787
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:03,690
 Are you sure you want this?

788
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:08,550
 Even if she meets someone else, dates him,

789
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,720
 loves him,

790
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,020
 and eventually leaves your life forever?

791
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,660
No.

792
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,850
I'm not sure.

793
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:39,620
♫  Tell me now, how are you doing it?  ♫

794
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,710
♫  My nights are filled with you  ♫

01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,340

~ Preview ~

806
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,829
 For the first time since I met her,

807
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:32,899
 I felt like I fell from clouds and bumped into reality.

808
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:36,400
 I'm going to give a presentation about Goryeo's Buddhist culture...

809
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,519
 What fox is so easy to read?

810
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:40,739
 If you like her so much, why don't you hurry

811
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,300
