1
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,949

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,660

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,230

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,780

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,820

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,100
It's raining so much.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,050

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,440

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,060

10
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,800
Sir, how did you come all the way here?

11
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,720
You weren't answering your phone.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,850
Right. I was going to tell you when I got home.

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,500
Miss Dam.

14
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,860
From now on, always answer my phone. Even when I'm right next to you.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,320
I worry.

16
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,900

17
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,699

18
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,590

19
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,929
You said you only eat seonji, so I ordered it on a home shopping channel. 
  (T/N: seonji - ox blood soup)

20
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,720
How is it, Sir?

21
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,340
- Not bad. 
 - Thank goodness!

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,130
Oh, yeah.

23
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,339
- How did it go with that sunbae today? 
 - Right, I have to report back.

24
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,649
I did such an awesome job today.

25
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,989
I got really obsessive and cheesy,

26
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,789
then I even waved at him when he saw me off. He was totally appalled.

27
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,310
Wow, this will taste even better with some radish kimchi.

28
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,390
   Disappointed about today, are you free tomorrow?

29
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,320
 Let's go see a movie.

30
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,219
Are you going somewhere?

31
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,690
Yes, I have plans.

32
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,019
Okay. Don't be too late.

33
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,100
Okay. I'll be back.

34
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,050

35
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,320
- Mom said to come and eat. 
 - I'm not eating.

36
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,260
Are you going out? Are you meeting someone?

37
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,809
Mom, Oppa won't answer. 
  (T/N: Oppa - how a female calls an older brother)

38
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:47,820
I don't think he wants to eat.

39
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,880
You idiot. She made braised short ribs today.

40
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,360
 So are you free tomorrow? Let's catch a movie.

41
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,789
 Gosh, it's all right.

42
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,820
 - Gosh, it's all right.  
 - This is it?

43
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,439
She was so forward yesterday.

44
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,930
Is she playing hard to get or what?

45
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,790
Hey, you.

46
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,290
Gosh.

47
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,229
What's all this, Ms. Lavender?

48
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,079
I'm sure you didn't dress up for me.

49
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,359
I'm going to watch Dan's match later,

50
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,519
and he told me not to come looking like an embarrassment.

51
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,469
That his friends ask if I even wash my face.

52
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:32,520
Your mistake.

53
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,850
Then why didn't you just go to his match? Why would you want to see me?

54
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,450
Hey.

55
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,399
It's Sunbae Seon Woo.

56
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,899
I thought I did more than enough to make him lose interest.

57
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,090
But he texted again to ask me out for a movie.

58
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,790
I think my plan failed.

59
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,159
Should I just tell him off and risk the chance he'll spread bad rumors?

60
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,849
That I am not interested at all, so he should stop texting?

61
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,299
I'm not sure.

62
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:04,419
It's not like he said he likes you. Isn't that a bit too much?

63
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,299
It is. Then what should I do?

64
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,979
Don't take hasty actions and just let him be.

65
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,449
Who knows? He might really like you.

66
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,440
He barely knows me. How could he like me?

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,800
Then how do you feel about him?

68
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,579
- What? 
 - You.

69
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:26,410
How do you feel about him?

70
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,529
I'm not sure. If you ask me what I think about her,

71
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,810
I would say she's an interesting girl.

72
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,270
She's kind, and I never get bored when I look at her.

73
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,840
Oh my.

74
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,079
Don't take an interest.

75
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,850
I won't see her after a year anyway.

76
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,699
How can you be so sure?

77
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,700
Even if you cut someone off, fate unravels to bring you back together.

78
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,199
What if you really fall for—

79
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,629
Stop talking nonsense and cut to the chase.

80
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,420
I would prefer you didn't visit my home unannounced.

81
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,960
Don't be so sensitive.

82
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,100
I came to share my win-win scenario.

83
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,970
I need your help. To be exact, your magic, but whatever.

84
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,380
What do you want?

85
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,859
I've played long enough, and I'm sick of spending money.

86
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:44,839
I worked so hard to become human,

87
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,790
but, now that I am one, it's nothing special.

88
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,309
That's why I'm thinking of going to this place called school.

89
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:56,570
- School? 
 - Yes, a university.

90
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,820
When it took you eighty years to learn the Thousand Character Classic? 
  (T/N: A poem used to teach Chinese characters to children since ancient times.)

91
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,689
Exactly. I'm sick and tired of how you look down on me.

92
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:10,139
And I want to live the rest of my life as a woman of intellect.

93
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,029
Nice fragrance.

94
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,510
Really? Then I'd like a cup...

95
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,470
Think about it. This isn't a bad deal for you.

96
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,020
Aren't you nervous, anxious, and sleepless these days?

97
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,069
The Bead finally began turning blue,

98
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,360
what if something goes wrong? You must feel very troubled.

99
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,040
Don't you need someone who can observe that girl closely?

100
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,490
Just to be safe and certain.

101
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,509
I'm home.

102
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:09,810
- You're back. 
 - I'm a little late, Sir.

103
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,059
I thought you ran off with my Bead.

104
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,590
- I wouldn't! 
 - I'm kidding.

105
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,620
But still, I think we need a curfew.

106
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,259
- A curfew? 
 - So neither of us need to worry.

107
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:25,159
Let's be home by 10:00 p.m. from now on.

108
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,680
If we break this rule,

109
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,560
the wifi in that person's room will be cut off for a month.

110
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,999
Hey, wait. The wifi?

111
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,629
Wifi is the lifeline of modern society.

112
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:41,520
I would rather have you flog me!

113
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,320
Flog you?

114
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,339
So you're already thinking of coming home late?

115
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,309
No, it's not that I'm already thinking about it.

116
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,989
Then?

117
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,319
There's such a thing as an emergency.

118
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:57,029
Why should I have to keep a curfew in my twenties, when I didn't even have one in high school?

119
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,219
I want to break this contract.

120
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,700
How much is the penalty?

121
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,190
I'll come home early.

122
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,929
Okay. Go and get some rest.

123
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:18,030
- You, too. 
 - Sure.

124
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,749
The door slammed because of the breeze.

125
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:31,640
Yes, I know.

126
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,939
I have no other choice.

127
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:57,000
 Let's do that. Just to be safe and certain.

128
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,730
He really took the bait.

129
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,910
 Could he really have feelings for her?

130
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,210
♫  People might be watching  ♫

131
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,720
♫  That is what I'm wanting  ♫

132
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,280
♫  The halo that I can see  ♫

133
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,870
♫  Maybe I am weirdo  ♫

134
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,790
♫  All my friends are talking  ♫

135
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,199
 She looks like she has a story.

136
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,590
- Darn it! 
 - Hey, wait.

137
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,740
Look over there.

138
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,490
♫  You're the one I need  ♫

139
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,040
♫  I loved you since I  ♫

140
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
♫  kissed your cheeks  ♫

141
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,219
Hi, let me ask you a question.

142
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:49,010
Where's the Humanities Department?

143
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,669
Oh, well.

144
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,439
Go straight this way past the main library,

145
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:56,339
then take a right, and you'll see a huge building.

146
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,459
There are all kinds of snack bars

147
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:01,979
and, you know, those vending machines and stuff.

148
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:05,720
So if you keep going that way...

149
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,980
Well... Should I just walk you there?

150
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,770
Will you?

151
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,260
Sure. Come with me.

152
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,729
This is Yang Hye Sun.

153
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:26,699
She's from overseas, and she's here as an exchange student.

154
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,069
Hi, I'm Kim Tae Hee of Seogwa University,

155
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,430
the top student of the History Department.

156
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,200
Hi, I'm just Lee Dam.

157
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,780
Nice to meet you. Let's be friends.

158
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,390
Sure.

159
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,999
You come here often, so this is on the house.

160
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,460
Please give it a try.

161
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,770
 I just met her. The kid from your place.

162
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,219
- Yang Min Ju. 
 - Here.

163
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,010
- Park Jin Young. 
 - Yes.

164
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,420
- Min Tae Seob. 
 - Yes.

165
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,680
- Kwon Na Young. 
 - Yes.

166
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,140
- Kim Hyeok Won. 
 - Yes.

167
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,440
Okay, let's begin.

168
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,769
Why does she keep staring at me like that?

169
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,800
What is communication?

170
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,079
The act of exchanging information. Conversing.

171
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,109
A sharing of ideas between people.

172
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,619
It can be defined in many ways.

173
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,600
Fifty percent of this lecture will be practical exercises.

174
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,280
You'll be experiencing varied interpersonal relationships

175
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,579
through simulations and writing reports.

176
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,660
The first assignment is "romantic relationship".

177
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
 Wow!

178
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,799
You'll form pairs and go on dates every week.

179
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,139
Then you'll each write a report on how you communicated.

180
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,120
I randomly selected the pairs before class.

181
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,989
Settle down. Here's the list.

182
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,320
Look for your partners.

183
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,220

184
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,340

185
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,130
Darn it.

186
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,970
It's as if fate is helping Seon Woo.

187
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,800
I guess he'll win the ₩100.000 ($100).

188
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,639
 Seon Woo is much better, though.

189
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,580
 Isn't she pretty?

190
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,609
- Lucky me. 
 - Sunbae, one minute.

191
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,039
Hey, Dam. Lee Dam.

192
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,899
I love your sneakers.

193
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,770
Can you buy them for about ₩100.000?

194
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,950
- You can go first. 
 - Should we?

195
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,249
Hurry up.

196
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,669
- What is it? 
 - Well,

197
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,959
it's about how we were paired up.

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,379
If you're too busy, we don't have to go on dates.

199
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,080
We can just match our stories and write the—

200
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,250
I'm free whenever.

201
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,169
Speaking of which, why don't we set a date?

202
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,250
How about Saturday?

203
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,180
Sure, I guess.

204
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,480
I'll text you with the time and place.

205
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,550
It'll be between lunch and dinner,

206
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,950
when it's not too early or too late.

207
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,190
 Sir, I somehow got involved with that tiger sunbae again...

208
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,740
I'll just tell him when I get home.

209
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,819
Seok Sunbae.

210
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,559
- Hi. 
 - Hi, Da Young.

211
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,299
- Hi. 
 - What's this?

212
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,849
Our club is promoting healthy campus culture.

213
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,890
Will you sign this?

214
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,809
Okay. Let me take a look.

215
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,860
The more people who know, the better.

216
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,000
Hey, Tae Jin.

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,459
Did you see that exchange student?

218
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,449
Her body is just—

219
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,940
It's not just her body. She looks like a celebrity.

220
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,909
- Exactly. 
 - So?

221
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:29,269
- Should I hit on her? 
 - Should we plan a get-together?

222
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:31,140
She doesn't have friends yet, so I think she would show up.

223
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,179
I don't know. She looks so haughty.

224
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,330
She might be cold.

225
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,449
Why aren't there any pretty girls?

226
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,569
What? You can find some if you take a good look around.

227
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:42,589
I think Lee Dam isn't half-bad.

228
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,910
I'd say she's definitely an A.

229
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,960
Enough is enough.

230
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,319
- I'd say an A is going too far. 
 - Too far?

231
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,909
Dam has a pretty face, but she's missing that something.

232
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:58,209
- I would say B+. 
 - My gosh.

233
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,729
Hey, how can Dam be a B+? You joking?

234
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,669
Forget her looks.

235
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,059
What about her personality? And she's a weirdo.

236
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,229
Wait, Tae Jin.

237
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,919
You're still sulking over how she turned you down.

238
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,149
What the heck are you saying?

239
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,039
I wouldn't take her even if she was free.

240
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,540
Hey.

241
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,380
What are you all doing?

242
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,959
I'm not an object.

243
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,390
Why are you talking that way about how I'm free, or whatever?

244
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,659
Aren't you going to apologize?

245
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,580
For what?

246
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,670
We were just joking around.

247
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,650
Jo...?

248
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,930
This is so absurd that the situation is becoming a joke.

249
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,330
If your families raised you right,

250
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,609
shouldn't you know that it's not right

251
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,550
to judge people based on their looks?

252
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,149
If you don't know what you should apologize for, then don't.

253
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:59,109
I'll just take it to mean that you had no one to teach you at home.

254
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,060
What the heck?

255
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,410
Hey, Dam.

256
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,210
One second.

257
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,020
- Sunbae, let me have a quick word. 
 - Sure.

258
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,500
So,

259
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,420
I didn't say a word.

260
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,140
Right, you really didn't say a word.

261
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,840
Are you mad?

262
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,270
Hey, I'm talking to you. You can't leave like th—

263
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,840
Just hit me until you feel better. I'll take it.

264
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,489
Then put it out.

265
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,860
- What? 
 - Put your face out.

266
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,360
If you don't put it out on the count of three, I'll start hitting you wherever.

267
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,670
One.

268
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,820
Two.

269
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,590
- No, wait. 
 - Three.

270
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,370
Sunbae, it's not something you need to apologize for.

271
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,869
But

272
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,710
I don't think it's okay, even to just listen to talk like that.

273
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,800
One second!

274
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,599
Thank you.

275
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,620
Thank you.

276
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,199
- Have you heard? 
 - What?

277
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:58,250
How our sunbaes graded Dam on her looks.

278
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,790
I did.

279
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,039
They said they wouldn't take her even if she was free.

280
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,680
And I heard Sunbae Seon Woo was there, too.

281
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,660
Exactly. She shouldn't have thrown herself at him.

282
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,110
I guess Sunbae Seon Woo really hated it, too.

283
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,180
She was always with him and showing off, like that made her somebody.

284
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,300
- How embarrassing. 
 - People will hear you.

285
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,280
Excuse me.

286
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,539
College life is much more interesting than I expected.

287
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,479
I even got a partner under the pretext of coursework,

288
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,200
to learn about romantic relationships or whatever.

289
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,339
I'm about to start dating a guy seven hundred years my junior.

290
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,780
I shouldn't have sent you there.

291
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,869
If I knew you'd call me this often, I wouldn't have.

292
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:58,220
The really interesting story begins now.

293
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,260
The kid you live with got paired up with the tiger boy.

294
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,759
Was his name Gye Seon Woo?

295
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,889
There's no need to report back on every detail.

296
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,429
What I asked you for is Miss Dam's safety,

297
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,919
not information on her private life.

298
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,330
Just make sure you look after her so that nothing bad happens.

299
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,379
 Then is this considered dangerous?

300
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,490
She looked as if she was about to cry any minute.

301
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,090
Are you sure you have zero interest in her private life?

302
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,020
Of course.

303
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,339
So if it isn't about the Bead, don't meddle with her.

304
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,870
Look at this.

305
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,270
- Isn't that hilarious? 
 - Exactly.

306
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,810
- Look. 
 - This is insane.

307
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,460
Sunbae.

308
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,330
Sunbae!

309
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,779
Where did you find this information?

310
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,709
On Dikipedia, or was it Mikipedia? 
  (T/N:  Free encyclopedia sites that anyone online can edit)

311
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,399
- And an online forum. 
 - I know that one, too.

312
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,080
Look at this.

313
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,240
We need accurate information to analyze or reinterpret what we have.

314
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,579
It's no big deal. Why are you arguing again?

315
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,760
It's exhausting.

316
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,199
That exhaustion is from lack of nicotine.

317
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,060
Let's go for a smoke, okay?

318
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,339
We can't work with this information.

319
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:30,180
Let's find some more data.

320
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,180
Sure.

321
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,619
Oh yeah, are you all right?

322
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,299
I heard the story.

323
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,439
What story?

324
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,459
Everyone in school already knows

325
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:48,600
how the sunbaes graded you on your looks.

326
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,099
I feel bad for you. It must be awkward to be in seminars with them.

327
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,020
I don't really want to talk about people who aren't here.

328
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,120
Trying to act cool.

329
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,600
What did you say?

330
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,189
You heard that?

331
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,679
You meant for me to hear it.

332
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,009
To be honest, I think your fakeness is absurd.

333
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,229
You pushed the image of a carefree girl who doesn't care about guys,

334
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:21,470
but then you suddenly became so close to Sunbae Seon Woo.

335
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,489
I really want to learn how to put on that kind of innocent act.

336
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,800
I agree. Tell us your secret.

337
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,300
You two don't need to learn how to be fake.

338
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,499
You're good at talking about people behind their backs,

339
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,209
then pretending that you're their friend

340
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,409
and you're worried about them.

341
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,210
What?

342
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,940
I heard you two talking about me before.

343
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,910
Honestly, I was more uncomfortable

344
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,810
seeing you, than those sunbaes.

345
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:59,200
Since I'd thought of you as friends.

346
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,660
So I didn't want to bring up such an uncomfortable subject, but I didn't need to.

347
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,110
Who asked you to? Whatever.

348
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,650
Hey, Da Young!

349
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,450
What?

350
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,969
Again, you pretended you didn't know anything after you heard us.

351
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,510
The uncomfortable person will go, so good luck.

352
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,560
Dam, you're a smart girl so you can handle it alone, right?

353
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,850
Da Young, wait for me.

354
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,210
Where are they going?

355
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,760
What, did you get into a fight?

356
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,440
Hey, this is great. Then let's just do it next time.

357
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,980
Sunbae.

358
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,700
We have to turn this in today.

359
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,889
You broke up the group. What do you want from me?

360
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:49,629
Just say that it'll be a few days late.

361
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,169
If you want to go, then go.

362
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,319
But I won't list your name on the project.

363
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,430
Won't list...?

364
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,529
- Do whatever you want. 
 - Hey.

365
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:00,660
Keep my name in.

367

368
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:36,100

369
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,130

♫   closer to you  ♫

371
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,650
♫   That’s how I feel   ♫

372
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,110
♫   That’s what I want to do, that’s all   ♫

373
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:20,520
♫   I hear the raindrops outside the window   ♫

374
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,590

376
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,140
♫   Because I don’t think our encounter   ♫

377
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,740
Sir!

378
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,930
You seemed to be running late, so I came for you.

379

♫   I want to feel it without saying anything   ♫

00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,540
♫   closer to you   ♫

382
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,010
Are you alright, Miss Dam?

383
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,420
No, I'm not okay.

384
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,090
Why are you crying?

385
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,500
Did something happen today?

386
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,200
I tend to break out in tears when something unfair happens to me.

387
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,740
♫   I’m not afraid   ♫

388
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,000
♫  I’m not sad  ♫

389
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,630
You must be very upset, Miss Dam.

390
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,640
I'm sorry. Something really unfair happened today,

391
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,870
so when I saw you suddenly, I...

392
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,870
Miss Dam.

393
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,380
In my case,

394
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:18,700
I went to a mountain fortress whenever I felt troubled.

395
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,159
And as I walked along the fortress,

396
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,269
everything that troubled me

397
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,780
gradually became nothing special.

398
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,080
So let me know

399
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,350
if you have a place like that mountain fortress.

400
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,760
I'll go there with you.

401
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,150

Oh, Sir. You should sing a song, too.

420
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,399
- Me? 
 - Right.

421
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,260
You wouldn't know any songs, Sir.

422
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,640
Sorry.

423
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,560
Miss Dam, I didn't get here using a time machine.

424
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,159
I've lived through many generations,

425
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,470
and I always kept up with culture to adapt to the changing times.

426
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,490
Do you honestly think I don't know any recent songs?

427
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,710
Whoa.

428
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,310

  (T/N: Song from 1982)

436
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,110
That's my grandpa's go-to song.

437
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,110
You really deserve to be called sir, Sir.

438
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,080
I just sang it because I like the melody. It's not really my song.

439
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,150

440
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,390
You like grandpa snacks, too.

441
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,070
There's no difference...

442
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,770

443
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,710
Why are you looking at me like that?

444
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,240
It just looks like you feel better, so I'm relieved.

445
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,480
It's thanks to you, Sir.

446
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,590
Today could've been remembered as the worst,

447
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,310
but, thanks to you, it became a little more fun.

448
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,330
Thank you, really.

449
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,980
What? Only he looks good.

450
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,170
My brother sent me pictures,

451
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,690
but I don't look good in any of them, right?

452
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,150
Why did he send me these?

453
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,349
Oh, you know that day I went out saying that I had plans.

454
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:53,430
I went to watch my brother's match.

455
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,090
Those plans

456
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,920
- were to meet your brother. 
 - Yes.

457
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,710
Why did you smile?

458
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,750
- I smiled? 
 - Yes.

459
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,170
- What? 
 - What?

460
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,290
You got some on there.

461
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,470
You really are so ancient.

462
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,410
You can't stand seeing anything out of place.

463
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,260
I think he will be a really great person once he becomes human.

464
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,760
What's wrong, Miss Dam?

465
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,940
My stomach suddenly began to ache.

466
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,140
What's today's date, Sir?

467
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,080
I believe it's the 2nd.

468
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,960

469
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:12,819
 Hi! I came back this month to destroy your character and happiness.

470
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,649
Sir, I'm expecting my condition to worsen today, so I'll go and get some rest.

471
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:24,150
What do you mean, you're expecting it to worsen?

472
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,190
Are you alright, Miss Dam?

473
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,060
You don't need any lunch?

474
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,310
Should I pick up some yum woon sen? 
  (T/N:  Thai glass noodles salad)

475
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,220
Pi... 
  (T/N: Pi is blood in korean)

476
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,920
I'm coming in, Miss Dam.

477
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,180
Pizza,

478
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,400

  (T/N: spicy stir-fried rice cakes)

480
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,410
I'm sorry, Miss Dam. I didn't know you were so sick.

481
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,519
Why are you sorry, Sir?

482
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:27,569
It's not like you're my estrogen.

483
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:28,970
What?

484
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,140
It's period cramps.

485
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,660
Oh! Then what can I...?

486
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,350
I'll go get a heating pad, food, and some warm water.

487
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,760
I'm sick, but it tastes good.

488
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,130
Take your time, Miss Dam.

489
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,680
And I got something for you.

490
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,640
These are supplements

491
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,869
and these are painkillers.

492
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,990
And these are your favorite snacks.

493
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,069
Sir, I think you'll definitely become a good human.

494
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,969
- What? 
 - Whether it's my department sunbaes

495
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:33,440
or what's on the news, there are so many bad people out there.

496
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,100
To be honest, when I first met you,

497
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,649
it felt like a fantasy.

498
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,670
But now, after dealing with other humans, it feels even more fantastical.

499
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:48,159
Anyway, you are way more humane than those weirdos, Sir.

500
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,110
It's really not easy to be nice to someone without expecting anything in return like this.

501
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,959
I brought you a thicker comforter

502
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,859
in case it gets cold at night.

503
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,270
Thank you, Sir.

504
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,600
Does it hurt a lot?

505
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,709
Kind of.

506
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,539
I've never felt so sick on "that day" before.

507
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,800
This time, my whole body feels weak.

508
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,910
It's a little strange.

509
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,050
I'll get some rest now, Sir.

510
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,569
Okay. Sleep well, Miss Dam.

511
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:46,790
Good night.

512
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,689
 You remember we're meeting tomorrow, right?

513
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,000
 I'll see you in front of the school at 2:00 p.m.

514
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,130
Right. The assignment.

515
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,310
I should feel better by tomorrow morning.

516
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,860
I forgot that period cramps peak on the second day.

517
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,840
If I go out like this

518
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,960
and we happen to touch...

519
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,570
 One of us won't make it.

520
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,070
Goodness.

521
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,340
Where are you going, Miss Dam?

522
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,550
I have an assignment today.

523
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,549
I need to go on a date with that sunbae born in the Year of the Tiger.

524
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,489
But you really don't look well.

525
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,469
Why don't you just cancel?

526
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,810
I thought about it, too,

527
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,169
but this is the first assignment for the semester.

528
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,169
I would've let it go if it was an individual assignment,

529
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,670
but if I don't do it, I won't be the only one getting a bad grade.

530
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,890
So I'm going, but I'll try to keep it short.

531
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,690
Then, I'll be going.

532
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,080
What if there's another way?

533
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,610
What?

534
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,830
I know a way

535
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,230
that you don't need to leave.

536
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,529
Hey, Seo Woo.

537
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,199
What the... Have you lost your mind?

538
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,869
Why are you screaming in my ear?

539
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,499
Your face is like an exam.

540
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,550
I hate it more as it approaches.

541
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,799
Whatever.

542
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,499
You took my sweater again, didn't you? Where did you put it?

543
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,209
It's probably under my bed.

544
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,809
Buy your own, for goodness' sake.

545
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,510
Why should I buy it when you have it?

546
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,150
Since she didn't cancel the date,

547
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,380
maybe she's not mad anymore.

548
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,270
I found it. Iron it if you want.

549
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,920
Hey, forget it.

550
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,290
Do you think this would go well with this?

551
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,169
Are you meeting a girl?

552
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,589
A new girlfriend? An ex-girlfriend? A soon-to-be-girlfriend?

553
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,830
Come on. Take a look.

554
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,419
Do they look weird together?

555
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,260
Who's this girl you're paying so much attention to?

556
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,449
Then again, you really do have to take care of your appearance.

557
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,700
So that your looks can cover you when your mouth ruins everything...

558
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,959
Hey.

559
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,940
- Go. 
 - Come on...

560
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,689
Sir, are you sure that you're going to be okay?

561
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,759
Of course. Doing this

562
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,100
makes me feel better, too.

563
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,429
I'll go on the date for you,

564
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,890
so don't worry and get some rest at home.

565
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,710
I will.

566
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,370
By the way, do I really look like this?

567
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,340
I somehow look like I've been seriously photoshopped.

568
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,339
I think you're being nice to me, Sir.

569
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,750
In case I'm frightened by my own face.

570
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,000
I'll get going then.

571
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,930
Okay. Good luck.

572
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,990
You're here.

573
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,110
Hello.

574
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,910
 What's this? Today, she's especially...

575
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,219
I booked the movie tickets.

576
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,200
Should we go eat first?

577
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,260
I have a restaurant in mind. How about we go there?

578
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,879
What you had in mind was a gamjatang place? 
  (T/N: pork backbone and potato stew)

579
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,829
- More kimchi, please. 
 - Coming.

580
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:27,140
I heard this was the best restaurant near the school.

581
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,060
- You don't like it? 
 - No, that's not what I mean.

582
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,590
So,

583
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,519
I'm sorry about before.

584
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,540
Like you said, I shouldn't have let the guys

585
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,390
judge you by your appearance.

586
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,500
Anyway, thank you for forgiving me.

587
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,030
- I never said that I forgive you. 
 - What?

588
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,180
I see.

589
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,900
 She eats gamjatang as if it was steak.

590
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,940
 She eats so daintily.

591
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,420
 But she's definitely not my type.

592
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,290
 He's easy to read.

593
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:38,200
 Miss Dam doesn't seem to know yet.

594
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,809
 And it seems he only just realized it himself.

595
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,240
Enjoy.

596
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,670
 How should I get rid of him?

597
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,049
 Jae Jin, looking forward to hearing about

598
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,329
 your date with the goddess.

599
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,590
 See if she has a boyfriend and ask what her ideal type is.

600
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,860
 Write everything down.

601
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,119
 I'm so jealous.

602
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,290
 What did you do to become so lucky?

603
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,520
I actually felt rather uncomfortable.

604
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,200
- You came. 
 - Of course, that's why I'm here. 
  (T/N: She doesn't understand phrases and takes everything literally.)

605
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,230
Oh, right.

606
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,729
You've been abroad for a long time,

607
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,969
so I thought you wouldn't know much about Korea yet.

608
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,219
Since I've lived in Korea longer,

609
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,929
I planned our date today.

610
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,079
Did you say

611
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,659
you've lived here longer?

612
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,159
Yes, of course.

613
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,299
Anyway, how about we eat first?

614
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:40,319
Maybe Koreans' favorite food, bulgogi—

615
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,380
I'm not hungry.

616
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,329
Well, then...

617
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,870
let's s-skip the meal.

618
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,169
Next up is

619
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,085
Koreans' favorite hobby, noraebang (karaoke).

620
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:53,869
Koreans' favorite hobby, noraebang (karaoke).

621
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,009
Are you a good singer?

622
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,480
Yes, I'm better than most...

623
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,130
Maybe I'm not.

624
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,339
 What's happening?

625
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,839
 This is how my exes used to talk

626
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,920
 when they wanted to break up with me.

627
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,450
Next is...

628
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,550
Koreans' favorite date activity,

629
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,389
watching a movie.

630
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:28,320

631
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,160
- The tickets. 
 - Thanks.

632
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,350
Hey! Dam!

633
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,839
Wow, what a coincidence!

634
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,559
I'm so glad to see you here.

635
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,049
I really missed you.

636
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,870
 What is he doing here?

637
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,709
You're doing the assignment with Dam, right?

638
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,729
- Yes. 
 - That's great.

639
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,289
We're doing the assignment, too. Let's have a double date.

640
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,779
Is that okay with you?

641
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,840
- I'm not sure. 
 - Me neither.

642
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,989
Come on. Let's hang out together.

643
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,049
Just this once. You know how much I've helped you.

644
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,410
Release me!

645
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,750
What's with the tone? Did you binge a historical drama?

646
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,759
Come on. Let's hang out together!

647
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,439
I'll pay for food and drinks and everything!

648
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,880
I'd love to hang out together.

649
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,189
Sounds fun.

650
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,060
 You...

651
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,040
- Do you want some popcorn? 
 - No, I'm good.

652
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,489
You two look great together.

653
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,729
You look pretty close.

654
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,959
Do we?

655
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,320
We're not close. I'm just his hoobae. 
  (T/N: Hoobae - means junior)

656
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,280
That's true. For now.

657
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,230
Sunbae, what do you mean, "for now"?

658
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,569
I think I should use the restroom.

659
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,290
I'll go with you.

660
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,730
That Gye Seon Woo seemed quite good-looking.

661
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:27,469
Are your preferences the reason why you still haven't collected enough human energy yet?

662
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,539
Watch your mouth.

663
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,930
Please, let's get through this quietly.

664
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,229
Well,

665
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,910
I'm too curious for that.

666
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,840
What exactly is going on today?

667
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,370
I only came in her place because she's sick.

668
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:46,389
I suppose

669
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:51,060
she can't be well when the Bead is stealing her energy.

670
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,940
- Sunbaenim, how about we switch partners? 
 - No.

671
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,239
Then how about the four of us keep meeting up as a group?

672
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,090
- No. 
 - Why not?

673
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:09,150
Wait. Are you serious about Dam?

674
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,330
Why don't we head in?

675
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:16,439
So what movie is this?

676
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,229
I just booked what they booked.

677
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,509
- What movie is this, sunbae? 
 - I don't know.

678
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,620
It looked like a romance from the title.

679
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,370
Romance...

680
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,030
 What's with this movie?

681
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,550
 There are hardly any lines.

682
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,130
 No, I shouldn't gulp here.

683
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,970
 This is mild.

684
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,500
Hye Sun, should we j-just go?

685
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,840
Why? You spent money on this.

686
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,080
 This is mild.

687
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,180
The title made it sound like a rom-com.

688
00:50:33,181 --> 00:50:35,599

689
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,189
What should we do? Let's grab a beer if you're free. It's on me.

690
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,229
I think we should call it a day.

691
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,650
Why? Let's go grab a beer.

692
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,719
Let's call it a day. I'm a bit tired, too.

693
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,099
Okay. Let's call it a day. Right now.

694
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,599
I'll take you home.

695
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,459
No, I would like to go on my own.

696
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,950
Have a safe trip back.

697
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,760
Dam is a little weird today.

698
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,200
She is. She keeps confusing us.

699
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,960
 Wait. Are you serious about Dam?

700
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,100
 What is Dam's type?

701
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,359
 Well, she seems to consider looks,

702
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,340
 but character seems to matter the most.

703
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,130
 In short, the good guy type.

704
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:24,220
 - The good guy type? 
 - Yes. A kind and...

705
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,840
What's that? What should I do?

706
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:50,360
Sir, why are you sleeping here?

707
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,780
Sir.

708
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:26,510
I feel bad

709
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,050
putting him through all this.

710
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,370
 I suppose

711
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,750
 she can't be well since the Bead is stealing her energy.

712
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,009
 But I wasn't asking how she's doing.

713
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,800
 I was asking why you're doing this.

714
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,510
 What are you trying to say?

715
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,020
 One mistake is enough.

716
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,160
 When you said you'd started living with a human, I was worried

717
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,370
 that you might mess things up because of your personal feelings.

718
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,609
 In the end, the Bead will steal all her energy

719
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,880
 and that child will either die or be close to death.

720
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,370
 And it'll be torture for you to watch that happen in front of you.

721
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,310
 Still, I thought it might be okay because you're Shin Woo Yeo.

722
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,200
 But you seem to be getting attached to her.

723
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,970
 Think about it.

724
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,450
 Has it ever ended well

725
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,400
 when we had feelings?

726
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,060
She's right.

727
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,850
Getting attached to her won't help anything.

728
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,250
Good morning, Sir.

729
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,990
You looked really tired yesterday. How do you feel?

730
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,650
I'm okay.

731
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,130
I'm sure it was hard.

732
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:51,980
Thank you and sorry.

733
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,480
Why aren't you saying anything?

734
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,470
- Oh, maybe I was too focused on the book. 
 - Ah.

735
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,510
Maybe he's still very tired?

736
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:24,050
Surprise. Let's eat this together, Sir.

737
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,599
I thought about buying seonji again,

738
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,000
but it seems like that's all we eat.

739
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,330
So, this time, I got sweets that are good for fatigue.

740
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,749
Look at the generous amount of cream.

741
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,330
Doesn't it look amazing? Let's eat it together.

742
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,880
Miss Dam, as I've said before,

743
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,890
I don't enjoy human food.

744
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:48,110
But we've always eaten together...

745
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,240
Oh, okay.

746
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:19,789
Sir, I'm going to school.

747
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,440
Okay.

748
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,660
 He seems to be avoiding me.

749
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,400
 But why?

750
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,380
 Did I do something wrong?

751
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,039
What are you doing? I called you from over there.

752
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:52,390
What?

753
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,069
Hey, look.

754
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,930
Someone you've been getting along with suddenly starts avoiding you.

755
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,330
What do you think the reason is?

756
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:02,220
Why? Is someone avoiding you?

757
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,820
- Is it Sunbae Seon Woo? 
 - No, it's not him.

758
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:13,390
What made this person start avoiding you?

759
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,040
I'm not sure.

760
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,340
He seemed a little tired,

761
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,350
but other than that...

762
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:25,160
Well, if you haven't done anything wrong,

763
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,960
The reason might lie with that person, not you.

764
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,770
I see.

765
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,160
I wonder what it is.

766
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,480
Do you have a crush on someone?

767
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,640
Crush? No way.

768
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,949
I don't know much about him yet,

769
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,600
and nothing happened to make me start liking him.

770
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,439
Anyway, that's definitely not it.

771
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,580
Okay. Then why do you care so much?

772
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,100
What?

773
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,470
Just because. No reason.

774
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:08,020
   Have you written the report yet?

775
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,040
 Do you want to do it together to get the stories straight?

776
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,190
I'm home.

777
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:34,360
Sir, I have a question.

778
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,800
It's about my sunbae born in the Year of the Tiger.

779
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,620
He wants to meet to write the report together.

780
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,500
But if it makes you uncomfortable, I'll say no—

781
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,700
Miss Dam,

782
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,560
you don't need my permission for that.

783
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,040
What?

784
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,620
But you were worried about it before.

785
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,920
Since you're doing the assignment together, you can't avoid him forever.

786
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,699
And I know you can take care of yourself now

787
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,040
and avoid contact with him.

788
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,029
That's true, but—

789
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:05,880
Unless it's important, you don't need to tell me everything from now on.

790
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,640
We are nothing more than

791
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,360
two people who are temporarily connected

792
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,250
due to unforseen circumstances.

793
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,330
Who doesn't know that?

794
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,990
When he gave me that, he was so sweet.

795
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,930
Why did he suddenly...

796
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,109
Did something happen during the assignment?

797
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:06,180
When he was with Sunbae Seon Woo?

798
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,490
I mean,

799
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,390
why did we come such a long way?

800
01:02:23,399 --> 01:02:25,629
I heard they have great desserts here. It's a hot—

801
01:02:25,629 --> 01:02:28,450
Then should we do the assignment first?

802
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:35,000
I didn't know what you'd like, so I ordered everything.

803
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,710
Should we finish the assignment first?

804
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,749
Let's talk about what happened that day.

805
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,180
We went to a gamjatang place, right?

806
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,970
Yes.

807
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,370
Did I eat heartily?

808
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:50,049
Did I look a little upset

809
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:52,369
or indifferent?

810
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,559
Not at all.

811
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,730
You didn't eat as well as usual,

812
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,730
but prettily...

813
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,150
What?

814
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,680
What?

815
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:06,470
Never mind. You ate well.

816
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:12,869
Then, did you say anything

817
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:16,140
that might upset or offend me?

818
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,579
Why?

819
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,089
Did I make a mistake?

820
01:03:19,089 --> 01:03:20,659
I don't think I said anything special.

821
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,450
No. Just asking.

822
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:25,729
What did we do after that?

823
01:03:25,729 --> 01:03:27,210
We went to the movies.

824
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,480
That's right.

825
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,790
How was I there?

826
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:34,129
You were fine.

827
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:37,650
We met Jae Jin and Hye Sun and hung out with them.

828
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,740
Fine should mean

829
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,550
there wasn't any real trouble.

830
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,759
But why do you keep talking like you weren't there?

831
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,160
What?

832
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,170
What do you mean?

833
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,670
 It seems like nothing special happened.

834
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,810
 Then why...

835
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,659
I can take you to your door.

836
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:17,860
I'm good, sunbae. See you at school.

837
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,130
Dam.

838
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,950
Can I ask you something?

839
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,920
What is it?

840
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,190
The man you were with at school the other day...

841
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,540
Who is he?

842
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,730
Oh, he's...

843
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:43,110
Well, I know you said you somehow got to know him,

844
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:46,040
but what exactly does that mean?

845
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:52,970
♫   Close your eyes and feel my dream   ♫

846
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:54,990
It's just like I said.

847
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:58,670
I somehow came to know him.

848
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,490
Nothing more, nothing less.

849
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:05,360
♫   A long day goes by   ♫

850
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:09,070
♫   And the night has come again   ♫

851
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:16,330
♫   Without fail, I’m thinking about you   ♫

852
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:23,460
♫   Your memories, your breath   ♫

853
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:30,700
♫   Suddenly, they fill up my heart one by one   ♫

854
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:37,980
♫   It confuses me. Because without even knowing   ♫

855
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:44,710
♫   You’ve grown so big   ♫

856
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,470
♫   All about you   ♫

857
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:52,050
♫   all about you my love   ♫

858
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:59,160
♫   I want to feel it without saying anything   ♫

859
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,440
♫   I want to get a little   ♫

860
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,420
♫  closer to you  ♫

861
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:15,540
♫   That’s how I feel. That’s what I want to do, that’s all   ♫

862
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:21,790
♫   Even if we grow apart some day   ♫

863
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:30,570
♫   I don’t want to think about it right now   ♫

864
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:36,350
♫   Even if I wake up from this dream, if you’re next to me   ♫

865
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:38,130
Miss Dam.

866
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:41,830
♫   I’m not afraid   ♫

867
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,490
♫  I’m not sad   ♫

868
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,580
Sir,

869
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,189
just like you said,

870
01:06:49,189 --> 01:06:52,119
I know we got involved due to unforeseen circumstances.

871
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,620
So I know we don't need to care about each other.

872
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,490
But...

873
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,980
I can't do that.

874
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,819
I want to go back to how we used to be. What should I do?

875
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:06,680
Miss Dam—

876
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,369
You said you feel comfortable around me. That I was okay.

877
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:12,289
You said the Bead wasn't the only reason why you were nice to me.

878
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:14,760
How can a person change his mind like—

879
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,299
Does this mean you can just change your mind because you're not a person?

880
01:07:20,299 --> 01:07:24,110
If you suddenly back away when we were getting along so well...

881
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:27,830
Miss Dam,

882
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,810
I said that because I thought

883
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:33,759
it might be better if I don't get too deeply involved in your life.

884
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:37,480
But it looks like I made you feel troubled again.

885
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,160
I'm sorry.

886
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,350
If you're sorry,

887
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:45,710
let's go back to how we used to be.

888
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,600
I'll come and sit again,

889
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,380
so talk to me and worry about me like you used to.

890
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,070
How did it go

891
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,200
with that sunbae?

892
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,580
It was just...

893
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,740
What's wrong?

894
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,860
Was he pushy again?

895
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,270
No, he was nice to me.

896
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:03,420
He said he wouldn't do anything I don't like from now on.

897
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:07,379
I'm sure he did.

898
01:09:07,379 --> 01:09:10,220
Because he has special feelings for you.

899
01:09:15,019 --> 01:09:17,250
Honestly,

900
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,350
I'm not sure.

901
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,060
I doubt it's true,

902
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,150
but if that sunbae happens to have special feelings for me,

903
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:29,569
I think that's strange.

904
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:33,050
Why is it strange?

905
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,730
I'm just not sure

906
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:39,210
what it is

907
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,959
to like someone.

908
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:44,728
He doesn't know everything about me,

909
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:47,300
so how could he like me?

910
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,420
What if he expects something from me?

911
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,760
What if I can't meet his expectations?

912
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,820
Then what should I do?

913
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,620
"There is always

914
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:09,320
some madness in love."

915
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,930
It's a line from Nietzsche's  Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

916
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,110
Liking someone may mean

917
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,380
that you are misunderstanding that person

918
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,270
in your own way.

919
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,970
So, what I'm trying to say is,

920
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:32,850
you could be Fermina Daza in someone's eyes, 
  (T/N: Female protagonist in the book "Love in the Time of Cholera")

921
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:35,970
and that won't be a misunderstanding.

922
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,560
Fermina Daza?

923
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,300
She's a heroine from a classic novel.

924
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:50,150
"To him, she seemed so beautiful, so seductive,"

925
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,910
"so different from ordinary people,"

926
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:58,600
"that he could not understand"

927
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,020
"why no one was as disturbed as he"

928
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,980
"by the clicking of her heels on the paving stones,"

929
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,410
"why no one else's heart was wild"

930
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:15,600
"with the breeze stirred by the sighs of her veils,"

931
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:20,190
"why everyone did not go mad with the movements of her braid,"

932
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:23,690
"the flight of her hands,"

933
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:27,250
"the gold of her laughter."

934
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,190
"He could not understand"

935
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:33,500
"why anyone wouldn't fall in love with her."

936
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:53,030

937
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:03,260

946
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,779
 Maybe I was just impressed because of his overwhelming good looks.

947
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,439
 This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make Dam fall in love.

948
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:45,440
 I like you.

949
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:51,129
 Living in the same house, I get attached to him.

950
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:54,070
 Can we talk for a moment?

951
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:58,549
 Are you sure she's no different from all the boring people you've met?

952
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:03,040
 But you seem true to yourself at every moment.

953
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,650
 I like it.
