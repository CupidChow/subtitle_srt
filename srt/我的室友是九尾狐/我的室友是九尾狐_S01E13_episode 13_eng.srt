1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:09,390

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,949

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,430

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,040

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,930

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,170

7
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,720
I was willing to bear it.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,330
I wanted this relationship despite everything.

9
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,910
Though you were not human,

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,299
and you lied to me and used me,

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,960
I just liked you.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,160
So many things scared and worried me,

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,480
but all I cared about was if I would hurt you.

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,770
How could you do this to me?

15
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,239
Miss Dam.

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,710
Let's...

17
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,720
stop this.

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:40,390
♫  The meaningless answer, that look on your face   ♫

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,490
♫   At some point I stopped wanting to believe you   ♫

20
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,970
♫   Even though I try to find a reason for your change of heart   ♫

21
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,820
 I was fully convinced that he was a good person.

22
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:03,000
♫   Still every day remains the same   ♫

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,770
 I thought I knew all that was there to know.

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,310
 That the Sir I know

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,690
 would never be careless with anyone

26
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,640
 or hurt them.

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,060
 I lied.

28
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,310
 I needed energy to become human,

29
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,410
 and you happened to be there.

30
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,420
 I had forgotten that our relationship

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,330
 also started that way,

32
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,300
 just because I like him.

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,690
♫   Is because the feelings   ♫

34
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,980
♫   have already passed   ♫

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,280
♫   So I’ll have to endure   ♫

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,970
♫   through this love that came too late   ♫

37
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,120
I can't believe the lecture was canceled so suddenly.

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,519
This is awesome.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,100
What do you mean, awesome? We won't get to see Professor Shin.

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,999
Oh, right.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,700
Besides, don't you think he canceled the lecture

42
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,369
because of the rumors about him and Professor Seo?

43
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,580
Look.

44
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,680
See? The way they're holding hands, it's obvious that they're dating.

45
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,110
What are you doing?

46
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,550
Hey, how can you just grab my phone?

47
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,810

48
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,490
What is it?

49
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,540
You don't even have to tell me.

50
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,850
So, Dam also found out?

51
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,690
You wouldn't budge when I told you to use other people, so why did you suddenly—

52
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,180
The Bead has changed.

53
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,390
What?

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,730
And so I

55
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,000
harbored a false hope.

56
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,940
 I was born a beast,

57
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,400
 but I dreamed of becoming someone's ordinary future.

58
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,850
 Whenever I was with you,

59
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,290
 I felt so at ease

60
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,140
 that I mistakenly thought all of the problems between us

61
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,690
 would be easy to resolve.

62
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:57,459
 Even though I knew that I'd put you in greater danger if I stayed with you,

63
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,540
 and that this wasn't a problem I could simply dismiss.

64
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,840
 And that night,

65
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,549
 when I could no longer bear my fate,

66
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,150
 I saw a sign of hope,

67
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,100
 even as fear crept into my heart.

68
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,910
 Since this blue glow grew out of your sacrifice.

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,790
 That's why I tried to use her.

70
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,850
 Professor Seo, it looks like your nail is broken.

71
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,710
 As long as you're unharmed,

72
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,350
 if I could live an ordinary life by your side,

73
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,910
 I was more than willing...

74
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,419
 Now tell me, what the rumor going around the university is.

75
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,590
 At times, I felt anxious.

76
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,360
 You could let me go at any time,

77
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,700
 and I knew that very well.

78
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,210
♫  Get close to you  ♫

79
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,280
 You put someone in danger

80
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,930
 instead of putting me in danger. Am I right?

81
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,710
 Because of me?

82
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,379
 I am not human

83
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,360
 so I'm unable to think like one.

84
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,140
 Even at this moment, I'm more afraid

85
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,180
 that you'll turn your back on me

86
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,860
 than for someone else's safety.

87
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,980
 Don't go.

88
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,710
 Let's...

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,790
 Don't let me go.

90
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,420
 stop this.

91
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,760
♫  Then look back at me once  ♫

92
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,390
♫  Once again, I spent a night filled with you  ♫

93
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,510
Here's your bag.

94
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,110
What's going on?

95
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,530
Thank goodness the lecture was canceled.

96
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,780
What made you run out without looking back?

97
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,740
Hey, be honest with me.

98
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,780
Your boyfriend was here, wasn't he?

99
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,470
If you cut class and left, it has to be something serious.

100
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,870
It doesn't make sense unless your boyfriend came to see you.

101
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,130
Tell him to come back if he hasn't gone too far. Let me meet him.

102
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,709
He's gone.

103
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,140
What, he doesn't have time?

104
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,000
I won't keep him for long.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,500
Okay?

106
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,060
That's not what I meant.

107
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,570
Wait, is it because he doesn't have money?

108
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,759
Don't worry. I won't mooch off him.

109
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,690
My treat.

110
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,180
It's not that.

111
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,710
I mean I don't have a boyfriend.

112
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,100
What do you mean?

113
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,050
You don't have a boyfriend?

114
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,150
What's wrong?

115
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,288
So,

116
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,610
what exactly happened?

117
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,570
You can't talk about it?

118
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,490
I don't know the details,

119
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,199
but if you can't tell me who he is

120
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,380
or share the reason for your breakup,

121
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,720
then you're better off without him. Great job.

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,180
That's true,

123
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,940
but it feels like the world is collapsing more than a hundred times over.

124
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,710
Then let it collapse.

125
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,859
Start crying and cursing him.

126
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,020
Do whatever you want.

127
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,820
Okay, good. Drink. Have another one.

128
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,250
Drink up.

129
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,350
Why did I say that to her an hour ago?

130
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,360
I should be punished.

131
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,830
♪ Why didn't you tell me? ♪

132

133
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,639
Was I not trustworthy?

134
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,449
I'm not sure. But Dam,

135
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,400
can you try using these things called legs?

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,029
Should I blame him for deceiving me?

141
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,260
Or should I blame myself for failing to earn his trust?

142
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,279
This isn't a call-in show.

143
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,219
Hey, get up.

144
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,780
Get up. Come on.

145
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,580
Soo Kyeong.

146
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,060
Do you think Sir is in as much pain as me?

147
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,219
What? What are you talking about?

148
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,860
I'm not sure what Sir you're talking about.

149
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,630
Wait, is that a pet name for your ex?

150
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,720
What?

151
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,430
Dam, what is it?

152
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,480
What's wrong? Hey!

153
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,270
Take a sample and check out our store.

154
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,789
Foxy girls all know

155
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,480
that you need to make use of an opportunity like this!

156
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,300
You shouldn't have made use of her.

157
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,980
- What? W-Who... 
 - You shouldn't have done that.

158
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,440
I was willing to deal with the fact

159
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,599
that you're a fox.

160
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:24,209
What? A fox? What's with you?

161
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,879
Why did you do that to me?

162
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,559
- Why are you doing this? Who are you? 
 - Why did you do that?

163
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,640
- Whoa, please. Please stop. 
 - Hey, Dam!

164
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,240
Come here.

165
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,170
Let's go home.

166
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,140
No, you'll only end up bawling.

167
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,909
Let's go clubbing, okay?

168
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,879
Once you're partying at a club, you'll completely forget

169
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,589
about that Sir or whomever.

170
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,850
Okay? Are you coming?

171
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,290
- Are you? 
 - Yes!

172
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,569
Dam, let's stop drinking and go dance.

173
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,600
I need to use the restroom.

174
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,579
What are you going to do?

175
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,040
It looks like she's not ready to say goodbye.

176
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,640
Should I help her out?

177
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,110
So his pet name is Sir, right? Sir.

178
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,430
   Sir, can you come right now?

179
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,580
I sent him the address, so he'll come if he still cares at all.

180
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,470
Professor Shin?

181
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,950
Professor! What brings you here?

182
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,520
Well, I...

183
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,069
I rarely come to a place like this,

184
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,229
but my friend broke up with her boyfriend today.

185
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,689
She was having such a hard time that I sent him a text message,

186
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,039
and now I'm waiting for him.

187
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,340
I want to get them back together.

188
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,500
I see. So that's what it was.

189
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,719
Anyway, this is unexpected.

190
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,920
You don't seem like the type who'd come to a place like this.

191
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,009
But since we're here,

192
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:57,360
why don't we give ourselves to the beat of the music?

193
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,760
Why? Professor, you should stay.

194
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,140
Instead of History 101, let's have Dance 101...

195
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,280
Man, why isn't Dam's ex texting back?

196
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,910
He's totally over her.

197
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,689
Dam.

198
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,969
Let's go dance.

199
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,709
You can completely forget about your ex-boyfriend.

200
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,249
Okay? Let's go.

201
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,690
Let's go.

202
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,460
Goodness, why can't I push this?

203
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
Be careful.

204
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,630
Thank you.

205
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,620
That could've been bad.

206
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,680
Sir.

207
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,140
Why are you...?

208
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,740
Because you were crying.

209
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,630
No matter how much we like each other,

210
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,310
we have to stop here, right?

211
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,870
Our relationship

212
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,320
is putting other people at risk, not just us.

213
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,890
That means we should stop here.

214
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,980
Why didn't you just ask me for help?

215
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,840
How could I?

216
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,960
I know better than anyone how much

217
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,550
pain and danger I could put you in.

218
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,640
I'm sorry

219
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,210
for liking you.

220
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:45,870
♫   All about you all about you my love   ♫

221
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:52,960
♫   I want to feel it without saying anything   ♫

222
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,190
♫   I want to get a little   ♫

223
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,220
♫   closer to you   ♫

224
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,530
♫   That’s how I feel   ♫

225
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,150
♫   That’s what I want to do, that’s all   ♫

226
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,770
 Noona.

227
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,889
Aren't you getting up? You said you have an early class.

228
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,640
Hey.

229
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,009
How did I get home last night?

230
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,010
What do you think? You came home wasted.

231
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,430
You blacked out again?

232
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,359
You shouldn't drink so much.

233
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,950
Get up. I made some bean sprout soup.

234
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,160
Was it a dream?

235
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,440
Drink this. You look troubled.

236
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,040
Are you okay?

237
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,900
Sunbae,

238
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,819
could you keep what happened

239
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,330
between Professor Shin and me a secret?

240
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,669
Things are already tough,

241
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,960
and I don't think I could deal with rumors too.

242
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,540
I won't tell anyone.

243
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,460
You didn't need to ask me.

244
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,480
Thank you.

245
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,610
It would've been better

246
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,990
if he was a good guy.

247
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,970
If he was so great that I couldn't even compare,

248
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,920
I thought I'd be able to move on.

249
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,920
What are you going to do?

250
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,380
Let's talk.

251
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,619
Have you met with Dam?

252
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,290
She really can't understand you?

253
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,560
I have no idea what to do.

254
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,340
Shin Woo Yeo.

255
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,760
What do you think Dam wants the most right now?

256
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,950
To part ways?

257
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,490
What are you talking about? You did that already.

258
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,109
Do you think she'd be scared of you at this point?

259
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,699
She's not afraid that she will be in danger.

260
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,770
She's afraid you'll also be putting other people in danger.

261
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,370
Well, I advised you to try using someone else too,

262
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,270
but I didn't consider how that would make Dam feel.

263
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:23,340
She's a human. Of course, she doesn't understand this situation.

264
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,809
So if you want to be loved by a human,

265
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,660
shouldn't you show her your humane side?

266
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,470
Now, look. Let's say you were driving.

267
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,180
Dam is standing on this side,

268
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,950
and there are five people on the other side.

269
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,929
If your brakes fail, and you have no choice but to hit one of the two,

270
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,490
- what would you do? 
 - I'd hit the five people.

271
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,859
What if one of them is pregnant?

272
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,569
- It wouldn't matter. 
 - What if there's a child?

273
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,560
- It wouldn't matter. 
 - What if I'm there?

274
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,780
It wouldn't matter.

275
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,540
 How can I make this guy more humane?

276
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,830
 Would Dam be better off with Seon Woo? They're connected by the red thread anyway.

277
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,919
 Hold on. Seon Woo's not humane either.

278
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,471
 Hold on. Seon Woo's not humane either.

279
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:15,089
 Then it's now a matter of

280
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,069
 which one becomes a decent human first.

281
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:22,340
 Honestly it could go either way.

282
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,909
Are you saying I'm wrong?

283
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,660
Then it's right for me to save those total strangers over Miss Dam?

284
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,010
That's not what I meant, but I thought you'd hesitate a tiny bit.

285
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,719
Why should I?

286
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,300
Because that's how humans are,

287
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,800
and I think that's what Dam wants from you.

288
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,500
Lee Dam. Wow, you reek of alcohol.

289
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,250
How much did you drink?

290
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,750
Let's go relieve your hangover. I'll buy you soup.

291
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,350
Hey, Hye Sun.

292
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,390
- Let's go. 
 - But...

293
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,310
I heard Woo Yeo cheated on you,

294
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,889
so you totally dumped him.

295
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,409
I mean, as you know, he didn't exactly cheat on me—

296
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,729
Don't take his side.

297
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,110
You two are over, so why are you protecting him?

298
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,540
How can I treat him like a stranger right away?

299
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,430
My feelings are still there.

300
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,390
At first, I couldn't believe what he did.

301
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,540
But then I kind of understood, then I couldn't again.

302
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,320
I feel like such a fool.

303
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,310
It's not your fault.

304
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,940
But it's not Woo Yeo's fault either.

305
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,179
I don't know what you were expecting, but he's a fox.

306
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:13,800
That means he could've deceived you much more thoroughly if he wanted to.

307
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,919
He didn't have to tell you about the red thread

308
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,599
or how he'd been

309
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,279
absorbing your energy even though he had the Bead.

310
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,000
And those rumors?

311
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,110
It wouldn't have been hard for him to get rid of them.

312
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,830
He could've completely deceived you.

313
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,370
But he didn't.

314
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,810
He's not human.

315
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,740
But when it comes to you, he could be humane.

316
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,019
I know that, but—

317
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,190
His Bead started to turn blue.

318
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,180
What do you mean, turning blue?

319
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,110
You didn't know?

320
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,910
Once his red Bead is dyed blue by human energy, he can become human.

321
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,509
His Bead had been stagnant for nearly a thousand years,

322
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,860
but it suddenly turned temporarily blue twice after he met you.

323
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:12,360
This time it stayed blue, although it only changed halfway.

324
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,439
Does that mean he could really become human—?

325
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,650
Do you get it now? Why Woo Yeo did something so out of character?

326
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,390
Hye Sun, I think I'd better go see him.

327
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,330
I'm sorry.

328
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,460
Can we talk for a second?

329
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,390
I'm sorry.

330
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,120
I don't know everything about

331
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,390
living like a human,

332
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,180
but if I made you cry, then I'm in the wrong.

333
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,980
Without a doubt.

334
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,070
If you don't care

335
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,540
whether I am a fox or a human,

336
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,970
then I'll stay this way.

337
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,900
For me, this relationship isn't something I can just let go of.

338
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,260
Then that's all the more reason you should've held onto me.

339
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,049
If there's anyone who can help you,

340
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,939
that should be me, not anyone else.

341
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,150
It has to be me. I'm your girlfriend.

342
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,330
Please give me the Bead.

343
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,169
- What? 
 - I don't want you seeing anyone else

344
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,490
or possibly putting them in danger.

345
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,359
But I also can't ask you to give everything up.

346
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,519
So give me the Bead.

347
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,119
- I can't do that. 
 - Why not? I said I'm fine with it.

348
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,519
I heard the Bead changed color.

349
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,329
It might hurt you more.

350
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,960
So please don't consider it just because of me.

351
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,089
Just because of you? Sir, you aren't just anyone to me.

352
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,049
Calm down first, and let's talk tomorrow, in the light of day.

353
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,519
No, I want to talk now, in the dark of night.

354
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,690
Give me the Bead.

355
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,150
What? Did he run away?

356
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,800
   Give me the Bead.

357
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,161

358
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,400
 We've already finished discussing this.

359
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,510
I'm not done.

360
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,959
I said I'll help you.

361
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,890
And I said no.

362
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,700
Why do you want to take a detour when you have a shortcut?

363
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,200
What? He ran off again?

364
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,040
I got you.

365
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,500
What?

366
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,340

367
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,330
Forget it. I'm sure he'll manage.

368
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,650
Hye Sun, drink this.

369
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,209
Okay.

370
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:02,950
What are you up to?

371
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,520
I was doing my History of Thought report.

372
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,969
I finished this,

373
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,350
but it was so hard to search all of the Chinese characters on an app.

374
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,550
Here. You don't need to suffer too.

375
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,590
Use mine for reference.

376
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,999
Wait, this one is wrong.

377
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,450
What?

378
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,250
This isn't the right character. It's not "faraway."

379
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,709
It's "far away from home."

380
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:42,330
It means a place that feels far away and unfamiliar.

381
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,499
Hye Sun, you're so smart.

382
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:47,940
You seem really sophisticated right now.

383
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,520
What?

384
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,630
I'm smart and sophisticated?

385
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,230
Yes.

386
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,220
Well, I get that a lot, so I'm used to it.

387
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,320
Then let's see if there are more mistakes.

388
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,009
All right. "Anti-imperialism."

389
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,469
They're all written in Chinese.

390
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,579
- Anti-feudal... 
 - Look at you.

391
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,729
Is this a campus drama or what?

392
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,109
You're so lovey-dovey. I'm so envious.

393
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,749
I heard rumors that you're going out for the project grade,

394
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,290
but you seem like a real couple right now.

395
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,870
Of course we're a real couple.

396
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,530
- Here, Hye Sun. 
 - So devoted.

397
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:34,280
Some might think you're her bodyguard, not her boyfriend.

398
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,450
What bodyguard?

399
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,690
 She told you to let go.

400
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,980
 If something like this happens again, call me.

401
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,189
 Why don't you have some too?

402
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,880
 I had enough already.

403
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,659
 If you don't like them, I can take some more.

404
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,569
 Do your legs hurt? Are you bored? Should we do something else?

405
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,280
 All right.

406
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,040
 Is there anything else you want?

407
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,609
A man shouldn't just act like a bodyguard.

408
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,509
When you're dating, there should be some push and pull.

409
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,619
- Jae Jin, are you listening? 
 - Let's go, Jae Jin.

410
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,060
Anyway, you're not a good match.

411
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,119
Hey, why don't you teach me

412
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,019
how to be a pushover in a relationship?

413
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,540
Should I leave my ego at home?

414
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,419
Hye Sun, are you okay?

415
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,840
He's the one who was hit. Why are you asking Hye Sun if she's okay?

416
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,200
Sorry about that, Sunbae.

417
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,440
Let's go.

418
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,819
You're just leaving like that?

419
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,770
Is beauty everything? Hey, are you okay?

420
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,089
Hye Sun, your next class is Modern History.

421
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,379
Then you have an hour-long break before Western Art History.

422
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,830
Okay.

423
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,850
Oh, and this.

424
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,479

425
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,889
What is this?

426
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,649
I know people don't use this anymore,

427
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,369
but since you're often confused

428
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,240
about your class schedule, I thought keeping this around would help.

429
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,370
- Do Jae Jin. 
 - Yes?

430
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,170
Don't be too nice to me.

431
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,879
What?

432
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,509
Stop being so desperate.

433
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,490
This is why the other guys call you a pushover and a bodyguard.

434
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,159
Well, I don't really care about that.

435
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,220
Still, stop acting like such a pushover.

436
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,480
This is why you're so hurt after it's over.

437
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,710
"After it's over?"

438
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,860
Oh, my stomach! Aigoo.

439
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,080
Why does my stomach hurt so much!

440
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,620
What's going on? Aigoo, this is bad.

441
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,310
- Are you okay, Miss Dam? 
 - Got you!

442
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,940
Don't even think about running away. I've got hostages.

443
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,000
Goodness.

444
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,090
What? He ran away again?

445
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,020
You've got to be kidding me!

446
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,130
Woo Yeo, are you okay?

447
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,209
Do you have bad teeth, by any chance?

448
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,009
Do you need dental implants?

449
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,249
Why can't you chew and swallow the food

450
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,330
that was already put in your mouth?
 (T/N: he should accept Dam's offer to take over the Bead)

451
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,229
You said Dam insisted on helping.

452
00:33:30,229 --> 00:33:32,690
That was her own decision.

453
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,359
That wasn't her decision, she was pushed by the circumstances.

454
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,999
So what? She's healthy.

455
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,849
Even if she does get sick,

456
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,869
she can just spit it out again.

457
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,830
I can't risk Dam's safety for something that isn't even certain.

458
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,749
If you want to be greedy, be greedy all the way.

459
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,419
You want to be with Dam,

460
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,269
but you don't want her to be hurt?

461
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,500
Then what about hurting her feelings?

462
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,809
If you end up disappearing,

463
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,390
do you think that won't hurt her?

464
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,570
What are you doing?

465
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,410
I'm giving you my energy so you can become human.

466
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,428
You said you don't have to share your Bead to absorb energy.

467
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,988
- This feels awful, so let go— 
 - Just shut it.

468
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,939
Just take my energy so you can stop staggering like a fool.

469
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,410
This is like the Valentine's Day chocolate

470
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,059
you give to your coworkers out of camraderie.

471
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,698

472
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,590

473
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,619
This is hard to take.

474
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,379
Do you think you can afford to be picky now?

475
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,488
You've got to take whatever's around.

476
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,249
But this is way beyond whatever.

477
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,920
Wow, you're so off-putting.

478
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,180
 Sir. If you keep running away, I'll really hide under your bed!

479
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,400
   Where are you? Can we talk for a minute?

480
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,520
Hye Sun.

481
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,320
What's up?

482
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,029
Do you remember the blind date tips I gave you?

483
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:29,230
What should you do if you can't get the guy by pulling him in?

484
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,339
I should be mean?

485
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,110
Good, you remember.

486
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,699
You should be mean to Shin Woo Yeo.

487
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,199
You guys decided to break up.

488
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,409
So tell him that's still valid and he shouldn't contact you again.

489
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,340
Why, all of a sudden...?

490
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,099
Is that really necessary?

491
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,659
Think about Woo Yeo's pattern of behavior.

492
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,379
When you drift away from him, he tries desperately to catch you.

493
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,070
But when you try to catch him, he runs away.

494
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,269
So if you really want to catch him,

495
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,430
let him go first.

496
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,059
I'm sure that if you even hint at leaving him,

497
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,800
it will drive him crazy.

498
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,320
Well, I'm not sure I want to take things that far.

499
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,450
The situation is not so great.

500
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,920
I can't tell you the details,

501
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,980
but one thing is for sure. Your attitude is not going to help.

502
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,349
I've known him for over 700 years.

503
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,270
So trust me.

504
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,020
He needs to be pushed.

505
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,200
To deal with a fox,

506
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,850
you have to become a fox yourself.

507
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,210
 Don't be too nice to me.

508
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,620
 This is why you get hurt when it's over.

509
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,950
Is that why she said that?

510
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,840
Because she likes someone else?

511
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,650
Hey, Jae Jin.

512
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,169
I feel like drinking today. Are you in?

513
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,369
I know you're busy hanging out with Hye Sun lately,

514
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,100
but just for today...

515
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,550
Actually, I could use some alcohol too.

516
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,050
What's with him?

517
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,779
Let's go grab a drink.

518
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,500
- Never mind, see you later. 
 - Dam.

519
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,819
Aren't you going to ask me what's going on?

520
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,700
Do I have to?

521
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,689
I'm not doing so great myself.

522
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,270
Why is that?

523
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,139
Did something happen with your boyfriend?

524
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,250
Don't ask.

525
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,810
I want you to ask me.

526
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,500
You're so annoying. What happened?

527
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,870
I...

528
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,090
have fallen for Hye Sun.

529
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,070
I knew it. You helpless romance addict.

530
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,580
Why's that a problem?

531
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,490
I think we need to break up.

532
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,390
It turns out

533
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,310
that Hye Sun likes someone else.

534
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,919
Really?

535
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,809
Since she took care of you

536
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,659
at the festival afterparty,

537
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,769
and with the way she looks at you,

538
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,669
I thought she had feelings for you.

539
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,370
No. I think Hye Sun

540
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,739
likes Professor Shin.

541
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,000
What? I don't think that's the case.

542
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,190
Why? Because Professor Shin is going out with Professor Seo?

543
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,770
No, that's not why.

544
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,689
Anyway, that's not right.

545
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,589
What do you know?

546
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,970
I know, you punk. Just drink.

547
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,170
You don't know anything.

548
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,059
- Gosh. 
  - One stir-fried cartilage and soju please.

549
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,859
 - Okay. 
 - It's so annoying.

550
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,399
 My ex keeps texting me.

551
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,289
Why, all of a sudden?

552
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,849
- You know my old friend, Yoon Hyeon Cheol. 
 - Gosh, it's bitter.

553
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:14,410
After I posted a photo of us, he's asking about our relationship nonstop.

554
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:19,110
He says that seeing me with another man made him realize how he feels about me.

555
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,750
- Goodness. 
 - Excuse me.

556
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,650
What are you doing?

557
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,229
That was so relatable.

558
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,110
It's like the universe has sent us the answer.

559
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,640
You don't want to break up with Hye Sun, do you?

560
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,069
Of course not. Why do you ask?

561
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,579
I just came up with a brilliant idea.

562
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,509
 I'm sure that if you even hint at leaving him,

563
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:48,010
 it will drive him crazy.

564
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,919
 To deal with a fox, you have to become a fox yourself.

565
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,700
From now on, I'll become a fox too.

566
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,080
A fox?

567
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,280

568
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,446
 I'll stop trying to convince you, Sir.

569
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:21,429
 I'm a bit tired.

570
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,330
 I just want to live an ordinary life now.

571
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,860

572
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,560
If I send a text like this that seems to signal the end...?

573
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,960

574
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,930
Got you.

575
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,460

576
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,190
And if I add that other strategy,

577
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,100
he will beg me not to leave.

578
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,989
I'd like one Iced Americano to go, please.

579
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,330
That will be 4,000 won.

580
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,240
Actually, could you make it two?

581
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,740
I can be nice to Jae Jin once in a while.

582
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,660
Oh, Do Jae...

583
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,610
He must have gotten it for me.

584
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,630
Here, a gift for you.

585
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,289
Thank you.

586
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,070
Do Jae Jin!

587
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,450
- Shall we? 
 - Okay.

588
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,150
Huh?

589
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,639
So you're saying that we should make Hye Sun jealous.

590
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,529
Yes. Who knows?

591
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,139
The jealousy might help her realize her feelings for you.

592
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,439
I'm not sure if she even has feelings for me.

593
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,950
I think she does.

594
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,650
You think so?

595
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,609
Anyway, thanks for the help.

596
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,490
You're helping me too.

597
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,470
Hey, she's looking. Come closer.

598
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,270
What's going on over there?

599
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,830
- Gosh! Get off me! 
 - Goodness.

600
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,719
Wow, that was hard. I'd better sanitize my hands.

601
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,130
Me too, me too! My hands just touched your body.

602
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,750
What if these cheap tricks just make me and Hye Sun grow apart?

603
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,530
Then just pretend that it was my idea and you'll sever our friendship.

604
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,699
I won't just be pretending, I really will sever our friendship.

605
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,389
If this goes wrong, I'll throw you onto the ground.

606
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,149
- "I will throw you." 
 - I will!

607
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,689
- No, you won't. 
 - Yes, I will.

608
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,790
- I mean it. 
 - See you later.

609
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,749

Smile.

614
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,440
What is with those two?

615
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,510
I've heard that there's no such thing as friendship between men and women.

616
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,630
Are they now blurring the line between love and friendship?

617
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,550
Unbelievable.

618
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,890
 Could they be acting that way

619
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,560
 because I told Dam to act like she's about to leave him?

620
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,160
Whatever. Why am I wasting my energy on that?

621
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,510
It doesn't bother me at all.

622
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,900
- I have it too. 
 - Really?

623
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,229
- Sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

624
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,570
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

625
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,890

626
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,440

627
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,110
- Dam. 
 - Yes?

628
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:38,330
Hye Sun isn't even around. Do we have to keep our arms linked?

629
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,020
Well, we could bump into her anywhere, anytime.

630
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,210
I feel like I'm playing games with her.

631
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,630
I feel so bad that I can't even look at her face.

632
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,240
Oh, no! Jae Jin!

633
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,210
Jae Jin! Are you okay?

634
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,330
Shin Woo Yeo?

635
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,969
Are you okay? What do we do?

636
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:15,200
Let me see. Is it bad?

637
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,939
I'm fine. Yea, I'm fine.

638
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,480
Stand up. Let's go to the hospital.

639
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,540
It's okay.

640
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,580
I can go with Dam.

641
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,649
- What? 
 - You have class soon.

642
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,890
You should go get ready for it.

643
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,619
Fine, then.

644
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,509
- I'm really okay. 
 - Let's go.

645
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,750
- Man, that hurts. 
 - Gosh.

646
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,130

647
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,480
Have you lost your mind?

648
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,990
It wasn't me.

649
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,209
Please.

650
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:21,210
Do you think I can't even tell whether he actually fell by accident?

651
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:26,030
You really have a long way to go before you can become human.

652
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,830

653
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,940
 Oh, no! Jae Jin!

654
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,770
- Hey, Dam. I'm done. 
 - Hey.

655
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,239
So what did the doctor say?

656
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,879
It's a stretched ligament. I just need a brace and some medicine.

657
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,870
I see. Let's go.

658
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,549
Your mom must be worried.

659
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,130
It's okay. When I did judo, this wouldn't even have counted as an injury.

660
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:14,390
- I should call a cab. 
 - Hye Sun said she's coming.

661
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,889
Hey, why did you call her?

662
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:19,770
I didn't. She insisted.

663
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,520
And I think Hye Sun does have feelings for you.

664
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,539
I saw her face when you fell.

665
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,740
- And she insisted on coming— 
 - I said no. She doesn't like me.

666
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,049
And I want to stop these mind games too.

667
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:39,930
If Hye Sun likes someone else, the right thing is to let her go.

668
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,620
If I hadn't chased after what I can't have, I wouldn't have been punished like this.

669
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,240
Jae Jin.

670
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,380
I think I have been too selfish.

671
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,469
So tell Hye Sun not to come.

672
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,669
But how can I stop her when she's insisting?

673
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,820
I don't want her to come. So keep her away.

674
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,180
- Behind you. 
 - What is it?

675
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,900
Hye Sun is behind you.

676
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,340
Hye Sun.

677
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,100
Hye Sun, wait—

678
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,360
Hye Sun, hold on.

679
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,320
Hye Sun, don't go.

680
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,639
 This is too hard to watch.

681
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,120
Hey, Dam. Could you carry me on your back?

682
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,670
Wait here. I'll bring her back.

683
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,849
Hye Sun! Hye Sun, wait.

684
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,660
Move.

685
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,470

686
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,709
Dam, open the door.

687
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,199
I won't. No, I can't.

688
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,359
Go and talk to Jae Jin. Please!

689
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,589
Please, please.

690
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,590
Forget it. It's not like this is the only exit.

691
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,360
Hye Sun, hold on.

692
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,710
Hye Sun.

693
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,720
You know you injured your leg, right?

694
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,540
Sorry.

695
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,000
For what? For hating me?

696
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,920
- That's not it— 
 - Forget it.

697
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,339
From the start, I should've known

698
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,280
that it was stupid to date someone over a grade.

699
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,120
Let's end things here.

700
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,029
Who do you think you are? You're not even going to try to hold onto me?

701
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,349
What?

702
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,239
I've seen guys who cry because they like me,

703
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,280
but I've really never had anyone cry because he hates me.

704
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,299
You said you weren't seeing me because of the grade, that you liked me.

705
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,149
Why did you lie to me?

706
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,170
I didn't. I do like you.

707
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,950
- What? 
 - I do like you.

708
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,360
I like you. I really do.

709
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,020
But...

710
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,330
I started to like you more and more, so it was really hard.

711
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,490
Leaving you is the right thing to do.

712
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,910
You like someone else.

713
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,450
What are you saying? I don't like anyone else.

714
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:30,670
- You don't? 
 - I don't.

715
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,040
- Really? 
 - Really.

716
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,680
Thank goodness.

717
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,800
I like you, Hye Sun.

718
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,320
- What? 
 - I like you!

719
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,720
I don't like you.

720
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,580
♫  Your face that I can see in the night sky  ♫

721
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:57,640
It worries me that you're too nice.

722
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,740
You make me too serious, and I hate that.

723
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,270
Do you still like me?

724
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:13,740
Yes, I do.

725
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,430
♫  when we first met  ♫

726
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,590
- Is your foot okay? 
 - It's fine.

727
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,930
♫  I'll always be there  ♫

728
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:31,590
♫  Please come back  ♫

729
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,980
♫  to me  ♫

730
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,981
   Forget my advice and you should just give up now.

731
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:40,891
 I never thought Woo Yeo would even hurt Jae Jin.

732
00:51:40,891 --> 00:51:44,140
I don't think he was the one who pushed him.

733
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,440
 You are bold. You could have hurt yourself.

734
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,899
 I decided I had no choice, even if I  hurt myself.

735
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,310
 I had to talk to you.

736
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,619
 Why do you have to harass him to this extent?

737
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,760
 Harrass him?

738
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,520
 I'm caring for him in my own way.

739
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,880
 Do you want to hear a secret that no one knows?

740
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,920
 The truth is, human energy is not what dyes the Bead blue.

741
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,520
 Human energy is only a way to appease hunger.

742
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,590
 Something else turns the Bead blue.

743
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,120
 What do you mean?

744
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,730
 Oh, no! Jae Jin!

745
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,770
 Try to guess

746
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:36,030
 what dyes the Bead blue.

747
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:40,370
 Those that are not human do not know what it is to be humane.

748
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,010
 I hoped that he would understand after experiencing it himself.

749
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:48,059
 I wanted him to learn what it is to feel desperate, hurt,

750
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,950
 and happy.

751
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,330
 Like Hye Sun did.

752
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,750
 I don't understand what you're saying.

753
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,590
 What dyes the Bead blue...

754
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,090
 is humanity.

755
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,930
 Humanity?

756
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:11,450
 Woo Yeo may think that the Bead finally responded

757
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,710
 for the first time in a thounsand years after he met you.

758
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:19,120
 But his Bead changed once before,

759
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:26,449
 when he faced the death of the first person he cared for and learned what sadness was.

760
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:30,870
 But he chose to close his heart after that,

761
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:34,390
 and missed the chance to make his dream come true.

762
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,100
 Then the moment he became curious about you,

763
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,530
 You can go back now.

764
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,630
 the moment he felt guilt toward you,

765
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,090
 and the moment

766
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:53,840
 you revived his desire to become human,

767
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,310
 the Bead responded.

768
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,040
 That is why I wanted to push him.

769
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,650
 To anger him. To frustrate him.

770
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,549
 I placed him in an unwanted situation,

771
00:55:09,549 --> 00:55:13,300
 where he did not need to pass on the Bead to absorb energy.

772
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,390
 In case they might be helpful.

773
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,390
 I have always felt for him, and I still do.

774
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,170
 Why didn't you tell him all of this?

775
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,840
 Because sharing the destination does not mean everyone will make it there.

776
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,370
 Then why are you telling me?

777
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:40,170
 Because you may be able to find the way.

778
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,240
 Do you want a hint?

779
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,130
 A hint?

780
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,870
 There are some whose jackets are blown off in harsh winds,

781
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,570
 while others only remove their jackets when they feel the warm sunlight.

782
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,870
 Which type do you think Woo Yeo is?

783
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:06,600
 What do you...

784
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:12,480
What? Where did he go?

785
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,970
How can he disappear after saying only that?

786
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:21,740
Well, I just need to get his jacket off, either way.

787
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,140
Miss Dam?

788
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,230
What brings you here in the middle of the night?

789
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,820
I'm moving in for the time being.

790
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,150
Let's live together again.

791
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:22,940

792
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:36,230
I'm going to make you human, Sir.

802
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,269
 Let me think of a way to make him human quickly,

803
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,409
 so this happiness can last a long time.

804
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:31,029
 If you haven't had lunch, do you want to join us?

805
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,349
 I can't.

806
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:35,209
 Mr. Do Jin Jae. Isn't the use of Chinese characters a given?

807
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:38,509
 I just don't like how formal he is and how he lacks the human touch.

808
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:41,940
 I would have been much happier without him.

809
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,650
 - See you at home. 
 - What do you mean, see you at home?

810
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,390
 I thought I was not in danger any more, so...

811
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,620
 I think things are just about to get dangerous.
