1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:09,440

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,949

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,790

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,300

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,970

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,820

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,639
Do you think you can take it out?

8
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,619
I will try.

9
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,970
A human cannot carry the Bead for long anyway.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,399
How long can a human hold it then?

11
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,979
A year, at most.

12
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,209
So that means after one year of carrying it,

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,700
it will be resolved one way or the other.

14
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,190
Doesn't it?

15
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,950
Then what happens if it's not taken out in time?

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,030
You will die.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,120
What?

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,840
Miss Dam,

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,560
you will die.

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,050
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,509
Why are you only telling me this now?

22
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,620
What do you mean, I'm going to die?

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,610
Wait.

24
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,249
You don't have to worry.

25
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:45,810
I just wanted to share the worst that could happen.

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,928
We still have a year of time,

27
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:50,550
so I'll try to find a way.

28
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,050
You should get some rest.

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,490
Good night.

30
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,719
Look how relaxed he is about this.

31
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,110
Is it because it's not his life?

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,840
Anyway, why didn't he say he was going to teleport? So startling.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,290
Whoa.

34
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,880
What are you doing out there?

35
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,330
I got depressed, so I came out to get some air.

36
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,349
Oh, I see.

37
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,880
You must be busy trying to meet your deadline, Mr. Gumiho.

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,080
There's a deadline on your manuscript and on my life.

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,339
- Miss Dam— 
 - I didn't even hit you that hard.

40
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,999
How could it pop right out?

41
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,900
Don't you have any muscles? Do you ever work out?

42
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,489
Miss Dam, what are you doing down there?

43
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,070
This sausage fell.

44
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,959
Why are you suddenly—?

45
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,400
I got hungry after taking a walk.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,549
You're probably wondering why I would want a snack now,

47
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,500
but I may have less than 365 days to enjoy late-night snacks.

48
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm going to start stir-frying now to leave no regrets.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
So.

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,050
Have you thought about

51
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,100
how you can take the Bead out?

52
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,179
Oh, that...

53
00:03:55,179 --> 00:04:00,060
I hope! You think! Of something! Very soon!

54
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,620

55
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,700
Will I get to see these fall colors next year?

56
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,940
 I hated you, campus lovebirds,

57
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,080
 but I'll miss you a lot.

58
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,239
 Jae Jin, my friend. I'll miss you, not!

59
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:03,210
 It's all your fault. You deserve a good beating!

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,260
What's this, are you crying?

61
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,820
Jin Ah...

62
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,239
got a new boyfriend.

63
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:14,650
We just broke up after she cheated on me, but she already...

64
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,559
Be quiet.

65
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,810
That's the end of your relationship, but I'm facing the end of my life.

66
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,220
Your girlfriend abandoned you, but fate has abandoned me!

67
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,669
I have no idea what you're talking about, but that sounds really sad.

68
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,289
My heart aches.

69
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,570
This is all your fault!

70
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,160
Fried chicken was Jin Ah's favorite.

71
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,610
Fried chicken is also my favorite.

72
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,379
Will I be able to see this again next year?

73
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,030
Of course. It's not like chickens will go extinct.

74
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,449
What is this sudden turn of events?

75
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,489
I'll leave if I must, but I won't leave with a piece of regret.

76
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:10,850
So I'll eat every single piece I can.

77
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,090
Excuse me! Another order of seasoned chicken and one more draft beer, please!

78
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,669
Dam, thanks.

79
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:38,309
Thanks for getting hammered with me.

80
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:41,640
Everyone else ignored me when I reached out.

81
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,150
Hey, Jae Jin.

82
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,020
Yes?

83
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,170
You need to learn how to deal with the feelings

84
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,390
after you break up with someone.

85
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,599
What will you do without me?

86
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,190
Why wouldn't you be there?

87
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,730
And as for women...

88
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,140
don't get so obsessed with them.

89
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,860
Be good to yourself.

90
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,580
You're a pretty great guy.

91
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,170
Really? I'm a pretty great guy?

92
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,379
- Say that one more time. 
 - Whatever.

93
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,220
- Just one more time. 
 - Whatever, you idiot. Get lost.

94
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,590
Get out of my life.

95
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,290
Bye.

96
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,410
That pathetic, yet annoying jerk.

97
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,100
I feel sick.

98
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,180
Did I have too many drinks?

99
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,970
Bead!

100
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,640
The Bead popped out!

101
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,870
 Mr. Gumiho!

102
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,370
 Hey, Mr. Gumiho!

103
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,300
Mr. Gumiho!

104
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,720
Hey, Mr. Gumiho! This is awesome!

105
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,608
I fell down after hitting my chest a few times,

106
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:37,489
then the Bead popped out from the impact.

107
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:38,960
What?

108
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,010
Look. I'm not going to die anymore.

109
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,820
This is...

110
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,290
This isn't the Bead. I think it's a candy someone spat out.

111
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,420
What?

112
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,720
 Bead!

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,210
 The Bead popped out!

114
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,370
 Hey kid, you're going to get sick.

115
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,300
Darn it. I thought I had saved myself.

116
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,999
Hey, Miss Dam.

117
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:49,010
At this hour, it's very dangerous for you to walk around in this drunken state...

118
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,620
Are you all right, Miss Dam?

119
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,960
 What is she looking at?

120
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,380
 That's

121
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,720
 the celadon made by the master who made one of the national treasures.

122
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,140
What? Where did they go?

123
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,020
What's going on?

124
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,660
What?

125
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,750
Let's see.

126
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,660
Am I seeing things? I must've had too much to drink.

127
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,940
I can't believe I'm using my powers for this.

128
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,860
That was startling.

129
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,990
Miss Dam?

130
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,250
Miss Dam?

131
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,930
Mom... Mom.

132
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,200
Mom, what am I going to do now?

133
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,360
Mom, what am I going to do?

134
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,280
Excuse me, Mr. Gumiho.

135
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,450
- Did you get a good sleep? 
 - Yes.

136
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,669
I'm sorry about yesterday.

137
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:29,509
I'm not the type who gets drunk and makes a scene...

138
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,160
Miss Dam, may I have a word with you?

139
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,660
Sure.

140
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,039
What is this?

141
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,879
I wrote up an agreement.

142
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,470
There are a few things I need you to keep in your mind.

143
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,450
 Shin Woo Yeo, Party A from hereon.

144
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,669
 Lee Dam, Party B from hereon.

145
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:09,269
Party B is obligated to keep Party A's Bead safe for a year,

146
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:14,299
and comply with the clauses below to keep the Bead safe.

147
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:18,510
One, no contact with the opposite sex born in the Year of the Tiger.

148
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,359
Two, quit drinking to stay in good health.

149
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,950

150
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,010
Three, do not consume chickens.

151
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,249
Wait, what is this?

152
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:31,889
Nothing makes sense starting with clause one.

153
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:35,289
I can't get in contact with the opposite sex born in the Year of the Tiger,

154
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,730
but how would I know which year they were born in?

155
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,579
Doesn't this basically mean I cannot be in contact with any men?

156
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,649
- It does. 
 - What?

157
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,679
Then I can't kiss any guys and do this or that with them?

158
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,009
This or that?

159
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:51,129
And I can't drink or eat chicken?

160
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,550
Then why would I want to live?

161
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,579
The Bead is very susceptible to your condition.

162
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,569
You haven't been living a healthy life due to excessive drinking.

163
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,399
So it'll be a good idea to quit drinking.

164
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,799
What about chicken? Why can't I eat chicken?

165
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,279
Tigers are the natural enemy of foxes, but chickens are fatal for gumihos.

166
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,320
From ancient times, chicken blood was used to ward off bad luck.

167
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,509
So you better not eat it.

168
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,369
No, I think I should.

169
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:18,870
I had chicken yesterday, and I was totally fine.

170
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,340
Are you sure?

171
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,779
Well, I felt a little sick, but it was tolerable.

172
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,790
That's just the first time. It can get more dangerous over time.

173
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,361
I mean, I could die in a year,

174
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:44,950
but I have to spend my remaining life feeling depressed?

175
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,460
Miss Dam.

176
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,970
I don't plan on letting you die.

177
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,669
So please trust me, and let's focus on the things we can do.

178
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:11,969
I'll look for ways to retrieve the Bead, and you can focus on keeping it safe.

179
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:15,780
I think that's the way for you to survive.

180
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,689
- Hey, Dam. 
 - What?

181
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,329
What happened at the club? Where did you suddenly go?

182
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:28,379
Oh, something suddenly came up.

183
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,459
You left without a word?

184
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,479
- Yes. 
 - What?

185
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,539
My phone died, so I couldn't contact you.

186
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:35,270
Sorry. Did I keep you guys from partying?

187
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,429
That's not the case. We had lots of fun partying.

188
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,499
I never get bored if I got some beats.

189
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,219
I got, got, got,

190
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,240
got, got, got, got...

191
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,640
That was loud.

192
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,370
Who the heck drives like that?

193
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,999
I think that's Seon Woo.

194
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,140
What? Gye Seon Woo? From the class of 2017?

195
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,699
- The playboy? 
 - Yes.

196
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,409
The legend of the history department who dated over twenty women, Seon Woo.

197
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:02,729
We're doing a group project together, so I know him.

198
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,909
He returned to school.

199
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:05,869
I'm jealous.

200
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,159
Let's go eat.

201
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,290
Hey, wait for me.

202
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,470

203
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,959
It's already on Everyday Time. 
  (T/N: Korean university community forum)

204
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,979
"I'm in class with Seon Woo. Lucky me!"

205
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,420
Look, there are three hundred comments.

206
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,770
Wow, look.

207
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,929
So what? He's a bad playboy who makes women cry a river.

208
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,589
Doesn't that sound better than you, the crybaby, that gets played on all the time?

209
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:54,779
No.

210
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:57,759
I think it's better that I cry than to make someone else cry.

211
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,379
I've been hurt a lot, but I love how I never hurt anyone else.

212
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,059
What? Have you been going to church?

213
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,559
It's what Dam said yesterday.

214
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,680
She said I should be good to myself because I'm a good guy.

215
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,189
Did you read a book written by Monk Bopjong? 
  (T/N: He was a Buddhist monk and writer in South Korea)

216
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:13,209
That's the alcohol talking.

217
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:15,329
Anyway, I finally realized this after hearing that.

218
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,789
Before I try so hard to get loved, I need to learn to love myself.

219
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:22,819
After I made that decision, I realized how loveable I am.

220
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:24,269
- You are? 
 - Yes.

221
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,809
I looked at myself in the mirror, and my face looked so good.

222
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:33,229
Then when I grabbed the bus strap, my biceps looked so hot.

223
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:37,129
Then I have a mid-low range voice, which makes me sound so sweet.

224
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,890
So lame, so stop talking before I shoot you.

225
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,659
I'm leaving. I have to go get some books.

226
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,109
Why? You aren't going to finish?

227
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:46,259
I'm full.

228
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,530
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

229
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,479
 Okay. In order to survive, I have to keep the Bead safe.

230
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,380
Excuse me.

231
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,120
 Isn't he Gye Seon Woo?

232
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,400
 The class of 2017, so he was born in the Year of the Tiger!

233
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,740
You dropped this.

234
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,450
I'm sorry, but could you just leave it on the floor?

235
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,780
- What? 
 - Just leave it on the floor.

236
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,550
Thank you.

237
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,260
What's with her?

238
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,700
 What? Cohabitation?

239
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,419
I get that the Bead just rolled into that woman,

240
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,850
but how did you of all people decide to live with a human woman?

241
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,549
Well, at first, I thought it seemed interesting,

242
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,190
so I wanted to keep her by my side, and...

243
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,740
And? What?

244
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,439
Forget it.

245
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,880
Why won't you finish your story?

246
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,829
Why? Is she your type?

247
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:40,949
Did you finally meet your ideal type who opened you up

248
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,600
after hundreds and hundreds of years?

249
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,639
Don't be so cheeky.

250
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:49,240
She's a human whose head is still wet from blood. 
  (T/N: Korean idiom similar to being wet behind the ears)

251
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,800
Wet from blood?

252
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,430
What did you do to make her bleed? Did you beat her?

253
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,059
It's a figure of speech.

254
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,739
It's used to express when someone is very young, a figure of speech used by humans.

255
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,360
I see. Is that so?

256
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,259
There are way too many things I have to remember as a human.

257
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,530
I have to memorize idioms and neologisms.

258
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:21,239
And to order a Croque Monsieur, I have to memorize English too.

259
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,720
That's French.

260
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,360
I can't believe how you managed to be annoying for seven hundred years.

261
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm sure it'll be very tough for that human woman who lives with you.

262
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,070
Anyway, does she know that she can die if the Bead keeps taking her energy?

263
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,570
I'm not going to let her die.

264
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,260
Okay. I'm glad you made that decision.

265
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,020
I hope you won't have to take the Bead from her dead body like back then.

266
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,460
Anyway, there's something I would like to ask.

267
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,870
 Danger! Danger!

268
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,720
- Dam! 
 - No, Sunbae, don't catch me! 
  (T/N: Sunbae - informal way to call a senior)

269
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,340
Are you okay?

270
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,779
Sunbae, you're in the class of 2017. Aren't you a Tiger?

271
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,589
I was born early, so I'm a Rabbit.

272
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,150
Early? You were born early in the year.

273
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,820
Sunbae, thank you so much for being born in the Year of the Rabbit.

274
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,640
I'm very glad that you're a Rabbit.

275
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,629
Did you come to school drunk again?

276
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,789
- No. 
 - Anyway, have you heard?

277
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,850
We're doing a general assembly.

278
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,759
I can't be there. I'm currently staying away from drinks—

279
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,559
- We're getting meat. 
 - I'm there.

280
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,629
I can go. I'll be there. I'm coming.

281
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,100
Okay. Go.

282
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,060
Yes!

283
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,300
♪  Meat! Meat is my vitamin   ♪

284
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,289
♪  Meat is my antidepressant   ♪

285
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,499
♪  Meat, meat, meat, meat   ♪

286
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,720
♪  Pork neck, pork belly   ♪

287
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,750
 Happiness isn't far away.

288
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,430
 It's freaking far away.

289
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,039
Hey, don't people usually refer to pork or beef as meat?

290
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,839
This is just chicken.

291
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,060
- Why? You're crazy for chicken. 
 - You are.

292
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,250
I am. So I'm about to go crazy.

293
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,440
- Jin Ah used to eat like that too. 
 - Cut it out.

294
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,769
 Just one bite. May I have just one bite?

295
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,970
 Just one piece of the wing would be fine, right?

296
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,700
 No, if I eat this, I might really die.

297
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,619
 Forget it. There's no reason to live, if I can't eat chicken.

298
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,219
 - I'll just eat it.  
 - Do you want to die?

299
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,339
 No, I don't. I won't eat it.

300
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,389
No, everyone is waiting for you.

301
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,050
Hey, enough. I'm here.

302
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,080
- Seon Woo. 
 - Hello, Seon Woo.

303
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,790
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

304
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,890
Hello, Seon Woo.

305
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,980
- Hey, Seon Woo. 
 - Over here!

306
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,039
-  Hello, Seon Woo. 
 - Hey!

307
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,109
- Why are you so late? 
 - Hey, Seon Woo.

308
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,159
- Have you been well? 
 - I thought you weren't coming.

309
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,769
- Hey, grab a drink. 
 - Grab a drink.

310
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,820
Here.

311
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,219
- A toast? 
 - Okay, let's make a toast.

312
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,020
- Okay. 
 - Cheers.

313
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,629
Hey, I can't do this. I'm leaving.

314
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,289
- Already? You haven't eaten. 
 - Hey.

315
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:35,040
Yes.

316
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,490
I have to leave. Could you take a step aside?

317
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,279
You're leaving? Let's grab a drink together.

318
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,340
Things are too loud over there.

319
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,249
Stay, Dam. You couldn't be here even if you wanted to in your fourth year.

320
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,449
You should sit just as our sunbae suggests.

321
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,370
Yes, we aren't that rude. Take a seat.

322
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,369
I'm sorry for the group project.

323
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,670
It's okay. Things can happen right after you get discharged.

324
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,609
- Are you Jae Jin's friends? 
 - Yes, Choi Soo Kyeong.

325
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,069
I'm pretty and the top of my class,

326
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,069
so people call me the Kim Tae Hee of Seogwa University.
 (T/N: South Korean actress who is famous for her looks)

327
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:25,300
That's your nickname? No one ever calls you—

328
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,890
- Aren't you going to drink? 
 - I have bad kidneys.

329
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,590
- Then some chicken— 
 - I love animals.

330
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,319
Lee Dam, are you insane? What's this crazy talk?

331
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,130
- Shut up. 
 - Lee Dam?

332
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,049
Your name is one syllable? Dam?

333
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,039
Yes, right.

334
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,739
Do you know my name?

335
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,940
You're Gye Seon Woo.

336
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,970
Let's be acquaintances from now on.

337
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,340
Let me pour you one, too.

338
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,969
 - What's with her? 
 - What's with this guy?

339
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,400
 - What's wrong with you? 
 - What's wrong with you?

340
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,460
I have to take this.

341
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,899
Hey, Eun Jung. Yes.

342
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,659
- My gosh. 
  - I can talk.

343
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,270
You have bad kidneys?

344
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,030
- What? 
 - You loved animals?

345
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,050
What? Oh, right.

346
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,499
I have to go. See you tomorrow.

347
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:40,500
Hey, go home after Seon Woo comes back!

348
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,180
Okay.

349
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,760
Are you okay?

350
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,410
Did she just roll over trying to avoid touching me?

351
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,410
What's wrong, Miss Dam?

352
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,520
What's wrong, you ask?

353
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,060
I fell over trying to avoid a guy born in the Year of the Tiger.

354
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,110
And I went to a chicken place for the general assembly,

355
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,290
but couldn't eat anything there.

356
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,460
I was the only one who ate the macaroni salad.

357
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,330
I see.

358
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,130
"I see"? That's all?

359
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,169
I had such a tough time today, yet you sound so indifferent.

360
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,019
I went through so much today, especially staying away from chicken.

361
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,989
You must know how it feels to turn down a fried chicken.

362
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,379
I don't.

363
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,839
You liar!

364
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,580
There was a crunchy and chewy chicken lying there in front of me,

365
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,070
yet I felt tortured because I couldn't even take a bite.

366
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,360
You really don't know what it's like?

367
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,280
I really don't.

368
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,170
Why don't you know?

369
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,470
Because I don't eat chicken.

370
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,350
Right.

371
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,180
Then change that into something you like and think of the same situation.

372
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,679
Yes, these cigarettes.

373
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,010
How do you think you'd feel if you suddenly had to stop smoking?

374
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,820
I'll just stop, then.

375
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,059
I doubt it. I heard it's really tough to quit smoking.

376
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:00,779
Some say you should never associate with those who quit smoking,

377
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,070
because they're the most persistent type.

378
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,830
I'm not sure.

379
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,940
That's for humans, who have a very weak will.

380
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,769
Smoking was just a means that helped me spend my tedious days.

381
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:18,030
I'm not exactly addicted, so I think I'll be fine.

382
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,670
Then quit smoking.

383
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,630
- What? 
 - Quit smoking.

384
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,909
You do know secondhand smoking is bad for me, right?

385
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,999
So please quit smoking for the sake of the Bead.

386
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:33,169
Now that we're on the subject, I want an agreement, too.

387
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:37,510
I'd like to make three requests just as you did, Mr. Gumiho.

388
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,360
What are these?

389
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,550
 Lee Dam, Party A from hereon.

390
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,469
 Shin Woo Yeo, Party B from hereon.

391
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,179
B is obligated to keep A and A's Bead safe,

392
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:06,619
and comply with the clauses below to keep A and A's Bead safe.

393
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:09,180

394
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,170
The first rule is already ridiculous.

395
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,499
What do you mean, "share the progress"?

396
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:16,049
Well, you've been only coming up with lame ideas.

397
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,779
This way, you will try harder so you have something to share with me.

398
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,690
All right.

399
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,390
Then what does the second one mean?

400
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,649
"No cold gaze"?

401
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:30,579
Let's be honest. A gumiho can look scary even when it smiles.

402
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:32,549
Whenever you give me a cold look, I feel a bit...

403
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:34,850
When did I look at you like that?

404
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,610
Just now. And also sometimes when you pass by.

405
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,470
Well,

406
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,790
we talked about the number three already, so could you sign it now?

407
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,609
It's going to be hard, right? Especially number three.

408
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:12,539
If you think you can't do it, we can make a deal.

409
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,669
For example, I can let you smoke

410
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,689
if you let me eat chicken every two weeks...

411
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:20,790

412
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,690

413
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,410

414
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,420
Do you have a minute?

415
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,240
I would like you to brief me about the progress.

416
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,279
Now?

417
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,349
As it's written on the agreement,

418
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:47,709
you must find a way to retrieve the Bead out and share the progress every Friday.

419
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,940
And today happens to be Friday.

420
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,950
So... did you find a lead?

421
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,090
Well, not yet.

422
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,729
But you don't need to worry.

423
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:03,740
As I said, I don't want to let you die.

424
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,120
I don't want a vague answer like that.

425
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,570
I want something solid.

426
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,820
Mr. Gumiho.

427
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,459
Where's the spirit you showed me when we first met?

428
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:21,529
You used to take the Bead seriously and had the guts to ask me to move in.

429
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:24,430
That's what impressed me.

430
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:29,009
Your dull attitude really disappoints me.

431
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,690
Let's call it a day.

432
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,869
Please don't be upset and keep my advice in mind.

433
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:48,339
We didn't gather in this house to make friends.

434
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:50,190
See you then.

435
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,300
Good morning.

436
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,690
Hi.

437
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,850
It looks like you're having a hard time quitting cigarettes.

438
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,160
No, I'm not.

439
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,860
By the way, Miss Dam,

440
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,510
have you heard of the idiom, "A tangerine becomes an orange"?

441
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,940
Tangerine? This?

442
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,660
A tangerine becomes an orange.

443
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,360
Just like that, the environment changes people.

444
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,920
Could you clean up the place

445
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,360
so you can keep your body and mind healthy?

446
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,999
I was going to clean it up when I'm finished eating.

447
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,459
This is not what I'm talking about.

448
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:31,519
Your socks are rolled up in the washing machine,

449
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,760
your hair is everywhere, and when you recycle...

450
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:41,290
Anyway, please be careful.

451
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,460
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,940
He sounded somewhat irritated. Or am I just imagining it?

453
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,160
It's tasty.

454
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,990
Hey, Jae Jin. Do you have my Korean History book?

455
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,450
I knew it. Do you want to die?

456
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,060
You should've given it back to me if you're finished reading it, you jerk.

457
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,939
Bring it when you come to school later.

458
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:24,220
If you forget it, I'll crush your head.

459
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,180
Okay.

460
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,340
This idiot must have lost his mind.

461
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,339
According to "Mingxin Baojian", 
  (T/N: The Mingxin baojian is an early Ming collection of aphorisms and sayings)

462
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,319
one's mouth and tongue are the doors to anger and worries,

463
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:40,330
and they are axes that kill one's body.

464
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:42,250

465
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,820
From now on, I want you to use only good words.

466
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,710
"Mingxin Baojian". I'll keep that in mind-xin.

467
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,980
I don't like puns.

468
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,260
"I don't like puns."

469
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,820
I don't think I was just imagining it.

470
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,290
He is being sensitive. It must be from quitting smoking.

471
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,510
I'm going to school.

472
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,140
Miss Dam.

473
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,730
According to "Sajasohak", one must be clean-cut and well-dressed. 
  (T/N: Text used to learn Chinese characters and basic ethics through practiced calligraphy)

474
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,300
It means you should be neat and dressed nicely.

475
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,370
But...

476
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:20,010

477
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,749
You're going to school,

478
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,110
and it looks like you didn't care about how you're dressed.

479
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,770

480
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,679
By any chance, does everything in this world irritate you?

481
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,979
- What? 
 - Because I think

482
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:40,790
you might be suffering from some withdrawal symptoms.

483
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,910
No way.

484
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,039
Be careful and get back safely.

485
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,950
I will. I'll see you late then.

486
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,770
He is having withdrawal symptoms.

487
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,889
It was easy for you to say when you told me to quit chicken and drinking.

488
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:02,010
Serves you right.

489
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,400

490
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,550
She even left the TV on.

491
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,849
 Last week, in the middle of the day, in the middle of the city,

492
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:26,129
 one woman has been murdered brutally.

493
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,869
 This is also known as "the Downtown Murder".

494
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,345
 Over two hundred thousand people pass this area daily.

495
00:39:32,345 --> 00:39:35,029
 There's no evidence found from any CCTVs and dash cams and

496
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:38,519
 there are no witnesses, which makes it hard to guess the culprit's whereabouts.

497
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:41,690
 This is the biggest hallmark of this incident.

498
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,430
Hi.

499
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,750
 He takes this class, too?

500
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,010
Hey, Dam.

501
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,270
Do you have some coins?

502
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,170
Could you get me a drink?

503
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,770
Okay.

504
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,040
Sure.

505
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,249
I owe you ₩800 ($0,71). I'll pay it back.

506
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,740
It's okay. You can just forget about it.

507
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,140
By the way, why do you keep avoiding me?

508
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,220
What? When?

509
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,619
Let's say you didn't then. Give me your phone.

510
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,340
Why?

511
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,999
Why do you think?

512
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:48,640
Why do you ask me?

513
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,340
Just to check the time.

514
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,960
Oh, time. It's three...

515
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,900
Here. Call me if you want to drink something.

516
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,240
 They say one's life lives up to one's name.

517
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,739
 "Seon" means kind and "Woo" means friend.

518
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:11,179
 My parents gave me this name because they wanted me to have

519
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:13,259
 kind friends and be a kind friend myself.

520
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:15,459
Hey, you are such a jerk.

521
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:18,169
Did you just say you're sick of me and our personalities don't match?

522
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:21,440
- You think I'm an idiot? 
 - Yes.

523
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,890
What?

524
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,930
No. Go on.

525
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:28,680
 But they seem to have given me the wrong name.

526
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,999
Excuse me. Can I have your phone number?

527
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,789
 I'm good looking.

528
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:36,749
My gosh. I didn't know you were going to such a prestigious school.

529
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:39,300
 I'm smart.

530
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,719
 Plus, I come from a rather wealthy family,

531
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:44,790
 so life seems too easy for me.

532
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,879
I had waited two years for you to come back from the army.

533
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:50,629
You just came back and you're saying you want to break up. Are you crazy?

534
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:52,199
Who is it this time?

535
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,819
Did you go to a club? Is it a freshman?

536
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:57,010
Tell me!

537
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,980
I've got to go.

538
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,849
 - That's  
 - Hey.

539
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,240
 the person I am.

540
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,490
I don't want to.

541
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,150
- What? 
 - Why did you take my phone without asking?

542
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,949
Are you yelling at me now?

543
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,780
Keep the ₩800.

544
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,670
 I'm Gye Seon Woo. Save my number.

545
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:36,250

546
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,730
Hi. Gosh, you scared me.

547
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,829
My phone.

548
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,490
I still have more than a year left until the contract is over.

549
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,930
Darn it.

550
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,829
Mr. Gumiho.

551
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:58,230
What are you doing here, Miss Dam?

552
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,700
I'm sorry. I'll leave now.

553
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,090
Please let me get out of here.

554
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,400
I can't.

555
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,080
Why not?

556
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,220
Because I'm locked up here, too.

557
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,590
What?

558
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,719
The doorknob broke,

559
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,650
so I was trying to fix it with the drill.

560
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,930
I even put the wooden block there

561
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,810
to stop the door from shutting.

562
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,810
Why did it fall out then...

563
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,350
Did I by any chance...

564
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,530
kick it when I came inside?

565
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,980
Yes.

566
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,010
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

567
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,979
Did you think I locked you up on purpose?

568
00:45:00,979 --> 00:45:03,889
What? No.

569
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:06,610
No way.

570
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,020
By the way, how do we get out of here?

571
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,400
I guess there's only one way.

572
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,560
Right.

573
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,170
What are you doing?

574
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,850
What?

575
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,329
I was going to ask you if I could use your phone.

576
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:43,940
To call a repairman.

577
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,710
I thought you were going to teleport us.

578
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,299
We can't teleport here.

579
00:45:49,299 --> 00:45:51,409
Why not? You did it just fine a few days ago.

580
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:53,429
Teleporting causes a wave,

581
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:55,589
which can affect the things around you.

582
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,399
And I have many important things here.

583
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,050
I see.

584
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,400
Right.

585
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,960
Here.

586
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,280
Hi, I'm the resident in 78-12, Samcheong-dong.

587
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,200
The doorknob in the basement broke again.

588
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,320
And I think the light will go off soon...

589
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,959
The light went off too.

590
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:22,909
Okay. Please repair this too.

591
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:24,500
Okay. Bye.

592
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,449
There must be something over there to light up this place.

593
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:32,120
Wait here.

594
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,030
Hold my hand.

595
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,150
I'm good.

596
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,460
Okay.

597
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,580
Is this a kerosene lamp?

598
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,709
What are all these?

599
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:31,120
Things that were naturally collected over time.

600
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,210
My gosh.

601
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,650
This is a bronze dagger, right?

602
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,040
Gosh, this must be a white porcelain from the Joseon Dynasty.

603
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,190
No way!

604
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,020
Is that Shin Yun Bok's painting? 
  (T/N: Shin Yun Bok was a Korean painter from the Joseon Dynasty)

605
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,699
How do you have that?

606
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,749
I once worked as a trader during the reign of Jeongjo. 
  (T/N: Jeongjo was the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty)

607
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:52,480
Gosh, that's amazing.

608
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,620
What's that?

609
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,360
It's a sketch.

610
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,839
I once worked for the science department.

611
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,059
You were a scientist? You were such an elite.

612
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:14,140
And what else have you done?

613
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,629
 During the reign of Seonjo, I fought against the Japanese,

614
00:48:22,629 --> 00:48:25,130
 leading the country to victory.

615
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,629
You were in the military too.

616
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:32,150
That's why there are swords and bows.

617
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,879
- Gosh. 
 - Miss Dam.

618
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:38,059
You seem to be very interested in history, unlike most young people.

619
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:40,509
Haven't I told you yet? I major in history.

620
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:42,779
Some kids applied for this major because of their grades,

621
00:48:42,779 --> 00:48:45,119
but in my case, it's because I love history.

622
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,910
I have always liked to watch historical dramas since I was little.

623
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,970
Gosh.

624
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,110
I want to be a museum curator after graduation.

625
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,820
But I'm not sure if I can live until then.

626
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,889
Anyway, this is really cool.

627
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:06,609
I have always wanted to travel back in time like in TV series

628
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:08,679
if I could.

629
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,800
I'm so envious that you got to live in so many eras.

630
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,400
How does it feel to live a long life?

631
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,520
Nothing.

632
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,300
It doesn't feel like anything.

633
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,360
Oh, there's a pipe too.

634
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,699
Have you used it yourself?

635
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:39,010
Yes.

636
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,150
Since when?

637
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,539
Since tobacco was imported in 1592.

638
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:45,210
1592?

639
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,000
When Japan invaded Korea?

640
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,149
Have you been smoking cigarettes for over four hundred years then?

641
00:49:50,149 --> 00:49:52,450
And I made you quit that?

642
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,259
Just keep on smoking.

643
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,540
What am I to stop your four hundred years standing habit?

644
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,659
Actually, I thought it would be easy.

645
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,910
I thought it shouldn't be too hard to change one habit.

646
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,069
But it turned out to be hard.

647
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:13,650
It made me realize that I might have made unreasonable demands.

648
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,169
So I want to keep myself from smoking during the contract period.

649
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,400
To share your pain.

650
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,660
I'm okay though.

651
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,700
So you have been smoking for four hundred years.

652
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,400
Then how old are you?

653
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,009
I'm 22. Born in 1999, the Year of the Rabbit.

654
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:34,360
I'm 999. Born in 1012, during the reign of Hyeonjong of Goryeo.

655
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,179
- Relax. 
 - I mean...

656
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,910
Now that I hear your actual age, I realize how ancient you are.

657
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,040
As a matter of fact, you've been scolding me so much

658
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,749
I felt like I was living with a great grandpa.

659
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:51,059
But if you think about it, you've lived longer than my great great grandpa.

660
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,940
Now I get why you have been speaking like a fossil...

661
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,700
Oh, it's a wind chime.

662
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,740
It's so pretty.

663
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,370
I have seen fish-shaped sails,

664
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,910
but I haven't seen a leaf-shaped one like this.

665
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,820
You can have it if you like it.

666
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,429
Are you sure?

667
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:20,009
It looks at least a few hundred years old.

668
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,700
I bought it in Insa-dong. At ₩7,000 ($6,23).

669
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,570
 Hello?

670
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:35,280
- Thank you. 
 - Bye.

671
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,130
Braised spicy chicken.

672
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,320
It looks so tasty.

673
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,719
I'm just looking at it.

674
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,709
You quit cigarettes, which you have been smoking for over four hundred years.

675
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,869
And I've been eating chicken for only twenty years.

676
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,370
I can hold it for one year.

677
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:16,330
♫   The drawing of our beginning   ♫

678
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:20,060
♫   When I close my eyes and feel you, I can draw you out   ♫

679
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:24,550
♫   Let’s start, baby   ♫

680
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:36,130
♫  At some point, I started thinking of you on a white canvas  ♫

681
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:40,480
♫  right here, follow your heart and draw  ♫

682
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,150
♫   The drawing of our beginning   ♫

683
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,620

684
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,420

685
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,590
♫  and lingers there  ♫

686
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,570
♫  Do you see that blue ocean,  ♫

687
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,660
♫  and those dark eyes of yours  ♫

688
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:02,260
♫  So beautiful, should I draw them here?  ♫

689
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,879
What's all this?

690
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,710
You can't eat your favorite food, chicken,

691
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,779
and I felt bad to put you through such pain.

692
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:12,169
So I made spicy stir-fried chicken using duck.

693
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,529
Wait. Can you eat duck?

694
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:17,770
No, I can't.

695
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,809
I can't have enough of it!

696
00:53:19,809 --> 00:53:22,050
Thanks for the food.

697
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,620
It looks tasty.

698
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:32,270
 Seriously? The flavor, seasoning, and texture are all horrible.

699
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,260
How does it taste?

700
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,099
Do you like it?

701
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:37,600
Yes.

702
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,340
It's tasty. It tastes really good.

703
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,950
- I made a lot of it. You can have it all. 
 - No, wait!

704
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,010
It's not tasty, right?

705
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,790
Well...

706
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,610
I'm sorry. I appreciate your kindness though.

707
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,759
I'll go get something to eat.

708
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,069
Don't. I'm okay.

709
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:08,999
I don't want you to starve because of me.

710
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,609
I'll be right back.

711
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:13,730
But I'm really okay.

712
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,599
Maybe I should have tried to eat it.

713
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,000
It would have made me more patient.

714
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,550
I'll tell him we're having only delivery foods from now on.

715
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,219
 Why aren't you answering?

716
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:36,700
 I'll pay you the ₩800 back. Let's meet.

717
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,940
Gosh. What's wrong with him?

718
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,410
Wait.

719
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:46,020
Is the reason why he's being so persistent...

720
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,400
because he hates to own someone?

721
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,869

722
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:55,320
 You can wire the money here.

723
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,990
This is a hundred percent poop.

724
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,480
Calm down. The toilet is near you.

725
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,570
What?

726
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,720
Why won't it flush?

727
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:56,490
Is it clogged?

728
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:09,520

729
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,570
 I'll give it to you in person. Let's meet.

730
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,400
 No.

731
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,680
 Why not?

732
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,270
 I'm really busy now.

733
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:26,729

734
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,940
 Why are you busy?

735
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,470
 I'm unclogging the toilet.

736
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:34,579

737
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:36,049
 Actually, do you know how to unclog it?

738
00:56:36,049 --> 00:56:38,550
 This is urgent.

739
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:49,659
 This is not about my image.

740
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:54,429
 This is about the privacy of my intestine and human dignity.

741
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,000
What did I put inside?

742
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,760
Maybe I should stop living.

743
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,310
No. Let's not give up hope.

744
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,650
Mr. Gumiho left thirty minutes ago

745
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:15,839

746
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,540
and it takes five minutes to the downtown,

747
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,020
so he should arrive in a minute.

748
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:21,319

749
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:25,970
So I will keep calm and flee the country.

750
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,599
This is ridiculous!

751
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:41,729
- Hey, Miss Dam. 
 - How long until you're home?

752
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:43,249
I'm almost there.

753
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,519
Already?

754
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,339
Right. I bought some pizza. Is that okay with you?

755
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,210
No, it's not.

756
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,289
I think greasy food like that can cause trouble

757
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:55,940
and diseases like obesity and esophagitis.

758
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,119
I should have asked you before buying it then.

759
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,909
Is there anything else you want to eat?

760
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,579
 What's the food he can't get near here?

761
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:04,279
 Something that takes a long time to get.

762
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,580
Yum woon sen. 
  (T/N: Thai Glass Noodle Salad)

763
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,440
Yum woon sen?

764
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,230
I'll see if I can find it.

765
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,100
Okay.

766
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,200
Yum woon sen?

767
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,170
Now, yum woon sen earned me some time, let's see what I can do.

768
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,970

769
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,120
 I found a how-to.

770
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,920
As you said, I wrapped the toilet.

771
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,411
Now, try flushing it.

772
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:43,315

773
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,409
Then the plastic will be bloated.

774
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:47,550
Press it hard.

775
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,349
It worked! It's unclogged, Seon Woo!

776
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:10,319
Thank you!

777
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,909
From now on, I'll call you the Toilet Fairy.

778
00:59:12,909 --> 00:59:14,129
You don't need to call me that.

779
00:59:14,129 --> 00:59:15,819
You don't have to give me the ₩800 back either.

780
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,029
This doesn't make up for it.

781
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:19,729
- Let's go out and eat. 
  - Sure.

782
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:21,620
It's on me. It's totally on me.

783
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,949
Thank you so much, Sunbaenim. 
  (T/N: Sunbaenim -  formal way to call a senior)

784
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,080
Thank you!

785
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,770
Thank goodness.

786
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,270
That was horrible.

787
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,000
She was actually unclogging a toilet.

788
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,929
Now, the pressure is off, both my mind and stomach.

789
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,240
Especially, my stomach.

790
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,800
It feels like my stomach is totally empty.

791
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,229
Oh, no.

792
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:05,260
Oh, I have a problem.

793
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,819
I think the Bead came out.

794
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,880
Could you see if the Bead is still there?

795
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,990
The Bead is fine.

796
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,109
Really? Ah!

797
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:19,910
Thank goodness.

798
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:21,729
- Did something happen? 
 - It's just that

799
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:24,729
I had a serious stomachache and pooped so hard

800
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:26,749
I felt like all my organs came out.

801
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,400
I was worried that the Bead also...

802
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,510
But it's fine.

803
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:37,880
Anyway, I'm glad the Bead is fine.

804
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,050
Hey.

805
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,759
Can I have a slice of pizza?

806
01:00:57,759 --> 01:00:59,349
Are you sure?

807
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,199
What about esophagitis and gastritis?

808
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,139
Actually, I gave it some thought.

809
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,029
You see, cars need oil to move.

810
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:07,969
I think humans need some oil too to move.

811
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:10,030
I love fat.

812
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,199
Sure. Help yourself.

813
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:15,750
Thank you.

814
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,680
It's so tasty.

815
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:28,659
I have one question.

816
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,500
For me? What is it?

817
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,269
Losing the Bead would be a good thing for you.

818
01:01:35,269 --> 01:01:38,020
Right. That's what I want.

819
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:43,639
Then why were you so relieved when I said the Bead was still there?

820
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:47,939
I do wish the Bead is gone, but I wish it happens safely.

821
01:01:47,939 --> 01:01:51,540
I don't want the Bead to go to the sewer.

822
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,899
I don't only care about my own life.

823
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,550
I care about the Bead and your dream, too.

824
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,730
What did you think of me, I'm not that selfish.

825
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,900
Why don't you have some too?

826
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,829
I don't appease my hunger with human food.

827
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:15,859
Human food is like some sort of snack I eat for pleasure from time to time.

828
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:18,209
Then why did you cook earlier?

829
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:19,529
I told you.

830
01:02:19,529 --> 01:02:23,500
I made it because I felt bad that I put you through the pain.

831
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,839
Then did you get these...

832
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:29,580
I got them for you.

833
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:34,440
Oh, I see.

834
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,150
This goes to plastic and this goes to plastic bags. Right?

835
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,240
Yes.

836
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,820
From now on, I'll make sure to recycle trash.

837
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,689
Right. Can we talk about how we address each other?

838
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:58,150
I don't feel comfortable calling you Mr. Gumiho all the time.

839
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,720
Since I call you by your name, you can call my name too.

840
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,329
No, I can't do that.

841
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:04,939
You're 977 years older than me.

842
01:03:04,939 --> 01:03:08,499
It's like I can't call the king of a country by his name.

843
01:03:08,499 --> 01:03:11,400
I think it's disrespectful.

844
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:14,480
How about Mr. Landlord?

845
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:19,830
Well, maybe it sounds like you would push me to pay rent.

846
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,260
How about Mr. Ancestor?

847
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:29,190
Well, I guess it sounds like you would take food from an ancestral rite.

848
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,280
How about "Sir"?

849
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,250
How about Oldmiho? It's short for Old Gumiho.

850
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,490
"Sir" sounds good to me.

851
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,509
It's "Sir" then.

852
01:03:42,509 --> 01:03:45,130
Let's get inside, Sir.

853
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,810
Sir.

854
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,370
"Sir"...

855
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,810
He's sweeter and more caring than I thought.

856
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,299
And...

857
01:04:19,299 --> 01:04:23,900
 How does it feel to live a long life?

858
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,550
 Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

859
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,360
He looks a bit lonely too.

860
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,830
Sir.

861
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,959
Why haven't you gone to bed yet?

862
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:25,580
Well, I was doing my assignment and I got sleepy, so I came out to get some fresh air.

863
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,640
It's hard, right?

864
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:44,430
You seem tired, so I was worried.

865
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:49,420
Until now, I have been thinking only about my situation,

866
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,929
but earlier when I visited the basement,

867
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:56,220
I realized how long you have been living.

868
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:01,410
For such a long time, you had one dream.

869
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,930
And it can all go down the drain, so I can only imagine how hard it must be.

870
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,490
I feel a bit bad too, because it feels like it's my fault.

871
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,130
Why would you feel bad?

872
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:18,520
Just because.

873
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:24,769
You know what? How about we try to live through this day?

874
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:29,290
If we repeat that, I believe good days will come in the end.

875
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:31,720
Let's tough it out together.

876
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,570
I'll go inside now.

877
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,460
Don't think too much.

878
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:33,810
 Anyway, there's something I would like to ask.

879
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:37,370
 Do you even want to become a human?

880
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:43,989
 To be honest, after what happened, I thought you gave up hope.

881
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:48,540
 Who is she to turn you like this?

882
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:53,040
 You already know how to take the Bead out.

883
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:03,210
- Miss Dam. 
 - Yes?

884
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:12,410
Let me check one thing.

885
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:39,030
You can go back now.

886
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:47,240
Just think all this was a dream.

887
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:13,360
I'll get going.

888
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:22,020

889
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:42,950
♫   Again tonight, I can’t sleep cuz I’m thinking of you. Oh every night  ♫

890
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:50,520
♫   What am I to you? I’m curious. Please tell me now  ♫

891
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,580
♫   Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper   ♫

892
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:58,930
♫   I’m seeping into you   ♫

893
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:05,530
♫   The longer I wait, they'll get deeper. Ask the moon  ♫

894
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:10,410
♫   Tell me now, how are you doing it?   ♫

895
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:13,480
♫   My nights are filled with you   ♫

896
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,400
♫   Stare me now, I wanna be your moon   ♫

897
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,669

~ Preview ~

898
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:22,820
 If I say I want to be your boyfriend, will you let me?

899
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,699
 What do you think he's up to?

900
01:11:24,699 --> 01:11:29,020
 I think even Gye Seon Woo can't get Lee Dam.

901
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,489
 You. Aren't you leaving?

902
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:31,759
 How can I help you?

903
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:33,549
 - Go on a date with me. 
 - A date?

904
01:11:33,549 --> 01:11:37,489
 It may be just a simulation, but I thought I should dress properly for a date.

905
01:11:37,489 --> 01:11:39,859
 He's enchanting me.

906
01:11:39,859 --> 01:11:41,399
 He's indeed a fox.

907
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:45,590
 Hold it in and date her.

908
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:49,390
 This might be the last chance you have.

909
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:54,690
♫   Again tonight, I can’t sleep cuz I’m thinking of you   ♫
