1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:09,960

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,029

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,810

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,450

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,420

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,350

7
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,210
Me too.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,200
Miss Dam, you are special to me too.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,520
♫  Again tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking of you  ♫

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,910
♫  Oh every night  ♫

11
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,010
Do you remember?

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,939
I said that everything feels like a passing season when you've lived for as long as I have.

13
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,430
♫  Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper  ♫

14
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,589
At first, you were like that too, Miss Dam.

15
00:01:17,589 --> 00:01:20,970
You were a passing shower.

16
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,710
But... I'm still standing in the rain.

17
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,710
♫  Tell me now, how are you doing it?  ♫

18
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,789
It's difficult to explain our relationship apart from the Bead and our contract.

19
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,490
♫  I wanna be your moon  ♫

20
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,850
But to me, you are...

21
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,540
♫  Though I know I’m still awkward and inexperienced  ♫

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,220
♫  Still, I’ll hold out my hand  ♫

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,780
special.

24
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,450
♫  That moon is the door to you  ♫

25
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,180
By that, you mean...

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,680
You're like family to me.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,939
Sorry?

28
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,269
I've never had a family,

29
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,480
but I think this is how it might feel to have one.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,780
Well, it would be weird to say you're like my daughter,

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,120
so it's more like a niece.

32
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,640
Are you going to school, Miss Dam?

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,920
Have a cup of coffee before you go.

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,770
It smells great and totally tastes like coffee from a cafe.

35
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,760
I almost gave you my credit card to pay for it, Uncle!

36
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,039
- Un— 
 - I gave this some thought,

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,069
and I think it would be better if I start calling you Uncle instead of Sir.

38
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,239
Since I'm like a niece to you.

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,799
- Miss Dam— 
 - And when you feel like it,

40
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,789
feel free to give me some pocket money too.

41
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:24,640
Since I'm like a niece to you.

42
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,820
Then I'll be going, Uncle.

43
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,380
Did I do something wrong again?

44
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,620
Let's look back on what you did, Woo Yeo.

45
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,380
His niece? Should I be grateful that I'm not his granddaughter?

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,750
How can he only see me that way when we live under the same roof?

47
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,859
 I ran out of toner. May I use yours?

48
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:59,999
 It's fine, but you want to use men's toner?

49
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,360
 Who cares? It's all the same.

50
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,410
 Soft and moist!

51
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,849
 I'm going to school!

52
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,910
 You're leaving like that again?

53
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,500
 Yes.

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,129
 Miss Dam, eating such a big late-night snack is bad for your—

55
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:27,619
 No way, food at 3:00 a.m. should be considered breakfast.

56
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,800
 Mom always says I should eat a hearty breakfast.

57
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,900
Or should I be grateful that he at least sees me as human?

58
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,940

59
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,170
Why are you picking at your food? Eat like a pig, like always.

60
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,390
I made something like a love confession,

61
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,620
but he said I'm like his niece.

62
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,299
That means I was kicked, right? 
  (T/N: rejected romantically)

63
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,530
You were. You were kicked out of the universe.

64
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,449
Even I've never been rejected that harshly before.

65
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,870
He must not see you as a woman at all to say you're like his—

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,250
I'll get going.

67
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,100
Dam, you should finish before you...

68
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,890
You idiot! Why would you say something like that?

69
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,289
I just felt bad for her.

70
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,060
Hey, if you feel so bad,

71
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,900
you should set her up on a blind date.

72
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,970
- A blind date? 
 - Do you know anyone?

73
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,020
 Dam, go on a blind date.

74
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,209
 Class of 2015. He's my sunbae from Judo Club, and a talent

75
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,190
 who got an internship with the super-competitive CDAY Group!

76
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,369
 I don't think so.

77
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:59,440
 Do you date with your thoughts?

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,610
 Then should I date without thinking?

79
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,570
Makes sense.

80
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,700

81
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,390
No blind dates. I don't want to.

82
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,630
Why not?

83
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,389
Is it because of that man?

84
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,110
It's not that.

85
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,389
Dam, you really need to get over him.

86
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,609
I've heard of people saying "let's be friends",

87
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:29,890
but I've never heard of anyone saying "let's be uncle and niece".

88
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,408
If he wanted to turn you down, why didn't he just say he's not interested?

89
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,899
What's with that cheap move?

90
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,839
He's not cheap.

91
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,250
- He's not interested in— 
 - What he's not interested in isn't dating,

92
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,570
it's you.

93
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,409
If he met someone he likes, he would never call her his niece.

94
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,189
I'm willing to treat him as my uncle. Why do you care?

95
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,930
I'm hanging up.

96
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,350
   Dam, I'm giving him your number.

97
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,630
 Say something.

98
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240

99
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,839
Why are you taking turns calling me?

100
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,779
Dam, is it that you don't want to date, or that you're not over him yet?

101
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,719
What do you mean, not over him?

102
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,579
What do you think? The guy that turned you down.

103
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,450
 You really can't give him up?

104
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,109
Well, it's...

105
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,619
The situation is a bit complicated.

106
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,240
What's complicated? You were turned down.

107
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,100
Then it's over. That means you date someone else.

108
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,809
- Do you need some privacy? 
 - No.

109
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,939
 And it's not like we're telling you to start dating him right away.

110
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,999
 You can just meet him and grab a bite together.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,589
Fine, I'll go on that blind date.

112
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,919
 Really? Okay then!

113
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,750
Fine.

114
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,440
Sir,

115
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,560
may I go on a blind date?

116
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,760
Oh, he wasn't born in the Year of the Tiger.

117
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,000
Then that should be fine.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,960
The contract doesn't say you cannot date.

119
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,960
You're right. It doesn't say that.

120
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,380
 I'll go on the blind date.

121
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,150
What are you doing?

122
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,189
You said you would treat me to everything tonight.

123
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,120
Is this bizarre behavior part of that "everything"?

124
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,710
Thanks.

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,950
No, it's not that.

126
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,930
We need to go on our second date for the project,

127
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,399
and I wanted to buy you a meal with the scrap metal money, ma'am...

128
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,819
No, I mean, Hye Sun.

129
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,320
Then why did you spray the cola?

130
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,559
Oh, I offered to set Dam up on a blind date, and she said yes.

131
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,079
Is that so shocking?

132
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,480
Yeah. I made the offer, but I never thought she'd agree.

133
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,539
She hates doing stuff like that.

134
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,320
Anyway, I hope it goes well since she decided to do it.

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,170
So that she won't get involved with bad guys anymore.

136
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,019
Right, Hye Sun. Could you give Dam a hand?

137
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,150
Give her a hand? With what?

138
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,289
Can you give her a few tips about how to avoid being awkward on a blind date?

139
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,780
She's never been on one before.

140
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,209
Why do you think I've been on a lot of them?

141
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,700
Because you're so pretty.

142
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,930
Don't pretty girls like you get offers for lots of blind dates?

143
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,949
Okay, then.

144
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,200
It's nothing difficult, so I'll help her out.

145
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,720
Thanks, Hye Sun.

146
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,370
Let's take off our shoes and step forward for Dam. 
  (T/N: idiom meaning "to go all out for someone")

147
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,110
I need to take off my shoes for this?

148
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,349
Since we're getting involved, we should do it right.

149
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,670
Okay, I guess.

150
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,100
But what does this have to do with her blind date?

151
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,579
- What? 
 - What?

152
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,180
What?

153
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,520
Why aren't you taking yours off?

154
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,310
What?

155
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,600
I'm heading out for a bit.

156
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,590
My friends set the blind date up for today, in case I change my mind.

157
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,490
I see.

158
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,570
Don't be too late.

159
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,610
There's lots of awful stuff on the news these days.

160
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,370
I don't know.

161
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,930
If things go well, I might come home late.

162
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,390
I have a feeling that he might be the one.

163
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,490
In any case, I'll get going, Uncle.

164
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,950
Hey, Dam.

165
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,190
Why is Hye Sun here?

166
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,049
Well, your date is at 7:00 p.m.,

167
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,809
but I called you out early so Hye Sun could give you a special lesson.

168
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:55,139
- A lesson? 
 - Yes.

169
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,510
Jae Jin asked me to give you some tips for your first blind date.

170
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,520
You didn't have to do that.

171
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,240
You almost bumped into him.

172
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,540
Thanks.

173
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,280
Where should we go?

174
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,740
 She's managing to hold on.

175
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,920
 A gumiho can only become human by absorbing human energy.

176
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,760
 We pass the Bead to people to get energy from them,

177
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,160
 then we must erase all their memories when we take it back.

178
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,449
 If we delay it for too long, all of their energy will be drained,

179
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,580
 and we can only retrieve the Bead from their corpses.

180
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,490
 Woo Yeo also made one mistake

181
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,000
 and he has kept his heart closed for a very long time.

182
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,480
 But he seems to have a special place in his heart for this child.

183
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,599
So sour!

184
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,679
 Is it because his Bead turned blue for the first time?

185
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,610
Why would you drink this?

186
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,380
 But the way he looked at her is too...

187
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,759
This is mine.

188
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,869
 He's about to reach his a thousand-year deadline for becoming human.

189
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:18,100
 What's his plan?

190
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,720
Hey,

191
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
I heard Seon Woo bet money over you.

192
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,770
Is that true?

193
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,720
Wow, everybody knows about it. Everybody.

194
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,970
So you're the type who attracts weirdos.

195
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,329
Then are you going on this blind date out of spite over him?

196
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:44,140
Or is it because of the guy who rejected you?

197
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,880
How did you know about all...

198
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,689

199
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,709

200
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,209

201
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,990

202
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,229
So you've never gone on blind dates or dated anyone.

203
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:08,010
That means you've probably never kissed anyone either.

204
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,110
- Then you're a— 
 - Hye Sun.

205
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,140
Let's change the subject.

206
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,370
Yes, I need to use the restroom.

207
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,610
Where are you going? I haven't even begun yet.

208
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,799
I'm someone who has to be thorough once I agree to help.

209
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Sit down.

210
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,720
Yes.

211
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,870
Okay.

212
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,910
Look right at me.

213
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,409
Do you know what's most important when you're hitting on someone?

214
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,230
It's your strategy.

215
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,459
You can either be obvious with your interest,

216
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,710
or you can be just plain mean.

217
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,369
But I'm really not looking to hit on—

218
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,939
First,

219
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,049
a smile is the best way

220
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,769
to express obvious interest.

221
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,330
Let's start with that. Give me a smile.

222
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,780
Well, if you suddenly tell me to smile...

223
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,779
What is this?

224
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,650
That smile was more mysterious than the Mona Lisa's.

225
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,390
Again.

226
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,350
Are you meeting a business client?

227
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,829
Forget it. You're not the type who has a pretty smile.

228
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,529
No, someone told me I look pretty when I—

229
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:30,130
Enough. You should just go with the mean girl strategy.

230
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,569
But there's something you need to know when you use it.

231
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:35,889
You can't just keep pushing them away.

232
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,140
You need to know when to push,

233
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,590
and when to pull them in.

234
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,370
You startled me.

235
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,110
Jae Jin, like we practiced.

236
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,890
Yes, right.

237
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,149
Now, let's say he's your blind date.

238
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,160
How will you answer when he asks you this?

239
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,279
Are you free tomorrow? Let's watch a movie.

240
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,440
I heard "Twilight" was re-released.

241
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,630
I'll see if I'm free.

242
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,309
You should be free at night, right?

243
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:06,809
I'll pick you up after class.

244
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:09,720
I have to eat after class.

245
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,250
Then we can eat first before we watch the movie.

246
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,559
 She's good.

247
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,629
 If she says okay right about now—

248
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,229
I'm sorry, but I'm turning you down right now.

249
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,120
And I prefer to watch movies alone.

250
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,699
- Jae Jin. 
 - Yes?

251
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,550
She's hopeless.

252
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,190
What?

253
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,339
The cafe street in Samcheong-dong at 7:00 p.m., right?

254
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,859
Yes, he said he'd meet where it's convenient for you.

255
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,509
But why Samcheong-dong?

256
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:45,929
What?

257
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,780
There are lots of great restaurants, and...

258
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,580
Anyway, bye. Thanks, Hye Sun.

259
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,540
Dam, you got this! You can start dating too!

260
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,400
Hey, you can do it too. You can date someone.

261
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,040
He's such an embarrassment.

262
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,849
It'll be so awkward. Why did I say yes to this?

263
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:19,719
No, birds of a feather flock together. 
  (T/N: expression, people who are alike tend to do things together)

264
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,909
Humans should date humans.

265
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,380
Let's make an effort with this human guy tonight!

266
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,600
Are you Miss Lee Dam?

267
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,030
I recognized you right away from your profile photo.

268
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,800
Hello, I'm Park Jae Hyun.

269
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,010
Yes, hello. I'm Lee Dam.

270
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,180
You must be pretty close to Jae Jin.

271
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,070
Jae Jin? I've only met him once.

272
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,999
But one day, he suddenly invited

273
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,009
all of the sunbaes from our club into a private chatroom.

274
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:06,399
He said he had a friend who likes men who are older

275
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:10,120
and stable, and that he needed to set her up with someone.

276
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,140
And he even invited a sunbae who graduated ten years ago

277
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,350
who's been married for three years.

278
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,770
- Why was he such a nuisance? 
 - Seriously.

279
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,610
I heard you got an internship with CDAY Group.

280
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,939
It's really hard to get in, right?

281
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,790
The process must've been tough.

282
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,719
Honestly, making a decision was more difficult than the process.

283
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:37,090
- Sorry? 
 - That wasn't my only option.

284
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,309
I got into Samsong, LD, SGEI,

285
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:41,019
and basically all of the big-name corporations

286
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,150
that you know. Isn't that awesome?

287
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,450
So I considered where I should go to use my potential to the fullest.

288
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,049
- That was the hardest part. 
 - I see.

289
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,509
It drove me crazy.

290
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,360
Right, you know what?

291
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,569
Every corporation is looking for a different type of candidate.

292
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,730
But I fit all of those types!

293
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,349
For example, CDAY Group loves people who are creative.

294
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,909
And I'm so creative. Let me show you.

295
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,239
I don't make a normal lettuce wrap with meat.

296
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,530
Sometimes I flip the lettuce over like this.

297
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,609
And salt? That's too ordinary.

298
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,970
I'm so creative, I dip it in cola.

299
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,130
Say, "Ah."

300
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,890
I'm fine.

301
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,209
They're like that. As for Samsong,

302
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,180
they really value teamwork.

303
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,650
And I happen to be crazy about teamwork.

304
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,339
The kinds of sports I love to play

305
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,760
are the ones like group jump rope or tug-of-war.

306
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,489
I'm practically my own co-op.

307
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,289
If we end up dating...

308
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,599
I'm sorry I jumped too far ahead.

309
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,140
But if we do, we can do a three-legged race.

310
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,069
 Why am I listening to this success story?

311
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,309
 It's as if I'm here on a blind date with Bill Gates.

312
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,810
I would do that for ten, twenty hours—

313
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,310
Hey, Dam.

314
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,020
Did you just yawn?

315
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,950
Not at all, you were so amazing that I was astonished.

316
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,390
Right? I was shocked!

317
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,570
And then SGEI.

318
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,710
 Miss Dam, may we have a word after your blind date?

319
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,350
 Why is it bad to say you're like my niece?

320
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,710
 Is your blind date ending soon...

321
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,970
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,000

323
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,180

324
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,470
Is this the cafe you often go to?

325
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,910
Yes, why don't you head in first?

326
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,399
I need to make a quick call.

327
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,830
All right, then.

328
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,990
I just read your message, but I don't understand what you meant.

329
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,300
Were you asking how my blind date is going?

330
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,460
No, that's not it.

331
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,589
Something has been bothering me a bit.

332
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,250
Bothering you?

333
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,879
Why? Do you think I'll make a mistake or something?

334
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:50,420
What?

335
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,049
I'm doing pretty well.

336
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:55,119
I even kept the conversation going as if this isn't my first time,

337
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,980
 and mixed in some compliments, so the mood is very positive.

338
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,419
Although I may look way too young to you, Uncle,

339
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,070
I'm actually pretty popular.

340
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,220
Things are going really well here.

341
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,620
 Then I'll be getting back to the great blind date.

342
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,420
 See you at home.

343
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,979
Hey, Dam. Over here.

344
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,350
Ah... okay.

345
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,320
I already ordered the coffee.

346
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,060
By the way, did you walk in late to avoid paying for the coffee?

347
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,000
No, I wouldn't do that.

348
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,420
Miss Dam, let me give you a piece of advice as a sunbae in life.

349
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,089
I just bought the pork belly, right?

350
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,550
- That means you're supposed to buy coffee. 
 - Ah.

351
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,510
And it's not about money.

352
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,569
I've been a pretty social guy, and I learned that this is good manners.

353
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,300
I really don't mind, though.

354
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,129
But please do be careful when you meet other people.

355
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:25,100
I'm sorry, I'll send you a coffee gift voucher—

356
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,860
One second.

357
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,920
It's CDAY Group. It's the manager. One minute.

358
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,570
Yes, Manager. Yes.

359
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,049
I was going to call you first.

360
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,659
Yes. Go ahead.

361
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,250
I love you, sir.

362
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,590
Why are you here?

363
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,490
I couldn't focus at home.

364
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,020
I should probably leave, right?

365
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,390
No, you don't have to go just because of me.

366
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,239
Then I'll pretend like I don't know you.

367
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,160
So don't mind me and have a good time.

368
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,340
Okay.

369
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,260
 Why did I say things are going well? He'll hear everything.

370
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,660
Dam, I have really great news.

371
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,869
What is it?

372
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,519
That was a manager who really liked me.

373
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,989
- Okay. 
 - He said I have the highest score

374
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,310
out of all the interns!

375
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,639
What this means is

376
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,110
that I have the highest chance of becoming a full employee!

377
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,930
This is awesome!

378
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,960
Congratulations.

379
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,070
Thanks a lot. I got too excited.

380
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,329
Come to think of it, you're now in your third year.

381
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,699
Shouldn't you start job hunting?

382
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,830
Yes, you're right.

383
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,169
I want to make use of my major and become a museum curator.

384
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,470
I believe studying abroad is basically a requirement for that.

385
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,699
Your family must be pretty comfortable.

386
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:11,129
No, we're just an ordinary family.

387
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:14,450
Then do you have a high GPA?
 (T/N: GPA = Grade Point Average)

388
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,090
May I ask what it is?

389
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,450
Well, it's okay.

390
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:25,330
Come on, what's your GPA? What is it?

391
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,490
- It's 3.5. 
 - 3.5?

392
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,110
What can you do with that?

393
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,990
What will you do? This is serious.

394
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,480
Miss Dam, let me give you a piece of advice as a sunbae in life.

395
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,959
I think you should stop wasting time on hopeless dreams

396
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,459
and choose something more realistic.

397
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,439
When should you dream?

398
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,299
When you sleep. Dream while you sleep.

399
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,419
Now I think you need to consider what you can do to find a job.

400
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,599
Well, thanks for the advice, but can you tell me this next time?

401
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,580
Next time?

402
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,770
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

403
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,350
There won't be a next time for us.

404
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,490
I don't plan to ask you out again.

405
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,950
What?

406
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:28,159
You sat there yawning while I shared all kinds of things about me.

407
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,559
Then you suddenly became nice when I said I might get a permanent job.

408
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,390
You even interlocked our fingers when we were high-fiving.

409
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,400
- No, you did that first— 
 - Anyway.

410
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,499
Let me give you one last piece of advice as a sunbae in life.

411
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,869
Instead of finding a guy who's stable,

412
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,520
you should try to become someone who's stable yourself.

413
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,299
I think you should be worrying about raising your GPA instead of dating.

414
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,959
Instead of shopping to add to your wardrobe, buy some books to add to your resume.

415
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:59,749
Instead of putting highlighter on your face, highlight some lines in your books.

416
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:01,820
Do you get what I'm saying?

417
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,610
Then please excuse me.

418
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,550
Right, please send two coffee gift vouchers today.

419
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,830
That didn't hurt at all.

420
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,320
Hey, Miss Dam.

421
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,140
Miss Dam?

422
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,530
Can you tell me now?

423
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,720
What? Tell you what?

424
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,450
Why were you offended when I said you're like a niece to me?

425
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,800
Please tell me.

426
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,180
Yes, that.

427
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,000
Miss Dam.

428
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,160
As you know,

429
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,680
I'm only trying my best to imitate what humans do,

430
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,650
so my word choice may not have been appropriate.

431
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,590
But what I wanted to tell you that day wasn't that you're like a niece.

432
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,510
I meant to say that you're special.

433
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,730
In nearly a thousand years, I've never accepted anyone as my family.

434
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,340
It took courage for me to tell you that.

435
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,600
Could you try to understand what I meant to say?

436
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,480
 If you continue to be so nice to me,

437
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,910
 I can't get over you.

438
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,830
Miss Dam, your expression...

439
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,260
Oh, I just remembered what that guy said to me.

440
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,089
He said it in an off-putting way, but it was all true.

441
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:34,350
I know that this is a really important time in my life.

442
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,530
I love history more than I care about finding a job, so I majored in history.

443
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,040
But people keep telling me to face the reality.

444
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,380
Miss Dam, there's something I need to show you.

445
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,770
Wait, this is...?

446
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,939
It looks closed, is it okay for us to be here?

447
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,190
Well, only if you'll keep it a secret.

448
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:20,380
In that case, this might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

449
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,640
Wow, white porcelains. So cute.

450
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,500
Have you ever actually used these, Sir?

451
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,880
Of course.

452
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,060
You're finally calling me "Sir" again.

453
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,810
Right.

454
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,350
♫  What can I do  ♫

455
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,210
♫  for you to look in my direction?  ♫

456
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,170
My gosh, this is so cool.

457
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,000
Look at that too.

458
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,940
Sir, what does this say?

459
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:08,250
♫   If only you would look at me and hold my heart  ♫

460
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:14,390
♫   Suddenly, I’m right in front of you  ♫

461
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,600
♫   One step closer, with all my courage. My heart is moving  ♫

462
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,370
♫   And your heart is also  ♫

463
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:28,190
♫   Slowly flowing towards me  ♫

464
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,840
♫  I’ve softly hidden this one truth  ♫

465
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,010
♫  Inside my heart  ♫

466
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,570
♫   I want to give that to you  ♫

467
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:46,120
♫   And embrace your heart that has returned   ♫

468
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,840
By the way, why do you like history so much?

469
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,670
I think it started with historical dramas.

470
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,599
My brother and I spent a lot of time alone at home,

471
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,890
so we watched a lot of TV.

472
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,539
I used to find museums boring,

473
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,449
but after learning about Admiral Yi Sun Sin,

474
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,880
seeing his faded War Diary touched my heart.

475
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,259
They say, "The more you know, the more you see."

476
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,540
But I also think the more you know, the more you get to like something.

477
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,330
Do you know when I first saw you smile?

478
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,390
 What are all these?

479
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,709
 And what else have you done?

480
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,659
 You were in the military too.

481
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,770
 How do you have that?

482
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,840
 Gosh, that's amazing.

483
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,790
It was that time in the basement.

484
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,860
I see.

485
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,580
Miss Dam.

486
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,850
There's one thing that I've learned from watching so many people over all these years.

487
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,260
When you like something a lot,

488
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,280
you'll be guided in that direction.

489
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,250
So I'm sure your wish will come true.

490
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,860
Before, that guy kept saying he's your sunbae in life.

491
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,680
Since I'm a true sunbae in life, don't you think I might be right?

492
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,820
So that's why you brought me here.

493
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,860
I don't want you to give up on what you like.

494
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,920
Is it really okay not to give up?

495
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,670
 Is someone there?

496
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,460
I'm glad we didn't get caught.

497
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,480
It would've been nice to look around some more.

498
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,940
- What a shame. 
 - It's okay, we saw enough.

499
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,170
  - How was the blind date? 
 - Tell us how it went.

500
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,020
My friends are asking about the blind date.

501
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,419
They actually put a lot of effort into it.

502
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,470
Jae Jin even brought Hye Sun.

503
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,559
What?

504
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,229
Hye Sun gave me a special lesson on flirting.

505
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,470
I'd better reply.

506
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,710
I see.

507
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,900

(T/N: 'Fox' misspelled, as 'Fox' and 'Pox' sound similar in Korean)

508
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,360
- What's up? You never call me. 
  - Where are you?

509
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,330
My room's terrace.

510
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:02,420
I love heights. Maybe it's because I've had a habit of watching over humans

511
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,580
from rooftops since my gumiho days.

512
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:10,410
You wouldn't know how beautiful Seoul looks from here at night.

513
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,280
I think I do.

514
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,420
Goodness!

515
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,839
You scared me.

516
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,869
You can't just show up like this without discussing it with me!

517
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,740
And why did you meet her without discussing it with me?

518
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,060
Are you talking about Lee Dam?

519
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,139
I couldn't find a good reason to turn down a friend I made in college.

520
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,060
Plus, it's not like you have

521
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,510
special feelings for her.

522
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,340
Let me ask you one thing.

523
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,260
Why are you suddenly doing all this?

524
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,469
You're almost at your 1,000th year, so I'm worried.

525
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:53,330
I don't think it's something you need to worry about.

526
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,240
That's upsetting, given our relationship.

527
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,170
Our relationship?

528
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,710
Our love-hate relationship.

529
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,170
We are the only ones in this world,

530
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,140
so I don't want to see you ruined.

531
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,960
I managed it somehow,

532
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,470
but you didn't handle it well.

533
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,060
Meeting someone special.

534
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,830

535
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,740
Hey, wait.

536
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,789
I won't touch you. I just want to talk.

537
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,460
If you don't want to say anything, just listen.

538
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,870
You have things left to say?

539
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,780
The rumors going around the department.

540
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,520
- I'll fix it somehow, so— 
 - Don't do anything.

541
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,460
I'll just be a laughingstock for a while.

542
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,829
Since you did apologize to me,

543
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,680
I can let it go, even if I can't understand it.

544
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,770
I'm saying that I don't want to be involved with you anymore.

545
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,790
I'm really sorry,

546
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,139
so please stop being mad at me.

547
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,070
I'm sorry,

548
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,730
but I haven't changed my mind.

549
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,380
I'm not that interested in getting to know you.

550
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,919
Dam, what are you doing in the smoking area?

551
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,390
You hate cigarette smoke.

552
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,360
Let's go.

553
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,419
He must have lost his mind.

554
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,910
How could he speak to you after what he did to you?

555
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,009
You should've made the blind date work.

556
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,079
Then I could've told him to back off

557
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,279
because you have a boyfriend now

558
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,419
to keep him away.

559
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,899
Hey, don't ever set anyone up on a blind date again! Okay?

560
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,569
Why? You didn't like him either?

561
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,499
What on earth happened with you two?

562
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,739
Forget it.

563
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,940
I shouldn't have tried

564
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,190
to meet someone when I'm feeling like this in the first place.

565
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,610
What do you mean, feeling like this?

566
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,790
Actually, I don't even know how I feel.

567
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,970
I'm not sure what it is to like someone, or if it's even okay to like someone.

568
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,400
 Wait. Maybe it's not that I'm not sure

569
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,370
 but that I'm not confident?

570
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,980
 A man with both looks and wealth

571
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,760
 and a college student who has no future.

572
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,380
 A dating expert and a dating novice.

573
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,650
 A mythical creature and a mere human.

574
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,299
What are you thinking about?

575
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,149
What is it? What's the problem?

576
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,210
I seem to have way more problems than I'd realized.

577
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,440

578
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,729
- Hey, mom. 
  - Dam.

579
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,199
 You said you're staying at a friend's house because of an exhibition.

580
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,379
 What's the address?

581
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,799
What? Why, all of a sudden?

582
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,290
 So I can send you some clothes we have left from the photo shoot.

583
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,820
It's okay. They're too experimental to wear anyway.

584
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,010
 Still, text me the address.

585
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,340
Okay. It's not like she'll visit all the way from the U.S.

586
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,770

587
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,750
Samcheong-dong...

588
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,950

589
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,830
- Thanks for the food, Jae Jin. 
 - Thank you, Soo Kyeong.

590
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,539
Jae Jin, thank you so much for the food.

591
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,609
- You ate six pieces! 
 - What?

592
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,929
Hey, Dan.

593
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,079
 Did you get Mom's call?

594
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,650
Yes. She asked for my address so she can send me a package.

595
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,869
What package? She's in Seoul now.

596
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,860
What?

597
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,169
Gosh.

598
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,669
What's so surprising about that?

599
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,869
Of course, I'm surprised. Why is Mom in Seoul?

600
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,229
She didn't say anything.

601
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,290
She's on her way to Hong Kong for a fashion show,

602
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,730
and she's laying over in Seoul because there was an issue with the flight.

603
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,510
But why would she keep this from you, then just ask for your address?

604
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,450
Is she planning to make a surprise visit?

605
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,700
Hey, I've got to go.

606
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,430
- I'm going! 
 - Hey, why?

607
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,800
Where are you going?

608
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,330
- We haven't paid, though. 
 - Hey, let's leave too.

609
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,850
You take it.

610
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,029
To Samcheong-dong, sir. Please hurry.

611
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,660

612
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,900
- Yes, Miss Dam. 
 - Sir, it's an emergency! Right now—

613
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,630
- For real? 
 - Miss Dam?

614
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,050
Miss Dam?

615
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,310
Who are you?

616
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,710
I'm Dam's mother.

617
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,110
Dam lives here, right?

618
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,730
I thought I might have come to the wrong place

619
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,830
because the house looked too fancy to be renting rooms to college students.

620
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,280
Are you the owner of the house, young man?

621
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,690
How do you know Dam?

622
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,660
Well...

623
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,650
 "A precious part of me is inside your daughter's abdomen."

624
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,860
 This could sound like she's pregnant.

625
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,850
 "I'm paying your daughter's tuition in exchange for her company."

626
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,190
 This sounds like we have an inappropriate relationship.

627
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,390
Gosh, why are you nervous?

628
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,970
Did I ask questions that are hard to answer?

629
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,919
 Mom! Mom!

630
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,380
Mom! You didn't say you were coming.

631
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,840
Let me explain.

632
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,220
So my original plan was to stay at my friend's place.

633
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,420
But it was so small that we decided on this house share— 
  (T/N: rental where the owner also lives in the unit)

634
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,740
Stop the fuss and sit down.

635
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,260
Okay.

636
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,380
So it's a house share.

637
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,030
So where's your friend?

638
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,360
- She'll be back soon... 
 - She recently moved out...

639
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,980
How long have you been living here?

640
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,420
- It's only been a week. 
 - About a month...

641
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,020
I think.

642
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,830
How did you meet each other?

643
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,940
- On the internet... 
 - A real estate agent...

644
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,270
 I'm doomed.

645
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,130
Erase her memories with your magic.

646
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,820
You told me not to use—

647
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,010
Come on. Do it.  Hurry!

648
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,250

649
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,209
 I've heard that magic doesn't work well

650
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,620
 on someone who is strong-willed, but...!

651
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,580
Dam, you know how much I hate lies.

652
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,560
Yes.

653
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,660
From now on, lying will only make this worse.

654
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,640
Are you living with him?

655
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:40,670
No, it's...

656
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,320
Let me explain it.

657
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,430
It is true that she's staying at my house.

658
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,630
But nothing's happened that you would worry about.

659
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,940
And nothing will.

660
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,700

661
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,610
I'm not worried.

662
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,480
Whether it was a week or a month, since you've lived with her, you should know

663
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,150
that my daughter has quite a personality.

664
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,200
I didn't plan to press you about living together either.

665
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,660
I just hate lies.

666
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,400
I'll be going now.

667
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,850
You're leaving?

668
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,350
Don't you sound too excited?

669
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,450
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you about it, Mom.

670
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,520
But really, it's not what you think.

671
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,350
I know you know how to take care of yourself, but I'll just say this one thing. Listen up.

672
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,710
Okay.

673
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,260
I approve.

674
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,550
What? The house?

675
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,750
The house?

676
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,990
You have good taste, just like your dad.

677
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:56,230
Seriously, it's not like that.

678
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,720
It's not?

679
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,270
Too bad.

680
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,780
Then I hope it becomes like that soon.

681
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,530
Good luck.

682
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,250
I'll go now.

683
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,320
Okay. Take care.

684
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,590
Call me when you arrive.

685
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:20,260
Bye-bye.

686
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,410
Maybe I should've gone with her to the airport.

687
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,460
- I'll drive you to the airport. 
 - What?

688
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,360
If we hurry, you'll have some time to see her off.

689
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,010
Mom!

690
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,110
Gosh.

691
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,650
Mom!

692
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,190
Hey, what are you doing here?

693
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,790
I asked him to come with me to see you off.

694
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,310
You said you had an important practice.

695
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,300
This is more important.

696
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,480
You should've told me you were only here for three hours.

697
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,970
I didn't know you were leaving so soon!

698
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:28,460
Hey, why do you look so... You do shower, right?

699
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,879
Of course! Noona's the one you should nag about that.

700
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,740
She won't wash her hair for three days!

701
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,380
That's to save shampoo. I care about the environment.

702
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,020
- It's not because you're a homeless bum? 
 - Do you want to die?

703
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,630
- What? 
 - You're the bum.

704
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,120
- Heh. 
 - You'll die.

705
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,840
- You never shower. 
 - I do.

706
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,260
I've got to go.

707
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,350
When are you coming back?

708
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,940
We just met and it's already goodbye. What is this?

709
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,220
We haven't seen each other in a year.

710
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,310
My Dam.

711
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,110
My Dan.

712
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,340
What's our family motto?

713
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,940
- "Handle your life yourself." 
 - "Handle your life yourself."

714
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,120
And you know it's only possible because I trust you, right?

715
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,450
Why are you saying that now?

716
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,550
I want to thank you for raising yourselves to be great people.

717
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:32,610
I don't feel comfortable thinking of you two living here on your own either.

718
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:38,470
But I've never felt anxious.

719
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,090
Because I trust you.

720
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,040
Mom.

721
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,789
Sir, it's been a hectic day, right?

722
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:15,280
Thank you so much. We were able to see her off,  thanks to you.

723
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,060
It's nothing.

724
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,050
You must be sad, though.

725
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,649
I feel a bit strange, but I guess that's what family is.

726
00:50:24,649 --> 00:50:26,439
We may fight all the time,

727
00:50:26,439 --> 00:50:29,219
but we support each other if anything happens.

728
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:32,560
That's probably why just thinking about them makes me feel safe.

729
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,320
So that's what family is.

730
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:47,180
You have me, Sir.

731
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:52,420
You said I was like your family.

732
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:57,520
So that's what I want to be for you.

733
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:05,249
Someone who supports you no matter what, and makes you feel safe.

734
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,550
Even if we take out the Bead.

735
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,270
 I managed it somehow,

736
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,900
 but you didn't handle it well.

737
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,130
 Meeting someone special.

738
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,110
 Intruders!

739
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,220
 Father!

740
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,429
 Father!

741
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,470
 Father.

742
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,300
 Are you all right?

743
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,520
 I thought it would be nothing.

744
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,010
 Insincere acts of kindness.

745
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,100
 Meaningless kisses.

746
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:04,030
 These were a routine part of my everyday life,

747
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,790
 so I didn't think it was any different.

748
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,530
 I could have saved her life

749
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,440
 if I had taken the Bead out

750
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,500
 and pretended nothing had happened.

751
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,950
 If I hadn't hesitated

752
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,840
 about removing the Bead and erasing all of her memories.

753
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,120
 If I hadn't been afraid of being forgotten by her.

754
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:45,610
 Just think of this as a bad dream.

755
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,290
 When you wake up,

756
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,340
 both your memories

757
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,970
 and pain will be gone.

758
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,990
 Do not cry.

759
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,540
 This is not your fault.

760
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,530
 I just wanted

761
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:15,730
 to be together with you.

762
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,400
 I hope

763
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,800
 your dream comes true

764
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:31,570
 and you can meet someone who will show you

765
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:36,370
 what being together is.

766
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,940
 Did you know all this time?

767
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,100
 Or if I had never given my heart to her in the first place...

768
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,930
 But when I felt regret, it was already...

769
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,590
 I might have just wanted to ignore

770
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:27,360
 how contradictory it was for me to have someone special.

771
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,750
 It was just a coincidence, and it could have ended there.

772
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,320
 That's how it should have been.

773
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,250
 She has her family, her life,

774
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,600
 and her relationships.

775
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:50,270
 Is it fair for me to keep her by my side?

776
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:57,170
 Just because she makes my life more interesting and less lonely?

777
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:04,240
 Just because I'm afraid I might disappoint her?

778
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,620
 Until when?

779
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:13,330
 Until something bad really does happen to her?

780
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:30,340
Sir, you're up early.

781
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,070
 Today is the day I should let her go.

782
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:07,020

783
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,230

784
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,460

~ Preview ~

785
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,270
 Why target those women, and not me?

786
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:53,009
 To be honest, the most dangerous place is beside you.

787
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,939
 Miss Dam, I promised I would protect you.

788
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,029
 And I always think about how I can keep my word.

789
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:01,569
 I heard that all men have a room in their hearts

790
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,469
 and they keep

791
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,969
 their first loves in that room for the rest of their lives.

792
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:08,809
 If the target is not you, but the women around you,

793
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,790
 who would be next?

794
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,129
 Sir!

795
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,590
 There you are.

796
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,480
♫  That moon is the door to you  ♫

797
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,890
♫  (your moon, your stars, you)  ♫
