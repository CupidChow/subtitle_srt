1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,960

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,090

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,900

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,370

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,370

6
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,620

7
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,719
It's quite rowdy today, isn't it, my lord?

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,409
The new scholars of Seonggyungwan are having a welcoming party tonight.

9
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,230
You're so funny, my lord.

10
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,340
They're so mischievous.

11
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,330
Right, I heard you also studied at Seonggyungwan.

12
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:51,149
Anyway, I'm afraid one of the drunk scholars might be bewitched by a gumiho. 
  (T/N: A mythical nine-tailed fox)

13
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,349
Haven't you heard the rumors?

14
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:58,859
They say a wicked monster who devours people's livers has appeared in the capital.

15
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,819
She bewitches people in an instant with her dazzling beauty,

16
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,180
but she's actually a fox who has been around for centuries.

17
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,550
If that rumor is true,

18
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,839
I should stop coming to this gisaeng house. 
  (T/N: Gisaeng were highly-trained artist women in ancient Korea who entertained men)

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,479
What? How come?

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,729
If you stop coming here, what do we have to live for?

21
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:29,440
But I thought the most beautiful women of Joseon were all gathered here.

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,339
I'm a coward, so I'm afraid one of you might try to eat my liver.

23
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,579
Goodness, my lord. Stop teasing us.

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,010
 You were born as a lowly beast, but you dreamed of becoming a human.

25
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,900
 What a foolish and pitiful thing you are.

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,010
 I take pity on you and will grant your wish.

27
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,140
My lord, should I blow out the candles?

28
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,690
Do as you like,

29
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,659
since all of this is nothing more than your dream.

30
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,269
Pardon? What do you mean?

31
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,229
You won't remember a thing once you wake up.

32
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,279
 Once you live a hundred years with good virtue, you'll grow one tail.

33
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:44,110
 If you cultivate yourself and live two hundred years, two tails.

34
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,670
 If you reach profound understanding and live three hundred years, three tails.

35
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,340
 And you will also create a Red Fox Bead.

36
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,579
 If you manage to dye that bead blue with human energy

37
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,550
 within a thousand years, before you grow more than nine tails,

38
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,450
 you, a beast, will become human.

39
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,550
Taking someone's liver?

40
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,770
How did such a heinous rumor begin?

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,170
 If you live long enough, you become indifferent to everything.

42
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,860
 The change of seasons,

43
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,908
 the meaningless time that must be spent feigning love...

44
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,189

45
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,790
 and even the emptiness that fills you from time to time,

46
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:02,060
 all you feel is the endless repetitiveness.

47
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,420
 How much longer must I spend living my life

48
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,110
 in this indifference?

49
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,780
You seem to be here alone, as always.

50
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,910

51
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,920

52
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,640
Writer Shin.

53
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,190
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

54
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,509
Our theme for this project is the history behind history.

55
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:34,969
I'd like to focus on the behind-the-scenes stories of our history.

56
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:38,780
Of course, there may be difficulty in providing historical evidence,

57
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,760
but I think it might be all right if we conduct thorough research.

58
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,908
For example, during the Joseon era, 
  (T/N: Joseon dynasty lasted from 1392 to 1910)

59
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:49,739
commoners couldn't report aristocrats no matter what injustice they suffered.

60
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,499
I heard they could only use the sinmungo 
  (T/N: A large drum hung outside the royal palace allowing commoners to air grievances directly to the king)

61
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,569
or run over and interrupt a king's procession to lodge a complaint.

62
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,790
That wasn't the case.

63
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,019
Anyone could file a lawsuit regardless of their social status.

64
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,709
There was also an appeal process and a system to avoid corruption in the courts.

65
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:11,070
While I was the governor of Pyeongan Province, I once took the case of a farmer...

66
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,350
Some might hear that and think you really did it yourself.

67
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,259
I knew it! Your works are so captivating

68
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,679
because you write like you've experienced everything yourself.

69
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,540
You're right.

70
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,850
Writer Shin, you're a perfect match for this project.

71
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,029
Don't you think so? No?

72
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,658
You're right. I agree.

73
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:45,090
Then let's keep the project going in this direction.

74
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,408
That's all for today.

75
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,209
- Great work. 
 - Sure.

76
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,430
Writer Shin. Writer Shin?

77
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,089
If you have some time, let's all eat dinner together and bond as a team.

78
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,080
Let's do it next time.

79
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,860
- I'll see you next time. 
 - Goodbye.

80
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,270
That darned "next time." Next time, next time.

81
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,570
So when exactly is this "next time"?

82
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,380
Wait, Writer Shin. Writer Shin!

83
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,870
You said you live in Samcheong-dong, right?

84
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,509
I'm actually going there now.

85
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,459
Could you give me a lift?

86
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,710
- I'm sorry. 
 - Wait!

87
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,779
I mean, do I make you that uncomfortable?

88
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,928
We have been working together for a while,

89
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,350
so I thought it would be great if we could get a little closer.

90
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,590
It doesn't seem like you have any close acquaintances, either, so...

91
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,890
I had a good friend, but I haven't heard from her since liberation─

92
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,420
Sorry? L-Liberation?

93
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,120
You and your jokes.

94
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,260
Wait! One second.

95
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,490
Just a second.

96
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,500
In that case, could you give me just one answer?

97
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,779
Why won't you let anyone get involved in your life?

98
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,420
You don't make friends or girlfriends.

99
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,710
Were you burned by a bad relationship?

100
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,390
Or is there someone you can't forget?

101
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,410
Your Highness, why do you shed a tear?

102
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,769
Because of the one who shows up whenever I am close to forgetting.

103
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,430
The one? Do you mean...

104
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,139
Fine dust.

105
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,889
Wow, my eyes really sting. The fine dust level is awful today.

106
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,399
No, what you're doing is what's really awful.

107
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,909
I mean, considering my elegant face

108
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,079
and my top-class intelligence, I should be the queen.

109
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,420
So why am I dressed as a palace maid?

110
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,870
- Hey. 
 - What?

111
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,279
I paid for the costume rentals.

112
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,299
I'm paying a hefty price for not bringing cash.

113
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,859
Stop it with the Queen cosplay, and let's go do our homework.

114
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,229
We're here to do research for our report on the Joseon palace.

115
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,299
- Let's not forget our mission. 
 - Of course.

116
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,249
Hey! Your time is up!

117
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,270
Already?

118
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,769
I paid 10,000 won for this.

119
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,520
The life of a queen is all too brief and futile.

120
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,150
Aren't you coming?

121
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,260
My maid, let us go together.

122
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,219
 What? Two-timed?

123
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,019
Hey, Jin Ah was two-timing you?

124
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,749
This is embarrassing, so please lower your voice.

125
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,970
I knew it.

126
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,299
Didn't I tell you time and time again that she isn't good for you?

127
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,390
But she really isn't someone who would do that.

128
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,600
So why?

129
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,189
Hey, why the heck are you crying?

130
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,699
Just think of this as an awful accident and get over her already!

131
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,170
I miss her so much.

132
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,600
Choi Jin Ah, you evil brat.

133
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,010
I hope you crap your pants.

134
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,759
I hope you drop your pouch, and your pearl eyeshadow totally shatters!

135
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,709
Hey, don't touch that phone while you curse her.

136
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,580
- No. 
 - Take it. He's going to call her.

137
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,290
Give it to me.

138
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,210
You'll thank me tomorrow.

139
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,700
♪ Come back ♪

140
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,509
♪ The place where you belong ♪

141
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,900
♪ Is right here, by my side ♪

142
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,429
♪ Come back ♪

143
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,189
Oh, the poor guy.

144
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,900
Such a softy, always giving his everything to girls.

145
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,580
Really, I'm afraid he'll give up all of his organs one day.

146
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,119
Damn! I have a phone English class with Ryan at 10:00 p.m.

147
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,269
We have to go.

148
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:24,559
No! I can't go.

149
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,460
I'm going to disinfect my broken heart with alcohol all night long.

150
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,899
That's bitter.

151
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,380
It hurts. It hurts right here.

152
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,180
It hurts.

153
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,780
- Gosh. Why... 
 - This isn't going to work. You should go.

154
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,980
He's completely wasted.

155
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,399
Can you handle it?

156
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,859
This isn't the first time. Don't worry about us and go.

157
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,920
The me who said that an hour ago

158
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,269
should be punished!

159
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,989
Darn it. Hey!

160
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,399
How can you drink so much that you can't even walk?

161
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,330
Where's your conscience, you jerk?

162
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,559
I'm not missing just my conscience, I've got no girlfriend either!

163
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,759
Hey, you need to walk. Try walking.

164
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,339
This isn't going to work. Prop yourself up.

165
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,990
Come on, please.

166
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,520
Should I just leave him here?

167
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,590
What? Did you sober up a little?

168
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,460
That crazy idiot. Hey, wait for me!

169
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,769
Jin Ah! I really loved you!

170
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:42,090
That son of a gun.

171
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,549
I'll kill you once I catch you.

172
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,800
Jin Ah!

173
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,480
Jin Ah, my Jin Ah.

174
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,880
Jin Ah, my Jin Ah.

175
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,680
By any chance, is this your car?

176
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,330
 Is he a human or a cardboard cutout? 
 (T/N: a life-sized cutout of a celebrity)

177
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,070
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

178
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,260
Jin Ah...

179
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,910
Have you gone insane? Get down here. Hey, get down!

180
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,890
Get down here.

181
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,929
- You lunatic! 
 - Let go.

182
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,429
Let go of what?

183
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,770
Your life? Your future?

184
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,609
Hey, please stop! You really can't do that. Please don't.

185
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:54,390
- Please, stop. 
 - Your friend must be drunk.

186
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,909
Yes, he drank a little too much.

187
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,929
I'll give you my phone number. We'll reimburse—

188
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,880
Are you a student?

189
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,660
Yes, I'm in college.

190
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,770
Forget it, then.

191
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,839
It's not badly damaged.

192
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,309
Still, my friend caused you harm. That's—

193
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,480
It's alright, you can go.

194
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,690
He's an angel.

195
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,300
- What? 
 - What?

196
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,329
No, nothing.

197
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:22,829
Then thank you so much. I'm so sorry.

198
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:24,079
What are you sorry for?

199
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,399
How much do I owe him anyway?

200
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,329
We won't have enough even if we sold off our organs, so shut your mouth.

201
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,259
We'll get going, then. Say you're sorry!

202
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:34,289
- I'm sorry. 
 - We're sorry.

203
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:37,279
Come here. Try to walk just this once. Please.

204
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,510
Hey, wait!

205
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,170
My head hurts.

206
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,370
When did I get home last night?

207
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,480
Let's drink some water first.

208
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,350
- You're up. 
 - Who are you?

209
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,320
Aren't you the owner of that red car?

210
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,939
I'm glad you remember.

211
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:59,500
Oh, and this is...

212
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,030
my home.

213
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,008
Why am I here?

214
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:08,119
You wouldn't wake up, so I had to bring you here.

215
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,240
And I have something to get back from you, too.

216
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,758
Something to get back from me?

217
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:15,399
You swallowed my Bead last night.

218
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,478
A very important Bead that I've carried for nearly a thousand years

219
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,750
in order to become human.

220
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,509
To become human? What do you mean?

221
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:31,210
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet.

222
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,490
I am a gumiho.

223
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,180
 He's a lunatic.

224
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,240
I see.

225
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,990
You don't believe me.

226
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,419
No, I do.

227
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,549
So you're a gumiho,

228
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,979
and I swallowed a Fox Bead last night.

229
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,619
Then what should I do? Should I go get my stomach pumped at the hospital?

230
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,030
It's not in your stomach.

231
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,080
It already placed itself in your body.

232
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,480
Then what should we do?

233
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,950
I'll have to start looking for a way.

234
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,400
Wait, where's my phone?

235
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,890
This means we're in the same boat now.

236
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,750
We have a shared goal, to remove that Bead.

237
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,099
So let's live together for now.

238
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,540
Sorry? Wait.

239
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,130
You want me to move in here with you?

240
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,129
I understand that you feel flustered.

241
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:40,679
But we're strangers, and that Bead is precious to me.

242
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,069
How can I be reassured unless I have you before me?

243
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:47,670
I can't believe this guy.

244
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,479
I was sorry my friend damaged your car

245
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,489
and grateful you didn't leave me on the street, so I was going to let you run with it.

246
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:56,109
But what? A gumiho? Live together?

247
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,049
Stop talking nonsense.

248
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,850
See? You don't believe me.

249
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,130
I guess it will be easier to understand once you see it for yourself.

250
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,570
Try not to pass out.

251
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,730
My head hurts.

252
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,410
When did I get home last night?

253
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,250
What kind of a dream...?

254
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,510
Did you sleep well?

255
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,520
You seemed very shocked earlier.

256
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,350
I'll bring you a cup of soothing tea.

257
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,290
Are you okay with white lotus tea?

258
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,540
I think he came after me.

259
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,620
Mom... Dan...

260
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,250
What am I going to do?

261
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,770
 Noona! Open the door! 
 (T/N: Noona - how a male calls an older sister)

262
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,150
Huh? It's Dan!

263
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,670
- Dan! 
  - Open the door already.

264
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,340
Dan!

265
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,620
- Dan— 
 - Move out of my way.

266
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,610
Why did you chain the door?

267
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,950
What's wrong?

268
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,750
Wait.

269
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,070
- Are you hungry? 
 - What?

270
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,240
No wonder you were running so fast.

271
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,269
- No, I— 
 - You ran at full speed so you could eat!

272
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,890
- No, that's not— 
 - You stayed out all night,

273
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,890
and couldn't even find time to eat?

274
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,540
- You're such a bother. 
 - No...

275
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,360
Hey, wait for me!

276
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,329
 What am I going to do? I think he's really a gumiho.

277
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,130
 What am I going to do now?

278
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,420
 I'd better not tell Dan, right?

279
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,240
 If I do, I might put him in danger, too!

280
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,400
Seriously! Why do you keep following me around?

281
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,740
Well,

282
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,239
I can't tell you why, but I'm too scared to be alone.

283
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:40,750
Noona, you frighten me even more. Go and take a seat.

284
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,800
My gosh!

285
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,320
What's with you today?

286
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,170
Dan.

287
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,419
The fact that you're an archer, that you're good at shooting arrows,

288
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,199
- might all be fate. 
 - What are you talking about?

289
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,939
I really didn't want to tell you,

290
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:15,920
but I can't find any other way.

291
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,260
I'm sorry, but can you help me?

292
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,120
What is it?

293
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,100
I met a gumiho.

294
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,220
- What? 
 - He hasn't done anything yet,

295
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,080
but he might come for me soon.

296
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,680
When he does, can you shoot him?

297
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,579
I've seen people shoot flaming arrows in historical dramas.

298
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:39,490
Can you do that—

299
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,580
No, not me. The gumiho.

300
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,599
Gumiho, my foot. Did you catch yourself in the mirror?

301
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,790
Get out of my room.

302
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,259
- Hear me— 
 - Three. Two!

303
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,370
Fine.

304
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,110

305
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,760
Figures. Who would believe that?

306
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,580
But why is that gumiho so quiet?

307
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,480
It's making me more anxious.

308
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,910
 The world is so peaceful,

309
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,890
 and yet I actually met a gumiho?

310
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,510
 Maybe it was just a nightmare.

311
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,919
 This stop is Terminal.

312
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,490
 Next stop is...

313
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,390
- I'm sorry. 
 - No problem.

314
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,060
 What is this?

315
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,580
 Do I have to take a dump?

316
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,130
 No, this isn't how that feels.

317
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,730
Hey, are you all right?

318
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,640
It's nothing.

319
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,349
Mr. Driver, one moment! Everyone, please make way!

320
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,290
This woman has to get to a restroom!

321
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,040
- No, wait. 
 - Please make way.

322
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,620
No, that's not what─

323
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,819
- Thank you, though. 
 - It's okay. Don't be flustered.

324
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:31,470
Thank you, thank you!

325
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,929
Hey, Dam. What's the matter?

326
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,940
I have a stomachache.

327
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,080
Wow, it's not period cramps or number two, but it hurts ten times worse.

328
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,819
Hey, then you should've gone to the hospital!

329
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,490
I came to report for attendance first.

330
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,510
Why does this hurt so much?

331
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,000
It's not like I ate anything special—

332
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,690
Lee Dam, have you been well?

333
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,940
I'm on leave.

334
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,410
Hey, Dam!

335
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,229
Dam, are you okay?

336
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,900
I wasn't actually choking her.

337
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,909
Hey, Dam. Hey, wake up.

338
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,320
Hey, Dam. Stay with me. Lee Dam!

339
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,580
Yes, this is he.

340
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,520
May I ask who's calling?

341
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,609
So this woman hit you on the back of your head with her purse?

342
00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:59,689
That's right.

343
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,419
Can she do that to an innocent citizen?

344
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,240
An innocent citizen?

345
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,149
You sexually harassed me, leering at me while telling me,

346
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,819
"You must have done it a lot, and what's more, you're so sexy you make me want to get it on with you."

347
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,410
But you've done nothing wrong?

348
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,739
When did I say that?

349
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,339
And do you have proof that I leered at you?

350
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,940
Were my eyes caught on the security cameras?

351
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,539
But you hitting me on the head was clearly recorded.

352
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,960
Don't you know that our legal system loves hard evidence?

353
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,739
What? Is that how our legal system is?

354
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,549
Yes, so you'd better be prepared.

355
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,600
No matter how much you beg, I'll never drop the charges!

356
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,370
You should be grabbing my pants and begging me to settle. 
  (T/N: go on her knees)

357
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,720
What are you doing?

358
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,420
You told me to grab your pants if I want to settle.

359
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,150
- Let go. 
 - This is unfair,

360
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,960
but I'm not familiar with this legal system yet, so I think it would be better to settle.

361
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,009
Let me go. What are you doing? Hey!

362
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,319
How much longer do I have to hold on for you to settle?

363
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,600
 Why don't you let go before we talk?

364
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,110
You're here.

365
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,860
Have you been well?

366
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,940
It's our first time since liberation, so it's been, what, seventy-five years?

367
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,590
Did you ever wonder how I was doing?

368
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,130
We've never checked on each other.

369
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,950
Why did you call me?

370
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,110
You always have that expression.

371
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,290
Erase their memories for me with your magic.

372
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,770
You can do that yourself.

373
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,560
I can't use magic anymore.

374
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,410
Why not?

375
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,510
You're right.

376
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,349
I became human four years ago.

377
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,759
Why are you leaving?

378
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,809
I want to treat you to a meal to thank you for helping me.

379
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:01,699
Humans always do that when they're grateful.

380
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,470
Forget it.

381
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,550
Oh, right.

382
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,239
A fox's hunger is satisfied

383
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,310
by human energy, not food.

384
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,070
Sadly, that's not something I can give.

385
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,990
So stay for a quick chat.

386
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:25,370
We've been friends for seven hundred years. We can't just leave like this.

387
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,129
I'd better stop eating.

388
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,349
I never gained weight when I was a gumiho.

389
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,230
Now my body fat balloons when I eat just a little too much.

390
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,449
That's not all.

391
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:56,339
When I was a gumiho, my skin was always flawless.

392
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,709
But now I have to take antioxidants

393
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,900
and use eye cream just to maintain my looks.

394
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:08,180
I'm sorry. You probably can't empathize.

395
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,499
If you've lived this long, you should've learned by now.

396
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,659
But you still cross the line, like always.

397
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,329
What? A line?

398
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:18,280
What line did I cross?

399
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,979
I don't mean that there's an actual line.

400
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:25,300
It's an idiom that humans often use.

401
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,939
Oh, really?

402
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:34,000
That idiom thing has been tough for me to grasp.

403
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,799
And you're still very dumb, as always.

404
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,619
It took you eighty years to learn the Thousand Character Classic. 
  (T/N: A poem used to teach Chinese characters to children since ancient times)

405
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:43,659
Fine, good for you that you studied at Seonggyungwan.

406
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:45,209
But you know what?

407
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:49,920
I became human before such a smart guy like you.

408
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,159
How have you not become human yet?

409
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,759
It looks like

410
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,670
you gave up on gathering human energy some time ago, too.

411
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,659
I hope you aren't still being picky?

412
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,720
The way you used to be.

413
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,559
 - You again? 
 - You again?

414
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,360
 "Once you fall for her, you lose everything, including your liver,"

415
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,400
 "then meet your demise after all of your energy is drained."

416
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,639
 The rumors are all over the capital.

417
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,589
 Rumors are unavoidable when you're this beautiful.

418
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:43,249
 You don't have to drain them to the brink of death every time.

419
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,319
 Mind your own business.

420
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,730
 You're so obvious about your displeasure. What will you do if the woman refuses you?

421
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,710
 Humans are such sensitive creatures.

422
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,250
 Then I can just hunt other prey.

423
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,249
 When my heart isn't moved, whichever one I take

424
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,850
 will only disgust me.

425
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,519
What's your plan?

426
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,220
What are you waiting for?

427
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,909
Say something.

428
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,859
I'm two hundred years younger than you, and I managed to turn into a human first.

429
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,089
Don't you have any questions?

430
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,329
How I became human,

431
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,349
if I changed while sleeping or eating,

432
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,639
how blue the Bead was,

433
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,759
whether it was a dark blue, a light blue, or a gradient!

434
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,019
You should beg me to tell you, on your knees

435
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,309
like this.

436
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,620
You're very boisterous. 
  (T/N: homonym for "Busan-like")

437
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,530
Busan-like?

438
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,969
Back in the days of Goryeo and Joseon, I lived in their capitals,

439
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,529
and now, I'm a citizen of Seoul.

440
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,780
I only live in capital cities.

441
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,089
You remember the hairpins and accessories I wore

442
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,130
always sold out at the marketplace.

443
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,720
Even now, in Seoul,

444
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,330
I haven't seen anyone as sophisticated as me.

445
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,090
Wait, was that an idiom as well?

446
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,120
Don't act like idioms are the only things you don't know.

447
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,789
You're diversely and broadly ignorant.

448
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,079
What?

449
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,020
Why don't we get going?

450
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,549
I'm expecting a visitor soon.

451
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,220
A visitor? Who?

452
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,000
So what does Busan-like mean?

453
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,940
So...

454
00:34:55,799 --> 00:35:00,099
I am sick because of that Bead, right?

455
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,920
To be precise,

456
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,980
it's because you touched a man born in the Year of the Tiger.

457
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,880
A man born in the Year of the Tiger?

458
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,920
Tigers prey on foxes, so we are vulnerable to their energy.

459
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,419
And it's worse for me,

460
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,520
who was born in a cursed year and became the only male gumiho.

461
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,119
 Men born in the Year of the Tiger are full of yang energy,

462
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,280
 so they're my worst enemies.

463
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,609
 And since you have my Bead,

464
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,960
 you feel pain when you meet a man born in that year.

465
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,769
Does that mean I'll be sick

466
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:37,840
until the Bead is removed?

467
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,960
- What are you do— 
 - Only my touch

468
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,690
can remove the pain.

469
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,860
That's ridiculous...

470
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,750
That's why I asked you to stay with me.

471
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,360
I thought you might need me, too.

472
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,300
Why do I have so many things to pack?

473
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,610
So you're preparing to enter an exhibition at your friend's place,

474
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,729
and you have to stay there?

475
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,690
Yeah. If we win a prize, it'll help us find jobs.

476
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,129
What exhibition?

477
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:10,250
It's about historical and cultural content...

478
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,890
Would you even understand if I told you?

479
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,620
I can look it up.

480
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,099
It's probably not officially posted yet.

481
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,890
I don't think.

482
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,359
Now, where's my sleep mask?

483
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,530
Did you tell Mom about it?

484
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,929
It should be morning in New York, why don't you call her?

485
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,570
Don't you know our family motto?

486
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,140

487
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,139
Mom's so busy. I can't bother her about every little thing.

488
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,810
Jeez, stop bothering me and get lost.

489
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,320
Stay out of a grown-up's business, kid.

490
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,380
Fine...

491
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,300
would've been my answer if it wasn't so suspicious!

492
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,220
No, it's not.

493
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,189
Your eyes. Why are you rolling your eyes like that?

494
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,259
Since when were you so serious about getting a job?

495
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,140
I mean, you're packing to leave in the middle of the night.

496
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,670
Wait.

497
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,209
You met a guy?

498
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,439
Are you moving in with him?

499
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,199
What are you saying? Where did you get

500
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,590
such a naughty idea?

501
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,780
Right. I guess it doesn't make sense.

502
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,470
Actually, I have total faith

503
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,060
in the tastes of my fellow men.

504
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,480
Stop messing with me.

505
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,790
I already feel bad about leaving you here alone.

506
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,270
Are you sure that you'll be okay?

507
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,020
Of course. I'm not a kid.

508
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,700
I'm barely at home anyway, because of practice.

509
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,069
I still feel bad,

510
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:27,560
thinking about you living in this empty house, alone.

511
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,420
But I want you to know

512
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,660
that you're one of the biggest reasons why I decided to do this.

513
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,379
Because I love you.

514
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,250
I'm leaving because I care about you.

515
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,890
You've lost your mind.

516
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,970
Get back to packing.

517
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,719
I said I'm okay.

518
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,260
I was going to work out anyway.

519
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,099
Good luck. Don't fight with your friend.

520
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,689
And go easy on the drinks.

521
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,549
Okay. I'll hang in there

522
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,360
and try to come back alive.

523
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,450
What do you mean, come back alive?

524
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,460
- From the battlefield of the job hunt. 
 - Idiot.

525
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,690
There's the cab.

526
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,499
Dan, make sure you call me every other day.

527
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,039
If I don't answer, call the police.

528
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,579
Police?

529
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,129
I mean, it will be just girls there, so I'm a little worried.

530
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,719
What's there to be worried about?

531
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,580
Your face will protect you.

532
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,559
Then buy something for self-defense.

533
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,900
- Self-defense? 
 - Yeah.

534
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,860
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

535
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,569
By any chance,

536
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:45,079
do you have any stun guns?

537
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,380
Of course.

538
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,790
120,000 won.

539
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,940
What? It's that expensive?

540
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,679
This should be enough, right?

541
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,300
Of course! You can overpower any normal person with this.

542
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,969
- But he's neither regular nor a person. 
 - Huh?

543
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,270
If you still feel insecure,

544
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,160
you can buy this, too.

545
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,589
With both, you'll be completely safe.

546
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,279
Sprayed on the face, it will burn for up to six hours.

547
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,150
It's 70,000 won.

548
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,710
Seven...

549
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,720
- I-I'll just take this. 
 - Sure, suit yourself.

550
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,519
Thank you.

551
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,509
 A cruelly mangled body found in the city center

552
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,939
 has shocked the world.

553
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:36,609
 The fact that the victim's torso was mutilated

554
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,539
 as if the organs were targeted,

555
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,009
 and the murderer's boldness in killing in the heart of the city

556
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,929
 has terrified the community.

557
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:45,979
Gosh. That's horrible.

558
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,320
- Was the criminal after the organs? 
 - Organs?

559
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,519
There must've been a reason for the mutilation,

560
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,540
like a heart or a liver.

561
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,100
A l-liver?

562
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,859
- I'll take this spray, too. 
 - Okay, thank you!

563
00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:01,080
That will be 70,000 won. Thank you.

564
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,160
That startled me.

565
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,320
Whoa.

566
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,150
What's with the creepy glare?

567
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:00,900
You were just in there. How can you be out here?

568
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,470
I teleported.

569
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,470
But why would you suddenly...?

570
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,800
I thought I would help you with the heavy luggage.

571
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,170
He's so kind that I almost fainted.

572
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,849
You can use that room.

573
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:34,650
Okay, thank you.

574
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,700
Oh, yeah.

575
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,010
We don't even know each other's names yet.

576
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,860
My name is Shin Woo Yeo.

577
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,710
My name is Lee Dam.

578
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:45,910
Lee Dam.

579
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,330
May I call you Miss Dam from now on?

580
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:52,160
Sure, whatever you like. Now, if you'll excuse me.

581
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,790
Why is this in my bag?

582
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,490

583
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,750
You also have a pepper spray that claims it'll burn for up to six hours

584
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,730
when sprayed on the face.

585
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,040
It's a gift for you.

586
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,290
Oh.

587
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,830
My mom said I shouldn't visit people's homes empty-handed.

588
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,940
I didn't have time to wrap it because I was in a rush,

589
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,530
but I hope you like it.

590
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,040
It's a gift.

591
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,470
A gift.

592
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,850
They were all taken.

593
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,490
Stay strong.

594
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,600
What's that noise?

595
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,710
Are you okay, Miss Dam?

596
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,170
Oh, this.

597
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,320
I trimmed the trees in the garden.

598
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,520
- Trimmed the trees? 
 - Yes.

599
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,780
It was time to prune them.

600
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,090
But why would you do that in the middle of the night?

601
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,770
Foxes are nocturnal.

602
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,310
 Is that liver?

603
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,050
It's seonji. 
  (T/N: coagulated ox blood)

604
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,800
What? Seonji?

605
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,520
It's one of my favorite foods.

606
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,250
The restaurant didn't package it properly.

607
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,690
I got blood on my hands earlier, too,

608
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,960
and had a hard time washing it off.

609
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,610
But, Miss Dam, you seem to get scared easily.

610
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,670
From now on, I'll finish it off while it's fresh

611
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,150
so I don't scare you.

612
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,960
There's so much blood.

613
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,570
 I suddenly had to move in with a gumiho.

614
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:47,330
 I'm scared and anxious.

615
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,320
 Will I ever get a peaceful night's sleep

616
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,410
 in this house?

617
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,520
 Aren't you going to school, Miss Dam?

618
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,390
 Miss Dam?

619
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:24,230
I'm not nocturnal like you. Who goes to school at night...

620
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:32,490
What? When did I fall asleep?

621
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,059
 Get a hold of yourself, Dam.

622
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,340
 That man is a gumiho who tricks humans.

623
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,590
 He's just a sly fox wearing the mask of a hottie.

624
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,740
Did you sleep well?

625
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,960
Yes, I guess.

626
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,669
You don't seem like you did, though.

627
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,190
Come have some warm goji berry tea.

628
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,580
Goji berries protect your liver and help with fatigue.

629
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,320
 What? Why does he care about my liver?

630
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,580
 What does he want to do with it?

631
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,490
 - That sly fox.  
 - Oh, yeah.

632
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:39,530
I don't know what you like yet, so I bought some random things.

633
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,250
 That sly fox.

634
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,000
I got some ice cream, too.

635
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,520
 That sly fox.

636
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,049
And I will take care of your tuition.

637
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,120
Generous fox!

638
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,680
Why would you? You don't need to do that.

639
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,810
I feel bad since you will be burdened

640
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,419
with many inconveniences.

641
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,820
Since you're a student, I thought

642
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,640
paying your tuition could help to make up for it.

643
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,530
It's okay, though.

644
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,850
Then should I text you my banking info?

645
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,930

646
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,990
This covers both, my tuition for next semester and Dan's lessons!

647
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,970
Are you happy?

648
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,230
How could you laugh in this situation?

649
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,790
 - Miss Dam.  
 - Yes?

650
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,110
Do you want to talk to me?

651
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,349
Are you going somewhere?

652
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,400
I'm attending a book event.

653
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,529
I write books on the humanities.

654
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:04,280
I see, so you have a job.

655
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,550
Even beasts of legend cannot escape capitalism.

656
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:11,040
- It's more that living a long life becomes tedious. 
 - Oh.

657
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,490
Anyway, I'm going to Singapore,

658
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,200
and will be away for a few days.

659
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,340
Okay.

660
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,880
Really?

661
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,820
You look so happy.

662
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,499
I must've made you very uncomfortable.

663
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,060
No, I wasn't. I'm not happy at all.

664
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,420
Then I'll be going.

665
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,180
What are you doing?

666
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,380
It's shapeshifting.

667
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,330
I heard reporters may come,

668
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,580
but I don't want to become publicly known.

669
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,780
So until I meet with the publishing company staff,

670
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,759
I thought I would travel like this.

671
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,580
I see. You are so multitalented.

672
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,440
Okay, then. I'm really leaving.

673
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,530
- Make sure to lock the door. 
 - Okay.

674
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,600
L-Let me.

675
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,080
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

676
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,770
 All right. Let's stop here.

677
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,480
Please submit your assignments by next week.

678
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,070
 - Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you.

679
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,730
Bye.

680
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,420
Hey, Dam!

681
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,070
You scared me.

682
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,189
Why do you look so down? Are you still sick?

683
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,610
No, I'm fine now.

684
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:33,560
That's great. Then you're going clubbing with us, right?

685
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,150
- Come on. 
 - Clubbing?

686
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,759
Remember, we're throwing a farewell party

687
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,379
for Ji Eun because she's leaving to go study abroad.

688
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,720
Oh, right.

689
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,690
I've been so busy these days that I forgot.

690
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,540
But I can't really be in crowded places right now.

691
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,530
I can't either. I have an English exam this weekend.

692
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,539
Still, we're no longer freshmen, living like there's no tomorrow.

693
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,389
We need to start worrying about

694
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,510
tomorrow's hangover and the coming of old age!

695
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,790
You're kidding.

696
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,869
And you're still wet behind your ears. 
  (T/N: lacking experience; immature)

697
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,449
- Just go. 
 - Just go.

698
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:04,079
- You have to. 
 - No matter what.

699
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,489
- Just go. 
 - Let's go.

700
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,349
- Let's go! 
 - Go, go, go!

701
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:11,350
Fine, fine! Are we going now?

702
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,080
Looking like that?

703
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,930
- You have no mercy. 
 - You have no conscience.

704
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:19,410
Okay. Let's go.

705
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,189
It's so crowded here.

706
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,590
Look at all the people.

707
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,050
 I'm so excited!

708
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:36,589
- Oh my God. What's this? 
 - What's this?

709
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,129
You look amazing!

710
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,350
Where do you get these just-released pieces?

711
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,529
Dam's mother is a fashion magazine editor in the U.S.

712
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,479
She sends Dam some clothes from the photoshoots.

713
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,849
That's why she used to be called

714
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,930
the fashionable

715
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,470
alcoholic.

716
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,919
I haven't worn heels in a while, my legs hurt.

717
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,329
Let's go sit inside.

718
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,009
- Sit? Sit where? 
 - You can't.

719
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,410
Don't even think about sitting tonight.

720
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,290
Let's go!

721
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,790
Is this a club or a subway during rush hour?

722
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,159
Hey, Dam! I'll go get some vodka.

723
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,350
Hey, wait up!

724
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,140
How old are you?

725
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,040
Do you know me?

726
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,149
Why are you touching me without asking?

727
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,600
Do you want to go to the police station with me?

728
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,530
I apologize.

729
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:41,009
- Here. 
 - Thank─

730
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,080
I like your style.

731
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,730
Why so serious? It was just a joke.

732
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,320
Do you want to have a drink with me?

733
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,160
 Year of the Tiger.

734
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,200
We booked a table over there.

735
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,599
Want to go?

736
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,109
Move. Move aside.

737
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,220
Move.

738
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:18,579
Writer Shin, you did a great job today.

739
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,970
How about a glass of whiskey in the lounge?

740
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,030
My gosh.

741
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,730
 The person you're trying to reach is not available. Please leave a message...

742
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,200
How much did you drink?

743
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,660
Now I have to hold you like that.

744
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,750
 What do I do?

745
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,810
 This is bad!

746
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:07,480
 Body, you have to move! Please!

747
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,820
I'll take you to a place I know around here.

748
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,299
Is that okay?

749
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,380
 Please.

750
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:17,120
 Please, somebody help me.

751
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,949
Are you okay?

752
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:21,830
 Please, please.

753
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,900
 Please, anybody!

754
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,450
I've been looking for you.

755
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:47,810
♫  Again tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking of you  ♫

756
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:50,530
♫   Oh every night   ♫

757
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,970
♫   What am I to you? I’m curious   ♫

758
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,940
Who are you?

759
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,240
♫   Please tell me now   ♫

760
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,500
♫   Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper   ♫

761
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,050
I'm her friend. I'll take her with me.

762
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,700
How can I just believe that you're her friend?

763
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,970
♫   Tell me now, how are you doing it?   ♫

764
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,180
♫   My nights are filled with you   ♫

765
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,200
♫   Stare at me now, I wanna be your moon   ♫

766
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,480
Why do you have my friend's phone?

767
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,310
- Because she's my friend. 
 - Do you know her name?

768
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:38,030
♫   Still, I’ll hold out my hand   ♫

769
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,070
♫   That moon is the door to you   ♫

770
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,940
Hey.

771
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,429
 I've actually sobered up a while ago,

772
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,989
 but I missed the right time to get up.

773
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,790
Are you feeling better?

774
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,360
Do you want me to get you something warm?

775
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,480
If I order a cake, you'll eat it, right?

776
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,140
A tiramisu, please.

777
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,880
I would prefer you scold me...

778
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,819
I went clubbing although I knew

779
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,119
crowded places are dangerous

780
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,899
and made you come back

781
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,550
after traveling abroad for work.

782
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,700
I'm sorry for everything.

783
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,700
It's okay.

784
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,600
The Bead is fine, and so are you.

785
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,989
But you should avoid places like that from now on,

786
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:17,380
if only for your sake.

787
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,139
- Okay. From now on— 
 - Don't be scared, either.

788
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,199
What?

789
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,399
I know you're scared of me.

790
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,389
You're worried I might harm or threaten you.

791
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,910
I can see it.

792
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,430
- Well— 
 - I understand.

793
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:35,030
Who wouldn't be scared of a gumiho?

794
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:39,059
But you're not just anyone.

795
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,349
You have my Bead,

796
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:45,280
and you need to be safe to keep my Bead safe.

797
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,480
I can only protect you at all costs.

798
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,480
So why don't you try to be less scared?

799
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,339
It makes me feel bad

800
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,000
to see you living on pins and needles.

801
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,809
I'm sorry that I've worried you.

802
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:05,019
From now on, I'll try not to be scared of you,

803
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:08,350
and to keep something like this from happening again.

804
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,890
- Do you promise? 
 - Yes.

805
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:24,650
You have to keep your promise.

806
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,090
I will.

807
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,710
- One moment. 
 - Sure.

808
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,590
Hello?

809
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,360
Yes.

810
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,389
I thought he was like a scary gumiho from the horror movies,

811
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:06,210
but he might be more like a kind fox from the fairy tales.

812
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,490
I understand. Bye.

813
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:25,670
- Shall we? 
 - Yes.

814
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,680
Year of the Tiger.

815
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,100
I see.

816
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,179
By the way, is the Bead

817
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,500
visible only to you?

818
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,510
Yes.

819
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,370
What color is it?

820
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,740
- It's red. 
 - So it's red.

821
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,350
Do you think you can take it out?

822
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:10,939
I will try.

823
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:15,360
A human cannot carry the Bead for long anyway.

824
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,510
How long can a human hold it then?

825
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:21,369
A year, at most.

826
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,619
So that means after one year of carrying it,

827
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,280
it will be resolved one way or the other.

828
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:37,730

829
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,320
Doesn't it?

830
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,450
Then what happens if it's not taken out in time?

831
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,440
You will die.

832
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,900
What?

833
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,280
Miss Dam,

834
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,980
you will die.

835
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:05,870
♫   The drawing of our beginning   ♫

836
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:09,460
♫  When I close my eyes and feel you, I can draw you out  ♫

837

♫  Let's start, baby (Let's start, baby)  ♫

838
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:25,710
♫  At some point, I started thinking of you on a white canvas  ♫

839
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:26,980
♫  right here  ♫

840

♫  The drawing of our beginning  ♫

842
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:38,140
♫  Somewhere where a warm breeze blows  ♫

843
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:42,170
♫  The sunshine follows it to you, and lingers there  ♫

844
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:46,280
♫  Do you see that blue ocean, and those dark eyes of yours  ♫

845
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:51,330
♫  So beautiful, should I draw them here?  ♫

846
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:56,020
♫  Let's start, baby. The drawing of our beginning, oh  ♫

~ Preview ~

849
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,539
 What are you doing out there?

850
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,619
 I didn't even hit you that hard. How could it pop right out?

851
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:10,190
 Have you thought about how you can take the Bead out?

852
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,249
 I can't believe I'm using my powers for this.

853
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,170
 I wrote up an agreement.

854
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,480
 One, no contact with the opposite sex born in the Year of the Tiger.

855
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,170
 How would I know which year they were born in?

856
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:22,629
 The legend of the history department who dated over twenty women, Seon Woo.

857
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,929
 Class of 2017, so he was born in the Year of the Tiger!

858
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:28,490
 So, does she know that she can die

859
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:30,250
 if the Bead keeps taking her energy?

860
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,349
 What are you doing here, Miss Dam?

861
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:34,820
 Mr. Gumiho, please let me get out of here.
