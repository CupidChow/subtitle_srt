1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:13,440

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,029

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,660

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,300

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,690

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,870

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,499
 I'll let you see

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,370
 what can be her future, too.

9
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,670
 It all began because of my selfishness, so I tried to bear through this.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,449
 My life was made up of nothing but patience,

11
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:08,490
 so I thought it would be a piece of cake.

12
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,560
 Why did I

13
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,830
 delude myself into thinking I could bear through?

14
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,300
Dam.

15
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:27,950
Wake up.

16
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,190
Stop

17
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,490
looking at that.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,880
Sir.

19
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,060
I had a dream and...

20
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,680
Forget it. That man...

21
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,670
He was just here.

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,250
Are you okay, Miss Dam?

23
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm all right now, sir.

24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,030
Anyway, about that man.

25
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,390
I think I ran into him at the bookstore too.

26
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,260
Who is he?

27
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,040
A being who put me here today.

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,300
People usually call him

29
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,499
the mountain spirit.

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,630
He's a spirit?

31
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,859
So that's how he could tie that red thread on me

32
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,060
and made me have that dream...

33
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,040
Did you see my dream too?

34
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,360
I didn't see anything.

35
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,089
It was nothing.

36
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,349
There was Seon Woo involved, but it's not a big deal.

37
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,910
He said something about my fate, but who said I'd let fate run my life.

38
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,179
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

39
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,569
Who does he think he is to tie that onto my finger and give me that dream?

40
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,180
Why does he do this to us?

41
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,640
Because it's right for a human

42
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,410
to be with another human.

43
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,989
We can decide what's right for us.

44
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,099
Sir, don't worry about it.

45
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,170
That dream and that thread? Those mean nothing to us.

46
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,460
I won't let him have it his way.

47
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,330
 What? He gave her a dream?

48
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,949
Why did he bother to show her something that isn't even true, by making her dream about it?

49
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,409
How much did you see?

50
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,720
Were they hugging each other? Or did they kiss?

51
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,330
Their ordinary day looked nice.

52
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:37,150
They were like a young couple as they should be,

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,380
enjoying their time in peace without any worries.

54
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,580
Those are the things I can't offer her.

55
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,480
Whatever. Why do you care about some dumb dream?

56
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,059
Right?

57
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,980
Why does it bother me so much?

58
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,190
I might have been envious of living such an ordinary life.

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,170
How much time

60
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,210
do you have left until your thousand years are over?

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm not sure.

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,070
It'll be over soon, I guess.

63
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,350
 Then

64
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,770
 I'll disappear without a trace.

65
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,219

66
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,729
- Are you busy tomorrow? 
 - No, why?

67
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,539
Come early. We're making kimchi.

68
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,860
You can't mix the seasoning, but you have good taste.

69
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,509
I do have good taste,

70
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,799
but you're busy training now. Let's just buy it this time.

71
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,219
I just ordered a few heads.

72
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,619
I'll send some to Mom,

73
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,680
and since you love to eat new kimchi with bossam, I want to show my gratitude.

74
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,280
Show your gratitude? What?

75
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,920
I made you get a part-time job.

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,320
You should be busy partying.

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,550
Hey, win a gold medal, then pay me back with 50 percent interest.

78
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,860
You're a loan shark.

79
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,030
So how's your job? Isn't it too tough?

80
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,790
Well, it's all right.

81
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,220
- It's okay. 
 - Really?

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,079
   You're off today, aren't you?

83
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,670
 I'll organize the inventory, so you don't have to mind it.

84
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,020
I don't want to mind it, but I do.

85
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,019
Good morning, Dam.

86
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,619
Hey, don't hug me from the back. I hate this.

87
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,450
Why? Do you have a bad memory of your man hugging you from the back?

88
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,129
It would've been better if it was him.

89
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,060
- My gosh, girl. 
 - That's Professor Shin.

90
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,980
Is something bothering him?

91
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,770
He doesn't look so energetic.

92
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,670
He doesn't.

93
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,889
He usually looks handsome and smart,

94
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,799
but today, he makes me want to protect him.

95
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,080
He looks as if he stayed up all night because he was sad.

96
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,869
You know, heartrending.

97
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,610
- Soo Kyeong, let me ask you a question. 
 - Okay.

98
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's say you have a boyfriend.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,080
And your boyfriend...

100
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,900
You can tell me. What about him?

101
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,249
He's not human.

102
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,769
What? He's such a jerk that you can't even call him human?

103
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,650
No, that's not what I meant. He literally isn't human.

104
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,359
Let's say he's a superhuman being.

105
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,250
For example, a vampire or a gumiho.

106
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,800
Okay, a gumiho.

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,889
And?

108
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,770
Then this mountain spirit showed up

109
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,900
and tied you up with a human man with a red string of fate in front of him.

110
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,510
And there's a mountain spirit now?

111
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,080
- And? 
 - And

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,410
what now?

113
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,590
If you want to tell him that's not what's important,

114
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,180
what can you do to get that point across?

115
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,560
Well, first off,

116
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,270
I'd stop reading webtoons.

117
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,679
I thought this was about your boyfriend.

118
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,499
You're reading a fantasy webtoon after binging on historical dramas?

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,680
And you got a part-time job too. You're one busy girl.

120
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,629
Hey, yes. Let's say this is a plot of a webtoon.

121
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,209
So what would you do?

122
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,689
No idea. My future would be way more important than my boyfriend.

123
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,750
Right? That's how it is, right?

124
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,250
But this is really odd.

125
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,440
When you like someone,

126
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,380
you're more worried about him than...

127
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,050
Soo Kyeong, wait up!

128
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
What are you doing?

129
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,739
What are you writing down?

130
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,679
I'm planning my date.

131
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,919
Lunch, dinner, dessert, then a walk.

132
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,239
Everything is perfect.

133
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,879
Yes, you're a perfect pushover.

134
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,639
Has the story of this pushover begun?

135
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,079
It's not that. Hye Sun comforted me when I was sad last time.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,059
So one day, when she feels down,

137
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,640
I want to comfort her by going on a fun date.

138
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,550
- Can a fun date be comforting? 
 - Yes.

139
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,330
- Jae Jin, let me ask you a question. 
 - Okay.

140
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,270
You said

141
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,500
you're dating Hye Sun because of your grade, right?

142
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,970
But since when have you been so concerned about your grades?

143
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,520
She's right.

144
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,349
What?

145
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,700
And if you're only dating her because of your grade,

146
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,189
why are you putting in so much effort?

147
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,790
She's right.

148
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,640
Well...

149
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,410
Hey, be honest.

150
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,400
The one you spent...

151
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,970
that time with.

152
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,740
It's Hye Sun, isn't it?

153
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,270
Well...

154
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,549
 What do I do? If I say yes, it'll make Hye Sun look weird.

155
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,069
 But if I say no, I'll be this jerk who was with one girl for a one-night-stand and another to date.

156
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,790
That girl I spent the night with isn't Hye Sun.

157
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,109
- What? 
 - You. You jerk.

158
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,770
Is this Hollywood? How are you this open-minded?

159
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,179
You deserve a beating.

160
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,809
 That was a good choice, Jae Jin.

161
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,729
 My reputation has gone down the drain, but I saved Hye Sun's reputation.

162
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,630
I'm taking this.

163
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,330
All of a sudden? Why?

164
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,790
- You can't have it. 
 - Give it back.

165
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640

166
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,989
Sir, are you busy?

167
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,630
Even if I was, I won't be. You're here.

168
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,420
Then let's go out.

169
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,250
Ta-da.

170
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,425
I stole Jae Jin's notebook of date ideas.

171
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:44,970

172
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,280
Let's do everything here to change things up.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
Change things up?

174
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,920
We've gone through so much with energy, red thread, and whatnot.

175
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,880
You can call it a day and focus on us.

176
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,279

177
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,980
One second.

178
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,670
Hey, Dan.

179
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,550
What? The cabbage is coming today?

180
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,879
I thought it was tomorrow.

181
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,619
Don't know. There must've been a misunderstanding in the order.

182
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:21,139
What should we do? They left it in front of our house.

183
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,550
It can't be out there for long.

184
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,499
Okay, I'll carry those back inside.

185
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:29,019
Well, carrying those in wouldn't be the end of it.

186
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:32,330
What? Are you telling me to make kimchi alone?

187
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,209
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:38,790
I have an important tournament, and I'll be really late after I finish analyzing the game.

189
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,090
You can't let salted cabbage be for too long.

190
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,210
Hang up for now.

191
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,290
Sir, I'm sorry.

192
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,410
We'll have to reschedule our date.

193
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,820
I'm even feeling cold now that I'm a human.

194
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,849
I used to go around fine

195
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:13,890
in the middle of winter wearing my flimsy hanbok.

196
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,649
That's why he can never date.

197
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,089
Have you all heard about Hye Sun and Jae Jin's relationship?

198
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,009
Yes, we've heard.

199
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,639
The boys in our department were shocked, then they got wasted.

200
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,309
You talk as if you didn't. You were the worst case.

201
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,130
- I thought you lost your country. 
 - Hey.

202
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,440
But doesn't this seem odd?

203
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,080
- What? 
 - What is?

204
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,109
I mean, it's all too sudden.

205
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,520
And they went public on the day our grades came out.

206
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,509
Do you think they're pretending to date because of their grades?

207
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,779
Just to get A pluses?

208
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,099
Exactly.

209
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,329
No way.

210
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,449
Grades are very important these days, and they wouldn't mess with it.

211
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:52,360
Exactly.

212
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,169
If that's the case, we should tell the professor and end their lives.

213
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,769
Then I'll upload it online.

214
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,520
- It'll be a huge scandal. 
 - They'll have to quit school.

215
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,200
- No way. 
 - Oh no.

216
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,489
I might end up getting embarrassed in front of kids who are 700 years younger than me.

217
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,830
- What should I do? 
  - Hye Sun.

218
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,239
- Are you done with your class? 
 - What?

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,470
I prepared lots of things for you,

220
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,610
but everything got stolen.

221
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,970
Babe, aren't you cold?

222
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,060
"Babe"?

223
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,240
Yes, babe.

224
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,900
Hold this in your hand and stay warm in your class.

225
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,120
Even if you get tired, think of me and stay strong. Okay?

226
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,330
Babe, you're so...

227
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,880
I'll do my best.

228
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,820

229
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,670
It'll take me forever to move these.

230
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,519
This is so much work.

231
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,200

232
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,699
Sir.

233
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,900
I thought you could use help.

234
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,519
My gosh.

235
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,100
Thanks for your power donation, sir.

236
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,370
Can you make kimchi with your magic?

237
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,630
I'm not sure.

238
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,129
Making food requires a delicate touch of hand,

239
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:55,170
so there's a limit.

240
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,179
So I wanted to help out myself.

241
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,599
You want to make kimchi?

242
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,049
Of course.

243
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,689
I believe that making kimchi is a family event,

244
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,839
which means you need many people.

245
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,860
You can't do it alone, can you?

246
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,110
But it'll be tough when you actually do it.

247
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,590
I want to do this together.

248
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,260
Something ordinary in your everyday life.

249
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,570
I want to do that with you.

250
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,490
Sure, you can do that.

251
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,440
Gosh, you have the looks to make everything you want come true.

252
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,220
What should we begin with?

253
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,460
First off, you should get dressed properly.

254
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,170
Is there a certain outfit?

255
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,689
How should I be dressed to look proper in this traditional human event of making kimchi?

256
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,470
Do you have something in a different color?

257
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,910
Something less flashy, but more classy.

258
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,820
But sir, are you sure you can do this?

259
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,469
Miss Dam, have you heard of an expression, "a man of uncommon acquirements"?

260
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:35,750
Of course, someone who's smart and talented in many ways.

261
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,350
That's who I am.

262
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,419
I've lived for a long time, so I have much knowledge of traditional dishes,

263
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,550
and I'm also amazingly talented,

264
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,119
so don't worry.

265
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:53,380

266
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,240

267
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,660
It's now the final step.

268
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,050
Do it over.

269
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,860
What? But... why?

270
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,319
You need to get the seasoning all the way in.

271
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,510
It's completely white inside. Are you making white kimchi?

272
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,229
Kimchi must be very significant for humans.

273
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:34,440
You've been doing this strenuous work every single year.

274
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,859
When there's no reward.

275
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,499
Of course, there's a reward.

276
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:42,449
There's always a special and amazing reward after you make kimchi.

277
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,530
What exactly is this reward?

278
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,489
Ta-da. We have some suyuk here.
  (T/N: boiled meet)

279
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,769
Freshly made kimchi with freshly boiled suyuk.

280
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,790
Isn't it the best reward or what?

281
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,759
I'm not sure.

282
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,930
It'll be different once you have a bite.

283
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,700
Open up.

284
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,630
How is it?

285
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,770
It's good.

286
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,980
Come on. That's not the response of someone who thinks this is good.

287
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,350
I'll walk in one more time, so do it over.

288
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,630
Ta-da. Sir, we have some suyuk here.

289
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,540
It looks so good.

290
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,530
Open up.

291
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,200
So?

292
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,740
- It's really good, Miss Dam. 
 - See?

293
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,919
I didn't learn to use magic to do this.

294
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,880
Right, this is when we need our friend.

295
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,860
Our friend?

296
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,319
Sir, I got some makgeolli. 
  (T/N: rice wine)

297
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,640
Suyuk's friend, makgeolli.

298
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh wait, you get easily drunk.

299
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,379
Sorry?

300
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,319
When we went to that cart bar,

301
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,750
we ordered two bottles of soju, and you had only one glass.

302
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,490
And your face turned red after that.

303
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,770
I think you were the one who got drunk that night.

304
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,479
You wouldn't let me drink back then,

305
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,290
so I was weak for that period.

306
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,919
I'm a hard drinker.

307
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,160
I was famous for winning a beer-drinking contest.

308
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,649
Miss Dam.

309
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:51,260
I was also famous for my alcohol intake in the Joseon era.

310
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,950
Once I began to drink, they had to use up rice

311
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,179
to satisfy my need for alcohol, so people went starving that year.

312
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,860
That's an exaggeration.

313
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,700
I'll prove that it wasn't just an exaggeration.

314
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,890
- Who's this? 
 - My mom.

315
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,940
It's ancient history.

316
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,450
I haven't looked at this for long.

317
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,280
I looked really ugly when I was a baby, right?

318
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,030
You were cute.

319
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,470
- This one? 
 - Yes.

320
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,510
This is Dan.

321
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,250
This is me.

322
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,790
Right.

323
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,549
So this is how you grew up.

324
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,880
What were you like as a kid?

325
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,780
I never had a childhood.

326
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,460
I've always looked like this.

327
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,690
Pick out a photo. I'll give you one.

328
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,640
Then give me five.

329
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,000
What? You want five?

330
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,730
This one. This, and this.

331
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,570
This one and this. I like them all.

332
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,290
What should I do, then? Should I give you the entire album?

333
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,380
 Dam!

334
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,049
- What are you doing? 
 - Well, I...

335
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:58,670
We only made kimchi, I mean it. Just kimchi.

336
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,109
I had to do it alone, right?

337
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,990
But he offered to help since it's tough to do it alone.

338
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,870
Then we got a little drunk on makgeolli, so...

339
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,700
Say hi. This is my boyfriend.

340
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,280
Is Admiral Yi Sun Sin your boyfriend?

341
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,400
What?

342
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,720

343
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,359
I must have had one too many drinks.

344
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,430
I must've dreamed of my boyfriend after I fell asleep drunk.

345
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,409
You had twelve empty bottles of makgeolli out there.

346
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,730
Clean those up.

347
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,320
Never mind, I'll clean up. Get some rest.

348
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,779
Oh, thanks.

349
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,200
Do you actually have a boyfriend?

350
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,560
 Sir, what happened?

351
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,460
 I didn't want to trouble you, so I got out.

352
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,100
 Oh, you should've met my brother before you left.

353
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,700
 You'll have to lie if you want to tell him about me.

354
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,810
 Then sir, you'll look like this for life.

355
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,700
 You know,

356
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,410
 I don't care that he said a human should only be with another human.

357
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,020
 I really don't care

358
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,930
 if you aren't human.

359
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,750
 But

360
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,140
 I'll keep changing

361
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,130
 as I grow older.

362
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,310
 So I do get a little worried about how you'll be left alone.

363
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,910
♫  Not once  ♫

364
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:29,860
♫  was I able to tell you that I love you  ♫

365
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,170
 But I do hope we could be together for a long time.

366
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:40,500
♫  And I still haven't been able to show you all of my sincere feelings  ♫

367
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,860
 I'd love to do that, too.

368
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,400
♫  Get close to you  ♫

369
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,700
♫  Like you and I,  ♫

370
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:00,730
♫  crossing each other in the cold breeze  ♫

371
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,360
♫  I'm scared I won't be able to see you again  ♫

372
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,660
 At first,

373
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,810
 I wanted you to go back to your ordinary life.

374
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,690
 That's why

375
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,180
 I let you go with much pain.

376
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,200
 But now,

377
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,340
 I want to be your ordinary future.

378
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:37,310
♫  If passed memories call for you  ♫

379
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,080
 One day, there will come a moment

380
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,520
 when you can't stand that you're actually a fox.

381
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,930
Professor Shin.

382
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,180
Are you going to class?

383
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,780
Yes.

384
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,700
Do you want to grab a cup of coffee after your lecture?

385
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
 Sir, are you feeling all right?

386
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,659
 It must've been tough to keep up with me.

387
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:34,990
 Let's relieve our hangovers together.

388
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,750
Hey, I know how you feel, but...

389
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,770
How I feel about what?

390
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,929
Oh, right.

391
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:05,100
That you adore me as a cute and nice junior.

392
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,360
What? I never had such a scary thought.

393
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,579
Oh, right. I heard you got Mr. Han Seok Won to do an interview.

394
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:16,179
How did you get him to do it?

395
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,349
I sent him about a hundred emails.

396
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:21,150
I'm going for the interview next week.

397
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,260
That's amazing.

398
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,779
But I'm sorry. There's no one to come with you.

399
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:27,729
Exactly.

400
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,800
Ever since Da Young and everyone left, no one else will join us.

401
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,330
Right, should we ask Professor Shin to help us get the word out?

402
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,710
Professor Shin?

403
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,359
I have an announcement before we begin the lecture.

404
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,010
We need more members in the history club I oversee.

405
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,369
Me! I'll do it.

406
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,999
I'm busy studying for my classes and for my teacher certification,

407
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,300
but I wish to add my little effort for your sake, sir.

408
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,330
I'm in too.

409
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,570
Anyone else?

410
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,370
Me too.

411
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,430
All right, then.

412
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,069
Then it's Choi Soo Kyeong, Jung Seok and Gye Seon Woo.

413
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:28,210
On top of that, Yang Hye Sun too.

414
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,969
Let's get started.

415
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:32,120
Why do I have to join it?

416
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,419
I already told them you applied before.

417
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,759
So why did you make up that lie? Stop pulling a prank.

418
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,330
It's not a prank. I'm asking you for a favor.

419
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,619
Please keep an eye on her.

420
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:43,759
If you're that worried, go there yourself.

421
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,539
Aren't you the advisor?

422
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,480
It'll make her feel overwhelmed.

423
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,090
If you don't want to do it alone,

424
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,200
you can bring that friend of yours along too.

425
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,150
What?

426
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,460
What now?

427
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,899
We're only dating because of our grades.

428
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:07,150
I didn't say anything.

429
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,800
You did. You said it in your head.

430
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,650
What do you want?

431
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,990

432
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,730
It feels worse when he says nothing.

433
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,240
But still, it looks like he has been keeping his calm.

434
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,779
Hye Sun.

435
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:35,660
I heard you joined Dam's club. I'll join you.

436
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,719
- You too? 
 - Yes, of course.

437
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:41,200
Did you hear about the interview tomorrow?

438
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,299
What?

439
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,720
Tomorrow? Right away?

440
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,899
Yes, the historian I'm about to interview

441
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,619
has to travel abroad soon.

442
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,790
If we don't do it tomorrow, we'll have to wait a month.

443
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,660
So I'll be away for two days, one night.

444
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,070
Two days, one night.

445
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,740
Do you have to stay the night?

446
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,780
Yes,

447
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,430
that's the only way we could work things out.

448
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,510
I'm thirsty.

449
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,010
♫   What words shall I use   ♫

450
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,290
To be honest, I don't want you to go.

451
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,370
Just hang out with me.

452
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,430
 He's so cute.

453
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,350
Promise to text me often.

454
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,500
Come on. It's not like a month-long backpacking trip.

455
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,710
Don't drink too much.

456
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,940
I can't promise that.

457
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,970
And don't stay too close to him.

458
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:11,510
♫   If only you would look at me and hold my heart  ♫

459
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,760
What you're worrying about will never happen.

460
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,570
Do you trust me?

461
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,360
I do.

462
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,010
♫   Slowly flowing towards me  ♫

463
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,020
♫   I’ve softly hidden   ♫

464
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:40,750
♫   this one truth   ♫

465
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,010
Go and have fun.

466
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,770
But don't have too much fun.

467
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,320
Okay.

468
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,560
♫   I want to give that to you and embrace your heart that has returned  ♫

469
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,229
Hye Sun, we must be the first to arrive here.

470
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:09,360
I guess you're right.

471
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:10,450

472
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,950
Right.

473
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,079
I didn't need any supplements before, but now that I'm a human,

474
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,088
I need them to get myself going.

475
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:19,979
Now you're a human?

476
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:25,720
My Korean is still bad. It's probably because I've been abroad for so long.

477
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,890
Two each.

478
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,410
Try it.

479
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:40,800
It's my present for you. It's good for health, so take it regularly.

480
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,079
Thank you. This is my first time getting something like this from my girlfriend.

481
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,210
All I have gotten were sudden goodbyes.

482
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,499
Thank you.

483
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,529
If you like it so much, make it your profile photo

484
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,398
so other guys don't suspect us.

485
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:55,399
Suspect?

486
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,758
Haven't I told you?

487
00:34:56,758 --> 00:35:00,460
Our fellow students suspect that we might not be a real couple.

488
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,780
You mean,

489
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,420
they think we are a "show window couple"?

490
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,739
That's not what I meant.

491
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,589
They think we are just pretending

492
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:09,829
to be a couple just for show.

493
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:13,250
That's what we call a show window couple, Hye Sun.

494
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,040
Is that so?

495
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,970
So that's why you've been nice to me.

496
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,360
You want to show them that we're not fake.

497
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,859
Yes. So tell your friends

498
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:31,420
to keep their mouth shut too.

499
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,670
Okay.

500
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,330
 Jae Jin.

501
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,780
Hey.

502
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,569
The other guys are already at the ticket office.

503
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,060
Let's hurry.

504
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,609
Thank you for your time, sir.

505
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:57,879
Thank you.

506
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:00,429
We will take a look at the museum too.

507
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:02,249
Good. Goodbye then.

508
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:04,270
Thank you.

509
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,199
What a charismatic man he is!

510
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,809
Every single thing he said was a pearl of wisdom. You heard it, right?

511
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,219
Of course, I did.

512
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,189
"I think getting our cultural assets back"

513
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,570
"is getting our ancestors' spirit back."

514
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,219
It touched my heart. You should definitely mention this in the magazine.

515
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,469
Of course. Excuse me for a second.

516
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:23,440
Yes!

517
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,710
Yes! It's finished now.

518
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,340
It went well.

519
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,910
 How are you doing, Sir?

520
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,670
 I'm doing all right. So you don't need to worry.

521
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,290
Be careful!

522
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,350
- Are you okay? 
 - Thanks, Sunbae.

523
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,410
I feel like she's avoiding me even more all of a sudden.

524
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,679
Thank you for coming today.

525
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,010
I appreciate your participation.

526
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,990
Your participation should be appreciated the most.

527
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,079
You just started seeing your boyfriend,

528
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,709
and you had to give up a weekend date.

529
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,560
What are you talking about?

530
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,399
By the way, Seon Woo, I had no idea you'd come.

531
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,539
You've never participated in things like this before.

532
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:25,440
Well...

533
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,320
I thought today might be the last chance for me.

534
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,349
How about we play a game? Truth or dare?

535
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:43,209
- We're not playing that. 
 - Come on. What else do we do?

536
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,100
Let me fill up the glass.

537
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,130
All right.

538
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,800
Three, two, one.

539
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,340
Soo Kyeong.

540
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,349
Oh, well.

541
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,549
I guess I have to disclose

542
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,639
the veiled secrets of mine now.

543
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,090
Ask me anything,

544
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,130
please.

545
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,699
- Come on. 
 - What?

546
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:11,100
Ask me.

547
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,380
Have you ever had a crush on one of us here?

548
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,760
- Come on. That's ridiculous... 
 - Yes.

549
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,640
I have.

550
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,740
You're not

551
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,520
about to start a long story, are you?

552
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,219
I'm not interested. Let's move on.

553
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:35,869
Next.

554
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,099
There you go. Dam.

555
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,890
All right. Dam.

556
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,110
Where did you first meet your boyfriend?

557
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,799
Where could you have possibly met him to drink it right away?

558
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,700
I don't know. Let's move on.

559
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,280
Three, two, one.

560
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,440
Why do you like your boyfriend?

561
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,179
I just like him.

562
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,140
I like him so much that nothing can sway me.

563
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,099
I think I should go grill a squid.

564
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,900
I'll go get some fruits too.

565
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,709
- Soo Kyeong. 
 - Yes?

566
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,140
You said you had a crush on one of us. Is that true?

567
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,369
The game is over now,

568
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,149
you Seogwa University's thief.

569
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:48,150
Seogwa University's thief?

570
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,159
Why is Jae Jin a thief?

571
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,729
Soy sauce marinated crab is a rice thief

572
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,869
because it makes us crave rice.

573
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:57,409
Rain is a thief because he married Kim Tae Hee.

574
00:39:57,409 --> 00:39:59,940
And he's a thief, too, because he's going out with you.

575
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,750
You're too good for him.

576
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,510
I'm not sure about that. I think he's too good for me.

577
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,279
Come on. You can be honest with me. There's nobody here.

578
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,479
You don't have to pretend to like him.

579
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,589
I mean it. I haven't seen

580
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,739
such a nice and ingenuous man in a long time.

581
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,300
I meant it when I said he's too good for me.

582
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,200
Are you sure?

583
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,890
Can you put your hand on the chest and swear?

584
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,410
Do I really have to put my hand on the chest?

585
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,749
You can't, can you?

586
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,119
Why? Is it because it will make you

587
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,410
feel guilty?

588
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,980
I should get going.

589
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,170
Why did you want me to put my hand on your chest?

590
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,649
Because there seems to be nothing to brag about.

591
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,350
Hey!

592
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,520
I didn't mean my chest.

593
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,320
And what do you mean by,

594
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,879
there's nothing to brag about?

595
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,340
Mine is just fine!

596
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,580
It's snowing.

597
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,420
It's pretty.

598
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,970
Is he drunk?

599
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,100
It's none of my business. I should go.

600
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,310
Sunbae, you should get inside and go to bed.

601
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,770
I warned you.

602
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,610
I like you.

603
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,670
I know you have a boyfriend and I know I should stop.

604
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,650
But still...

605
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,590
What should I do to make you look at me?

606
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,620
Is it too late?

607
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,050
Or have I never had a chance at all?

608
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,190
 I should stop. I might make a mistake.

609
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,960
Seon Woo, you're drunk.

610
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,790
You should get inside before you make any mistake.

611
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,030
It's not a mistake.

612
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,040
 Why does my heart suddenly...

613
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,380

614
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,670
 If I answer this call now and he happens to hear his voice...

615
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,600

616
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,180
Sunbae, I told you.

617
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,590
I really like my boyfriend.

618
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,200
I don't want to give you false hope.

619
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,100
What do I have to say to turn you down for good?

620
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,120
Where did she go?

621
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Woo Yeo told me to keep an eye on her.

622
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,710
 Hye Sun.

623
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,080
What are you doing in the snow?

624
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,320
Jae Jin, have you seen Dam?

625
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,820
No.

626
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,410
Why are you looking for Dam? Do you need to talk to her?

627
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,519
Well, kind of.

628
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,239
I'll go find her, so stay inside. It's cold.

629
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,879
Come on. We don't need to look so sweet.

630
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,790
There's no one looking anyway...

631
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,870
There is someone looking.

632
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,930
What? Someone's looking?

633
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,260
Seok sunbae is behind us.

634
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,680
Pretend we're a sweet couple.

635
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,920
Let's go. Smile and walk naturally.

636
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,860
I shouldn't have asked you to date me.

637
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,209
I thought it was a good idea to get good grades,

638
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:12,480
but now I'm a bit worried it might get more complicated than I thought.

639
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,460
Hye Sun.

640
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,220
I'm not seeing you for good grades.

641
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,379
What?

642
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,270
About what happened to us that night

643
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,750
after the festival after-party,

644
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,170
I thought about it a lot,

645
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,990
and I don't think it was just a mistake.

646
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:38,730
I think you're cute and really cool.

647
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,620
Thinking about you makes me happy.

648
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,169
So, don't you mind what others say.

649
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,950
I'm seeing you because I like you.

650
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,730
Is Seok still there?

651
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,370
Yes, he's still there.

652
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,610
I need to find Dam.

653
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,750
She'll find her way back on her own.

654
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,590
It's snowing a lot, isn't it?

655
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,820
 Should I go?

656
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,640
 No.

657
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:44,690
 If I suddenly show up, it will look weird.

658
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,620
I felt that way

659
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,000
because of the red thread?

660
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,590
 Dam, you're arriving at two tomorrow, right?

661
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,910
 I'll pick you up.

662
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,020
I promised I wouldn't do anything that might worry him.

663
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:24,280
He will probably worry more if he finds out that I can see it too.

664
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,650
Dam, where have you been? I've been looking for you.

665
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,640
Why did you look for me?

666
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,670
I couldn't find both, you and Seon Woo. Nothing happened, right?

667
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,860
What?

668
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,479
I heard that you two are tied with the red thread.

669
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,370
I see. Nothing happened.

670
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,910
That's good.

671
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,180
It's cold. Let's get inside.

672
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,960
Hey, Hye Sun.

673
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,460
Do you think only the person who you're tied with the red thread

674
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,170
is considered destiny?

675
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,890
Yes and no.

676
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,760
Do you know

677
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,570
why all animals, including bears and tigers, want to be humans?

678
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:23,670
Only humans can decide their own destiny.

679
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,930

680
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,600
Good work, guys.

681
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,350
I'll get going now.

682
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,750
Bye.

683
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,590
Let's go.

684
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,470
It was fun.

685
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,270
- Hye Sun, let me help. 
 - It's okay. It's heavy.

686
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,840
That's why I'm offering help.

687
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,830
Thanks.

688
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,909
Cool.

689
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,489
Should I drive? I'm sure you're tired.

690
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,380
That would be great.

691
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,010
- Bye. 
 - Can I...

692
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,220
He said Exit Eight.

693
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,360
Are you okay?

694
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,890
You were still around here.

695
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,430
I'm taking a cab here.

696
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,300
How are you going home?

697
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,380
- By car. 
 - Whose car?

698
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,020
- Well... 
 - Dam.

699
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,310
Dam is riding my car. Is there an issue?

700
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,170
Hello, Professor. I'm Gye Seon Woo, and I take your class.

701
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,160
How do you

702
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,330
know Dam?

703
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,350
Is there a reason why you want to know that, Mr. Gye?

704
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,730
Pardon?

705
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,990
Yes, there is.

706
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,190
Wait.

707
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,800
He's my boyfriend.

708
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,919
What?

709
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,959
I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want any rumors,

710
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,820
but we met even before he came to our school.

711
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:54,200
I'm not taking his classes now, so there won't be any problem.

712
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,980
What are you talking about? That's not the problem.

713
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,430
- Then... 
 - Dam.

714
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,850
I wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday.

715
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,400
I was going to apologize, stay away from you

716
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,040
and stop talking to you if you said so. No, actually,

717
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,220
I would have stopped myself from doing so.

718
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,860
But this is not right.

719
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,580
I get that I might not be the one. But if I'm not,

720
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:24,420
it at least can't be him either.

721
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,130
What do you mean?

722
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,890
I'm not saying this because of rumors.

723
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,840
I saw it myself.

724
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:50,270
I don't understand what you're talking about. What rumors?

725
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,510
The thing is...

726
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,269
 They say Professor Shin and Professor Seo are going out.

727
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,570
 The entire school knows it.

728
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,040
You should leave.

729
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,750
Whatever I did or didn't,

730
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,310
is a matter between me and Miss Dam.

731
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,840
Now tell me,

732
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,730
what the rumor going around the university is.

733
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,180
You know Professor Seo Young Joo.

734
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,530
Yes, she teaches Ancient History.

735
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,960
I had a cup of coffee with her because of work,

736
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,880
and apparently that made false rumors

737
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:03,170
that we are dating.

738
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,690
Gosh, I got scared for nothing.

739
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:10,080
So it's not a big deal, right?

740
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:14,700
Of course. It's not.

741
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,000
By the way, did something happen yesterday?

742
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,620
What?

743
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,440
He said he wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday.

744
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,780
Oh, that.

745
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,180
If you don't want to talk about it, you don't have to.

746
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,140
He said he liked me.

747
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,130
I kept getting involved with him because of the red thread.

748
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,520
I tried to be careful

749
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,710
because I didn't want to worry you,

750
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,660
but one thing led to another, and it happened.

751
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,820
I don't know how honest I should be with you,

752
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,570
but I thought I should tell you this.

753
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,050
Thank you for being honest with me.

754
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,940
 Why is he holding it like that?

755
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:27,060
 He must have been worried.

756
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,640
 Look what I have done to the person I care about.

757
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,210
 Only humans can decide their own destiny.

758
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,200
 Okay.

759
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,860
 I will make... the decision.

760
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:55,949
I'd like a chicken sandwich with extra avocados.

761
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,759
- Okay.
- For the sauce, please drizzle the one you think would go well with it.

762
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,880
Yes, I understand.

763
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:17,250
What a shame. You were of great help.

764
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:20,099
I'm sorry I'm quitting on such short notice.

765
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,310
It's okay. You must have your own situation.

766
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,250
I hope to see you again one day.

767
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,810
I hope so too. Thank you for everything.

768
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,300
Thank you.

769
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,230
Hi, Uncle.

770
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,550
Hey, Dam is quitting.

771
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,960
It's because of you, right? You made her feel uncomfortable.

772
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,399
Well, it's...

773
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,830
Did you think I wouldn't know you had a crush on her?

774
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,499
You always waited for her to come,

775
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,699
and you did all the work for her.

776
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,150
Since when have you been such a devoted type?

777
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,110
Seon Woo.

778
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,739
Being too nice to women only pushes them away.

779
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,849
If you want to keep her, let her free.

780
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:19,610
If you want a passionate love, be cold to her.

781
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,379
If I had given you this wonderful tip earlier, you...

782
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,880
- I would have become an old single man. 
 - That's right. An old single...

783
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:32,609
Anyway, I think it's for the best.

784
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,190
You guys made me feel awkward.

785
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,220
She probably has someone better than you.

786
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,900
If he was actually a good person, I would have given up.

787
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,619
Sir, I decided to quit the job.

788
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,039
The work was harder than I thought.

789
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,700
Let me know if you need any help.

790
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,470
Good luck with the class. I'll talk to you later.

791
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,340
Professor Shin.

792
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,310
Hey.

793
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,270
Why the long face?

794
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,030
Well...

795
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,699
I probably shouldn't have joined the club.

796
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,899
Why? You were the first one to raise your hand

797
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,180
and say things like, "I'd like to provide help to Professor Shin."

798
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,620
It turned out he didn't need my help.

799
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,979
Apparently, Professor Seo and Professor Shin are going out.

800
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,290
I'm sure Professor Seo provides him a lot of help,

801
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,289
which is love.

802
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:50,359
I heard it's not true.

803
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,930
I heard they just had a cup of coffee because of work.

804
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:56,079
Hey, who talks about work

805
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,310
holding each other's hand so tightly?

806
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,120
You don't know anything.

807
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,330
Dam, aren't you just envious of Professor Seo?

808
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:29,890
I wonder what it feels like to date a man like Professor Shin.

809
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm sure you feel on top of the world.

810
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:39,750
 It can't be true. He said it was nothing.

811
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:43,729
Hey, it looks like the rumors were right.

812
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,929
I just saw Professor Seo on my way here.

813
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,749
And she was walking into Professor Shin's office.

814
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,369
They must be really going out.

815
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:53,220
Hey, we all know it.

816
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,950
We all do.

817
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,769
- I need to go somewhere. 
 - What?

818
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,229
Where? The class is starting soon.

819
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,370
What's going on with her?

820
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:07,360

821
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,530
Thanks for the coffee.

822
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,369
Are you free this evening?

823
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,829
There's a fine dining restaurant I like,

824
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,950
and the chef is...

825
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,270
Professor Shin?

826
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,729
Is this what you meant when you said you can handle it?

827
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,799
Wait. I can explain.

828
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,859
How will you explain that?

829
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,460
Miss Dam.

830
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,130
You were trying to hurt others instead of me.

831
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,359
 Wait up.

832
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,560
 - Hurry. 
 - Where are you going?

833
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:28,620

834
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,430
I can explain.

835
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:01,620
Let me ask you one thing.

836
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,350
And I really wish your answer is no.

837
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:08,330
Miss Dam.

838
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,140
You urgently needed some energy because of me,

839
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,490
and you put someone in danger

840
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,550
instead of putting me in danger. Am I right?

841
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,900
Because of me?

842
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,690
Did you do what you did to me?

843
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,009
There was no other way.

844
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,670
You could have told me there was no way then.

845
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,940
You should have been honest with me.

846
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,480
I know I'm horrible,

847
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,950
but could you just...

848
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:57,320
Could you just... bear with it?

849
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:04,600
I was willing to bear it.

850
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,049
Even if I always had to be scared to death

851
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,509
just to hold your hand,

852
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,960
I was willing to bear it.

853
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,600
I wanted this relationship despite everything.

854
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,170
Though you were not human,

855
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:28,519
and you lied to me and used me,

856
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,170
I just liked you.

857
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:35,480
So many things scared and worried me,

858
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,990
but all I cared about was if I would hurt you.

859
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:46,040
How could you do this to me?

860
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,090
Miss Dam.

861
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,540
Let's...

862
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,330
stop this.

863
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:35,170

864
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:44,550
♫  The meaningless answer, that look on your face   ♫

865
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:51,570
♫   At some point I stopped wanting to believe you   ♫

866
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,400
♫   Even though  ♫

867
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,619

868
01:03:56,619 --> 01:04:01,860
♫   I try to find a reason for your change of heart   ♫

869
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:08,810
♫   Still every day remains the same   ♫

870
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:17,550
♫   I have nothing left to say  ♫

871
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:23,310
♫   My words for you have hurt us   ♫

872
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,820

~ Preview ~

873
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,439
 I was fully convinced that he was a good person.

874
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,450

875
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:35,809
 The Bead has changed. And so I harbored a false hope.

876
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:39,369
 She's a human. Of course, she doesn't understand this situation.

877
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,560
 I'm sorry

878
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,890
 for liking you.

879
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,929
 His Bead started to turn blue.

880
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,829
 If there's anyone who can help you,

881
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,769
 that should be me, not anyone else.

882
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:55,000
 You might be the only one who can make him human.

883
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,570
♫   So I’ll have to endure through this love...   ♫
