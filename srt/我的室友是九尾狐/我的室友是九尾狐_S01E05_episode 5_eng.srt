1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:12,030

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,119

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,010

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,700

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,780

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,910

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,160
"There is always some madness in love."

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,430
Liking someone may mean

9
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,630
that you are misunderstanding that person in your own way.

10
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,730
So, what I'm trying to say is,

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,130
you could be Fermina Daza in someone's eyes, 
  (T/N: Female protagonist in the book "Love in the Time of Cholera")

12
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,309
and that won't be a misunderstanding.

13
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,960
Fermina Daza?

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,870
She's a heroine from a classic novel.

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,590
"To him, she seemed so beautiful, so seductive,"

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,110
"so different from ordinary people,"

17
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,010
"that he could not understand"

18
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,350
"why no one was as disturbed as he"

19
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,200
"by the clicking of her heels on the paving stones,"

20
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,030
"why no one else's heart was wild"

21
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,940
"with the breeze stirred by the sighs of her veils,"

22
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,440
"why everyone did not go mad with the movements of her braid,"

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,990
"the flight of her hands,"

24
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,580
"the gold of her laughter."

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,830
"He could not understand"

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,950
"why anyone wouldn't fall in love with her."

27
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,170
Look at the time.

28
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,130
We should go.

29
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,840
Yes, right. Let's go.

30
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,660
Gosh, it's hot.

31
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,150
Oh, I'm sorry. I was wondering if you were feverish.

32
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,140
No, I'm all right. I don't have a fever. I'm fine.

33
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,829
 Guys, listen up.

34
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,089
 This is my friend's story.

35
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:28,809
- It's her. 
 - It's your story.

36
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,620
 Her heart suddenly starts to pound,

37
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,689
 she had a tough time breathing,

38
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:35,970
 then she felt airheaded as if she was walking on clouds. What does this mean?

39
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:38,489

40
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,160
 Arrhythmia?

41
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,399
Stop fooling around, Jae Jin.

42
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:46,259
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make Dam fall in love.

43
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,350
I'm... I'm sorry.

44
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,359
 When did you... No, wait.

45
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,959
 When did your friend have those feelings?

46
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,229

47
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,510
 Well, she was just with somebody.

48
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,600
 In my opinion,

49
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,980
 I think your friend fell for that somebody.

50
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,950
 No, that can't be it.

51
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,680
You said it's your friend. How do you know?

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,929
 Because...

53
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,310

54
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,010
All right.

55
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,140
 Look.

56
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,950
 I burn this place down today to swear to die on sea.

57
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,469
If I seek to live, I shall die.

58
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:08,069
But if I seek to die, I shall live.

59
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,420
Gosh, that line gets me every time.

60
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,689
 Wait, maybe my heart began to race because I heard a nice quote from a book.

61
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,199
 My heart always begins to flutter when I hear great lines in movies.

62
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Is this any good?

63
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,870
Yes, sure.

64
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,310
Goodness, I'm so sleepy.

65
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,220
What is he doing? Filming a TV ad or something?

66
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,509
 Wait, maybe I was just impressed because of his overwhelming good looks.

67
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,349
 I would be fine if I didn't have a heart,

68
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,520
 but anybody with a heart is bound to be impressed by him.

69
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,769
It's surely so. No, I mean, I'll be back.

70
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,290
Miss Dam.

71
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,710
Yes, I'm just a huge fan of great lines with a weak spot for hot guys.

72
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,590
There's no way I would fall for him. No.

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,229
What's with her?

74
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,049
 What do you think? They have a thing for each other.

75
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,790
Dam likes Seon Woo, and Seon Woo likes Dam too.

76
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,720
What?

77
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,619
That message she sent us yesterday is about Seon Woo.

78
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,199
Why are you so slow?

79
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,049
You're the one who's slow.

80
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:52,109
I say that was a hundred percent not him.

81
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,839
I say it was a hundred percent him.

82
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,099
To be frank, I was a bit worried because of his reputation.

83
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,258
But he has my support now.

84
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:01,539
I got to know him, and he doesn't seem all too bad.

85
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,819
Above all, Dam likes him so much.

86
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,239
She never said anything about liking him so much.

87
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,319
The way she acted shows she's totally into him. Don't you know what she's like?

88
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,709
 Do you want to eat together?

89
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,829
 No, I like to eat alone.

90
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:18,360
 That way, I can eat all the side dishes by myself.

91
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,390
 Hey, if you don't have an umbrella, do you want to share mine with me?

92
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,290
 No, I bet my umbrella is way bigger.

93
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,919
 My gosh, but seriously,

94
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,379
her coldness probably brought the national temperature down by three degrees, however, we live to see this day.

95
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,010
I'm all for this relationship. Completely.

96
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,450
- You're all for what? 
 - It's you and Seon Woo—

97
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,839
He's all for some tteokbokki.

98
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,258
- Are you coming? 
 - Sure.

99
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:52,860
Let's go.

100
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,089
- Come. 
 - My gosh.

101
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,930
- Great work. 
 - See you at the next meeting.

102
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,030
Excuse me, Writer Shin.

103
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,040
Well, you know,

104
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,399
we'll have to go out for field study soon,

105
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,940
so why don't we discuss the schedule

106
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,459
over dinner with me sometime?

107
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,639
Next time.

108
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,939
Yes, I would like to schedule when exactly that next time will be.

109
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,159
I thought dancing around was my way of showing courtesy,

110
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,589
but I should probably make myself clear.

111
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:36,008
- I'm not looking to eat dinner with you. 
 - Sorry?

112
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:40,650
I don't feel comfortable dining with somebody else.

113
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,319
That was hurtful.

114
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,660
Hello.

115
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,530
 Goodness, I'm so sleepy.

116
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,299
 It's surely so. No, I mean, I'll be back.

117
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,130
 Miss Dam.

118
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,249
Dam, why aren't you eating? That's not like you.

119
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:36,979
You didn't even make a choice on adding ramyeon or udon noodles.

120
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,570
Why? Are you still worried about that friend from last night?

121
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,139
- What? 
 - So?

122
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,119
Does your friend admit she likes him?

123
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,270
She likes him? No way. Never.

124
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,970
 I'll be passing by your school later. Should I head over there?

125
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,399
- Yes, Miss Dam. 
 - Sir, I just read your text message.

126
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,689
Did you pass by my school?

127
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:15,709
Yes, I did.

128
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,650
What a shame.

129
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,969
 What is?

130
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:22,079
My bus fare. I could've saved on that.

131
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,189
Then will you wait there?

132
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,580
I didn't get too far, so I can be there soon.

133
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,480
See you at school.

134
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,270
I'm so full.

135
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,029
- Hey, I'm leaving. 
 - Wait for us. We're all done.

136
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,270
No, I have to meet someone. See you tomorrow.

137
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,870
Who is she in such a hurry to meet?

138
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,579
Wait, do you think she's going out with Seon Woo?

139
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,779
Goodness, stop that thing with Seon Woo.

140
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:54,050
Hey, maybe you're the one who has a thing for him.

141
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,500
Wait, I think I'm spot on.

142
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,749
If you're done, let's go. I'm going to my TOEIC class. 
  (T/N: TOEIC - Test of English for International Communication)

143
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:02,439
Really? Do you want a ride? I drove today.

144
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:05,259
You brought your brother's car again? You haven't scrapped it yet?

145
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,719
Why would I? It's still running fine.

146
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:12,079
And it's not my brother's car anymore. It's mine.

147
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,710
He gave it to me.

148
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,009
No, he didn't give it to you. He threw it away to you.

149
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,390
Anyway, I'm fine.

150
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,169
Are you sure you aren't just jealous that I'm a car owner now?

151
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:28,940
I'd love to give you a good kick.

152
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,960
Goodness, she's totally jealous. Goodness.

153
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,939
Take me to Silla Hotel.

154
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,249
Did I tell you that I live in the suite room there?

155
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,489
You don't need to. Get off.

156
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,190
Why? Aren't you here for me?

157
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,630
You know I'm not.

158
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,830
I can't believe Shin Woo Yeo, the great, came to pick her up.

159
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,710
Dam seems even more amazing now.

160
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,599
But how disappointing.

161
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,109
I gave you that advice from the bottom of my heart.

162
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,539
We never had a happy ending whenever we started having feelings.

163
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,929
I told you not to let those petty feelings ruin your life's work.

164
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,299
Did you decide to ignore that?

165
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,319
There's no need for me to ignore anything.

166
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,130
I never had any feelings for her to begin with.

167
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,549
Are you sure she's no different from all the boring people you've met?

168
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,090
Of course.

169
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,230
That's why I'm not going to get conscious.

170
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,100
If I distance myself from her for no reason,

171
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,230
it'll seem more peculiar.

172
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,230
You seem more suspicious with those long excuses.

173
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,340
Stop talking nonsense and get off.

174
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,739
Why? Let's just tell her that we're acquainted.

175
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,279
Let's say we met somewhere else, you know, while clubbing or something.

176
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,130
- Stop joking with me. 
 - I'm not joking.

177
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,510
Drop me off at the hotel.

178
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,440
It's much bigger than I thought.

179
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,220
I've never been in a car like this before.

180
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,459
You'll give me a ride, right?

181
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,680
It's not a big deal for you to drop me off in our relationship.

182
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,730
In our relationship?

183
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,199
Well, I guess we're partners, so yes, I can give you a ride home.

184
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,419
Hop in, Hye Sun.

185
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,410
No, I...

186
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,290
Woo Yeo, you punk. How dare you use your magic on me?

187
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,540
♫  With my head filled with thoughts  ♫

188
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,710
♫  this day passes by  ♫

189
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,429
So why did you suddenly offer to pick me up?

190
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,069
Well, I was passing by, and

191
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,320
it seemed like you have been avoiding me since yesterday.

192
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,410
I thought we talked it out and decided to go back to how things were before.

193
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,799
Actually,

194
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,250
I was in slight confusion over something personal.

195
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,010
A confusion?

196
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,389
It's not a big deal.

197
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:19,480
That's already taken care of, so you don't have to mind it.

198
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,280
I really love Han River.

199
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,180
Why do you love it?

200
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,440
If you eat something by the river, everything becomes twice as delicious.

201
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,009
Especially so with ramyeon you make at a convenience store.

202
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,430
My gosh, really.

203
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,589
While we're on the subject, do you want to stop by the river?

204
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,630
- You haven't eaten yet, right? 
 - I was at a tteokbokki place...

205
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,689
but I didn't eat anything.

206
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,510
Let's go to the river.

207
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,850
This isn't my car. It's my brother's.

208
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,810
I didn't ask.

209
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,399
Anyway, you. Do I make you feel that uncomfortable?

210
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,739
- What? 
 - You can't talk to me or look at me.

211
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,460
What's up with that?

212
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,350
You seem to get along with Dam all right.

213
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,259
Dam and I are besties, that's why.

214
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,860
Really?

215
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,510
What's she like?

216
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,959
She's a great girl. You know how people say, "Like attracts like"?

217
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,640
- I don't. 
 - What?

218
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,100
She's close to me for a reason. I feel comfortable and pleasant with her.

219
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,230
That means you feel uncomfortable and unpleasant around me.

220
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,330
What? No, that's not what I meant.

221
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,039
I don't want you to misunderstand this, so I'll be frank with you.

222
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,020
This is a very heartbreaking story only Dam and I know.

223
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,659
I actually have a goddess trauma.

224
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,150
- A goddess trauma? 
 - Yes.

225
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,129
In high school, I dated this older girl who looked like a goddess,

226
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,410
but she turned out to be a bully.

227
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,998
She asked for ₩50.000 ($50) to save up for our dates, but we never went out once.

228
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:27,299
After three months, I realized she had been ripping me off.

229
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,929
After I realized that, I tried to break up with her,

230
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,170
but she tried to burn me with cigarettes.

231
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,820
So I always remind you of cigarette burns?

232
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,200
Yes.

233
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,800
No, that's not what I meant.

234
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,180
It means you're like a goddess.

235
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,070
It's a compliment.

236
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,980
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

237
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,519
Anyway, I'll do my best to be more comfortable.

238
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,239
I became partners with a goddess like you,

239
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,250
so I just need to overcome my trauma and march forward...

240
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,660
I don't think we can march forward now.

241
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,010
You're right. What's wrong with this car?

242
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,030
It's good.

243
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,479

244
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:54,670
 Dam, you must be spending some quality time with someone special,

245
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,110
 so I'm sorry for messaging you.

246
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,310
 But I wanted to tell you my last goodbye.

247
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,469
 What are you suddenly talking about?

248
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,759
 I was dropping Hye Sun off, then the car broke down.

249
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,720
 So my car is getting towed.

250
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,789
 Hye Sun's face is as pale as a Goryeo celadon, 
  (T/N: Type of ceramics and porcelain produced in ancient Korea)

251
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,820
 and I probably need to take some time off from school.

252
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,730
Goodness, what a foolish kid.

253
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,309
It's Jae Jin.

254
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,989
He feels sorry for Hye Sun about something he did, so he wants to take a leave instead of facing her.

255
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:46,650
He could just stay calm and deal with it.

256
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,590
He gets very nervous around pretty girls.

257
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,449
Right, you have seen Hye Sun at the movie theater, right?

258
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,190
The guys in my department are all crazy about how pretty she is.

259
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,909
Does she look pretty to you, too?

260
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,720
Not at all. You're much prettier.

261
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,640
I am?

262
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,330
I would say I'm the cute type, but not pretty like her.

263
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,750
- You must be kidding. 
 - I mean it.

264
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,590
I'm more serious than ever right now.

265
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,440
Well, really?

266
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,210
I don't think so.

267
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,250
 Why won't you reply?

268
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,940
Sir.

269
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,710
Why don't you use a messaging app?

270
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,140
I never felt the need to use it.

271
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,990
I think you should.

272
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,709
I caught your text message much later

273
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,550
because most people use the messaging app, so I never check my texts.

274
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,570
But I guess I can just remember to check text messages.

275
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,770
- That sounds all right. 
 - Sorry?

276
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,240
It sounds like a good idea to learn to use technology in line with this age.

277
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,200
How do you use this messaging app?

278
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,960
It's... Let me show you.

279
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,400
All done. Take this.

280
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,660
- Right, your profile pic. 
 - Profile pic?

281
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,560
A picture for your profile.

282
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,520
I don't have any photos.

283
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,060
You don't have any photos?

284
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,319

285
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,460
Sir, how can you not have any photos?

286
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,099
I never felt the need to take any.

287
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,830
Then when was the last time you took a photo?

288
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,590
Back during Jungjong's reign in Joseon, I once left behind a portrait.

289
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,220
A portrait?

290
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,040
This isn't good.

291
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,870
Sir, let me take some photos for you.

292
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,080
I'll take the best photos of your life,

293
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,160
so stand over there.

294
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,120
Come on.

295
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,740
Can you smile a little?

296
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,240
No, like this.

297
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,740
A little more.

298
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,110
 Are you sure she's no different from all the boring people you've met?

299
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,370
 Yes.

300
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,370
 This doesn't mean anything.

301
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,230
 Just as it always had been,

302
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,380
 this is another careless relationship that will stay with me for a short while.

303
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:59,380
♫  Again tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking of you. Oh every night  ♫

304
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,160
♫  What am I to you?   ♫

305
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,260
You should check.

306
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,080
♫  I'm curious, please tell me now  ♫

307
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,200
♫  Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper  ♫

308
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,550
I'll take one for you too, Miss Dam.

309
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:22,100
♫  The longer I wait, they'll get deeper. Ask the moon  ♫

310
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,320
♫  Tell me now, how are you doing it?  ♫

311
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,850
 This isn't special.

312
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:38,150
♫  Stare at me now, I wanna be your moon  ♫

313
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,750
Do I look okay? Let me see.

314
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,660
I look much better than I do in person.

315
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:50,950
♫  Still, I’ll hold out my hand. That moon is the door to you  ♫

316
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,510
♫  (your moon, your stars, you)  ♫

317
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:02,470
♫  I wanna be your star (your moon, your stars, you)  ♫

318
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,150
Shall we go home?

319
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,470
The sunset.

320
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,660
It's because of the sunset.

321
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,540
Who was she with?

322
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,130
 What is Dam's type?

323
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,640
 Well, she seems to consider looks,

324
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,060
 but character seems to matter the most.

325
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,010
 In short,

326
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,940
 the good guy type.

327
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,520
Oppa!

328
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,370
Oppa, could you give me just ₩50.000 ($50)?

329
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:58,180
I'll be a good sister who does everything you say. Chu!

330
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,520
Do you think I'll give it to you?

331
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,360
- No. 
 - Then get lost.

332
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
You little... You just said you would be a good sister.

333
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,060
Only if you give me ₩50.000.

334
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,530
Hey.

335
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,460
Let me ask you something.

336
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,160
What?

337
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,500
What does a "good guy" mean exactly?

338
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,270
A guy with a good personality, obviously.

339
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,740
What do I have to do for people to say that to me?

340
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,970
In your case,

341
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,920
- you'll have to be born again. 
 - Why you...

342
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,000
- I'm serious. 
 - Does it look like I'm joking?

343
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,550
To be frank, you look like a player.

344
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,550
What?

345
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,680
- I look like a player? 
 - Yes.

346
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,370
Isn't life as a player your core identity?

347
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,150
Wait, player, core, awesome rhyming.

348
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,160
♪ Life as a player is your core identity ♪

349
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,899
You can't pull that on me again.

350
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:02,540
You won't even give me ₩50.000. Don't call yourself my brother.

351
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,890
That little punk.

352
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,740
Yes, he needs to use it more often to get used to it.

353
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,050
 Sir, have you eaten?

354
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,510
 Don't skip your meal for some coffee, and eat delicious lunch!

355
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,650
 Miss Dam, I hope you enjoy your lunch too.

356
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,870
 Why do you add these shapes at the end of your sentence?

357
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,500
Gosh, I feel like I'm texting an ancestor.

358
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,440
Watch where you're going.

359
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,480
Right, yes. Thank you.

360
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,570
I'm sorry. I had nowhere else to grab on to.

361
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,000
You don't like it when others touch you.

362
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,290
We have to go on two more dates.

363
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,370
- When can you do it? 
 - Whenever is fine.

364
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,990
- Do you want to go anywhere? 
 - Anywhere is fine.

365
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,020
Oh, hey.

366
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,550
Yes, hello.

367
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,910
- Hi. 
 - Hey.

368
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,120
So you're taking a leave? Did you file your request?

369
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,380
- I won't see you starting tomorrow. 
 - Right.

370
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,150
I got paid for the scrap metal after scrapping the car.

371
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,690
I told Hye Sun I'll buy her a meal with that money, so we're cool now.

372
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,920
Oh, right. That's not the problem.

373
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,270
Then what? What's the problem?

374
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,560
I saw this on my way here.

375
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,730
Seon Woo sunbae was totally coming onto Dam, like a bulldozer,

376
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,060
but Dam kept pushing him away like a bouncy ball.

377
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,580
What if Seon Woo gives up on her?

378
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,660
- I told you it's not Seon Woo. 
 - Yes, it's him!

379
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,400
Let's ask them to grab a drink, then we can help them get together.

380
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,070
"If you drink this, it means you two will start dating." 
  (T/N: pun on famous movie quote from A Moment to Remember)

381
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,120
Let's say stuff like that and help them get together.

382
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,490
Let's not do any stuff and stay still, okay?

383
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,440
Why should we stay still? Hey.

384
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,150
- Hurry. Let's call Seon Woo first.
- Hey, stop that!

385
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,120
There's this other guy she likes. I've seen him.

386
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,330
You've seen what?

387
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,370
He didn't seem like just an acquaintance. Her face was...

388
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,870
I think it was the guy she talked to me about, asking for advice.

389
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,420
Advice?

390
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,740
Yes, last week, she was worried

391
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,670
things seemed distant with this person. It seemed quite serious.

392
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,780
Really?

393
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,680
I haven't heard anything.

394
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,810
Why didn't she tell me?

395
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,860
I'm sure there was a reason.

396
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,870
Anyway, we should wait until she tells us.

397
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,670
Don't act like you know something.

398
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,880
Okay? Will you?

399
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,320
Yes, I'll do that.

400
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,800
- Hey, Jae Jin. Want some? 
 - No.

401
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,270
- What's with this cold response? 
 - What about it?

402
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,120
What do you mean? You obviously look annoyed.

403
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,240
Stop piling it up and tell me.

404
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,410
Aren't you the one who should be telling me something?

405
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,960
What?

406
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,760
I'm a little upset.

407
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,029
There is nothing I haven't told you.

408
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:16,020
You know everything about my ex-girlfriend, the ex before that, the one before...

409
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,480
Forget it.

410
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,440
I told you everything I was too ashamed to share with my brother.

411
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,590
But I guess you didn't feel that way.

412
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,700
Bye.

413
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,680
Hey, Jae Jin.

414
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,700
What was that?

415
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,730
- What's with him? 
 - What?

416
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,560
He said I didn't tell him something. What could it be?

417
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,040
I'm... I'm not sure.

418
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,689
Is it how I diluted his soju when he got trashed after Jin Ah dumped him?

419
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:05,259
Or how I pulled out his hair last year after I got trashed?

420
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,170
 Hey, I told you not to get so antsy.

421
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,719

422
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,870
 Whatever, I'm upset. What can I do?

423
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,020
Hi.

424
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,029
What was that?

425
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,220

426
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,100
Hey, Jae Jin. What should we eat for lunch...

427
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,810
Hey, Jae Jin!

428
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,940
Can we talk...

429
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,789
 Hey! Are you seriously doing this?

430
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,820
 What?

431
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,160
"What"?

432
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,400

433
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,669
- Hello? 
  - Hello, my foot.

434
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,029
What's your problem?

435
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,590
- What is it? 
 - You'll pop my eardrum!

436
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,969
Just leave me alone.

437
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,769
Give me some time to be sulky.

438
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,570
Are you getting drafted? Why do you need some time?

439
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,920
What are you disappointed about?

440
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,430
Tell me. Tell me now.

441
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,599
 Darn it!

442
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,720
 You jerk! You idiot!

443
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,800
Are you all right, Miss Dam?

444
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,249
I'm sorry, Sir. That must have been loud.

445
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,369
Is something bad going on?

446
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:23,759
Well, Jae Jin is angry at me, but I don't know why.

447
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,570
I wanted to talk, but he avoids me.

448
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,180
He ignores my texts and hung up on me too.

449
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,470
You two looked very close.

450
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,870
That must be disconcerting.

451
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,730
Yes. As you know, I have a younger brother.

452
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,019
But ever since I met him, I felt like I had two younger brothers.

453
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,340
We were so close like real siblings. Why is he doing this to me?

454
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,930
Sir, will you take a walk with me?

455
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,560
Sure.

456
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,420
Sorry?

457
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:00,950
Why don't we go for some jokbal you love so much?

458
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,800
No, I don't feel like it.

459
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,039
Then how about the archery game we played...

460
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,970
I'm good.

461
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:24,000
- Do you want to grab a drink? 
 - What?

462
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,118
A drink?

463
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:28,368
Humans seem to drink alcohol to forget their problems.

464
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:32,159
I figured you might need that now.

465
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,529
It's okay. I'm not supposed to drink.

466
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:37,190
If I drink, that would be violating the contract.

467
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,738
You haven't been drinking until now,

468
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:43,460
and I'm with you today, so I think it'll be okay.

469
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,019
But still...

470
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,659
Let's go.

471
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,840
Miss Dam, "The Analects" says, 
  (T/N: Ancient Chinese book composed of a large collection of sayings and ideas)

472
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,250
one must stop drinking while one feels good.

473
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,810
I think we should set limits before we start drinking.

474
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,879
How much alcohol can you take?

475
00:35:10,879 --> 00:35:13,140
Seven bottles of soju.

476
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,050
Seven...

477
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,760
Why don't we order just one bottle?

478
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,580
Two.

479
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,249
Are you making a deal with me now?

480
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,189
Well, if we're going to drink anyway,

481
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:29,189
we should drink until we feel good, just like "The Analects" says.

482
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,789
Just a half bottle of soju will hardly touch my organs.

483
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:35,039
But you haven't been drinking for a while, so—

484
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,579
Come on.

485
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,649
I know my liver.

486
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,260
One bottle of soju can't make it drunk.

487
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,159
Ma'am, I'd like to order two bottles of soju and stir-fried cartilage.

488
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,820
Okay.

489
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,250
Cheers.

490
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,419
It's good to finally have some drink.

491
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,340
I thought I wouldn't be able to drink anything for one year.

492
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,010
Miss Dam.

493
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,530
You're not going to pretend to be down whenever you want to drink, are you?

494
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,620
That's a very good tip.

495
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,650
Alcohol is the best.

496
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,969
Sir, do you think I can make up with Jae Jin?

497
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,970
Cheers.

498
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,109
Actually, whatever.

499
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:01,019
What does he want me to tell him?

500
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,950
I said I could drink seven bottles of soju.

501
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,960
Thank you.

502
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,590
Excuse me. I'd like to order some steamed eggs.

503
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:15,189
Gosh, it's hot,

504
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,360
but it's tasty.

505
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,929
Sir, why are you smiling?

506
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,090
Well, watching you fascinates me.

507
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,800
One moment you're happy, the next you're upset.

508
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,670
One moment, you laugh, the next, you frown.

509
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,890
Are you saying I can't control my emotions?

510
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,310
That's not what I'm saying.

511
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,340
I like it.

512
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,310
Miss Dam.

513
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,110
I have lived a long time.

514
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,740
When you live for such a long time,

515
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,030
everything feels like just a season that will eventually pass.

516
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,560
And everything feels meaningless.

517
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:22,970
But you seem true to yourself at every moment.

518
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,180
I like...

519
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,160
your honesty.

520
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,580
I'm in love.

521
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,590
I think I'm in love.

522
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:04,550
I don't know how to describe this feeling.

523
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,770
It's soft and hot.

524
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:21,010
I can't either swallow it or spit it out.

525
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,540
That's how much I'm in love.

526
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,370
♫   All about you   ♫

527
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,010
♫   all about you my love   ♫

528
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:56,260
♫   I want to feel it without saying anything   ♫

529
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:01,220
♫   I want to get   ♫

530
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:05,470
♫  a little closer to you  ♫

531
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,770
♫   That’s how I feel   ♫

532
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:14,210
♫   That’s what I want to do, that’s all   ♫

533
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,030
What? What happened last night?

534
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,500
Right. We drank soju in the street stall

535
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,509
and talked about many things.

536
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,629
Then he said he liked my honesty.

537
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,610
Then I said...

538
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,570
 I'm in love.

539
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,540
 I think I'm in love.

540
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,259
How...

541
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,349
But you were there just now.

542
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,340
I teleported. I haven't done it for a while.

543
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,860
Can we talk for a moment?

544
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,169
No. Let's talk later.

545
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,090
Later in the evening. Actually, tomorrow.

546
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,190
Or a few months later.

547
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,540
It won't take longer than ten minutes.

548
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,020
After hearing what you said last night, I gave it a lot of thought.

549
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,950
Oh, that...

550
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,440
I was just carried away by the mood.

551
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,429
I wasn't serious or anything.

552
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:39,410
Still, if I had known it, I would have been more considerate.

553
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:46,440
I thought about what I could do about it, and I prepared something.

554
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,960
What?

555
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,820
Steamed eggs.

556
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,669
If I had known you liked steamed eggs so much,

557
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:10,420
I would have taken it into consideration when we bought groceries or ate out.

558
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,380
I'm sorry.

559
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,540
 I'm in love.

560
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,460
 I think I'm in love.

561
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,860
 It's soft and hot.

562
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:34,500
 It's so warm, I can't swallow it nor spit it out.

563
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,450
 That's how much I'm in love.

564
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,110
- What's with the face? 
 - Oh. Never mind.

565
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,540
Well, I'm glad he didn't get it.

566
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,880
Please take a look. Thank you.

567
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,489
Sunbae, please take a look.

568
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,040
The more people know about it, the better.

569
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,460
Haven't you heard about it from Dam?

570
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,250
Heard what?

571
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:36,849
I asked Dam to spread the word.

572
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,960
I particularly asked her to tell you about it.

573
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,050

574
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,510
Is she interested in these things?

575
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,830
I guess.

576
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,979
What else is she interested in? Lee Dam.

577
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:54,120
I'm not sure.

578
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,339
Why do you ask?

579
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,410
I'm just curious.

580
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,510
Wait, sunbae.

581
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,700
Did you apologize to Dam for commenting on her appearance?

582
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,820
It's none of your business.

583
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,169
Stop wondering about useless things and make a proper apology.

584
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,859
- Don't muddy the waters here. 
 - What?

585
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,900
Haven't you heard about the rumors that Jang Tae Jin and you

586
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,030
are the only people to avoid?

587
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,790
 Let's make a bet and see if she falls for you, then.

588
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,790
 - Let's make a bet for ₩100.000. 
 - Okay.

589
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,189
Seriously?

590
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,145
- Come on. 
 - Darn it.

591
00:45:51,146 --> 00:45:53,319

592
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,429
- Let's stop it. 
 - Stop what?

593
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,159
- Let's stop the bet. 
 - Okay.

594
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,680
What? Did you start dating her already?

595
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,370
Man, she is one easy girl.

596
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,180
I lost the bet, so let's stop it here.

597
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,149
 You said any time is good, right?

598
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,670
 Let's meet this weekend. I have something to say to you.

599
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:30,930
I have a bigger problem.

600
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,490
Of course, I'm developing feelings for him.

601
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,770
We live together, I can't help it.

602
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,169
I should take the Bead out as soon as possible

603
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:52,300
and leave this house. That's the only way.

604
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,149
A progress report?

605
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,719
Yes. It's Friday today,

606
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,950
and it's been a while since we talked about the Bead.

607
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,170
Because I've been distracted by something else...

608
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,180
By my study. I've been distracted by my study.

609
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,770
So I didn't get to care about the Bead much.

610
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:22,090
Anyway, I wish everything goes back to normal.

611
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,970
Everything.

612
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,910
I see.

613
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,260
That's why.

614
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,670
What?

615
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,140
Was it the Bead that concerned you?

616
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,740
I guess.

617
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,660
Sir,

618
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,760
you haven't found a way to take the Bead out yet, have you?

619
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,810
Not even one clue?

620
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,150
No. Not yet.

621
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,060
 It's a lie.

622
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,140
I'm sorry.

623
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,440
Please give me some more time.

624
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,580
 I'm lying again.

625
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,740
 I don't have to feel bad

626
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,220
 about not telling her that I know the way.

627
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,480
 I have never been that humane.

628
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:32,760
 Not even once.

629
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:38,300
 I have never regretted anything.

630
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,270
 I was just worried because you seemed upset.

631
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,360
 I didn't mean to pressure you.

632
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,530

633
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,930
 It's nothing special.

634
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,380

635
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,410
 Another subhuman and brutal crime,

636
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:01,500
 difficult to believe that a human would commit, has once again

637
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,290
 been repeated today.

638
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,919
 Considering that the crime has been committed in the middle of downtown,

639
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,079
 the abdomen of the corpse has been brutally abused,

640
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,150
 and none of the crimes were caught on CCTV.

641
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:13,220
 The abused parts of the corpse and the MO are identical. 
 (T/N: MO - Modus Operandi, someone's habits of working)

642
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,559
 The police have announced they will carry out the investigation

643
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,539
 based on the assumption it's a serial murderer.

644
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,249
 The deceased...

645
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,200
Could this be...

646
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,530
Did you see the news?

647
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,589
There's something fishy about it.

648
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,269
What do you mean?

649
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:35,260
It doesn't seem like it could have been done by a human.

650
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,010
 Why don't you do some research on it?

651
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:41,689
- Who knows, maybe it's related to us─ 
 - You have many problems,

652
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,990
but your biggest problem is that you stick your nose into everything.

653
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,940
 Sir,

654
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,250
 you haven't found a way to take the Bead out yet, have you?

655
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,760
 I'm sorry.

656
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,270
 Please give me some more time.

657
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,970
 Did something happen to him?

658
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,450
Dam.

659
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,810
What's up? What are you thinking about?

660
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,700
Nothing.

661
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:26,150
Is it because of Jae Jin?

662
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:30,920
Dam.

663
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,150
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

664
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,780
Because of you?

665
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,880
Well...

666
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,290
Actually, I recently saw you getting in someone's car.

667
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:46,410
- What? 
 - And I told Jae Jin about it.

668
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:51,020
You said it was your friend, but we know you.

669
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,870
You were obviously talking about yourself.

670
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,109
But you wouldn't tell us about it and make more secrets from us.

671
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:59,320
And Jae Jin seems upset about it.

672
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,050
I see.

673
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:06,819
By the way, the man you were with that day...

674
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,379
He's the man you talked about before, right?

675
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:12,800
The man you were afraid was avoiding you.

676
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,480
Yes.

677
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,540
How do you know him?

678
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,420
I just know him.

679
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,820
Are you seeing him?

680
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,760
I'm not seeing him.

681
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,180
Actually, I don't know.

682
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,639
I know I shouldn't, but I seem to develop feelings for him.

683
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,940
Why shouldn't you?

684
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,940
I don't know how to explain.

685
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,460
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

686
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,950
Okay.

687
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,680
Since you don't want to talk about it, I won't ask you anymore.

688
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,169
But if you can't even tell if he's someone you're seeing

689
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,640
or someone you just know,

690
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,640
don't like him so much. It's only bad for you.

691
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:18,060
 Now that I think about it, I don't know how to define this relationship.

692
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:23,660
 He's not just someone I know.

693
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,140
 But he's not someone I'm seeing either.

694
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,180
 I might be

695
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:47,230
 some misfortune that happened to him.

696
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,550

697
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,880
 That's awesome.

698
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,679
 Did Seon Woo really give you ₩100.000 ($100)?

699
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,829
 Yes. Earning ₩100.000 ($100) was an open sesame thanks to Lee Dam. It's awesome.

700
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:05,069
I have to say though, I'm disappointed in Seon Woo.

701
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:07,439
He said he could definitely make Dam fall for him.

702
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,520
If he was going to give up so easily, why did he even start the bet?

703
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,280
Even Seon Woo gave up and paid ₩100.000 ($100).

704
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,159
It means Lee Dam has high standards.

705
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,549
- Let's go. 
 - Gosh. Her standards are too high.

706
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:20,821

707
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:23,030
Come on.

708
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,039
Hey, Jae Jin. Enough is enough. Make up with Dam.

709
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,570
Have you seen Gye Seon Woo?

710
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,620
There he is.

711
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,319
Have you lost your mind? Let go.

712
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,930
Did you make a bet on Dam?

713
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,230
Answer me, you punk.

714
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,760
Get your hands off me first.

715
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,810
You did, didn't you?

716
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:03,620
Who do you think you are to make her worth ₩100.000 ($100)?

717
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,350
I regretted it. So I quit it.

718
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,980
Don't tell Dam about it. I will tell her...

719
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,610
Don't you even talk to Dam.

720
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,730
If you regret it, get out of her sight. That would be even better.

721
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,690
Hey. This is not fair though.

722
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:23,150
You're talking as if you're her parent or boyfriend.

723
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,500
You have no right to talk down to me. You've crossed the line.

724
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,159
I crossed the line?

725
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,979
- Jae Jin! 
 - Break it up!

726
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,959
- Hey, hey. 
 - Stop it.

727
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,250
Calm down, talk it out.

728
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:40,170
Keep your boys' mouths shut if you don't want to make a fool out of Dam.

729
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:44,650
What are you talking about?

730
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,410
Why would he make a fool out of me?

731
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,569
Never mind. I don't want to know if it won't do me any good.

732
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,010
I'll just pass by.

733
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:08,770
Dam, wait up.

734
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,390
Lee Dam.

735
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,870
Can we talk for a second?

736
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,050
I'm going to a class.

737
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:33,300
I want to apologize for something.

738
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,049
Spare me one minute.

739
00:56:34,049 --> 00:56:36,369
Whether it's one minute or two, you don't need to hear it.

740
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:39,910
- Let's just go. 
 - Let's see what he has to say.

741
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,110
Okay. Go on.

742
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,800
I'm sorry.

743
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,470
Why?

744
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,760
I...

745
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,040
I bet money on you.

746
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,380
 I should say something.

747
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,020
 I should say I didn't know about you then

748
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:22,150
 nor about my feelings for you.

749
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:26,110
Actually, I felt bad that I judged you

750
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:29,720
only based on the rumors I had heard about you.

751
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:35,240
But I guess I don't need to feel that way anymore.

752
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,220
I wish I never have to see you again.

753
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,460
 This is the next news.

754
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,509
 The police have done an autopsy on the woman in her twenties

755
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,489
 brutally murdered in the middle of downtown,

756
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,429
 and announced that the cause of death was organ damage

757
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:08,729
 and heavy bleeding

758
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,269
 caused by the stab on the abdomen.

759
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,779
 They've concluded that the victim has been stabbed alive

760
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,979
 and based on the shape of the cut on the abdomen,

761
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,650
 it is presumed that she was not attacked with a weapon but bitten,

762
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,839
 which is making this case more and more of a mystery.

763
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,630
 Why don't you do some research on it?

764
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,930
 Who knows if it's related to us...

765
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,720
Miss Dam?

766
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:03,530
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

767
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:07,930
May I ask you something?

768
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:11,200
I'm looking for this place.

769
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,419
It should be in that direction.

770
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,340
Thank you.

771
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,209
Gye Seon Woo, that scum.

772
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,539
It embarrasses me that I was once attracted to him.

773
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,209
Don't you ever answer his call again.

774
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,229
That little ugly twerp.

775
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:15,840
I want to kick him in that stupid butt.

776
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:21,350
Is there an exam for cursing? If there is, you'll get a perfect score.

777
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,529
Why the long face?

778
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,780
You haven't even touched the tripe. It isn't like you.

779
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,649
Are you still upset? Should I go give him a punch?

780
01:00:33,649 --> 01:00:36,570
You know I did judo in high school.

781
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,470
Do you want me to throw you?

782
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,439
You're the one who has been upsetting Dam.

783
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:43,390
Stop acting like you care.

784
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:47,210
To be honest, I was upset.

785
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,939
I mean, the three of us haven't really hung out together lately.

786
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,709
You don't drink with us anymore. You always hurry home.

787
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,089
That I got upset was one thing,

788
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,190
but I was also worried something bad

789
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,120
might have happened to you.

790
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,310
Nothing bad has happened.

791
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,249
See? You're avoiding again.

792
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,500
There are so many things I want to ask you,

793
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:14,840
but I'll wait.

794
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,819
It's frustrating, but I'll wait until you tell me.

795
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:20,410
That's what true friends do.

796
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:24,470
Wow. You're being cheesy.

797
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:28,230
- Just eat the kimchi. 
 - I was going to.

798
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,400
It looks so tasty.

799
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,620
Eat up.

800
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:46,220
 This feels strange.

801
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,390
 Jae Jin and I made up,

802
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,949
 and I'm not offended

803
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,940
 because I didn't expect anything from Seon Woo anyway.

804
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,529
 Just because he thinks I'm only worth ₩100.000 ($100)

805
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:05,360
 doesn't mean I'm actually worth that much.

806
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,580
 That

807
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,100
 Sir might think of me as no one but someone
who made a contract with him,

808
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,830
 or just some misfortune that happened to him...

809
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,950
 That I might be no one to him

810
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,640
 depresses me.

811
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,730
 Where are you, Miss Dam? I'll come to pick you up if it gets late.

812
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,880
Miss Dam.

813
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,540
What are you doing here?

814
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,320
Sir.

815
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,990
I've been sitting here like this since 10 p.m. sharp.

816
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:29,119
Technically, I didn't break the curfew.

817
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,980
Does that matter now?

818
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,280
I said, what are you doing here?

819
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,200
You said you wouldn't worry me.

820
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,980
I'm sorry.

821
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,890
I just

822
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:05,120
didn't want to go home like this.

823
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,490
I really wanted to have some soju,

824
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:16,330
but I didn't because I promised you I wouldn't.

825
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:22,490
Beef tripe goes really well with soju.

826
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:26,550
Did something happen, Miss Dam?

827
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,010
Sir,

828
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:38,830
you said I seemed true to myself at every moment

829
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:42,510
and you liked my honesty.

830
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:48,350
So I'll be honest.

831
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:53,460
You have met many people

832
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,530
and experienced many things, so I'm sure nothing is hard for you.

833
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,350
But I'm not like you.

834
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:06,110
I'm the opposite of cool.

835
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:11,830
We're supposed to be just two people living together by contract,

836
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:14,670
but I can't keep my private and public life separate

837
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,620
because I'm not as cool as you.

838
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:22,330
What I'm saying is,

839
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:29,500
no matter how you think of me,

840
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,920
you are

841
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,530
special and significant to me.

842
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,620
So special that I can give up

843
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:46,110
beef tripe and soju.

844
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,340
 Dishonesty cannot beat honesty.

845
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,610
 Never.

846
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,360
Me too.

847
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,530
Miss Dam, you are

848
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,210
special to me too.

849
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:46,310
♫  Again tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking of you  ♫

850
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,860
♫  Oh every night  ♫

851
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:54,170

852
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:56,370
♫  Please tell me now  ♫

853
01:06:56,370 --> 01:07:00,420
♫  Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper  ♫

854
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:04,860
♫  I’m seeping into you  ♫

855
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:11,500
♫  The longer I wait, they'll get deeper. Ask the moon  ♫

856
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:16,200
♫  Tell me now, how are you doing it?  ♫

857
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,240
♫  My nights are filled with you  ♫

858
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,520

~ Preview ~

859
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,889
 Sir, may I go on a blind date?

860
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:26,069
 Then that should be fine.

861
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,239
 My friends set up the blind date today in case I change my mind.

862
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,460
 - I see. 
 - Give me a smile.

863
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,390
 Again.

864
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:35,599
 Sir, I'm in big trouble now.

865
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,159
 Miss Dam?

866
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,339
 Who are you?

867
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:41,170
 I'm Dam's mother.

868
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:45,410
 I don't want you to give up on what you like.

869
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:46,600
 Is anybody there?

870
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:51,430
 Is it really okay that I don't give up?

871
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:54,940
♫  Now, I wanna be your moon  ♫
