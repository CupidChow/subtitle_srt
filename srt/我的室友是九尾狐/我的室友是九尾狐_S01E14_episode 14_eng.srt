1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:13,350

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,949

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,610

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,340

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,780

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,870

7
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,770
Miss Dam? What brings you here in the middle of the night?

8
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,150
I'm moving in for the time being.

9
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,290
Let's live together again.

10
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,600
I'm going to make you human, Sir.

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,979
Yes. What?

12
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,520
You just said yes, right? I'll use my old room.

13
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,370
I got here, but what now?

14
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,520
 The truth is, human energy is not what dyes the Bead blue.

15
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,179
 Human energy is only a way to appease hunger.

16
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,660
 Something else turns the Bead blue.

17
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,779
 It's humanity.

18
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,430
 Humanity?

19
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,910
 What? Where did he go?

20
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,040
 How can he disappear after only saying that?

21
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,730
 I got you.

22
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,460
 Why did you leave? I wasn't done talking.

23
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,869
 You're... one strong girl.

24
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,850
 You did that last time, too. You can't leave just because you're done talking.

25
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,169
 You've fooled my Sir for almost a thousand years.

26
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,220
 You can't just leave after throwing that mystery at me.

27
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,710
 - There's something I want. 
 - What?

28
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,180
 And you have to make it happen.

29
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,859
May we talk, Miss Dam?

30
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,670
I need to unpack first.

31
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,670
Let's talk first.

32
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,890
Okay.

33
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,500
Fine. There must be a reason why the mountain spirit

34
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,309
only told me.

35
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,250
What do you mean, you're going to make me human?

36
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,469
I already said I can't give you my Bead.

37
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,610
I don't need your Bead.

38
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,569
Then how?

39
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,939
Well, I'll have to find a way

40
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,330
to make you human now.

41
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,420
I guess it's up to you to turn the Bead blue,

42
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,059
but it's up to me to turn you into a decent human.

43
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,940
You don't know a thing about humanity.

44
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,000
So I'll teach you as we live together.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
That's true, but you had said you've grown tired.

46
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,810
- You wanted to live an ordinary life— 
 - I was lying.

47
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,579
- Lying? 
 - I didn't mean it.

48
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,490
You kept avoiding me,

49
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,280
so I went a little too far to hold you back.

50
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,200
I thought I needed to be like a fox in order to catch a fox.

51
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,110
But I think I was wrong.

52
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,730
I only need to be sincere with someone I like.

53
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,490
Then will you give me permission to move in with you?

54
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,439
- But... 
 - Your rejection is rejected.

55
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,549
Life isn't that complicated.

56
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,460
Let's think about it in a simple way and just do it.

57
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,510
Please?

58
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,540
It looks like you're saying okay.

59
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,260
This means you gave me permission.

60
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,560
It's late, so let's continue later.

61
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,520
Goodnight.

62
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,890
Miss Dam.

63
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,640
Can we both sleep in the living room?

64
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,950
What?

65
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,270
I just want to fall asleep while chatting with you.

66
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,320
There's no blanket in that room either.

67
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,780
No?

68
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,120
That's the face that always makes me say yes.

69
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,620
What did you tell your brother?

70
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,270
I said I'll be staying at Soo Kyeong's.

71
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,480
Oh, and

72
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,919
about how Jae Jin fell down the stairs—

73
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,830
I know it wasn't you.

74
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,370
I can figure out that much.

75
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,170
I love it.

76
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,710
Sorry?

77
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,980
How you trust me.

78
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,490
And how you're here by my side. I love it.

79
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,400
And? What else do you love?

80
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,300
How you ask me if I slept well.

81
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,100
And

82
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,460
how you eat anything deliciously.

83
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,800
And

84
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,690
your smile.

85
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:44,470
What about you?

86
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,290
In my case,

87
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,180
when we first started living together,

88
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,589
I said I was craving yum woon sen, and even though you don't eat any food 
  (T/N: Thai Glass Noodle Salad )

89
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,769
you went out and searched all over the neighborhood to get me some.

90
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,160
I was pretty touched back then.

91
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,820
Right, when I had bad period cramps,

92
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,380
you went out for the dating project in my place.

93
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,930
And

94
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,459
when I was worried about my future,

95
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,740
you took me to a museum and comforted me.

96
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,250
In times like those, I thought you were much more humane than I am.

97
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,620
Please continue to show me those sides.

98
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:32,000
If we start with such little things, this might work.

99
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,790
Such little things?

100
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,559
Oh, I meant that I hope we can continue to get along.

101
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,939
This isn't a good idea.

102
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,889
Why not? We're an item now.

103
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,280
If we stay apart, we're no different than before.

104
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,679
But what if I take your energy...

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,190
Gosh, stop going on and on about my energy.

106
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,969
- I'm worried I might get you in danger. 
 - You won't.

107
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,160
We'll be fine, so let's go to sleep.

108
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,960
Goodnight.

109
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,570
 This definitely seems dangerous.

110
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,770
 No.

111
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,340
 Think about something else. Think good thoughts.

112
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,940
 Shin Woo Yeo, think about something else. Yes, something good.

113
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,310

114
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,500
Good morning, did you sleep well?

115
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,120
Hey. Yes, I slept well.

116
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,880
You don't look like you did.

117
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,530
You seem very tired.

118
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,970
No, I slept enough.

119
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,209
Anyway, your house is so huge,

120
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,499
so I was a little scared when I slept alone here.

121
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,910
But it wasn't scary at all to sleep next to you.

122
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,439
- Can we do this every single day─ 
 - No.

123
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,810
One day of this torture was enough.

124
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,880
What torture?

125
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,020
Wait, did I snore?

126
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,180
No, it's not...

127
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,240
It's not that you snored.

128
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,930
- It was teeth grinding. 
 - What?

129
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,740
It's okay. It can happen.

130
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,399
I ground my teeth so badly to the point it was torture?

131
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,140
This makes me gnash my teeth.

132
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes?

133
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,830
Miss Dam?

134
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,289
Oh, I knew something seemed missing.

135
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,190
That's what.

136
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,310
I'm glad you're here.

137
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,320
I was very anxious that our relationship

138
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,400
might end there.

139
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,260
I prepared breakfast.

140
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,970
Come on out.

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,489
Yes. Let me think of a way to make him human quickly,

142
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,780
so this happiness can last a long time.

143
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,460
What is he missing?

144
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,440
 Wait, he prepared breakfast with his awful cooking skills?

145
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,750
It's ramyun.

146
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,859
I remembered how you had this from the morning,

147
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,239
so I prepared this only according to the recipe, without any fault.

148
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,020
- Is this okay? 
 - Of course.

149
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,160
 Wait, is he trying to share one bag?

150
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,979
 Perhaps he hasn't become human because of the inhumane thought

151
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,290
 that two could share one bag...

152
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,400
I already made jjajang ramyun.

153
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,740
You seem to enjoy many flavors.

154
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,099
 He has such a perfect character.

155
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,660
 There's absolutely no flaw about him.

156
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,290
Take a seat.

157
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,810
So what kept him from becoming a human to this day?

158
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,580
He's thoughtful, and he knows what's right and wrong.

159
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,420
What does humanity actually contain?

160
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,619

161
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,720

162
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,609
 The reason why the Korean word for "human" is a mix of "person" and "relationship",

163
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,589
 is because humans are born in relationships between people,

164
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,080
 and they are beings that must live in various relationships with other people.

165
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,420
Beings that must live in relationships with other people.

166
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,360
- Hello, Professor Shin. 
 - Hello.

167
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,970
Are you here to find research material?

168
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,770
Yes, something like that.

169
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,809
It seems like he gets along well enough with other people.

170
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,330
Professor, if you haven't had lunch, do you want to join us?

171
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,060
I can't.

172
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,800
Not too well, I guess.

173
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,729
   Dam, when are we meeting for the club?

174
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,350
   Aren't we making the outline of the magazine?

175
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,829
 Actually, I was looking for some materials in the library.

176
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,770
 Let's have our meeting today. I'll head to the club room now.

177
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,680
Gosh, how can I find a way?

178
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,480
- A way to do what? 
 - My goodness.

179
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,899
You startled me!

180
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,439
Is something bothering you?

181
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,040
No.

182
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,749
Right, I might be a little late today.

183
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,010
I have to be at a club meeting.

184
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,360
I wanted to go home together.

185
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,649
I'll be home right after.

186
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,460
See you at home.

187
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,460
"See you at home"?

188
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,430
Why are you two here?

189
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,180
You said you were at the library. We were nearby, so we came for you.

190
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,509
Anyway, what do you mean,

191
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,520
you'll see him at home?

192
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,780
Well, it's...

193
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,490
We're going to make the magazine at his place.

194
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,440
At his place?

195
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,500
All of us?

196
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,610
Yes, all of us.

197
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,909
He has lots of references at home,

198
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,850
so he'll show those books to us as the professor in charge of our club.

199
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,740
Really?

200
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,749
- Thank you, Professor. 
 - Thank you.

201
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,390
You're a true educator.

202
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,300
Thank you.

203
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,350
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

204
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,250
All right.

205
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,190
This is nice, isn't it?

206
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,499
Professor, with all due respect,

207
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,550
please excuse us.

208
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,480
Thank you.

209
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,649
Sir, once we get there, I'll take them to a convenience store.

210
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,710
Can you move my stuff while we're gone?

211
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,230
Hey.

212
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,049
I know they're your friends, but I can't let them come to my house.

213
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,910
But they ended up hearing me say that.

214
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,689
Dam, aren't you getting in?

215
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,380
I'm coming.

216
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,598
 Okay, then he'll get to experience

217
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,659
 different relationships with people...

218
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,899
It's a chance of a lifetime.

219
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,269
Not everyone gets invited to the professor's home.

220
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,939
I won't lose this chance

221
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,240
and get closer to him.

222
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,280
Do I have to go though?

223
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,320
Why not? Does your leg hurt?

224
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,929
I just don't really like him.

225
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,530
You don't? Why not?

226
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,019
I just don't like

227
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,570
how formal he is and how he lacks the human touch.

228
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,259
He lacks the human touch?

229
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,369
He's right. Other professors

230
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,059
sometimes buy drinks for students, take questions from us,

231
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,379
and give us career advices too.

232
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,690
But Professor Shin always dashes back to his office, as soon as he's done with his lecture.

233
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,550
He does lack the human touch.

234
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,569
But if he invited us to his home,

235
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,960
then maybe he does have the human touch.

236
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,149
He just might be awkward around people.

237
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,259
Let's keep an open mind and be nice,

238
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,109
showing the love between a teacher and pupils,

239
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,250
and what it means to live together in different relationships.

240
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,820
What? Why are you getting all grand?

241
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,779
Hey, so what do you think his place is like?

242
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,069
Will it be refined and modern just as he seems?

243
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,430
Or will it be simple and small?

244
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,040
Let's go.

245
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,870
Gosh, thank you.

246
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,720
My gosh, is this happening for real?

247
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,760
Look at this place.

248
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,640
Thank you for having us, Professor.

249
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,170
This is for you.

250
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,089
Then let's go to the study.

251
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,630
Yes.

252
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,080
- Where are you going? 
 - What?

253
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,390
It felt like that was the study.

254
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,189
Is that your study?

255
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,259
I want to know if my gut feelings are right.

256
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,000
You do have great gut feelings.

257
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,750
That is my study.

258
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,390
Let's go.

259
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,770
Wait.

260
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,680
Dam, isn't this yours?

261
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,769
It's not. That's not mine.

262
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,550
You do have something like this.

263
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,190
Look at this.

264
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You were wearing it then.

265
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,930
Wait.

266
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,730
If Dam's badge was found here, it means...

267
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,550
Professor Seo also uses that bookstore.

268
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,610
You only go to that one bookstore for your history books.

269
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,180
I thought this was a limited-edition.

270
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,659
She must be as quick as you are.

271
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,170
Right?

272
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,669
Why are you bringing her up now?

273
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,210
- Then why else would it be... 
 - Yes, that's enough.

274
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,650
Let's go.

275
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,570
What's this?

276
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,490
"Sir, I'm leaving first. See you tonight."

277
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,070
"Sir"?

278
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,330
I've heard that pet name before.

279
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,190
Wait.

280
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,330
Isn't that your boyfriend's pet name?

281
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,659
What?

282
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,770
That means...

283
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,099
I guess that pet name is trending.

284
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,960
I want to make my own Sir, too.

285
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,409
Anyway, it's funny to think

286
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,020
that Professor Seo would call you Sir.

287
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,320
Sir.

288
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,079
- Ms. Soo Kyeong? 
 - Yes?

289
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,399
Let's cut the small talk and go to the study.

290
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,189
Yes, guys. Let's go.

291
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,160
Come on.

292
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,529
Then let's use this reference here,

293
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:24,770
and have the return of cultural assets as our theme.

294
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,930
Think of the details by next time.

295
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,160
- Okay. 
 - Okay. Great work.

296
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,829
Are you all done?

297
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,579
Yes, thanks to the great materials you let us use as reference, we ended...

298
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:41,950
Then let's wrap things up now, yes?

299
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,090
 He can't let them go yet.

300
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,420
But since we're all here already,

301
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,680
why don't we have a get-together?

302
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,460
- A get-together? 
 - Yes.

303
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,309
Other professors let us ask questions on history

304
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:01,000
and give us advice on careers too.

305
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,440
Do you have anything to ask him or any requests to make?

306
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,960
No?

307
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,750
Professor Shin.

308
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,150
Could you use less Chinese characters in your lectures?

309
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,389
I mean, you use the most Chinese characters in your lectures,

310
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:26,040
so it's tough for everyone.

311
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,400
We find it even harder than Professor Irritating.

312
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,829
Professor Irritating?

313
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:32,099
We had a professor like that?

314
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,739
It's Professor Oh's new nickname.

315
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,329
No matter where you meet him,

316
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,230
he's awfully annoying and irritating,

317
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,770
so Professor Irritating. 
  (T/N: abbreviation sounds like actor Park Bo Gum)

318
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,760
Anyway, everyone is a bit scared of Professor Oh,

319
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,489
but recently, more people

320
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:50,419
have been saying your lecture is even tougher than his.

321
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,760
So could you use less Chinese characters?

322
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,880
- Mr. Do Jae Jin. 
 - Yes?

323
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,370
The word research is derived

324
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,820
from an old French word, "recherche", which means "to go about seeking."

325
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,429
If you're a history major,

326
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,210
it means you wanted to gain a deep understanding in this field.

327
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,489
In order to examine historical documents accurately,

328
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:17,470
isn't the use of Chinese characters a given?

329
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,530
Isn't that so?

330
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,490
You're right.

331
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,769
Soo Kyeong, do you have any questions for him?

332
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,360
Of course, I do.

333
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,589
Professor Shin.

334
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,709
I have many deep concerns

335
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,670
regarding historical matters as the top student of the department.

336
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,940
And while we're on the subject, may we stay for dinner?

337
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,470
What does history have to do with dinner?

338
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,389
 RIght, a meal.

339
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,909
 Now that I think about it, I've never seen him eat with anyone else other than me.

340
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,770
You should go home and eat.

341
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,890
Let's have dinner, Professor.

342
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,769
- What? 
 - Well,

343
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,549
an old adage says you must always treat your guests.

344
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,650
It means you should eat and drink with your guests

345
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,899
as you all cultivate your virtue.

346
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,839
How can a virtuous man like you

347
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,010
let us go home on an empty stomach?

348
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,490
And life is all about meat. How's meat for dinner?

349
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,150
Sounds great.

350
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,380
Man, it does look good.

351
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,420
Is it hot enough?

352
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,559
I just threw it out there,

353
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,219
but I can't believe I'm grilling pork neck here.

354
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,450
Right? Doesn't he seem more humane and a better person than we thought?

355
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,129
Professor Shin, join us. Let's eat together.

356
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,160
I'm boiling water for ramyun.

357
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,179
We have so much meat, though. Why are you making ramyun?

358
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,730
You always need ramyun with meat.

359
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,379

360
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,330
What is this?

361
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,269
Is it your ex-boyfriend?

362
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,780
No, a spam message.

363
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,819
Ex-boyfriend?

364
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:03,519
You said there's trouble, but you didn't say you broke up.

365
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,250
Well, it's, you know...

366
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,630
My boyfriend and I are back together.

367
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,230
Hey! You can't do that.

368
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,300
You can't date a jerk like him.

369
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,649
A jerk? Don't be so harsh.

370
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,019
Harsh?

371
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,479
You can't tell me where you met this jerk and what he does.

372
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,959
You can't even tell us how darned old that jerk is.

373
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,349
Is he a con man? Is he wanted?

374
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:29,739
Why does he make you so shady?

375
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,139
Enough, stop it. What's with you?

376
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:33,840
Stop what?

377
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,159
Hey, I wasn't going to be this harsh,

378
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,699
but the day you two broke up, you looked so devastated,

379
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:39,899
so I texted him

380
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,589
pretending to be you, and asked him to come for you to the club.

381
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,830
But what happened? He ghosted you. He never came.

382
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,889
Most guys would come for you if you told them you were drunk at a club.

383
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,089
That jerk sounds really cold-hearted.

384
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,609
Yes, that's what that jerk is like.

385
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,820
No, he's a really nice guy.

386
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,309
If he's such a nice guy, why did you curse him saying he's a fox?

387
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,599
- When did I do that? 
 - When you got wasted,

388
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,149
you went over to a guy in a fox costume and said,

389
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,300
"I could understand everything."

390
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,289
"I could even deal with the fact that you're a fox."

391
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,929
You said that.

392
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,829
Not only is he cold-hearted, he's as sly as a fox.

393
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:20,480
Did you always pay for his meals, while he never bought you a present?

394
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,510
Don't date a jerk like him.

395
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,369
Yes, call him right now and tell him to forget about getting back together, and that you're through.

396
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:26,390
Enough!

397
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,430
That's enough boiling water.

398
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,289
Please enjoy your dinner.

399
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,460
I need to vent my anger...

400
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,600
I mean, I need to get some beer.

401
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,930
Eat up.

402
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,200
Were we a bit too agitated before him?

403
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,869
- You were way too loud. 
 - You were loud.

404
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,700
No, her.

405
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,460
- Gosh. 
 - Fire...

406
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,149
Professor Irr... I mean, Professor Oh Sang Chul.

407
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:26,339
I heard Professor Shin was having fun with the students,

408
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,720
so I decided to stop by.

409
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,569
I see. Professor, have you had dinner?

410
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:35,110
- We were... 
 - Wait, one second.

411
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,780
Ground pepper.

412
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,560
This is perfect timing to learn some more about pepper.

413
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,010
Don't you think so?

414
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,430
Do you know who brought pepper to Korea and how it was popularized?

415
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,620
There's a record on pepper in the old writings of "Pahanjib."

416
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,910
Wait, one second.

417
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,809
The knowledge you gain easily will be forgotten easily.

418
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:10,940
Therefore, you should turn in a report on this subject.

419
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,429
- Here, you can take this. 
 - Yes, sir.

420
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,600
Grab a seat.

421
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,350
Wait, one second.

422
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,100
A silver spoon.

423
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,940
This is perfect timing to learn some more about silver spoons, right?

424
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,339
There are many anecdotes about how kings in the past used silver spoons

425
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,679
in an attempt to avoid getting poisoned to death.

426
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,520
You should turn in a report of those historical anecdotes.

427
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,580
- May I... 
 - Yes, of course. Please.

428
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,960
Okay.

429
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,840
Right, from what I heard, students have been calling me

430
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,419
Professor Irritating, Professor Park Bo Gum, recently.

431
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,869
What's the reason?

432
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,779
- It's... 
 - It's because...

433
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,259
Yes, it's because you are irritatingly handsome, just like the actor Park Bo Gum

434
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,030
so we've been calling you that as you look so much like him!

435
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,030
It's just as I expected.

436
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,060
Yes, of course.

437
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,959
- Goodness. 
 - In that case,

438
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:29,529
would you turn in a report regarding how much I resemble him?

439
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:32,770
Of course, it's already a proven theory.

440
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,380
I slept so well last night! 
  (T/N: parody of Park Bo Gum's bed commercial)

441
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,370
Gosh, this is hilarious.

442
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,320
Wait, one second.

443
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,779
- Glass craft. 
 - Professor Oh!

444
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,260
I have to be in a TOEIC class, so please excuse me.

445
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,539
Me too. I have to take my medicine.

446
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,650
- Yes, I should get going. 
 - Wait, one second.

447
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,270
Miss Dam.

448
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,340
Sir?

449
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,830
Wait, did you just use shapeshifting to kick out my friends?

450
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,280
Why?

451
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,390
Sir.

452
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,329
Please don't mind what my friends said.

453
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,310
They got worried about me, so they overreacted.

454
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,710
But Miss Dam, there were plenty of good things I did for you too.

455
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,850
Just as you said yesterday, I bought what you wanted to eat,

456
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,509
helped you with your report when you were sick, took you to the museum,

457
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,740
and even helped you make kimchi.

458
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,690
Why didn't you tell them that?

459
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,200
Exactly. I never had a chance to tell them that much about you.

460
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,490
If we ever get together again,

461
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,980
I'll make sure they don't say anything like─

462
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,619
No, we won't do anything like this again.

463
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,139
What? Why not?

464
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,659
I liked seeing you associate with other people.

465
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,339
We said we'll do many things that humans do.

466
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,880
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

467
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,810
Wait.

468
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,530
Come on, Sir. Sir! Please?

469
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,620
Come on, Sir.

470
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,770
Can't you do this for me? Please?

471
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,590
I have everything planned out.

472
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,060
Aren't you cold?

473
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,729
What? The heater is on, so not at all.

474
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,420
You seem a little cold.

475
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,890
What are you doing?

476
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,090
I don't want you to catch a cold.

477
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,590
What?

478
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,270
 What is he doing?

479
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,010
Why did he give me these things, I'm not cold.

480
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,060
This is way too hot. Gosh.

481
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,140
Did this plan just fall through?

482
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,640
No matter how much I think about him, he doesn't seem different from Hye Sun.

483
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,460
But how did she make it while he couldn't...

484
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,960
Yes, Hye Sun.

485
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,300
I had Hye Sun as a model example.

486
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,319
Jae Jin, isn't it about time to take your medicine?

487
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,040
Yes, you're right.

488
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,920
Wait.

489
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,920
Here it is.

490
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,540
Hye Sun, you know, this injury is uncomfortable,

491
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,889
but I like how I got hurt.

492
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,519
Why are you happy about that?

493
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,649
But still, you've been worried about me ever since I got hurt.

494
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,380
So I'm glad I got hurt.

495
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,430
- Hye Sun, I'll take my medicine. 
 - Okay.

496
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,750
Hye Sun, can the three of us eat dinner together later tonight?

497
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,289
The three of us?

498
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,139
Do you have to be the third wheel?

499
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,519
Not with him. You, me, and my Sir.

500
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,469
I don't want to. I'm not going to see Woo Yeo anymore.

501
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,189
There's no way he could be a human.

502
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,880
How can he push Jae Jin down the stairs?

503
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,639
Then he completely denied the charges.

504
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,669
He really didn't push him.

505
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,349
I know he did. I still have my sixth sense.

506
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,739
I could feel some kind of mysterious force pushing Jae Jin down.

507
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,160
There's no one else who could use such magic...

508
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,229
You're right. It was the mountain spirit.

509
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,609
He got hurt just as I did before.

510
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,509
What? That darned old man.

511
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,249
Calm down. So apologize to him, undo the misunderstanding,

512
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,970
and try to get along with him.

513
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,950
I've never said I'm sorry to him.

514
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:12,530
Not even once.

515
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,159
 All right. Let's keep the answer sheet next to me,

516
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,980
 and see what the difference is.

517
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,259
I'd like to order two club sandwiches and one shrimp sandwich.

518
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,799
Which bread would you like to have?

519
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:28,009
Honey oat for the club sandwiches

520
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:31,280
- and white bread for the shrimp sandwich. 
 - Okay.

521
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,100
You see, we didn't meet up to eat sandwiches today.

522
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,070
Hye Sun, you said you had something to say to him.

523
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,440
The thing is, I told her it wasn't you who pushed Jae Jin.

524
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,830
Hey, Woo Yeo.

525
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,660
I'm so...

526
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,990
So...

527
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,910
Do they have soy milk too?

528
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,600
I guess they don't.

529
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,720
Sir, it looks like Hye Sun wants to say sorry.

530
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,100
Why don't you say something?

531
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,160
Well, it's o...

532
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,110
It's o...

533
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,400
It's okay, Miss Dam. This is unnecessary.

534
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,320
Why did you invite Hye Sun, by the way?

535
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,389
 They're exactly the same.

536
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,710
 I don't see any difference.

537
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,919
It looks like we're all finished. Shall we go?

538
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,339
Right? That sounds good.

539
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,210
No! It hasn't even started yet.

540
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,290
Start?

541
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,020
I mean, the reconciliation.

542
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,290
You didn't get to make up with each other yet.

543
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,879
Why don't we go grab a drink?

544
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,710
Alcohol is the best solution when it comes to reconciliation.

545
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,330
Is everything going all right at school?

546
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,649
Of course, Dad.

547
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,849
Though I could use a bit more money to buy workbooks.

548
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:06,070
I'm not asking you, Seo Woo. I was asking Seon Woo.

549
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,979
Well, I'm doing my best.

550
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:13,920
Why did you even start studying history if you wanted to work for my company?

551
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,980
You should have gone study abroad.

552
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,569
You keep saying that.

553
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,340
You know how much he hates to hear that.

554
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,230
I'll go.

555
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,110
Really? Are you really going?

556
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,680
What happened? Why did you suddenly change your mind?

557
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,180
You said it felt like you're forced to go and you hated it.

558
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,780
Butt out.

559
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,750
It's because of her, right?

560
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,000
- The sister of that boy named Lee Dan. 
 - What?

561
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,299
That day, when you picked on me at the police station,

562
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,940
your eyes were fixed on her.

563
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,890
So I figured out what's going on.

564
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,899
But it looks like she dumped you.

565
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,800
That's just part of the reason...

566
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,410
Forget it.

567
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,370
You see, if you have regrets, why don't you try one last time?

568
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,040
I don't have regrets.

569
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,370
Cheers.

570
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,400
It's so nice to drink all together. Don't you think?

571
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,980
It is kind of nice to have some makgeolli after a while.

572
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,240
This reminds me of the time

573
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,449
when I dated Lord Kim's third son.

574
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,909
He made straw shoes for me and gave me chocolate.

575
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:41,870
He was so sweet.

576
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,559
Did they have chocolate back then?

577
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,279
You were all excited, saying noblemen are indeed different.

578
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:48,570
Wasn't it in the 1600s though?

579
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,590
It was.

580
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,150
I thought chocolate was imported in the 1800s.

581
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,350
Maybe it was taffy then.

582
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,140
Come on. It was centuries ago. I was confused.

583
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,789
Anyway, it's nice to see you guys reminiscing about the same time period.

584
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,970
You are old friends, right?

585
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:15,810
Speaking of which, why don't you save her phone number?

586
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,680
What? You haven't saved my number yet?

587
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,680
I saved your number. Look.

588
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,330

589
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,570
What? Did you save me as "Pox"?

590
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,880
What about it? You are a "pox" after all.

591
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,680
You spelled it wrong.

592
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,550
It's not "pox, it's "fox".

593
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,940
F. O. X. Fox.

594
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,800
What?

595
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,730
Well... I know. It's just a typo.

596
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,840
You're such an ungrateful smarty-pants.

597
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,590
I even held your hand to share my energy because you seemed so shaky.

598
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,140
And how dare you treat me like this?

599
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,049
It was just to get some energy.

600
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:07,890
There's nothing to worry about.

601
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,679
Well, seeing your relationship,

602
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,840
I wouldn't worry about anything even if you were holding each other tight.

603
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,770
That's great.

604
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,400
What? What is it?

605
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,070
I don't like those mean-looking fox eyes.

606
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,059
Stop fighting.

607
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,279
Still, you guys have been relying on each other for such a long time.

608
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,500
She was more of a weed to me.

609
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,439
Things were much easier without her.

610
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,939
Same here.

611
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,680
I would have been much happier without him.

612
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,769
What an ungrate bastard.

613
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:48,250
You mean, "ingrate", not "ungrate".

614
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,100
It's "ingrate".

615
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,039
My, you're really smart.

616
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,339
Is that why you haven't become a human yet?

617
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,179
- You have a problem with that? 
 - I can't hear you.

618
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:57,759
- Stop talking like that. 
 - Keep talking.

619
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:59,309
 - They're the same.  
 - I'm much older than you.

620
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:03,770
 They've lived hundreds of years, but they're more childish than children.

621
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,029
 What in the world is the difference between

622
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:07,939
 taking off a jacket because of the sun

623
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,610
 and taking off a jacket because of wind?

624
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,520
From now on, please never organize a meet-up with Hye Sun.

625
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,119
I won't. Thanks for trying anyway.

626
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,840
Though it wasn't that fruitful.

627
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,590
Miss Dam.

628
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,170
Is there another reason why you want to live with me again?

629
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,060
What?

630
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,760
You suddenly made me spend time with your friends,

631
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,809
organized today's meet-up,

632
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:46,069
and said things like "you had a plan but it didn't turn out fruitful",

633
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:48,350
which I find a bit strange.

634
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:51,890
What do you mean, strange? There's no other reason.

635
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,440
It's cold. Let's go.

636
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,199
- What? 
 - Isn't that Dam and Professor Shin?

637
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,210
Wow. Daebak.

638
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,810
Take a photo of them.

639
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,780
- But why? 
 - This is unbelievable.

640
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:19,610
Gosh. He's really quick-witted like a fox.

641
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,720
Should I just tell him the truth?

642
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,230
No.

643
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,290
It might only confuse him.

644
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,850
Gosh, I'm so tired.

645
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,520
"A History Professor and A Student Spotted on a Date".

646
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,880
Add, "Shocking News".

647
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,330
Okay. "Shocking News".

648
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,949
I can't believe this.

649
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,879
How could she do this behind everyone?

650
00:42:46,879 --> 00:42:49,320
I knew it.

651
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,100
- Should I post it? 
 - Yes.

652
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,090

653
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,049
Hey, did you read that post on Everyday Time?

654
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,660
No. Did something interesting happen?

655
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,390
Well...

656
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,110
Someone posted such a heartbreaking confession of love.

657
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,410
Here.

658
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,399
"I first met him two years ago when I was a freshman."

659
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:18,200
"I told him how much I loved his warm smile,"

660
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,949
"but he dumped me brutally."

661
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:22,959
"It hurt me and I have been mean to him since."

662
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:25,479
"But in fact, I still like him."

663
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,320
"I'm sure he doesn't know how I feel."

664
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,070
Is that about our Jung Seok Sunbae?

665
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,899
What in the... There's nothing interesting about it.

666
00:43:35,899 --> 00:43:39,540
You're such a horrible actress. I know you wrote this.

667
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,480
What are you saying?

668
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,230
Stop acting like it's not you.

669
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,449
I have always wondered why you hated him for no reason.

670
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,510
I guess it's because he turned you down when you were a freshman.

671
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,719
Wait. When we played truth or dare,

672
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:53,539
you said you used to like one of us there.

673
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:56,309
And Jung Seok, Seon Woo, and I were

674
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,579
the only men there.

675
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,039
It's definitely you.

676
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,799
Jeez! I said it wasn't me!

677
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:01,939
"It wasn't me!"

678
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,889
Hey, did you read that new post on Everyday Time?

679
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:09,230
That's... really not me.

680
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,659
What are you talking about?

681
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,029
We're talking about the photo of Professor Shin and Dam.

682
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:14,900
He's right.

683
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,470
Didn't you know about this?

684
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,790
Let's go.

685
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,019
I thought they were friends.

686
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,249
I guess not.

687
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,660
What...

688
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,270
- Hey, look for that post. 
 - We were looking at the wrong post.

689
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,190
Seon Woo!

690
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,220
Sunbae, I thought there was something going on between you and Dam.

691
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,339
What are you talking about?

692
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:43,219
I mean, she has a boyfriend, so I've always wondered

693
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:44,840
why she would always get involved with you.

694
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,709
And that boyfriend of hers turned out to be a professor.

695
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,929
- She must have lost her mind. 
 - I know.

696
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:52,280
Where did you hear that?

697
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,859
Hey, are these two really going out?

698
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,369
Isn't it obvious?

699
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:59,530
Their arms are linked. They're definitely going out.

700
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,509
I thought Dam was dating Seon Woo.

701
00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:03,119
Wait a moment.

702
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,150
Didn't Professor Shin get involved in a scandal with Professor Seo?

703
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:08,979
Right. It's a love rectangle then.

704
00:45:08,979 --> 00:45:10,480
It's so confusing.

705
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,599
Hey, maybe we should share this in our group chat.

706
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,750
Good idea. Go on and do it.

707
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,519
You know both taking photos in secret and spreading the photos are wrong.

708
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,339
You should refrain from talking behind others' back

709
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:26,109
if you don't really know about it.

710
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:28,929
Come on, guys. It's fun.

711
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,490
You were surprised to see it too.

712
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,149
You call yourselves her true friends. How could you not know?

713
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,149
Do we have to?

714
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:36,040
Dam is a grown-up. She knows what she's doing.

715
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,809
Is there a problem?

716
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,889
Of course, there is. She takes his class.

717
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,009
- It's a big problem. 
 - You're right.

718
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,440
What if he only gives her good grades because they're dating?

719
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,759
- That wouldn't be fair. 
 - That's not acceptable.

720
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,850
It just doesn't make sense that a student goes out with a professor.

721
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,760
Hey, Dam is here.

722
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,730
What's going on here?

723
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,790
This is just unbelievable.

724
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,020
You were the ones who took the photo?

725
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,089
You should be professional paparazzis.

726
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,159
When did they start dating?

727
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,760
After Professor Shin started working here, obviously.

728
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,479
Seriously though, how could she even think of dating a professor?

729
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,739
Wait. Did he volunteer for the club

730
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,499
- for his girlfriend? 
 - Yes.

731
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,930
- Gosh, even my heart flutters. 
 - Do you even hear yourself?

732
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,560
Guys, enough already.

733
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,169
- Goodness. 
 - What's enough?

734
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,119
How could a professor date a student?

735
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,500
Even if he could,

736
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,249
he shouldn't date someone who takes his class.

737
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,239
Come on. They're both adults.

738
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,949
I just feel bad for Seon Woo.

739
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,420
- Right. 
 - Dam.

740
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,950
Hey, Dam. Is that true? What about Seon Woo?

741
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,930
How did you seduce a professor?

742
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,809
We were dating even before he became a professor here.

743
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,570
I didn't know he'd be teaching my major here.

744
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:00,249
And about the club, I heard it was decided by the professors at a meeting.

745
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:03,179
I see. So there's no problem with it?

746
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,549
Who cares?

747
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:07,139
Who knows if he'll give you good grades because you're dating him?

748
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,890
She has a good point.

749
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,050
I'll drop the class.

750
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,940
Dam, we're having our final soon.

751
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,679
It will be wasting a whole semester of studying.

752
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:19,069
It's better than misunderstandings like this.

753
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:22,110
Now everything is okay, right? I should get going now.

754
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,020
Right. Jeon Da Young, Seo Jin.

755
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,150
Delete the photo.

756
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,319
- That little... 
 - Hey. Hey. Hey.

757
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,999
It was kind of mean of you to post the photo online.

758
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:38,180
Shut it.

759
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,340

760
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,380

761
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,080
What is it you wanted to say?

762
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,140
It's about you and the professor.

763
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,439
There are rumors about it in our department. Someone saw you.

764
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,690
I know.

765
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,620
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

766
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,610
I mean, why are you dating someone like him?

767
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,940
Don't the rumors about him bother you?

768
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,130
It's none of your business.

769
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,069
I know you don't care about what others say,

770
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,949
but people will talk about you behind your back.

771
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,560
And...

772
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,070
some will talk about me as well.

773
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,790
It's my fault. I shouldn't have made it so obvious that I liked you.

774
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,319
Let me at least take care of this.

775
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,310
I'm the one who put you in trouble.

776
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:52,029
I can tell people that I was the one who insisted─

777
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,250
Please don't do that.

778
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:59,150
I don't want to put you in trouble for my own sake.

779
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,240
Just don't worry about it.

780
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,000
If you're done, I'll get going.

781
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,660
 Oppa, your departure date is set.

782
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,010
 Don't forget to give me your tablet before you go.

783
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,520
Dam.

784
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,400
I like you.

785
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,050
I like that you speak what you think

786
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,150
and the way you look when you glance at me carelessly.

787
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,550
I like everything about you.

788
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:07,030
- Seon Woo Sunbae. 
 - There were times

789
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,450
I thought I was just confused

790
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,710
because I couldn't make you like me.

791
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,350
But I don't think that's the case.

792
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,350
I like you.

793
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,980
I know what you're going to say.

794
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:38,810
Still... I wanted to say it one last time.

795
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,360
One last time?

796
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,370
I'm going to go study abroad.

797
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:04,740
This can be a confession of love or a goodbye.

798
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,540
You can take it however you like.

799
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,760
Goodbye, Sunbae.

800
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,940
 I still like you.

801
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,560
 If only I could, I would turn back time.

802
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,090
 (Text me)

803
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,960
Hello, sir.

804
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,710
Why are you walking away?

805
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:18,490
Well...

806
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,359
I don't want to put you in trouble.

807
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,230
What do you mean by trouble? We didn't do anything wrong.

808
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,219
I just don't want people to talk behind your back.

809
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,440
I don't care about those kinds of things.

810
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,200
So don't run away.

811
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,629
I got everything settled.

812
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,699
I admitted that we're going out.

813
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:46,729
And this does look suspicious, so I'll drop your class.

814
00:54:46,729 --> 00:54:48,970
Everything is okay now.

815
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,570
That's probably why the red thread has been cut.

816
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,400
What?

817
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,210
You're right. I don't see it anymore.

818
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,530
You could see the red thread?

819
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,870
Yes. I started seeing it at some point.

820
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:18,130
But what matters is that we managed to cut it.

821
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,649
- "We"? 
 - Yes.

822
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:25,000
We solved this on our own.

823
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,030
We are the ones to decide our own destiny, not the stupid thread.

824
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,590
♫   All about you    ♫

825
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:40,170

826
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,400
♫   I want to feel it without saying anything   ♫

827
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,339
- You should go. 
 - What?

828
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,400
Go and clear the air. I'll be waiting.

829
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,590
♫   I want to get a little closer to you   ♫

830
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,990
♫   That’s how I feel   ♫

831
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:04,110
♫   That’s what I want to do, that’s all   ♫

832
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,210
I'm sorry, Professor Shin.

833
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,660
It looks like there were rumors about us between the students.

834
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,810
I'm sure it made you feel uncomfortable.

835
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:31,319
Now that I think about it, you always turned me down politely.

836
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,380
I'm bad at taking hints.

837
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:38,209
I'm saying this because I thought it'd be good

838
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,810
for both of us to make things clear.

839
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:53,100
There's nothing you should apologize for.

840
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,150
I knew you were interested in me.

841
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,370
I knew it,

842
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:04,370
but I pretended I didn't.

843
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,450
But I shouldn't have done that.

844
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,550
I'm sorry.

845
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,340
I mean it.

846
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,190
Well done.

847
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,190
I'm sure you feel much lighter now.

848
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,289
But, seriously, it feels so good now.

849
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,750
Especially because that damned red thread is gone.

850
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:18,119
Now that I think about it, it must have been just as hard for Seon Woo as well.

851
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:23,480
He probably didn't like me so much if it weren't for the red thread.

852
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,890
 He's so cute.

853
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,400
 He's probably the cutest 999-year-old person.

854
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,830
Anyway, now everything is over, let's go eat something nice.

855
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,639
I'd love to. What should we eat?

856
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,400
- How about pasta? 
 - Sounds good.

857
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,490
Let's invite your friends too.

858
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,240
Okay. Then I'll invite...

859
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,539
- What? 
 - They didn't get to eat much that day.

860
00:58:57,539 --> 00:58:59,710
I want to make up for it.

861
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,890
But you said it's not going to happen again.

862
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,220
I did.

863
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:09,260
But I thought I might be able to work it out if we face things upfront like I did today.

864
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,660
That's great. I've always wanted to brag about my boyfriend.

865
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,220
Let's do that.

866
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,790
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

867
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:29,750
He said he needed to make a phone call.

868
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,400
Where's Soo Kyeong?

869
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,400
She went to the restroom.

870
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,990
I'm sure you're surprised. I'm sorry I kept it a secret.

871
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,420
Are you sure you want this?

872
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,110
He once had a scandal with Professor Seo.

873
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:48,770
It's just a rumor. It will die down soon.

874
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,039
Dam. I thought this was my problem,

875
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:55,629
so I was going to keep it to myself,

876
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,479
but now I know you're dating Professor Shin,

877
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,700
so I need to tell you this.

878
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,000
Please don't get me wrong.

879
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:02,090
What is it?

880
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,350
As a matter of fact...

881
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:10,459
I once saw Professor Shin and Hye Sun holding hands.

882
01:00:10,459 --> 01:00:13,790
That's why I hated him.

883
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,030
That's a misunderstanding.

884
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,210
Professor Shin and Hye Sun are just f...

885
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:20,950
 Officially, their age difference is too big to be friends.

886
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:24,350
 If I say they held hands because of energy, he'd think I'm crazy.

887
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,710
They're just f-what?

888
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,340
They're just f...

889
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,710
Family. Distant relatives.

890
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,790
Really?

891
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,889
That's why they both look so attractive.

892
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,110
It runs in the family.

893
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,779
I can't believe I judged such an upright man like Professor Shin.

894
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,440
I'm so ashamed of myself.

895
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,389
I know. I'm very ashamed of you too.

896
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:50,529
Look at you, flip-flopping so quickly.

897
01:00:50,529 --> 01:00:52,670
I knew there was something different about them.

898
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,509
- This is so cool. 
 - What's so cool?

899
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,680
- This way, Professor. 
 - He's coming.

900
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,209
On my way back from the toi...

901
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:04,540
I mean, restroom, I bumped into him.

902
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,370
Hello, Professor.

903
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:10,550
I mean, Mr. Dam's boyfriend. I mean, hello, Professor.

904
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,370
Shall we take seats now?

905
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,110
Okay.

906
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,540
Relax, guys.

907
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:33,129
Well, I know what I did,

908
01:01:33,129 --> 01:01:35,140
so I can't relax.

909
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:40,540
I still feel bad about what I said at his place that day.

910
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,699
We didn't know you were her boyfriend then

911
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,930
and used curse words.

912
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,710
"We"?

913
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,059
I was just playing along with her

914
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:55,189
because I didn't want my friend to feel embarrassed.

915
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:58,400
I didn't mean it, Professor.

916
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,210
Professor, what's your favorite?

917
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,390
Well, there are so many things I like about her,

918
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:17,930
but my favorite is her smile.

919
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,460
What?

920
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:30,510
I was asking what your favorite menu was.

921
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,300
I like everything.

922
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,940
Excuse me!

923
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,240
I wish every day was like today.

924
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,940
I'll try to make your every day like today.

925
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:02,130
I should have discussed with you in the first place.

926
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:05,280
The things I couldn't change no matter how hard I tried

927
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,890
seem to change since you realized it yourself.

928
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:13,530
Now I get it.

929
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,759
You're the kind of person who takes off the jacket

930
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,360
when exposed to warm sunshine for a long time.

931
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:30,000
To be honest, there is another reason why I'm living with you.

932
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,060
What?

933
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,140
 What dyes the Bead blue...

934
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,560
 is humanity.

935
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,440
 Humanity?

936
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,530
Are you okay?

937
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,430
I'm glad.

938
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,400
I thought your sacrifice was what changed the color of the Bead,

939
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,800
and it made me feel bad.

940
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:21,310
But I'm glad that wasn't the case.

941
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,810
Still, we should be careful.

942
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:32,800
There's still the hunger issue, so it can still be dangerous.

943
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,999
I said, don't worry.

944
01:04:35,999 --> 01:04:39,620
There's no way I'll be in danger.

945
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,800
Actually, when I met the mountain spirit,

946
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,260
I asked him a favor.

947
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,800
I said I would make sure to turn you into a human,

948
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,510
so I wanted him to keep me from any sickness or death.

949
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,530
We made an agreement.

950
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,740
You never cease to surprise me.

951
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,590
I need to save myself, after all.

952
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,940
Looks like the wind dropped the wind chime.

953
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:28,330
Goodnight, Miss Dam.

954
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,160
Goodnight.

955
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,530
I thought I was not in danger anymore, so...

956
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,610
I think things are just about to get dangerous.

957

978
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,520
 I can't focus on my homework.

979
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,330
 I can't focus on anything.

980
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,979
 Bye, Sir.

981
01:07:53,979 --> 01:07:56,519
 Who would think you're dating him if you call him "Sir"?

982
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:57,589
 You're done, Dam?

983
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:59,259
 Honey! My love!

984
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:01,289
 - It's cheesy, right? 
 - I like it.

985
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:04,229
 I'm very concerned about my friend who started a tough love.

986
01:08:04,229 --> 01:08:07,089
 I'm thinking of quitting the job after this semester.

987
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:10,090
 So why do you never touch me?

988
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,669
 - Sometimes, it works. 
 - My goodness!

989
01:08:11,669 --> 01:08:13,649
 Sometimes, it doesn't. Why do you think that is?

990
01:08:13,649 --> 01:08:15,760
 I think that's a sign that you're turning into a human.

991
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:24,140
