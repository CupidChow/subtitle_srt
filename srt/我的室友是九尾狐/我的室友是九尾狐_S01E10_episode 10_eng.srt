1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:10,380

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,899

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,970

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,650

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,980

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,870

7
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,510
Wait.

8
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,180
Just one second.

9
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,150
Well, I...

10
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,200
This doesn't mean I don't like it. I'm just surprised.

11
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,930
Sir.

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,750
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

13
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,550
There's no need to apologize.

14
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,910
It's just that

15
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,880
you're moving a little too fast, so I'm about to feel motion sickness.

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,860
I have to be in a class, so please excuse me.

17
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,560
 What? You felt hungry again?

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,680
I don't know why this is happening.

19
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,560
This has never happened over centuries of my life.

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,769
Like I said before, you'll have to walk a fine line

21
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,520
between your affection and hunger when a gumiho loves a human.

22
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,939
And your thousand years are about to expire,

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,570
so your instincts would crave her energy even more.

24
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,799
But still, don't worry.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,250
You have the Bead. What's there to worry about?

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,639
We give them the Bead,

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,910
let them fill it up with energy, then have it returned to us.

28
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,070
That's the rule the mountain spirit made.

29
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,609
I mean that you shouldn't worry because your instincts perked up

30
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,040
only due to your lack of energy.

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,470
But I still exposed Miss Dam to a bit of danger.

32
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,760
This is unacceptable.

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,290
Do you want me to tell you a solution?

34
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,480
Stay away from touching her.

35
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,730
 There is no meaning to the body.

36
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,390
 You can enjoy platonic romance

37
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,010
 that may drive you insane with your desires.

38
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,120
What do you think? Doesn't it sound like a good idea?

39
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,790
Right. I shouldn't ask you to do something that I can't.

40
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,120
Then is there anything else you can do?

41
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,779
What a long day.

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,589
What is this?

43
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,590
Why do I suddenly feel so conscious?

44
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,790
That wasn't the first time.

45
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,680
Wait, then does this mean that time doesn't count?

46
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,730
Then was today my first kiss?

47
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,090
Dam, I'm home.

48
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,680
My gosh.

49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,490
What's with her?

50
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,060
Is she hungry?

51
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,700
 My lord, have you heard that rumor?

52
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,690
 What rumor?

53
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,179
 That a wicked monster who leeches on people's energy

54
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,530
 was seen in the city.

55
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,209
 But the monster is unbelievably beautiful,

56
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,760
 so there is no one who wasn't bewitched by it.

57
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,769
 Is that so?

58
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,189
 Once you run into this monster,

59
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,530
 you lose your liver, gallbladder, and everything,

60
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,510
 then get your energy drained to death.

61
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,409
 Isn't that horrendous?

62
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,020
 I'm sure that's just a rumor made up by gossipers.

63
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,990
 That must be the case, right?

64
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,410
 Then...

65
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,810
 shall we blow out the candles, sir?

66
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,710
What was that?

67
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,719
 No matter how low in energy I was,

68
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,400
 something like this hasn't happened before.

69
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,759
 I felt hungry for the first time in a thousand years

70
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,670
 from my lover?

71
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,420
 Sir, I'm sorry I had to leave in a hurry yesterday.

72
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,430
 So let me buy some good coffee after classes.

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Platonic love...

74
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,600
It looked so good.

75
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,620
Yes, it's natural for couples to do that.

76
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,210
I need to get used to this.

77
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,590
I'll quickly grow into someone who loves physical contact.

78
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,460
Miss Dam.

79
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,499
- Sir. 
 - Did I keep you waiting?

80
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,720
No, I didn't wait for too long.

81
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,440
This place is famous for their coffee. Let's go inside.

82
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,880
Wait for me, sir.

83
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,060
♫  People might be watching. That is what I'm wanting  ♫

84
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,210
♫  The halo that I can see. Maybe I am weirdo  ♫

85
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,570
♫  All my friends are talking  ♫

86
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,439
- He so stylish. 
 - He's so handsome.

87
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,710
- Who is that? 
 - Is he a model or what?

88
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,730
♫  Let's leave it with me  ♫

89
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,660
♫  Just step by step  ♫

90
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,720
♫  Sorry that I'm quick of foot. I'll walk your step  ♫

91
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,470
♫  I'm wondering now  ♫

92
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,730
My gosh.

93
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,360
♫  Tremble lips and blurry eyes  ♫

94
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,070
I got you a Caffé mocha.

95
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,900
♫  Then actual date and time, will you?  ♫

96
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,450
Looks great.

97
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:43,250
♫  You never say for sure  ♫

98
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,350
You got cream on your lips.

99
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,250
- Where? 
 - Right here.

100
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,490
You should wipe it with this.

101
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,760
No way. It looks like only the girl has a crush on him.

102
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,540
Yes, or he might be bored with their relationship.

103
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,249
 Bored? This is our fourth day together.

104
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,799
 And it's not a single-sided crush. We mutually like each other.

105
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,470
 We had a really passionate first kiss yesterday...

106
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,280
What should we do after coffee?

107
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,970
There was something I wanted to do.

108
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,490
Why are we at an arcade?

109
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,710
I used to come often before, so I thought it'd be fun to come with you.

110
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,040
- Why? You don't like it? 
 - I do. I love it.

111
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,100
 I won't have to touch her if I keep it casual and just play games.

112
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,120
Hey, let's go play that.

113
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
Let's do that.

114
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,570
 I want to be lovey-dovey like them too.

115
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,420
 I didn't want to spend all my time shooting guns.

116
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,369
Sir, let's go play the motorcycle game.

117
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,360
- Okay. 
 - Sure.

118
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,360
Sir, did you just grab me by the neck?

119
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
No, it's...

120
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,330
I...

121
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,580
- You're home. 
 - Hi.

122
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,419
What's with your shirt? Did you get into a fight?

123
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,640
Why would I fight anyone?

124
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,799
Why are you watching this?

125
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,429
Why do you care?

126
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,990
I'm eighteen, so I can watch a fifteen rated drama.

127
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,149
You're so old-fashioned as if you still live in Joseon.

128
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,909
No, even someone from Joseon

129
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,139
would call you old-fashioned.

130
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,850
What? I'm not old-fashioned.

131
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,670
Wait.

132
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,899
Wait, was it Seon Woo who grabbed you by your neck?

133
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,240
Did he get frustrated with how conservative you are?

134
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,890
Wait, is that why he was trying to keep his distance?

135
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,350
 Wait.

136
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,040
 You're moving a little too fast,

137
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,670
 so I'm about to feel motion sickness.

138
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,069
Yes, that was it. He was trying to stop himself

139
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,650
from taking things too fast.

140
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,560
All I wanted was to slow down a little,

141
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,960
not turning off the engine and sitting there.

142
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,359
 Yesterday night, a man in his 20s was arrested and detained

143
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,569
 at a club in Gangnam after attacking another man.

144
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,029
 This is unfair for me too.

145
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,270
 He grabbed me by the neck first.

146
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,089
 If you hold someone by the neck, that means you want to fight.

147
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,609
 I mean, I couldn't just stand around and let him do this.

148
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,480
 And of course, I became agitated so things turned out in disgrace,

149
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,189
 but I believe it was self-defense.

150
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,699
 And I don't think it'll take him four weeks to recover.

151
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,290
 It was just a fist fight.

152
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,909
- What do you want? 
  - Ever since

153
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,339
I became a human, I began to have a huge appetite.

154
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,409
I still have room for dessert after a filling meal.

155
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,049
On top of that, I could have another drink after that.

156
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,499
So what?

157
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,939
I just ordered a fried chicken and had it with beer.

158
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,510
It was heavenly.

159
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,950
No, never mind.

160
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,720
Once I became full,

161
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,470
I didn't care for more food.

162
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,579
- Why are you telling me... 
  - What do you think?

163
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,240
You should eat as much as you can to quench your hunger.

164
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,100
What?

165
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,299
I've never filled myself up with human food...

166
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,569
Exactly.

167
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,919
You've never tried it before, so you should.

168
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,369
Who knows?

169
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,859
Once you're full,

170
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,829
your hunger and craving for energy may disappear.

171
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:03,270
What kind of logic is this?

172
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,340
I've seen some of these before thanks to Miss Dam,

173
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,450
and there are some dishes I've never had before.

174
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,690
Is this a pot stand?

175
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,570
♫  I stopped and looked back  ♫

176
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,800
♫  but what was missing was my own existence  ♫

177
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,210
♫  For someone whose name I do not know  ♫

178
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,320
♫  I've lived my life, day by day  ♫

179
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,560
♫  The only thing left with me with were lonely memories   ♫

180
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,800
♫  I can't continue like this  ♫

181
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,270
♫  When I'm reborn in my next life,  ♫

182
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,850
♫  I'll be the one to fill my own life  ♫

183
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,830
♫  And to you, looking at me  ♫

184
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:08,090
♫  I'll profusely show you my feelings  ♫

185
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,900
That's too sweet.

186
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,570

187
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,439

188
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,570

189
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,590
What on earth...

190
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,710
 Am I doing?

191
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,040
How does this make any sense?

192
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,140
 We began by living together,

193
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,370
 then said goodbye with a kiss.

194
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,810
 But we can't touch each other now that we're dating?

195
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,449
 Sir, good morning.

196
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,970
 There seems to be a misunderstanding between us, so I send you a message.

197
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,309
 Everything I said and did two days ago

198
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,899
 didn't mean that I don't want you to touch me.

199
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,990
 Actually, it was wonderful.

200
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,900
 I was just a little flustered because it was my first time.

201
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,780
 I felt like a baby who just learned to walk

202
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,820
 doing a windmill all of a sudden.

203
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,819
 But now I'm all ready for this.

204
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,660
 I'm willing to race at your speed on the highway or wherever else.

205
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,760

206
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,240

207
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,200
You're buying today. I bought you this last time.

208
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,460
If he read my message, why won't he respond?

209
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,550
You

210
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,310
dropped this.

211
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,160
Thank you.

212
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,550
How did you know this was mine?

213
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,410
I've been watching you.

214
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,350
What's he saying? Why was he watching me?

215
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,229
 That laptop of yours actually sold

216
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,569
Yes, it was sold in five minutes as soon as I posted it.

217
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,209
- I wouldn't even take it for free. 
 - It's not for you anyway.

218
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,289
Hey, do you remember everyone who went on the history trip?

219
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,570
I keep running into him, but I can't remember.

220
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,399
He's a guy, a little taller than me,

221
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,070
- and has monolid eyes. 
 - Monolids?

222
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,680
Oh, that guy. I know him.

223
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,810
His name is...

224
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,530
Do Jae Jin.

225
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,999
He's taller than you, has monolid eyes.

226
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,570
No, not him.

227
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,729
What?

228
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:33,299
History 101 lecture was canceled.

229
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,180
What? Why?

230
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,660
Professor Shin's personal reasons.

231
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,209
I hope nothing bad happened to Professor Shin.

232
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,939
His lectures are as well prepared as his glowing facial features,

233
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,619
so he wouldn't cancel a lecture over something petty.

234
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,949
She's so worried as if she's his girlfriend.

235
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:49,009
Right?

236
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,170
Yes, you're right.

237
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,650

238
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,360

239
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,270
Sir.

240
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,840
I'm here.

241
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,390
Sir! Sir, are you not feeling well?

242
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,770
Sir! Oh no.

243
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,290
 Sir.

244
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,200
Are you all right?

245
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,290
 Sir.

246
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,160
Sir.

247
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,740

248
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,620
- Are you all right? 
 - Miss Dam.

249
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,960
You should leave the room for a moment.

250
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,260
Sorry?

251
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,220
Yes, you should probably do that.

252
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,560
Hye Sun.

253
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,920
- Let's go. 
 - Wait, I... Hey.

254
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,040
 I'm sorry. I'll explain everything later.

255
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,240

256
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,680
You must be startled. Drink this.

257
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,080
Thanks.

258
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,480
I heard that

259
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,910
you're a gumiho, too.

260
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,270
I heard it from my sir.

261
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,160
"Sir"?

262
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,960
Is that what you call Woo Yeo? "Sir"?

263
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,580
- Yes. 
 - My gosh.

264
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,800
Woo Yeo finally met his match.

265
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
You're a funny girl.

266
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,210
Anyway, what's going on?

267
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,000
Something seemed serious.

268
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,260
You know what's happening, right?

269
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,930
I'm not sure.

270
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,970
Even if I explained it to you, would a human like you understand?

271
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,870
But what I do know is that you don't even know half of who he is

272
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,310
or what we're like.

273
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,740
 I'm going to be a human as soon as I can.

274
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,820
 Why are you in such a hurry?

275
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,510
 Because I want to live a different life.

276
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,270
 A cold-hearted guy like you who's made of ice won't understand.

277
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,429
 Please erase my memories. Please, I ask of you.

278
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,160
 One day, there will come a moment

279
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,360
 when you can't stand that you're actually a fox.

280
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,460
Why don't you try getting energy from other women?

281
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,629
Then she won't have to see you as a threat,

282
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,170
and if you get lucky, you may become a human, too.

283
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,870
If the result is great, who cares about the process?

284
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,340
Well, there's no way an upright man like you would do that.

285
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,760
Then try doing something as I suggested.

286
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,220
- Try stuffing yourself to quench... 
 - I tried.

287
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,770
What?

288
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,160
I tried everything I can.

289
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,760
Really?

290
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,690
Yet you couldn't control yourself?

291
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,520
I don't get it.

292
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,640
Could it be

293
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,120
because of that?

294
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,890
Because of what?

295
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,560
If it's because of that, then I wouldn't be too worried.

296
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,600
You know.

297
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,900
Sexual desire.

298
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,870
I think there's definitely a chance.

299
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,639
I recently saw a movie where the male lead was in your spot.

300
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,869
He couldn't restrain himself,

301
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,469
so he would get up in the middle of a meal and wipe out the table—

302
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,300
That's enough.

303
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,380
It's not that I can't restrain myself.

304
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,560
I can't control myself.

305
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,530
And what's more important is

306
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,980
the Bead is somehow gathering energy.

307
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,500
What? How does that make any sense?

308
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,960
 - Sir. 
 - Miss Dam.

309
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,300
 You might want to leave for a second.

310
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,720

311
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,230
Sir!

312
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,280
Why did you call...

313
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,700
Forget that. Are you all right?

314
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,160
- Miss Dam. 
 - Yes?

315
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,730
Could we

316
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,570
keep our distance for a while?

317
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,390
We just started to go out. Why would we do that?

318
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,190
Stay right there. I'm coming.

319
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,780
Just for a short while,

320
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,730
until I find a way.

321
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,870
A way?

322
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,890
Miss Dam.

323
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,490
You thought I'd become a human right away

324
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,970
once I take the Bead back, right?

325
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,990
So didn't you wonder

326
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,860
why everything seemed to be the same?

327
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,390
Yes, I was dying to know.

328
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,020
But I thought you had a reason for not telling me.

329
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,090
I don't have enough energy yet.

330
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,330
That's why

331
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,260
I continue to crave for more

332
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,490
against my will.

333
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,369
But isn't it all right since you have the Bead?

334
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,580
 What if it isn't?

335
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,270
What if something goes wrong?

336
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,820
If I take more energy from you, you might fall in danger, Miss Dam.

337
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,870
So let's keep our distance for a while

338
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,050
until I find a way.

339
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,850
I know how smart you are,

340
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,340
so I'm sure you understood everything.

341
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,099
We have lots to discuss, so let's get started.

342
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,819
I'm thinking of donating proceeds

343
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,589
from our school festival to a cultural asset protection group.

344
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,659
I'm not sure. It all sounds great,

345
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,519
but are we going to make that much from opening a pub like everyone else?

346
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,870
I was wondering if you had any other ideas other than opening a pub.

347
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,170
How about doing tarot card readings or having your fortune read?

348
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,489
- Economics is doing that. 
 - Really?

349
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,569
Just do a free hug campaign for ₩500 ($0,50).

350
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,750
If they have to pay, it's not free. It's a paid-hugs campaign.

351
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,340
Don't be so uptight.

352
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,999
We can leave a box,

353
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,279
and ask people to donate as much as they want.

354
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,680
So who would pay money for a hug?

355
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,280
It's not like we have somebody big.

356
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,590
Wow, really...

357
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,619
Hey, people would pay. They'd pay to do this.

358
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,379
We'll empty out everyone's pockets.

359
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,919
I'd give up my tuition for him.

360
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,750
- What's going on? 
 - You've just been sold.

361
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,990
You're our free hug guy at the festival.

362
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
I'm not doing it.

363
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,560
He's right. He's not in the student body, so we can't force him.

364
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,520
- Why not? 
 - You totally killed this.

365
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,389
- Hey. 
 - Then what about Dam?

366
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,700
She can do this for coming late.

367
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,460
You do the free hugs campaign.

368
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,819
- The free hugs campaign? 
 - Yes.

369
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,400
You were late, and we already chose what we're going to do.

370
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,460
- You don't have a job yet. 
 - We're too busy.

371
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,410
Then I'll do it.

372
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,930
I'll do it, so leave her out of this.

373
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,890
- Hey, what's going on? 
 - A knight in shining armor?

374
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,130
He's making my heart flutter too.

375
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,050
Hey. What's up?

376
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,050
Thank you for what you did earlier.

377
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,190
Then let me ask you something.

378
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,570
You said before that you had a crush on someone. Who is it?

379
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,540
Don't ask me.

380
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,510
I already did.

381
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,240
Come on and tell me. I got you out of the free hugs campaign.

382
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,330
Give and take, you know.

383
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,970
That's not fair.

384
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,430
That confession I made

385
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,860
might have been lame, but I was serious.

386
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,360
I had feelings for you, and I still do.

387
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,320
Is it Jae Jin?

388
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,170
You make me laugh.

389
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,040
Are you sick, by the way?

390
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,570
What?

391
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,569
You don't look well.

392
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,250
You seem to have lost a bit of weight, too.

393
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,590
 Lose weight? Really?

394
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,550
I really did. I lost 2kg.

395
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,920
Is this really because I got my energy stolen?

396
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,990
No way. I always lose a couple of kilos when I don't eat much.

397
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,430
Wait.

398
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,180
My weight has never gone below 50kg.

399
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,110
 Wait.

400
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,459
 But what I do know is that you don't even know half of who he is

401
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,619
 or what we're like.

402
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,260
 If I take more energy from you, you might fall in danger.

403
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,120
 You agreed to stay away from each other?

404
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,890
That's the only way to solve this.

405
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:06,269
Why did you even suggest it if you can't take responsibility for your own word?

406
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:09,209
You should have rather begged her desperately.

407
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,020
Beg? How?

408
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,040
"I may lose my mind from time to time and confuse you with food,"

409
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,410
"but please still hang out with me."

410
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,620
"I might steal your energy too." Like this?

411
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,970

412
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,880
Is that Lee Dam?

413
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,410
Yes, Miss Dam.

414
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,100
 Sir...

415
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,840
Sir, you're right.

416
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,620
Let's...

417
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,860
stay away from each other.

418
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,860
Are you still there?

419
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,710
Yes, I am.

420
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,180
I gave it a lot of thought,

421
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,380
and if it's something you cannot control,

422
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,650
it might be better for us to stay away from each other until we find a solution.

423
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,510
 I know it's a selfish thought,

424
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:53,620
 but I wished you wouldn't be pushed away even if I pushed you.

425
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,919
 Tell me, Sir. Was I nothing but just a Bead carrier?

426
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:58,499
 Was I?

427
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:00,750
 I wished you'd be bold

428
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,329
 just like you always have.

429
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,420
 I like you.

430
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,480
 And I want you to like me too.

431
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,760
 I wished you'd be reckless

432
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,289
 and cross the line I drew.

433
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,179
I also didn't know

434
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,179
I would say this.

435
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,029
I understand.

436
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,520
Let's do that.

437
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,840
You know there's no solution to this.

438
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,859
Unless you turn into a human.

439
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,090
Why don't you ask her for help?

440
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,429
A human can bear it for a year,

441
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:04,279
and you have half a year left.

442
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,840
No.

443
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,990
I don't want to.

444
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,020

445
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,320

446
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,410
 We have a lot of delicious food. Come on, guys.

447
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,400
- Does it look all right? 
 - Of course.

448
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,880
You won!

449
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,740

450
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:48,099

451
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,260
- What do you think of this one? 
 - Good.

452
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,299
- This one is better, right? 
 - Yes.

453
00:35:57,299 --> 00:35:59,410
- Is this one better? 
 - Yes.

454
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,279
Hey, I have a lecture now. See you later.

455
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,310
- Okay. 
 - See you.

456
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,420
Dam, you should take some rest.

457
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,059
Labor is the best way to clear your head.

458
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,380
Clear your head? Do you have concerns lately?

459
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,940
Actually, you don't look well these days.

460
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,499
I'm just saying.

461
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,659
- This should be in the lounge, right? 
 - I'll move it.

462
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,930
I have a class now, so I can drop it there on my way.

463
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,069
Professor, I was really worried because you suddenly canceled the lecture the other day.

464
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,799
- Is everything all right? 
 - Yes.

465
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,620
Wait. Why don't you come to our pub?

466
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,430
We can give you extra food.

467
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,590
I'm the top student, so you may think I spend my time studying only,

468
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,250
but I also dedicate myself to college events.

469
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,750
Sir, do you like stir-fried cartilage? Or how about...

470
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,190
♫  The meaningless answer,  ♫

471
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,840
♫  that look on your face   ♫

472
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,530
♫   At some point   ♫

473
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,850
 I know you also have a lot on your mind.

474
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,520
 But do we have to ignore each other?

475
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,530
♫   Even though I try to find a reason for your change of heart   ♫

476
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,460
♫   Still every day  ♫

477
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,830
 When I said we should stay away, I didn't mean this far away.

478
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:50,800
♫   I have nothing left to say   ♫

479
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,550
♫   My words for you have hurt us   ♫

480
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,390
♫   I couldn’t recognize your sadness   ♫

481
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:06,970
♫   In the past   ♫

482
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,240
 I would lie to him and say I'm all right,

483
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,770
 but I have my family whom I love,

484
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,700
 my friends,

485
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,530
 and my dreams to pursue.

486
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,660
 I have never liked someone this much,

487
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,510
 but if you ask me if I could risk my life for it,

488
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,430
 I don't think I can.

489
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,875

490
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,860
Professor Shin, you came.

491
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,680
Yes.

492
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,770
Have you eaten yet?

493
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,970
Right. Have a seat.

494
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,220
Professor, you can sit...

495
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,079
over there.

496
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,680
Excuse me, ma'am.

497
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,370
Call me Hwang Jin-yi.

498
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,619

499
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,440
Guys, I got you some warm coffee.

500
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,120
Just coffee? No bread?

501
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,999
- Seon Woo is amazing. 
 - Why?

502
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:08,059
I think he's making more money than our pub.

503
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:10,540
It's like a one-man business.

504
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,000
I kind of feel bad that he hasn't been able to sit down for hours,

505
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,330
but he's making so much money. Like a lot.

506
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,719
Hey, Dam.

507
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,220
I heard he's doing that for you. Why is he doing that?

508
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,110
I'm not sure.

509
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,360
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

510
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,980
Thank you.

511
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,320
Hey, do you have a girlfriend?

512
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,680
I don't.

513
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,980
- Could you give me your number then? 
 - I don't have a phone.

514
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,520
Yes, you do.

515
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,739
You're lying.

516
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,750
- We'll come back. 
 - Thank you.

517
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,910
- Let me take some break. 
 - Okay.

518
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,619
I'm sorry, but we're taking a short break.

519
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,120
- Oh, no. 
 - Why?

520
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,830
Have this, Seon Woo.

521
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:28,160
 I know this doesn't mean anything, but I want to believe it means something.

522
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,790
 I guess my hard work paid off.

523
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,720
If you don't want it, give it back...

524
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,770
I do. I'm just saving it.

525
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,270
You don't need to though.

526
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,440
I can tell your fortune...

527
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,870
Hey, Seon Woo.

528
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,530
Your girlfriend?

529
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,789
I'm not his girlfriend.

530
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:58,149
Oh, I see. Do you want to see your future?

531
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,909
You should join. I'll give you a discount.

532
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:02,420
- I'm busy. 
 - Let's try. Just for fun.

533
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,409
- Good. Come on. 
 - I need to go...

534
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:08,110
I'll give you a discount. Come on. Let's go.

535
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,350
That way.

536
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,540

537
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,270
Tell me.

538
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,320
Why are you watching her in disguise?

539
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,990
I don't know.

540
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,580
I'm the one who wants to ask what you're doing now.

541
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,700
Tell me.

542
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:44,200
Has your or Hye Sun's love ever ended well?

543
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,830
Everyone you loved either died or ended up a living corpse.

544
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:55,769
To humans, you are an unfortunate car accident and a bolt out of the blue.

545
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,900
Though she's blinded by love and believes she loves you,

546
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,249
humans are meant to be with humans. That's the rule.

547
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:12,380
Which both of you will figure out soon.

548
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,240
But if you still believe she's your destiny who found you after a thousand years...

549
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,960

550
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,740

551
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:36,910
Why don't you see for yourself what real destiny looks like?

552
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,880
You know foxes are related to dogs.

553
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,940
Even a friendly dog can bite you when upset.

554
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,800
Gosh, you guys are a match made in heaven.

555
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,669
You are so meant to be.

556
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:33,580
It's like the whole universe wants you to be together.

557
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,269
I said I wanted to know about my future career.

558
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:38,469
I'm not lying. It's just the way it is.

559
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,640
- Our relationship is nothing like... 
 - There's a man now, right?

560
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,700
And there's quite some age gap.

561
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,010
You're the earth, and he's a tree.

562
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,409
And he's not just a regular tree.

563
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,500
He's too old and big a tree.

564
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,760
If you stay with him, you'll be faced with a drought.

565
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,130
Dam.

566
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,531
Okay. Bye, Seon Woo.

567
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:19,569

568
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,930
How did you know I was here?

569
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,019
I was looking for you. I have something to say.

570
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:25,620
What is it?

571
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,870
Let's talk.

572
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,500
What are you doing, you freak?

573
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,689
Are you coming to the after party?

574
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,410
Maybe.

575
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,970
So what is it? Let's go.

576
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,760
What?

577
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,470
Where's Soo Kyeong?

578
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,940
Probably helping others at the pub.

579
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,790
What kind of vague answer is that?

580
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:02,930
You don't look well. Is everything all right?

581
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,130
I'm just thinking about what I heard from the fortune teller.

582
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,570
Why?

583
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:14,930
I feel like she might be right,

584
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,220
but at the same time, I hate that I feel that way.

585
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,480
Hey. I was waiting for the right time to tell you this,

586
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,850
but I have a boyfriend now.

587
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,520
Is that so?

588
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,930
What's with that calm reaction? It's not like you.

589
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,710
I wanted to introduce him to you.

590
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,299
He's a really nice person.

591
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,970
And being with him makes me happy.

592
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,340
Is that all?

593
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,110
He's the most handsome man in the world.

594
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,420
What's with the smirk?

595
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,640
You're just beautiful to look at, that's all.

596
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,300
What? What's wrong with you?

597
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,589
You did something bad, didn't you?

598
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:13,049
If you tell me in three seconds, I'll extenuate it.

599
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:18,150
- Three, two... 
 - So how much do you like him?

600
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,680
What?

601
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:28,040
I'm not sure, but I most definitely like him more than he likes me.

602
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,190
I doubt it.

603
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,990
You don't know.

604
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,550
Finally, I see your face.

605
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,160
What? How did you suddenly... Since when?

606
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,800
Anyway, I think you're wrong.

607
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,750
Because I like you way more than you like me.

608
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,600
Well...

609
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:09,770
Which is why I'm regretting saying that we should stay away from each other.

610
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,390
I avoided you then

611
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:21,050
because seeing you made me weak when nothing was sorted out.

612
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,630
I promise I will sort out the Bead situation somehow.

613
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,690
Pardon?

614
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:35,460
I can't stand putting you in danger.

615
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:51,090
- This way, your energy... 
 - You said you'd sort it out.

616
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:55,440
You said I could hold out for a year.

617
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,090
I'll try to hold out.

618
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,350
I can hold your hand every three days.

619
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,129
If I lose weight, I'll overeat.

620
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:09,620
I'll do anything I can do, so let's not stay away from each other.

621
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,550
Let's stay together.

622
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,389
What's with the smirk? It's creeping me out.

623
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:49,749
What?

624
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:51,119
You're coming to the after party, right?

625
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,450
Answer my question first. What's the name of your first love?

626
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,540
- Shin Seol A. 
 - When's Jae Kang's birthday?

627
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,660
How would I know?

628
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,379
It's you. Let's go.

629
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,700
What are you saying? Are you coming to the after party?

630
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,429
- What are they having? 
 - Meat.

631
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,750
- Meat? 
 - Meat.

632
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:12,240
I wonder if Woo Yeo sorted it out all right.

633
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:16,170
Excuse me. Hi.

634
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,400
Are you a student here?

635
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,530
I've been watching you over there and you're totally my type.

636
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,319
 I'm not just your type.

637
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,569
 I'm everyone's type.

638
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,470
And?

639
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,209
Could you give me your phone number?

640
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,610
No.

641
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,830
Come on. Do you not like me?

642
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,699
She's saying she doesn't like you.

643
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,089
If you don't want to give us your phone number,

644
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,780
I don't mind hanging out together for just today.

645
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,740
Boys.

646
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,479
Be objective, okay?

647
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:54,950
Can't you see I'm way out of your league?

648
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,310
What a disrespectful wench.

649
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,740
Hey.

650
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,330
I'm not done yet.

651
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,010
Let go.

652
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,910
- "Let go." 
 - You let go.

653
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,889
- Let go, I said. 
 - You let go.

654
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,690
Hey.

655
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:17,500
She said, let go.

656
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,779
What in the...

657
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,070
Hey, you think this is a movie or something?

658
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:23,740
Who do you think you are...

659
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,800
Let's go, Hye Sun.

660
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:43,679
Hye Sun, if something like this happens again, call me.

661
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,990
I did judo in high school, so I'll be pretty useful.

662
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,439
Okay.

663
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,690
Let's go. I was looking for you so we can go to the after party together.

664
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,630
To Seogwa!

665
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:05,460
 - Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

666
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,830
 Good job everyone, good job.

667
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,439
Seon Woo made a huge contribution this time.

668
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,419
- How much did you earn? 
 - Tell me about it.

669
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,390
I heard you broke the record.

670
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,949
Seon Woo, if you don't get a job, please come to the festival every year.

671
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,539
- We will double your pay. 
 - Or triple.

672
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,100
Thanks for the curse.

673
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,629
Did Dam come, by the way?

674
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,139
That's a random question. What's the deal between you two?

675
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,029
Hey, you're not a good match.

676
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,750
So did she come or not?

677
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,909
 Hey, you're here.

678
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,400
 - Come on in. 
 - Hi.

679
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,350
- One soju and two beers, please. 
 - Okay.

680
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,120
I thought you preferred pork belly.

681
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,730
I like all meat equally.

682
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,840
Don't drink too much.

683
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,300
Are you two really going out?

684
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,660
I have a boyfriend.

685
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,860
- What? 
 - What?

686
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,630
You have a boyfriend? Since when? Who is he?

687
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,839
Where did you meet him? Is he a student here?

688
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,490
Who is it? Why didn't you tell us?

689
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,080
I'm saying it now.

690
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,070
I'm seeing someone.

691
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,949
I'll introduce him to you one day.

692
00:53:27,949 --> 00:53:30,509
Right now, the situation isn't so good.

693
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,430
What do you mean by, the situation isn't good?

694
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,769
How could you have a boyfriend? You weren't dating anyone.

695
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:37,449
Who is it? Chan Wook? Seong Woo? Gi Yong?

696
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:39,650
Come on and tell me. Or I'll really be upset this time.

697
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,289
- Tell me... 
 - Gosh!

698
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,410
Just eat the meat.

699
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,300
Give me some water.

700
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,660
Seon Woo is drinking so much today.

701
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,580
I've never seen him this drunk.

702
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,340
But he looks even more handsome.

703
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,629
- Hey. 
 - Where are you going?

704
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,420
- Don't go. 
 - Where are you going?

705
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,540
What time is it now?

706
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,049
So tell me. How did you meet him?

707
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:03,259
I want the whole story. Do you have a photo of him?

708
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,059
Come on. I said I should go home.

709
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,700
No, I want to drink more.

710
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,169
If you're busy, just go.

711
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,359
I will take him home today.

712
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,470
Are you sure? He's horrible with alcohol.

713
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,170
I know he is.

714
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:24,959
I owe him a bit, so I'll take care of him today.

715
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:28,690
Then please take care of him. Thanks, Hye Sun.

716
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,320
What a disloyal friend she is.

717
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,349
Seriously, Hye Sun. Can you believe it?

718
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,369
How could she have secrets from us?

719
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:42,260
We are not just anybody, are we?

720
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,610
This is why they say the axe you trust stabs you in the back.

721
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:50,530
"The axe you trust stabs you in the back"?

722
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:55,099
Well, it doesn't mean you actually get stabbed by an axe.

723
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:59,740
I know. It means you get betrayed by someone you trusted.

724
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,209
It was written in the second chapter of the book you got me.

725
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:05,989
You read the book?

726
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:09,670
I'm so proud of you, Hye Sun.

727
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,090
Well done.

728
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:16,119
Well done.

729
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,300
Well done.

730
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,790
What are you doing?

731
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,330
You're still wet behind the ears.

732
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,690
I'll keep drinking then.

733
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,360
Dam.

734
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,670
Are you going home? I'll take you home.

735
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,920
You're not taking me anywhere. You're almost crawling.

736
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,080
You drove here, right? Do you want me to call you a chauffeur?

737
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,190
No.

738
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,410
I'll walk home.

739
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,280
You can't walk to Seocho-dong.

740
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,940
You remember where I live.

741
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,429
You're drunk. Instead of staying here all alone, go back inside,

742
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,800
sober up, and...

743
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,220
It's a free hug. It's free for you.

744
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:01,950

745
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:27,720
♫  Not once was I able to tell you that I love you  ♫

746
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,370
♫  And I still haven't been able to show you  ♫

747
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:37,110

748
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:42,230
♫  So now, I will go to you  ♫

749
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,830
♫  Get close to you  ♫

750
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:55,710
♫  Like you and I, crossing each other in the cold breeze  ♫

751
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,330
♫  I'm scared I won't be able to see you again  ♫

752
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,400

~ Preview ~

753
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,990
 Can I come to your place? It's been a while.

754
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,569
 Don't worry about touching.

755
00:59:10,569 --> 00:59:13,289
 I'm just worried I might take your energy...

756
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:16,289
 When I woke up, I was half-naked in a hotel.

757
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:16,949
 Are you crazy?

758
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:21,359
 To get close to you, Miss Dam, I have to think through a lot of things.

759
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,059
 But it seemed too easy for him.

760
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,979
 When the red thread of fate ties two people together,

761
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,340
 they end up growing feelings for each other.

762
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,079
 Don't make me jealous.

763
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:33,970
 My boyfriend, whom I really like a lot.

764
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:34,840
 Dam!

765
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,880
♫  Then look back at me  ♫

766
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,330
♫  Once again, I spent a night filled with you  ♫
