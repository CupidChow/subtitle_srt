1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:10,960

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,989

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,970

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,700

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,780

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,870

7
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,100

8
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,460
Sir, you're up early.

9
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,020
 Today is the day

10
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,560
 I should let her go.

11
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,640
Why do you look at me like that?

12
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,140
Miss Dam.

13
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,700
Are you free tonight?

14
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,360
Sorry?

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,739
I thought we should grab a cup of coffee at a nice cafe.

16
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,500
Sounds good. I'd love to.

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,900
I'm having tiramisu too.

18
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,959
Turn in your reports before the weekend.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,490
 - Yes, Professor. 
 - Yes, Professor.

20
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,140
- Could you check this? 
 - Yes, that's it.

21
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,259
I went through everything here.

22
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,639
 - Thank you.  
 - What are you doing? What is that?

23
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,070
I've been making a list of great places to go

24
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,819
with my future girlfriend.

25
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,080
I never know where to take girls when I actually date them.

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,890
Hey, doesn't this place look great?

27
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,360
It's quiet and desolate, so you can solely focus on each other.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,479
If I didn't total my car, I would've taken you two there to practice.

29
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,600
Where is this place?

30
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,590
 Sir! I found this new popular cafe.

31
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,779
 I'll be there right after my classes. See you at 8 p.m.

32
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,320

33
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,350
 I'll take off soon too.

34
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,060
 Breaking news. The third possible victim

35
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,979
 of the Downtown Murder has been found.

36
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,579
 Like the victims before, the victim had been murdered

37
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,909
 without any weapons found on the scene.

38
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,630
 The victim had been attacked once before and was already hospitalized.

39
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,970
Hello?

40
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,550
Ms. Hwang Yoo Jin?

41
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,059
 The police are investigating,

42
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,140
 but they have yet to figure out the motive.

43
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,090

44
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,870
Sunbae, so we don't have any evidence on the CCTV footage or witnesses again?

45
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,260
Who is this, and how do they manage to not leave a trace behind?

46
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,840
Sunbae.

47
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,140
What's with him?

48
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,219

49
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,690

50
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,469

51
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,789

52
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,870

53
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,129

54
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,360

55
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,569

56
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,890
 You seem to be here alone, as always.

57
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,320

58
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,610
 You come here often, so this is on the house.

59
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,150
 You should give it a try.

60
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
All these women were involved with you?

61
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,670
Why did this case make you concerned?

62
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,080
I still have good hunches.

63
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,070
It obviously doesn't look like something a human would do,

64
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,280
just as you noticed.

65
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,490
It couldn't be that old man, could it?

66
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,309
I know he has a peculiar taste, but he can't be this wicked.

67
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,250
Why did the assailant go after these women instead of me?

68
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,660
I do know one thing for sure.

69
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,099
If this attacker is after the women around you,

70
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,530
think about who'll be next.

71
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,120
Sir, you're here.

72
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,370
What's wrong?

73
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,350
Miss Dam.

74
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,370
I think I might be making another mistake,

75
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,830
and I may end up regretting this moment.

76
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
But for now, stay by my side.

77
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,840
Sir, did something happen?

78
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,379
- Sorry? 
 - You haven't said anything for a while,

79
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,980
and you don't look too well.

80
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,680
I also don't understand, what you meant by what you said back there.

81
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,210
Right. It didn't mean anything.

82
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,480
You don't have to mind it.

83
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,560
Oh, okay.

84
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,510
He definitely says things I cannot understand from time to time.

85
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,970
Sir, I'm going to school.

86
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,270
- I'll go with you. 
 - Sorry?

87
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,380
I'll give you a ride.

88
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,230
You will?

89
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,380
Sir, why are you suddenly giving me a ride?

90
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,829
I'll take you and bring you back from school for a while.

91
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,560
For a while? Why?

92
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,340
My project has taken off,

93
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,789
so I have to be at work at the publisher every day for the time being.

94
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,029
I see.

95
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,210
Your school is on the way, so I thought it'd be great to commute together.

96
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,870
Of course, it's great news for me.

97
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,199
I mean, it's great for the environment

98
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
since we won't waste more fuels,

99
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,270
and I get to save my bus fares.

100
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,880
I'll buy you a meal one of these days with the bus fares I saved.

101
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,590
What? You're going to keep her by your side?

102
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,660
Are you serious?

103
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,570
Keeping her with you is honestly the most dangerous move.

104
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,969
You said the victims were all women involved with you.

105
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,479
I thought she'd be safer with me until I find out exactly what's going on.

106
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:13,740
If anything happens to her, I'm also the one who could protect her best.

107
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,039
But here's the thing I don't get.

108
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:21,389
If you think about it, that kid at your house was closer to you than any other woman.

109
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:24,239
How did she manage to stay safe?

110
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,110
That's what I find relieving and questionable at the same time.

111
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,430
Anyway, keep an eye on Miss Dam. I ask of you.

112
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,419
I can't believe you're asking me for something of a favor.

113
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,410
I still trust this hunch you still have left.

114
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,920
You trust me?

115
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,069
Well, I'll see.

116
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,570
I'll keep my eyes on her if I have any extra time.

117
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,809
Hey, Hye Sun.

118
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,410
The road is very big. Why are you walking right behind me?

119
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,840
I must've been gum in my past life.

120
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,789
Hye Sun, why are you keep staring at me?

121
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,170
Tell me about it. Were you a CCTV in your past life?

122
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,179
- Hey, Jae Jin! 
 - Are you okay?

123
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,149
I'm sorry.

124
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:55,650
I thought someone was attacking Dam.

125
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,760
- I... 
 - I wasn't attacking her.

126
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,930
I was trying to surprise her like that.

127
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,339
We have no time, so I'll skip the attendance and go right into the lecture.

128
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,980
Next week is waiting for you.

129
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,640
You remember what's coming up, right?

130
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,600
 - Yes. 
 - Whatever.

131
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,350
What about next week? What is it?

132
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,609
 Sir, what am I going to do? I'm scared.

133
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,400
What's going on, Miss Dam?

134
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,190
I'm about to... take my midterms.

135
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,770
And that's scary?

136
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:38,280
Of course, nothing is scarier than tests for college students.

137
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,149
So I'm going to stop by the bookstore before I go home today.

138
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,880
 You don't have to pick me up today.

139
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,020
Okay.

140
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,079

141
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,320
Right, he said he writes humanities books.

142
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,970

143
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,340
His book is really here.

144
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,250

145
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,170
You must like this book.

146
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,540
Yes.

147
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,400
Thank you.

148
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,600
Be careful.

149
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,080
Miss Dam.

150
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,390
Hey, sir.

151
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,199
What are you doing?

152
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,630
I bumped into this man...

153
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,910
What? Where did he go?

154
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,550
He was here just now.

155
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,270
Anyway, what brings you here, sir?

156
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,100
I just came to browse some books.

157
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,930
- What are those? 
 - These are related to my major.

158
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,570
I see.

159
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,790
Hey, Miss Dam.

160
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,570
About that man you ran into at the bookstore.

161
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,199
What was he like?

162
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,849
Could you tell me what he was wearing, how old he looked,

163
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,380
and anything else you remember?

164
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,510
I'm not sure. It happened so quickly, so I don't exactly remember.

165
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,489
He looked pretty cold,

166
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,289
and he was maybe in his early thirties,

167
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,140
around the same age as you.

168
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,600
What is it?

169
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,060
I was concerned.

170
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,169
 What's going on? If he's concerned

171
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,529
 that a stranger came up and talked to me...

172
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,430
There are lots of awful crimes these days.

173
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,770
Right, crimes. You're right.

174
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,199
So while we're at it,

175
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,069
I think it might be better if you avoid strangers from now on.

176
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,089
Sure.

177
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,250
If anything happens and seems out of the ordinary, please let me know.

178
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,540
I get worried.

179
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,710
You get worried?

180
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,000
Come on, sir. I'm not a kid.

181
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,690
Sir.

182
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,890
Ta-da.

183
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,750
I bought this.

184
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,110

185
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,450

186
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,920
Why did you buy that?

187
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,350
I wanted to have a read.

188
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,990
May I get your autograph?

189
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,600
I've never done that before.

190
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,380
It's a bit awkward.

191
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,220
I see.

192
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,356

193
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,580
Wait, is this me?

194
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,330
That looks worse than I actually do.

195
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,209
Then let me get you a new book.

196
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,399
No.

197
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,509
I'll just keep it.

198
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,530
You took the time to draw it.

199
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,795
 Here's the question and the summary on the history of late Goryeo.

200
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:54,850

201
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,560
Sir.

202
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,930
May I make use of you?

203
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,099
Make use of me?

204
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:03,619
Soo Kyeong pointed out a possible test subject for me,

205
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,339
discussing the background for annotations of "Tripitaka Koreana."

206
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,960
I want to get a detailed explanation from you, who lived through that time.

207
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,710
Annotations of "Tripitaka Koreana."

208
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,059
I have related products downstairs.

209
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,810
- Do you want to come with me? 
 - Sure.

210
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,699
As you know, the annotations were created to supplement the first edition.

211
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,759
And that's called a sutra plaque.

212
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,279
It's a sort of a mark to discern what's written in the annotation.

213
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,310
It's like a table of contents.

214
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,980
I'm highly interested in the Buddhist culture.

215
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,350
Sir, let's go on a trip to a Buddhist temple after my midterm.

216
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,819
A trip?

217
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:46,850
Why not? Don't you like going on trips?

218
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,860
No, it's not that I hate it.

219
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,939
It's my first time.

220
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:52,800
You always say it's your first time.

221
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,569
Your first time living with someone.

222
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:56,189
Your first time having someone as close as family.

223
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:59,250
And your first time signing an autograph. You always say that.

224
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,960
Did you only cultivate your morals over a thousand years?

225
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,140
What would you have done without me?

226
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,160
I wonder.

227
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,920
Then we have no choice but to go on a trip.

228
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,109
I mean, I've been worried about you lately.

229
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,620
You kept saying all these mysterious things.

230
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,909
So I wondered if you'd adapt well once you become a human,

231
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:28,230
but I think it might be your lack of experience.

232
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,649
Since you can enlarge your experience through this chance,

233
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:34,390
I would like to go with you.

234
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,730
Okay, let's go on a trip.

235
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,370
Really?

236
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,570
Then promise me.

237
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,590
I promise.

238
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,530
It's hot here.

239
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,991
Sir, may I borrow this book?

240
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,390

241
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,650

242
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,110

243
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,670
This must be a portrait.

244
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,940
Seo... Hwa.

245
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,060
That sounds like a woman's name.

246
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,010
Jeong... Da?

247
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,050
I think that means deep affection.

248
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,950
Excuse me, sir.

249
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,059
"Teuk, geup, jeong, da, mong, jung, ji, yeon."

250
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,900
Does that mean the love was so special that you miss someone even in your dreams?

251
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,260
You're right.

252
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,330
Who's Seo Hwa?

253
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,780
I found this portrait in the book, so I ended up seeing it.

254
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,690
If you missed her even in your dreams, I thought she could be your first love.

255
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,790
- Why was that in there? 
 - She was, wasn't she?

256
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,410
Her portrait and this letter.

257
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,790
She's obviously your first love. Right?

258
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,720
I guess that might be the most appropriate expression.

259
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,360
First love.

260
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,780
Miss Dam.

261
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,720
Goodness, I'm sorry.

262
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,660
Thanks for showing your first love...

263
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,030
I mean, your book.

264
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,420
A portrait and a love letter?

265
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,220
He had lots of romantic experiences, didn't he?

266
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,560
But wait.

267
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,150
He drew her so gorgeously with every stroke of his brush.

268
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,190

269
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,320
But he draws me like this.

270
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,030
Excuse me, sir.

271
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,820
I'm asking you without any intentions,

272
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,550
so this question is purely academic.

273
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,560
How did people date back in the Joseon era?

274
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,600
Did you push a lady on the swing

275
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,100
just like Lee Mong Ryong and Chun Hyang? 
  (T/N: couple in old Korean tale set in Joseon)

276
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,470
I think so.

277
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,670
Then

278
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,230
did you buy her a norigae out on the streets? 
  (T/N: traditional Korean accessory)

279
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,850
I've never done that, but I did buy her flower shoes. 
  (T/N: traditional Korean women's shoes, only nobles would wear)

280
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,920
I see. You must've liked her a lot.

281
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,290
Well, from the portrait, I could see how elegant and beautiful she was.

282
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,540
- She looks like her. 
 - Sorry?

283
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,350
No, never mind. Nothing.

284
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,560
Hey, can you stop making that noise?

285
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,249
You're making me lose focus.

286
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,240
There she is.

287
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,570
The highly sensitive Soo Kyeong, who shows up during the exam period.

288
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,319
My sensitivity and fierceness are

289
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,680
what made me the top student in our major.

290
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,929
I'm going out for two more cups

291
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,750
of instant coffee to wake up.

292
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,090
Goodness, she always overreacts.

293
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,499
- Hey. 
 - Fine. I'll eat quietly.

294
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,770
No, it's not that.

295
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,860
What does first love mean to men?

296
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,090
First love? All of a sudden?

297
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,230
I just got curious.

298
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,910
First love.

299
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,590
Those two words make you feel so sentimental and painful.

300
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,020
I had my first love back in middle school.

301
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,350
We broke up over the most heartrending reason.

302
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,410
She was terminally ill.

303
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,830
- Really? 
 - No, she lied to me.

304
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,560
It turns out she two-timed me with a close friend.

305
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,800
Even though she made up such an absurd lie,

306
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,610
I still couldn't forget her just because she was my first love.

307
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,930
People say,

308
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,580
all men have one room in their hearts they keep for life.

309
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,280
The room where they keep their first love until the day they die.

310
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,569
So if he doesn't die, she lives on in that room for life?

311
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,580
Precisely. She checks in, but there is no check-out hour.

312
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,880
You may face a peak season with other people you love,

313
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,130
but that room is always sold out. No one can take it.

314
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,150
Goodness, you.

315
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,290

316
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,850
Hello, Sir.

317
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,469
 What time will you be done today?

318
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,580
Well, I don't think

319
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,450
you have to pick me up today.

320
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,730
No, nothing is going on. I just wanted to walk a little.

321
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,320
Then let's walk together.

322
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,400
So why did you suddenly want to walk today?

323
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,840
Just because. The weather was so nice.

324
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,490
- Goodbye. 
 - Thank you.

325
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,340
Miss Dam?

326
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,740
Yes?

327
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,459
Let's go.

328
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,629
I said I'll buy you tteokbokki with the bus fare I saved.

329
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,010
Let's go eat that now.

330
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,330
Is something wrong, Miss Dam?

331
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,690
What?

332
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,740
You don't seem very well.

333
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,820
No, it's nothing.

334
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,100
Anyway,

335
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,000
Jae Jin told me

336
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,180
that all men have a room in their hearts.

337
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,020
And in that room,

338
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,770
they keep their first love for the rest of their lives.

339
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,760
Is that true?

340
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,030
I'm not sure.

341
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,500
What about you?

342
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,300
For quite a long while, I thought about her from time to time.

343
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,130
 I feel like such a fool.

344
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,030
 I hate myself for getting concerned over something that happened

345
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,130
 hundreds of years ago.

346
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,180
What's going on? Why are you sighing?

347
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,240
Is that guy you asked out troubling you again?

348
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,549
- What? 
 - I knew something was up when you suddenly asked me about men's first love.

349
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,320
Did his first love show up or something?

350
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,570
No, that's not the case. But—

351
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,430
Just forget about it.

352
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,280
You don't have to mind the past.

353
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,670
It's not like you can undo what already happened.

354
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,400
I know that.

355
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,360
But I get jealous.

356
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,930
I hate how ridiculous I am,

357
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,790
but that's how I feel.

358
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,670
What's wrong with me?

359
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,470
I think that's only natural.

360
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,370
There comes a moment in everyone's life when they lose their usual pace.

361
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,410
It happens once you like someone.

362
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,930
That happens when you like someone.

363
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,870
Hey.

364
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,810
How are your studies going for the midterms? Do you start tomorrow?

365
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,970
Why do you care?

366
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,600
Well, I wanted to bid you good luck.

367
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,849
And I quit smoking.

368
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,270
You said you hated it.

369
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,040
Dam, let's eat lunch.

370
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,900
What? With me?

371
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,190
Is there another Dam here? Let's go.

372
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,650
Seon Woo, what you need to quit is your interest in Dam, not smoking.

373
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,079
Why have you been like this to me lately?

374
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,830
Like what?

375
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:17,379
I mean, you're always around me, and you suddenly wanted to eat with me.

376
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:19,590
Because I was asked to...

377
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,500
You were asked to do this?

378
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,360
This monk I know asked me to be kind to others.

379
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,640
That's how I can gain virtue and reborn into a good next life.

380
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,029
I see. So you were a Buddhist.

381
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:40,160
Something like that.

382
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,819
But I don't even expect to reborn into a good next life.

383
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:49,059
I just want to live according to my fate and place,

384
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:52,049
enjoying this troublesome life to the fullest.

385
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,130
That's all I want.

386
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,529
Hye Sun, you sometimes seem like you have years of experience from the way you talk.

387
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:03,130
Why are you criticizing me while I'm being kind to you?

388
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,790
Criticizing you? It's a good thing to come off as an experienced person.

389
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,779
I'm not sure. I hate it when people say

390
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:13,170
I seem seasoned as if I have years of experience.

391
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:18,109
It looked like humans think longevity is a blessing and want to live forever.

392
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,159
Imagine if you live for almost an eternity.

393
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,320
How do you think it'll feel?

394
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,970
I didn't expect you to find me.

395
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,190
It has been a while, fox.

396
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:01,360
Don't call me a fox. I'm a human now.

397
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,169
Then live like a human.

398
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:06,960
Stop coming to a place like this by using his petty magic.

399
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,559
Don't be afraid.

400
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,480
I don't mean that I'll ruin your life right now.

401
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,219
Old man, you know about this, right?

402
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:23,619
Know what?

403
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:27,560
The mysterious happenings surrounding Woo Yeo.

404
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,700
I can tell by your face that you do know. Help him.

405
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,549
I'm not sure. Don't you think this is his job?

406
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:39,610
If you have anything to say, you can tell me.

407
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,759
Woo Yeo, what have you been doing to this day?

408
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,009
Hye Sun is younger than you, yet she became a human ages ago.

409
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,039
I said I wanted to become a human,

410
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,620
then you told me to collect human energy to become one.

411
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,420
I've always known you weren't the kindest guy since then.

412
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,550
It must've been lots of fun

413
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,370
if you just stood back and watched me to this day.

414
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,640
Fun?

415
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,320
I may not look like it, but I'm a mountain spirit.

416
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,270
What benefits would I get from pestering you?

417
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:18,170
My job is to take care of your destiny.

418
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:24,790
Which is why I have been watching over that kid.

419
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,470
Are you saying you're the reason Dam has been safe all this time?

420
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,779
Of course.

421
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,130
She has been protected by my magic spell.

422
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,930
 I was hovering around her at times,

423
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,140
 and around you at others.

424
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,830
So,

425
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,800
from whom have you been protecting us?

426
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,000
When a gumiho lives a thousand years, it turns into a maegu.

427
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,159
Maegu?

428
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,289
I didn't want you to turn into such a wicked creature.

429
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,229
Therefore, I thought I might as well eliminate you

430
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,650
if you fail to become a human within a thousand years.

431
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,040
Why would you suddenly talk about elimination?

432
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,638
There has appeared one who goes against nature and disrupts the order.

433
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,429
A maegu who has lived a thousand years and failed to become a human

434
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,359
refused to be eliminated and turned into an evil spirit.

435
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,269
And it covets your Bead.

436
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,908
Wait.

437
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,759
An evil spirit covets the Bead?

438
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,299
What does it need it for?

439
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,950
It has a silly belief that it might make it a human.

440
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,470
You should have made sure to eliminate it in the first place.

441
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,849
You had one job.

442
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,189
So where's this evil spirit called maegu or whatever?

443
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,650
Even if you don't try, you'll eventually bump into it.

444
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,389
It couldn't find what it wanted,

445
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,489
and it will now try to find it from you, the owner of the Bead.

446
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,639
And now a human's life is in my hand because I did my job.

447
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:08,570
I do not want to disturb order,

448
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,480
so I think I should stop here.

449
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,360
I'm saying I'm not protecting her anymore.

450
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,070
What does that...

451
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,730
Miss Dam.

452
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,009
Sir.

453
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,379
- Are you okay? 
 - What do you mean?

454
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,549
Why didn't you call me? I said I would come to pick you up.

455
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,080
Right. The class suddenly got canceled, so...

456
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,000
Sir.

457
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,440
Let's go home now.

458
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,910
I want you to go first.

459
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,100
I'll catch up with you right away.

460
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,030

461
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,080
I know why you appeared with that face.

462
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,740
You want the Bead.

463
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,810
You don't have the Bead anyway.

464
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,310
Sir.

465
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,630
Is everything okay?

466
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,710
Did something happen at the flower shop?

467
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,530
Never mind.

468
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,890
Miss Dam.

469
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,580
All I think about is you.

470
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,160
I promised I would protect you.

471
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,740
And I always think about

472
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,820
how I can keep my word.

473
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,240
Everything I ever said to you,

474
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,910
I meant every word.

475
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,480
So...

476
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,160
trust me.

477
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,300
 It's funny

478
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,990
 how a few words can make me feel better

479
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,170
 though I have been upset the whole time.

480
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,990
Yes, Sir.

481
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,500
- Miss Dam. 
 - What's up?

482
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,300
Well...

483
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,860
I don't feel comfortable leaving you alone.

484
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,800
Would you mind

485
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,660
staying with me tonight?

486
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,559
Hey, I get you're busy, but you should wash your hair.

487
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:21,719
Your hair is so oily it can be an oil mill.

488
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,649
Whatever. I barely have enough time to learn.

489
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,059
I don't have time to wash my hair.

490
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,750
Gosh.

491
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,900
Take a look if you like.

492
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,359
What is it?

493
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,560

494
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,250
- Awesome! These are past exam materials. 
 - Hey!

495
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,250
This...

496
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,299
and this are musts.

497
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,900
They'll definitely be on the exam.

498
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,680
This is awesome.

499
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,910
Soo Kyeong, on the inside, you are the most beautiful person.

500
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,200
How about on the outside?

501
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,230
Tell me.

502
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,210
On the outside...

503
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,070
You haven't gone home yet.

504
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,760
- Hi. 
 - Keep it up.

505
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,120
Soo Kyeong.

506
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,930
I heard you had the past exam materials of Korean Medieval History.

507
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,490
Could you share it with me?

508
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,530
Sunbae.

509
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,569
You know, during the late Joseon period,

510
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,220
family history books were often traded.

511
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,020
- Yes, I know that of course. 
 - What was society like then?

512
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,169
It was chaotic.

513
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:30,969
That's right.

514
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,209
I turned everyone down, so if I share it with you,

515
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,490
it will make society chaotic, I think.

516
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,459
You have your point.

517
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:42,600
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked. Good luck then.

518
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,250
Why won't you share it with him?

519
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,710
I get it. You don't want to help him because he's your rival.

520
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,769
He's not my rival.

521
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,319
I have never left my throne.

522
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,079
I have always been the top.

523
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,349
I'm unrivaled.

524
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,289
Come on. That's not quite true.

525
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,709
You're the top student because you focus only on studying.

526
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,039
And he's in second place while organizing all the events...

527
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,799
because he's a student representative.

528
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,049
Once he starts focusing only on studying,

529
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,850
he will be the top student, not you...

530
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,670
Which is never going to happen.

531
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,710
As long as you don't stop breathing, you'll always be the top student.

532
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,780
This is not right.

533
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,150
It's 1859, not 1857.

534
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,830
I see.

535
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,480
- Which year? 
 - 1859.

536
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,910
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

537
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,169
You seemed to have trouble focusing on study these days.

538
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:25,300
That's why I wanted to keep you company tonight.

539
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,389
To make sure you work hard.

540
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:32,660
Well, it's nice studying together anyway because I can get your help.

541
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,770
I guess I can make use of my long life sometimes.

542
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,159
 Imagine if you live for almost an eternity.

543
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:53,010
 How do you think it'll feel?

544
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,960
 In the end, you have to let go of all the people you love

545
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,440
 and all the good and bad memories will fade away.

546
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,730
 Is it really good to live a meaningless life like that?

547
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,720
 How does it feel to live a long life?

548
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,140
 Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything.

549
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,970
I will try to understand.

550
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,630
- What? 
 - I said, I'll try to understand.

551
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,389
What do you mean?

552
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:34,329
You also say a lot of things I don't understand.

553
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:37,240
So just pretend you got what I mean.

554
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,179
 The feeling of liking someone

555
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:00,300
 can be quite childish.

556
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,060
 That childish feeling sometimes bothers me,

557
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,030
 but I wish it doesn't go away.

558
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,060
♫  Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper  ♫

559
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,350
♫  I’m seeping into you  ♫

560
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,870
♫  The longer I wait, they'll get deeper  ♫

561
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:30,070
♫  Ask the moon  ♫

562
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:34,690
♫  Tell me now, how are you doing it?  ♫

563
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,980
♫  My nights are filled with you  ♫

564
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:42,780
♫  Stare at me now, I wanna be your moon  ♫

565
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:47,720
♫  Though I know I’m still awkward and inexperienced  ♫

566
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,550
♫  Still,  ♫

567
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,760
♫  I’ll hold out my hand  ♫

568
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,950
♫  That moon is the door to you  ♫

569
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,870
Seriously, everything you mentioned was on the exam.

570
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,219
Did you wash your hair, by the way?

571
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:06,580
I got changed too.

572
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,390
What am I going to do? I messed up my first exam.

573
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,430
I shouldn't have studied with him. I couldn't focus.

574
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:21,000
Him? You studied with someone?

575
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,090
With Dan. He's taking exams too.

576
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,879
Why are you smirking?

577
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:32,740
- As if you nailed it or something. 
 - I did nail it.

578
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,869
I almost got a heart attack when I got the exam paper.

579
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,370
All the exam materials Soo Kyeong shared with me were on the exam.

580
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,830
I had so much to write, but there wasn't much space for it.

581
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,510
What? Am I the only one who messed it up?

582
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,990
Yes. You're the only one.

583
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,339
You'll let me see your notes and the exam materials again, right?

584
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:51,750
Where's your conscience?

585
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,319
It's very brazen of you to ask me to share the fruit of my hard work.

586
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,710
I'm not brazen.

587
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,870
I'm going to buy you food and drinks. I'll be nice to you.

588
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,790
Not interested. I've got to go.

589
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,509
Hey, Soo Kyeong.

590
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,720
She said she's studying in the library the whole night. Let's go join her.

591
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,629
You need to be around a banquet to get some food

592
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,650
and be around the top student to get some tips.

593
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,869
- You're right, but... 
 - The exam is tomorrow morning.

594
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,590
You don't want to waste time traveling back and forth.

595
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,610
Miss, do you want to retake this class next semester?

596
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,760
- No, sir. 
 - Let's go.

597
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,539
I'm sorry. I can't go home today.

598
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:35,090
I really messed up the exam.

599
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,729
I think I should study with my friends today.

600
00:48:37,729 --> 00:48:39,749
 Okay. Good luck.

601
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:42,380
 And call me if something happens.

602
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,440
Okay. I'll text you immediately.

603
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,519
- Hello. 
  - Writer Shin.

604
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,000
 This is Kim So Jeong from Haemil Publishers.

605
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,129
 A detective is going to call you soon

606
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:42,070
 so I thought I might as well give you a heads-up.

607
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,860
What?

608
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,760
 Apparently, Ms. Hwang said something

609
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,790
 before that incident.

610
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,569
 And all the people related

611
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,810
 are required to be interviewed.

612
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,000
 She said she was familiar with the culprit's face.

613
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,600
 She was familiar with the face?

614
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,440
 You don't have the Bead anyway.

615
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,130
 If this person can change their appearance and Ms. Hwang was familiar with the face...

616
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:39,570
Sir, what are you doing here?

617
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,860
I came to see you.

618
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,160
I was wondering if you were doing all right.

619
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,970
I guess it bothered you that I'm staying out.

620
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,970
I found it.

621
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,510
What?

622
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,849
 Sir, why did you suddenly disappear?

623
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,035
 Is everything all right?

624
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:06,340
Everything is all right.

625
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,950
You scared me.

626
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,870
What happened? I was worried about you.

627
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:17,340
But what where you saying you found?

628
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,140
I said that because I found you.

629
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,900
Now, everything will be all right.

630
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,600
What do you mean?

631
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,509
If you want to come home because you get tired or sleepy, call me.

632
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:57,600
I'll come pick you up any time.

633
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,190
Okay.

634
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,330
Are you okay?

635
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:39,030
I guess all kinds of things happen when you live a long life.

636
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,229
Now, don't worry about other things and focus on your original goal.

637
00:54:44,229 --> 00:54:46,860
You're almost there.

638
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,190
I know it's upsetting.

639
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,110
But there must be a reason why the Bead changed its color for the first time.

640
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:00,920
So do everything you can to keep her.

641
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,260
If you become an evil spirit just like the old man said...

642
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:13,560
 How does it feel to witness the vain end?

643
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,700
 I want you to remember this day.

644
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,700
 It can happen to you, too.

645
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,339
 Think of the girl as your last hope and become a human.

646
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:45,010
 I truly wish you won't meet a tragic end like this.

647
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,030
Why aren't you saying anything?

648
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,019
It's finally over. It feels so good.

649
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:08,769
Thanks, Soo Kyeong. You helped me a lot.

650
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:11,599
If you thank me so much, buy me some grilled pork belly.

651
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:12,809
Okay. Why don't we go now?

652
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:14,409
Grilled pork belly, soju and beer?

653
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:15,689
I'd love to!

654
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,010
Where should we go?

655
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,839
What was that place called where they had great fried rice?

656
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:24,200
 Miss Dam, now your exams are finished, why don't we go on a trip?

657
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,179
Guys, I have an appointment. I've got to go.

658
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,519
I'm sorry. I'll buy you grilled pork belly and beef tripe next time.

659
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:31,709
- Sorry. Bye. 
 - Hey.

660
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:34,430
Hey. Darn it.

661
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,809
It's okay. It's just the two of us, so it'll be cheaper.

662
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,569
- Come on. Let's go. 
 - Forget it.

663
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,970
Dam can't even make it, let's just go another time.

664
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:47,570
I mean, I don't want to be hanging around the campus looking like this.

665
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,179
You know, I'm the Kim Tae Hee of Seogwa University.

666
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,080
You know what I mean.

667
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:54,649
Listen, my friend.

668
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:56,829
I really didn't want to say this because you helped me a lot,

669
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,289
but why do you keep bringing up  the  Kim Tae Hee?

670
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:02,330
The only thing you two have in common is that you have a face.

671
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,540
What are you saying? I totally look like Kim Tae Hee.

672
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,580
How do I make you understand?

673
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,549
Hey, wait. Since you always say the truth, please answer me.

674
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:15,910
Does she look like Kim Tae Hee?

675
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,629
Yes, she does.

676
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:19,280
What?

677
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:26,050
Kim Dae Hee, the comedian who used to be on "Gag Concert", right?

678
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,330
You look a lot like him.

679
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,530
Bye then.

680
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,970
Let's eat. 
  (T/N: parody of Kim Dae Hee's famous gag)

681
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Hey! Stop right there!

682
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,950
Be careful. You might fall.

683
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,200
See? I told you to be careful.

684
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,060
Right. That was close.

685
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,690
By the way, why a trip all of a sudden?

686
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,309
We agreed to go on a trip together when your exams were finished.

687
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:20,019
Right.

688
00:58:20,019 --> 00:58:23,640
But I didn't know it would be on the very day the exam was over.

689
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,359
Should we try another day then?

690
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,519
No. You say that only when you buy lottery tickets.

691
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,840
Let's go.

692
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,560
Let's take a bus this time.

693
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:46,590
♫   If I carefully approach you  ♫

694
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,590
Why did you suggest we ride a bus this time?

695
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:53,520
Well. I wanted to go slowly.

696
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,160
Slowly. That sounds great.

697
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:03,280
♫   Suddenly, I’m right in front of you. One step closer,  ♫

698
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,590
♫  with all my courage. My heart is moving  ♫

699
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:15,090
♫   And your heart is also slowly flowing towards me  ♫

700
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,970
How about that?

701
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:21,270
♫   I’ve softly hidden   ♫

702
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,120
Oh, I want to make a wish too.

703
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,830
♫  this one truth inside my heart  ♫

704
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:34,600
♫   I want to give that to you 
 And embrace your heart that has returned  ♫

705
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:44,810
♫   I want to give that to you 
 And embrace your heart that has returned  ♫

706
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:14,140
By the way, do you have a wish too?

707
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,019
I mean, you can use magic whenever you want,

708
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:20,189
you've been accumulating wealth for almost a thousand years,

709
01:00:20,189 --> 01:00:21,999
and you're so tall and handsome.

710
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,680
I wonder what wish you can possibly have.

711
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,980
Oh. Maybe you wished the Bead comes out soon so you can be a human.

712
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,520
I made a wish for you.

713
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,640
For me?

714
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:42,370
You have a beautiful smile, so I wished you would have many things to smile about in the future.

715
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:49,590
I know you will make your dreams come true, so I wished you wouldn't give up on what you like.

716
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:59,800
And I wished you wouldn't get hurt by others.

717
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,970
I wished you would always be well.

718
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:20,570
It's so pretty.

719
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,210
Don't you think, Sir?

720
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,810
I'm so glad we came here.

721
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,900
Sir.

722
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,770
Let's come back here next year.

723
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,429
Actually, earlier in front of the stone tower,

724
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:48,950
I wished I could come back here next year with you.

725
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,140
But not like this.

726
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,630
I wished you could come with me as a human.

727
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,770
Miss Dam.

728
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:05,090
Do you remember what I said then?

729
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,240
What do you mean?

730
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,610
I said I had never had a family, but I felt like I got one now.

731
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,810
I really meant what I said.

732
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:25,650
Nobody has ever stayed with me for this long.

733
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:30,620
I've been used to being alone.

734
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,650
Then...

735
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,029
 Then...

736
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,259

737
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,400
 I met you.

738
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:48,120
 And you happened to become special to me.

739
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,800
♫  Not once  ♫

740
01:02:52,910 --> 01:03:00,380
♫  was I able to tell you that I love you  ♫

741

♫  Get close to you  ♫

745
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,740
I lied.

746
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,740
I knew how to take out the Bead

747
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,890
from the beginning.

748
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,850
But I lied to you.

749
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,720
♫  Now,  ♫

750
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:39,490
I needed energy to become human,

751
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,190
and, you of all people, had to be there.

752

01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,840
You won't remember a thing.

758
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,610
When you wake up,

759
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:19,500
everything will be over.

760

775
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,199
 Sir, I'm home.

776
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:44,220
 Her kind voice.

777
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,699
 Her smile.

778
01:05:45,699 --> 01:05:47,149
 Seeing all that might have been a privilege.

779
01:05:47,149 --> 01:05:49,770
 You don't have time to lose looking miserable.

780
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:50,889

781
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:55,210
 I'm just watching her for a while. Just for a while.

782
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,489
 Are you free today?

783
01:05:57,489 --> 01:06:00,190
 Aren't you just pretending that you don't know?

784
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,030
 That I like you, aren't you?

785
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:06,750
 Is it really okay for you to see her doing just fine without you?

786
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,430
 I like someone else.

787
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:18,320
