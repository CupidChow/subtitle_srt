1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:08,080

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,989

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,610

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,270

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,880

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,070

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,210
Let me check one thing.

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,120
You can go back now.

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,380
Just think

10
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,220
all this was a dream.

11
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,289
I'll get going.

12
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,700
 What? The Bead turned blue?

13
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,080
It turned blue the moment you tried to take it back,

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,900
then it went back to normal?

15
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,880
How could that happen?

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,660
How did it go for you?

17
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,580
It turned blue at once.

18
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,090
Then I instinctively knew that

19
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,840
I became a human as of that moment.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,859
So? How do you feel?

21
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:30,289
I know it happened for a second, but it never changed colors before.

22
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,300
It felt very peculiar for me.

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,490
Well, a little, I guess.

24
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,880
And?

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,450
He hugged you?

26
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,310
Well, this isn't about me. She's a friend of mine.

27
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,220
The guy she lives with...

28
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,160
 Let me check one thing.

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,620
 suddenly wanted to check something, then grabbed her hand.

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,970
 And then he suddenly hugged her.

31
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,890
What kind of trick is he playing?

32
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,700
What do you mean, a trick? This is why I don't associate with kids who haven't dated before.

33
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,310
That's called expressing affection.

34
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,310
What do you think he was trying to check? It's obviously her love.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,930
Anyway, your friend got married young.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,170
Oh, she's not married. She's living with him.

37
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,578
But it's not affection. They don't like each other.

38
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,350
What? They live together even though they don't like each other? Why?

39
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,140
Well, one thing led to another and

40
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,380
now she's bearing a precious—

41
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,900
What?

42
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,440
She's pregnant?

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,110
She's not pregnant, but...

44
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,380
 Isn't it frustrating?

45
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,110
I...

46
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,600
You have no idea how to color the rest of the Bead blue.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,800
All I can do for now is keep an eye on her.

48
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,050
I finally get it.

49
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,390
You wouldn't let a random human stay by your side.

50
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,300
The Bead rolled into her

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,700
as if she's the owner right before your thousand years are up.

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,440
On top of that, although it was only a brief moment, it even turned blue.

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,310
I can see why you thought this was fate.

54
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,749
Anyway, be good to her as much as you can,

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,280
and do everything you can as best you can.

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,620
Why should I do that?

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,900
This might be the last chance you have.

58
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,550
In my experience, humans emit

59
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,910
the best kind of energy when they're happy.

60
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,770
So I made a lot of efforts to make them happy.

61
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,080
What did you do?

62
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,940
I dated them.

63
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,200
There's not a thing that would make a man happier.

64
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,730
Right.

65
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,450
You should just date her while you got this chance.

66
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,529
Nonsense.

67
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,620
I'm saying it because dating is the best way to get those endorphins flowing.

68
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,449
And, of course, I know how much you hate

69
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,100
to feign love and stay by a human's side.

70
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,120
But you have no other choice.

71
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,160
Hold it in

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,450
and date her.

73
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,050
Why would you say—

74
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,580
 Are you going to date me?

75
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,780
Then why did you hug me?

76
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,350
Oh, well...

77
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,900
I mean, I gave it a thought to figure out why you did that.

78
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,100
But you're the one who did something odd, so why should I be troubled?

79
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,920
So I decided to ask you.

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,859
What's going on?

81
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,250
At first,

82
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,920
I was really going to let you go.

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,260
But then it hit me

84
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,810
that I had to stay behind all by myself to figure this out,

85
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,260
and it made me feel hopeless.

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,040
So in a word,

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,919
it's like we're stuck on a deserted island,

88
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,240
but you felt as if you had to let me escape alone,

89
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,200
as if your only comrade were leaving?

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,690
Well, something like that.

91
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,400
I guess I can understand how you feel,

92
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,730
so I'll let you slide.

93
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,000
But from now on, don't do anything to lead people on.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,330
People will misunderstand what you did.

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,260
What if it's not a misunderstanding?

96
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,780
If I say I want to be your boyfriend, will you let me?

97
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,060
 If I say I want to be your boyfriend,

98
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,550
 will you let me?

99
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,390
 No, I won't.

100
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,449
 Because I'm a gumiho?

101
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,700
 You are not my type.

102
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,390
 But why do you ask?

103
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,730
 Well, I am

104
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,650
 feeling anxious and unable to think right,

105
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,640
 so it must be a withdrawal symptom.

106
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,220
 I see.

107
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,630
Why did I say that?

108
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,300
That was such a lame excuse.

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,990
Let's go relieve our hangovers first.

110
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,590
I had no time. I had to put on makeup.

111
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,640
I'm about to puke right now.

112
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,339
Dam, are you all done?

113
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,059
If you got some time, let's go eat.

114
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,189
Let's go.

115
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,350
Sunbaenim, hello.

116
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,319
- Hello. 
 - Hey.

117
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,609
Did you take care of that trouble?

118
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:29,759
Yes, thanks to you. Thank you very much.

119
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,910
What trouble?

120
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,209
Well, I—

121
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,589
She had some trouble with a project, so I helped her out.

122
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,928
I see, Dam.

123
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,079
I wonder what that project was. You didn't ask me, the top student,

124
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:43,860
- but went to bother him? 
 - You.

125
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,340
Aren't you leaving?

126
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,160
Should I be going?

127
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,249
Okay, then. Bye.

128
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,649
Are you really sure you're into Dam, not me?

129
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,780
Okay. I was leaving.

130
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,329
- I'll get— 
 - Let's eat.

131
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,340
We said we would grab a meal together.

132
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,280
Today?

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,679
Well, I don't have enough cash on me today.

134
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,899
I put most of my money into my savings account,

135
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,040
- and my pocket money— 
 - Let's go.

136
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,540
What? I'm really broke.

137
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,059

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,230

139
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:34,810
Sunbae, I thought I made myself clear when I said I didn't have any money.

140
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,709
It's on me.

141
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,960

142
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,290
In that case, I'll get carbonara.

143
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,680
- Two carbonaras. 
 - Sure.

144
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,609
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

145
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,810
I had you help me out, then made you buy for meals too.

146
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,930
Forget it.

147
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,010
I was going to anyway.

148
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,400
I wanted to grab a meal with you.

149
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,570
What?

150
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,270
With me?

151
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,809
 But she's not particularly like that to you.

152
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,789
 She builds a wall against all men, just like what her name, Dam, means. 
 (T/N: Dam in English is a wall built to stop the river's flow)

153
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,439
 It's like the Iron Curtain. No one can get through.

154
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,739
 Tae Jin tried to hit on her,

155
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:21,869
 but she turned him down at once. It was hilarious.

156
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,360
 You're actually comparing me to Tae Jin?

157
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,689
 Fine, you do look much better.

158
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,259
 But you both have that impression of a scumbag.

159
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:33,819
 Dam might be the type who's into people's character, not looks.

160
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,399
 Right.

161
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,210
 I think even Gye Seon Woo can't get Lee Dam.

162
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,780
 What's with that face? Do you feel confident?

163
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,609
 Let's make a bet and see if she falls for you, then.

164
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,149
 That's a very good idea.

165
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,150
 Let's make a bet for ₩100.000 ($100). Are you in?

166
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,960
 I'm in.

167
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,390
You can have this.

168
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,480
Is this seat available?

169
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Can I share your book?

170
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,330
 We're all meeting up at the back gate today. Want to come?

171
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,019
Why does he do this to me?

172
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,109
 What do you think?

173
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,560
I'm just frustrated to see you waste your time.

174
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,290
Your a thousand years will be over soon, and what if you really...

175
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,959
Brace yourself,  and ask her out.

176
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,089
I did.

177
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,110
Of course, you did.

178
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,120
What? You did? Really?

179
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
And? What did she say?

180
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,260
She won't go out with me.

181
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,809
Because you're a gumiho?

182
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,900
Because I'm not her type.

183
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,919
People used to say gumihos are bewitching, but not anymore.

184
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,020
 What happened to you, Shin Woo Yeo?

185
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,609
Anyway, I'm sorry.

186
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:19,159
You took my advice, then only embarrassed yourself.

187
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,829
I didn't take your advice.

188
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,800
I wasn't going to do that,

189
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,170
but she didn't seem to care at all,

190
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,419
so it just came out.

191
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,969
Yes, don't go begging a girl who doesn't care about you

192
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,469
to go out with you.

193
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,099
 Let's find another way.

194
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,980
It looks like dating you

195
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,310
isn't her idea of happiness.

196
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,059
Right, humans have a weak spot for presents.

197
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,169
Why don't you give her a load of stuff she likes?

198
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,889
If she likes clothes, get her clothes.

199
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,309
If she likes accessories,

200
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,589
get her things made with diamond, gold, sapphire, clam gem,

201
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,030
and pearl.

202
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,560
Pearl is the English word for clam gem.

203
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,329
What? Since when?

204
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,040
You should take language classes instead of meddling with my business.

205
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,010
- Forget it. 
 - Are you afraid of getting lashed?

206
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,039
The education system has changed a lot.

207
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,749
You won't get lashed by the teacher like we used to in the old days.

208
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:11,550
I hope you get the courage to sign up for a class. Bye.

209
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,210
I can't believe this guy.

210
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,419
Fine, big shot.

211
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,950
All showing off how he's an elite scholar from Seonggyungwan.

212
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,410
Something that she likes.

213
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,149
- Do you enjoy ghosting people? 
 - Sorry?

214
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,369
I said we're meeting at the back gate.

215
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:42,979
Right, I have to go home early—

216
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,499
Then forget today.

217
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,770
Let's watch a movie this weekend.

218
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,979
Why do you want to go with me?

219
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:50,480
No way.

220
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,320
They're caught together quite often these days.

221
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,569
Is she his type now?

222
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,179
I'm sure Dam flirted with him.

223
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,449
She went for so long pretending like she's not interested in guys.

224
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,859
Hey, do you remember that one senior, Eun Jo?

225
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,549
She kept saying she doesn't think Seon Woo is hot,

226
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,420
but got humiliated when she got caught flirting with him.

227
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,230
What if Dam ends up like her?

228
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,980
- My gosh. 
 - Dam, what are you up to?

229
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,429
What?

230
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,379
Get some yourself.

231
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,160
It's not that.

232
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,720
What's going on between you and sunbae Seon Woo?

233
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,619
Nothing. We just had a meal once.

234
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,239
What? You had a meal with him?

235
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,479
Just you two? Why?

236
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:41,239
He seemed like the bad boy type.

237
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,169
Hey, she won't die from eating with him.

238
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,939
She can manage that much.

239
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:46,270
Well,

240
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,370
I'm sure you're surprised that he went for her and not me,

241
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,359
but for you, Dam, I can give him up.

242
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,199
No, it's not like that.

243
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,590
We just ate a meal, and that's all.

244
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,890
 So we'll watch a movie this weekend.

245
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,559
No way, you wanna watch a movie?

246
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,229
It's not "not like that."

247
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:07,339
You ate with him, took classes together,

248
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,669
then asked me to leave, and now, a movie?

249
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,049
Then he's a hundred percent interested.

250
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:14,019
That's what it looks like on the outside.

251
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,469
But look at me.

252
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,709
I don't look so bad today,

253
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,939
but on most days, you wouldn't want to say hi to me if you weren't my friends.

254
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,199
- You want to be strangers. 
 - Yes.

255
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,029
So why would he?

256
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,260
Why would he be interested in me among countless numbers of students?

257
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,429
Dam has attended co-ed schools over her entire life,

258
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,350
 from her preschool to college days, for about twenty years.

259
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,080
 But there's a reason why she has never dated to this day.

260
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,080

261
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,189
 I'm interested in you.

262
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,019
 I have feelings for you.

263
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,210
 Hello?

264
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,130
 I'm over here!

265
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,549
 Hey, I'm over here!

266
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:56,709
 First, she's the type

267
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:59,660
 who becomes very small in front of a guy she likes.

268
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,190
 Hey, look.

269
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,479
 I have a hole in my sock.

270
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,579
 My gosh.

271
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,279
 - Awesome! 
 - Second,

272
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,720
 she becomes too relaxed with guys she's not interested in.

273
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,550
 You like me?

274
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,649
 Don't you remember during our Freshmen Trip, how I got hammered

275
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,519
 and stuck my phone charger up your nose?

276
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,069
 If you still like me even though you remember that day,

277
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,869
 I think there's something wrong with you.

278
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,409
 And third,

279
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,959
 she turns down everyone knowing exactly what she's like.

280
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,689
 That's right. Dam was a woman

281
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,499
 who could view herself a bit too objectively.

282
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,280
 That's why she was sure Seon Woo wouldn't like her.

283
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,739
 That's why...

284
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,539
 Goodness, does he have a thing for me?

285
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,119
 she couldn't let her heart race as she gets involved with him.

286
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,569
 Her attitude is more like that of General Guan Yu,

287
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,360
 who said,

288
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,200
 "I will return before this drink turns cold."

289
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,910
I need to put an end to this before it blows up any bigger.

290
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,959
Yes, I'll become so unlikable that he would never, ever

291
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,070
want to associate with me again.

292
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,168
Wouldn't it be better if you were just honest?

293
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:10,828
Just tell him that you feel uncomfortable.

294
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,769
What if he thinks I'm playing too hard to get?

295
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,449
Most of the girls in my major are on his side.

296
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,259
What if he gets mad at me

297
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,069
and starts a bad rumor?

298
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,068
What am I going to do?

299
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,309
That could happen.

300
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,710
There's no doubt.

301
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,480
Making him get sick of me is definitely the best tactic.

302
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,509
- Hey, Jae Jin. 
 - Yes?

303
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,829
Share your secret with me.

304
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,030
What did you do to make all of your girlfriends leave you?

305
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,729
They all hated how I was too clingy and obsessive.

306
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:36,839
I see.

307
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,199
Can you ask someone else,

308
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,869
not this expert on getting dumped?

309
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,809
You know, someone who has dated a lot

310
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,650
and can give you lots of tips,

311
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,580
a real player.

312
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,650
A real player?

313
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,840

314
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,560
What a beautiful relay.

315
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,940
What's all this?

316
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,859
I thought you might be hungry, so I got these for you.

317
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,399
You got me this much food?

318
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,779
You didn't know what I'd like, so you got everything?

319
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,679
You seemed to like everything, so I got everything.

320
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,360
Right, but no chicken.

321
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,139
You're such a delicate and considerate guy.

322
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,680
Sir, I knew it. I knew you'd be like that, but you seem to be

323
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,160
a bigger player than I thought.

324
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,340
Sir,

325
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,590
you've dated lots of women, right?

326
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,240
I mean, you're pretty old.

327
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,909
I need the help of someone who's experienced like you.

328
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,400
Could you please help me out?

329
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,379
Can you fill me in from the top?

330
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,060
Here's the thing.

331
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,440
So in short,

332
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,920
you want to disappoint that guy

333
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,029
and make sure he never approaches you again?

334
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,080
Yes, that's it.

335
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,599
How can I help you?

336
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,740
Go on a date with me.

337
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,259
- A date? 
 - Yes.

338
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,059
Just as how we take mock tests,

339
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,609
I want to go on a simulation date before I go out with him.

340
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,259
I'll do my best to be awful,

341
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,199
so tell me what you hated the most,

342
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,659
and if you have any ideas on what I can do

343
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,389
to get him to hate me more.

344
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,229
Miss Dam...

345
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:37,259
I know it's you, but I can't intervene with personal─

346
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,759
He was born in the Year of the Tiger.

347
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,339
Let's go on a date tomorrow.

348
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:41,529
Really?

349
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,500
Yes, it sounds too personal, but I have no other choice.

350
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,730
Thank you, sir.

351
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,000
I wonder if he's up yet.

352
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,590
I hope he didn't change his mind.

353
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,329
It may be just a simulation, but I thought I should dress properly for a date.

354
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:35,360
Yes, that's a great attitude.

355
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,669
But are you going out like that, Miss Dam?

356
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,259
Yes, I thought he'd hate it if I go out like this to watch a movie with him.

357
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:45,470
What do you think? Do I look awful?

358
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:53,259
Instead of this, why don't you put on that reddish-brown shirt with a dog on?

359
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,040
 You should go with that.

360
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,560
 It's a little bit tackier,

361
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,540
 there are spots here and there, and the neck is stretched out too.

362
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,240
 How can I put this?

363
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,189
Yes, you looked pretty awful.

364
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,489
I see. Then I'll wear that when I go out with him.

365
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,709
And you'll look sloppier if you put on your sneakers while stepping on the back as always.

366
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,460
He may find you more unlikable.

367
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,149
I see. Thank you for your advice.

368
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,590
- Shall we? 
 - Okay.

369
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,179
Sir, I'm about to show you the epitome of gluttony.

370
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,669
I hope this won't become a problem in our cohabitation.

371
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,259
If I put you off a bit too much, call a time out.

372
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,860
Okay.

373
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,440
This is the best restaurant near our school,

374
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,090
but no matter how good it is, if I devour on this aggressively,

375
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,310
don't you think I'll look awful? Watch this.

376
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,090
Hey, Miss Dam.

377
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,499
Why don't you just eat jjajangmyeon? 
  (T/N: A noodle dish in a black bean sauce)

378
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,859
Sorry?

379
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,629
I watched you eat jjajangmyeon last time.

380
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,380
You got the sauce all over your mouth,

381
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,820
and you slurped on the noodles very loudly.

382
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,650
It might be more off-putting than this dish.

383
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,190
I see.

384
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,330
And you take a bite of your picked radish and leave the eaten ones in your bowl.

385
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,079
It seemed quite selfish too, so that could be off-putting.

386
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,070
Thanks for the great tips.

387
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,040
Thank you for your help today, sir.

388
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,200
I'm glad I could be of help.

389
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,860
That was hot.

390
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:24,549
Right, when you drink hot drinks, you tend to slurp a lot.

391
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,030
I think you should show such uncultured behavior too.

392
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,360
And you should call your friend when you're with him.

393
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,939
I overheard your call once,

394
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:37,029
and it seemed like you were using all kinds of vulgar language such as,

395
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:39,759
"jerk, idiot, I'll kill you," and more.

396
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,080
That could all be off-putting, so...

397
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,049
What's wrong?

398
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,569
Now that I hear everything you said,

399
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:51,329
there's no need for me to try so hard.

400
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,499
- I... 
 - I just have to be myself.

401
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,499
I'm the human incarnation of the word unlikable.

402
00:23:57,499 --> 00:23:59,510
That's not what I meant.

403
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,149
I'm sorry, Miss Dam.

404
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,790
- I shouldn't have focused on helping— 
 - No.

405
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,299
Then shall we go back home?

406
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:10,200
I think that was enough.

407
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,960
Hey.

408
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,555

409
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,630
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

410
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,650
That's awesome.

411
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,940
Do you want to give it a try?

412
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,269
No, it's really tough to shoot for ten points, actually.

413
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:53,669
- Is it? 
 - Yes.

414
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:57,410
My brother is an archer, and he said it's not like the real one.

415
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,020
Gosh.

416
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,690

417
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,870
What was that?

418
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,970
All right! That was amazing. You're really good.

419
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,339
As I mentioned, back in Joseon, I've once served as a military officer.

420
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:53,529
Yes, you're right. You did.

421
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,780
I knew it.

422
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,260
- Here are your prizes. 
 - Thank you.

423
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,239
I'm sorry for making you upset today.

424
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,380
Please accept my apology.

425
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,680
You're trying to win my favor with these stuffed animals?

426
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,679
If you thought I'd fall for something like these,

427
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,140
you were right on!

428
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,640
Gosh, this is so cute.

429
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,019
Right, what if I smiled like a fool in front of him?

430
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:32,400
Do you think that might be off-putting?

431
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,480
You shouldn't smile like that.

432
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,160
Why not? Do I look too awful?

433
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,350
You'll look pretty.

434
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,580
Let's go, then.

435
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,309
What was that? He's enchanting me.

436
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:07,160
He's indeed a fox.

437
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
Sir, wait for me!

438
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,940
Lee Dam?

439
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,719
Hey, I'm leaving.

440
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,600
You don't want this coffee? Hey!

441
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,030
- Is he seeing a woman again? 
 - Is she pretty?

442
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,590
Your order of Americano is ready.

443
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,720

444
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,599
Why aren't you picking up?

445
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,490
It's that guy.

446
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,429
No way, I got this.

447
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,529
- Hello? 
 - Hey, stop.

448
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:00,459
What did you say? I can't hear you.

449
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm right here.

450
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,919
Sunbae, what brings you here?

451
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,159
I came to see my friends at school, then I spotted you.

452
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,850
I see.

453
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,159
Oh, he's a senior in my major.

454
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,090
And he's...

455
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,089
 I can't tell him that he's my housemate.

456
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:50,130
 If I say he's a gumiho, he'll think I've gone crazy.

457
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,539
a guy that I somehow became acquainted with

458
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,380
while going here and there and to other places.

459
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,959
Which movie should we watch this weekend?

460
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,409
Anything you want to watch?

461
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,559
- I'm not sure. 
 - I'll get tickets.

462
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,580
Excuse me, young man.

463
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,979
We have to be somewhere right now.

464
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,479
You two can discuss that later.

465
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:14,650
Is it urgent?

466
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,129
Yes, let's text, then.

467
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:19,119
You rarely answer my texts.

468
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,580
I have no comeback if you say something that accurate.

469
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,589
If you promise to respond, I'll leave.

470
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,359
Will you respond, then?

471
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,659
Okay. But I can't respond if you call me during mealtime.

472
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,409
Contact me between lunch and dinner, when it's not too early or too late.

473
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:37,520
You can reach out in that ambiguous hour.

474
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,650
Okay. I'll see you this weekend.

475
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,120
Are you all right, Miss Dam?

476
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,349
No, I'm not okay.

477
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:12,419
I even had you touch me.

478
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:15,060
Why can't I seem to get better?

479
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm sorry,

480
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,920
but please excuse me.

481
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,499
- What are you doing? 
 - The closer I am to the Bead,

482
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:27,220
- the faster you'll get better. 
 - What?

483
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,660
Wait, you're right.

484
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,490
Your hands must be medicinal.

485
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,740
But I'm going to start flexing my tummy, so don't talk to me.

486
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,879
You already know a lot about me,

487
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:48,300
but I want my body fat to remain a secret.

488
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,790
Hey, Miss Dam.

489
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,430
You've worked out before, haven't you?

490
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,570
I can hear my privacy shattering in pieces.

491
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,290
- Do you feel better now? 
 - Yes.

492
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,820
Gosh, that almost killed me.

493
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,680
It was unbelievably painful.

494
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,780
Miss Dam.

495
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,279
You might end up with that pain again if you see that guy.

496
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,999
Will you be all right?

497
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,639
I'm worried about that too,

498
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:23,959
but you saw what he's like.

499
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,849
He pets me even though we aren't close.

500
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:29,019
There's no point talking to someone like him.

501
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:32,189
And I can't avoid him forever since he's in my major.

502
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:33,889
So if it's okay with you,

503
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:36,850
I want to go out with him and put an end to this.

504
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,659
I can't stop you if that's what you want.

505
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,089
But you have to call me right away if anything happens.

506
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,859
If I call, will you run over right away?

507
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,360
Of course.

508
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,730
I should protect you.

509
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,679
Gosh, I'm tired. I should get to bed.

510
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,710
Okay. Get a good rest.

511
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,890
Good night, Miss Dam.

512
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,340
Okay.

513
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,429
Hey, it's my brother.

514
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:16,549
What's this? You don't sound well. Did you skip dinner?

515
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,179
No way.

516
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,159
The person I live with bought me gamjatang,

517
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,879
and I even had fried rice.

518
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:24,740
"The person"? I thought she was a friend.

519
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,210
Yes, right.

520
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,210
I can be very respectful to you too if you'd buy me food.

521
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,739
Whatever.

522
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,360
Anyway, what was your friend's name?

523
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,000
Shin Woo...

524
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,599
- hee. 
 - What?

525
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,949
Shi Nu-i? 
  (T/N: sounds like sister-in-law)

526
00:33:43,949 --> 00:33:46,289
Her last name is Shi, first name Nu-i?

527
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:49,470
No, not Shi Nu-i, but Shin Woo Hee.

528
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,049
Anyway, why did you call?

529
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,489
Mom called

530
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,809
 and asked me to make sure you're fine. How are you doing?

531
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,619
I'm doing fine. I'm doing so great.

532
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,380
Okay. Good night.

533
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,099
 The person you have called is unavailable. Please leave a message...

534
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,200
Why won't she answer the phone?

535
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,688
- Hey! Lee Dan! 
 - Hey!

536
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:16,289
- What's up? 
 - Hey.

537
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,659
What are you doing here?

538
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,089
I was just passing by.

539
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:20,549
I haven't seen my sister for a while, so...

540
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,218
What do you mean? You live together.

541
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,759
Didn't you know it?

542
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,519
She's not living with me.

543
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,369
She's living with a friend named Shin Woo Hee to prepare for a contest.

544
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,620
What?

545
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,750
Shin Woo Hee?

546
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,209
I have never heard of that name.

547
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,080
I also haven't heard about the contest.

548
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,850
Wait. I drove her home two days ago with my brother's car.

549
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,409
What?

550
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,468
But she moved out two weeks ago.

551
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,170
What?

552
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,359
What could it be?

553
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,939
I don't think she's doing something shady though.

554
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:56,250
Actually, something weird happened.

555
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,510
The most popular guy in our major is interested in Dam.

556
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,499
You're lying.

557
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:05,040
I know. It does sound like a lie.

558
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,879
Right! There's one more.

559
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,899
She quit chicken and drinking.

560
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,089
- No way. 
 - Right?

561
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,720
But it's true. It's been almost two weeks.

562
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,759
Wait.

563
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,910
She moved out two weeks ago and quit chicken and drinking two weeks ago.

564
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,460
Could it be...

565
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,099
she's into something weird?

566
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,659
Something like a cult where they worship chicken.

567
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,240
- Maybe she lives there and... 
 - No way.

568
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,789
- Dam. 
 - Hey, wait.

569
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:40,890
I'll call her.

570
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,489
Hey, Dam. Where are you?

571
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:49,029
 The class is finished, so I'm going home. Why?

572
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,060
Home? You mean the place

573
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,630
where you live with Dan?

574
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,490
 Of course. I've got to go.

575
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,380
See? She was lying.

576
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,000
Okay.

577
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,350
 The next bus is...

578
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,689
See?

579
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,849
She has to take 171 to go to your place,

580
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,880
but she took that bus.

581
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,320
Wait. Wait for me.

582
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,690
Wait up.

583
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,870
Sir, where are you coming from?

584
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,419
I went to the publishing company.

585
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:52,619
You've finished early.

586
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,850
- "Sir"? But he looks so young. 
  - Let's eat together.

587
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,949
Hey, he must be the priest.

588
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,510
The leader of that cult she got into.

589
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,049
How was it today? Are you feeling all right?

590
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,869
Are you worried about my condition

591
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,019
or the Bead's?

592
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,389
Your condition is the Bead's condition.

593
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:15,779
What are they saying? Why would she talk about a bead while rubbing her belly?

594
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,870
It must be the baby name! 
  (T/N: Koreans often give their unborn babies nicknames)

595
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,559
My cousin is also pregnant,

596
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,029
and she calls her baby by nickname.

597
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,179
Now it all makes sense.

598
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,829
- She's not into a cult. She's pregnant. 
 - What?

599
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,989
That's why she can't drink nor eat chicken, because of morning sickness!

600
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:27,989
That's why.

601
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,589
 Is there anything you want to eat?

602
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:32,169
I put you through all this, so tell me anything.

603
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,349
Don't say that.

604
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,299
It's not like I'm keeping it forever. It will come out soon.

605
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,149
See? She's pregnant.

606
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,869
- Shall we go in? 
 - Let me carry it for you.

607
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,730
It's okay. It's not heavy.

608
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,230
Dam!

609
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,560
Dan!

610
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,690
I'm not here for a drink.

611
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,079
Come on and explain.

612
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,880
When we talked on the phone last night, you said you were living with your friend.

613
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,080
Is this man your friend?

614
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,280
Well...

615
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,649
You said one of your friends got pregnant

616
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,979
and now she has to live with a man she doesn't even like.

617
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,779
- It's you, right? 
 - No, it's not!

618
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,949
Then what is it?

619
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:22,899
What's that bead

620
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,019
that you won't keep forever and will come out soon?

621
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,960
You even gave a nickname to your baby. Stop lying to me.

622
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,449
He's right. Just admit it so we can give you blessings.

623
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,429
- That's not— 
 - Do you love my sister?

624
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,080
No.

625
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,969
Still, you're going to marry her, right?

626
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:39,940
No.

627
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,120
- And you call yourself a human? 
 - No.

628
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,289
- You scumbag! 
 - That jerk!

629
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,380
How dare you...

630
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,499
I'm sending them back home.

631
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,219
Their memories will be erased.

632
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:09,660
What?

633
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:50,449
- Why won't he pick up the phone? 
   - The person you have called is unavailable.

634
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,290
It looks like it's not a big deal to you.

635
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,070
Erasing the memories.

636
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,059
How much did you erase?

637
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,049
It looked like he learned about it today, so I erased today's memories only.

638
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,989
You don't know how much this day meant to them.

639
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,970
How could you erase their memories just like that?

640
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,370
I did it because you seemed to be flustered.

641
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,249
Do you think there was another way?

642
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,409
We could have given it some time and think—

643
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,219
What if more people find out about it while we think?

644
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,299
Then I might have to erase more memories.

645
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,340
And I don't want to waste my time doing something annoying like that.

646
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,950
"Something annoying"?

647
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,609
I know there was no other way

648
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,559
and I understand that you're right,

649
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,409
but I'm still upset.

650
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,519
You must have someone you care about too.

651
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,539
If that person has to lose their memories because of you,

652
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,960
won't it upset you?

653
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,720
That's not how I think.

654
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,670
I don't think like humans.

655
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,040
Did you at least try to?

656
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,280
If you really want to be a human,

657
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,770
I think you need to learn about those emotions.

658
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,069
I hope he's all right.

659
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,700
Oh Dan. What shall I do?

660
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,999
 - What? 
 - Stay still.

661
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,630
Dan!

662
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,199
- Hi, Dam. 
 - Hi.

663
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,249
Hi.

664
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,199
- What's up? 
 - What?

665
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,610
I said, what's up?

666
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,440
- I was worried. 
 - Worried about what?

667
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,330
Well...

668
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,809
I was wondering if you're eating and exercising well.

669
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:31,010
I'm doing fine. Now, go.

670
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,250
Go?

671
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,880
Well...

672
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,970
I don't think I can be in that house comfortably now.

673
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,079
I'll be in my room.

674
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,400
Don't mind me and have fun.

675
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,219
- Hey, the toilet is clogged. 
 - Hey, come in.

676
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,419
Hi, Dam.

677
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,559
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

678
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,710
Hi.

679
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,109
- Hold on! 
 - Hey!

680
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,250
- What is it? 
 - Oh.

681
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,239
- Hi, Dam. 
 - Hi, Dam.

682
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,700
Oh, hi.

683
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,709
I guess I can go in Dan's room.

684
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,299
- Have fun. 
 - Okay.

685
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,720
- Hey, I'm hungry. 
 - Me too.

686
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,700
Hi, Dam.

687
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,729
Hey, let's just go. I think we're making her uncomfortable.

688
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,549
What? You said you'd sleep over tonight.

689
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,790
She's leaving soon. Right?

690
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,199
Right. I'm leaving soon.

691
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,139
I just came by to take my stuff.

692
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,869
See? Take your stuff and go.

693
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,059
Okay.

694
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,119
Have fun. Okay?

695
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,750
- Bye. 
 - Bye, Dam.

696
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,130
Why did I even worry about that punk?

697
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,140
If I had known he's doing so well, I wouldn't have been so mad at Mr. Gumiho.

698
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,770
Right. I wonder how Jae Jin is.

699
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,120
My phone.

700
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,159
 Well done.

701
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,479
Where is it?

702
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,889
I told you

703
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,309
you should be as nice to her

704
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,850
as possible.

705
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,319
You should put her on a pedestal, not argue with her.

706
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,260
And she's way younger than you.

707
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,700
What if she never comes back?

708
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,000
She's not that irresponsible.

709
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,549
What's the point of crying over spilled milk?

710
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,449
You should have thought of her as your last hope.

711
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,860
But look at what you have done.

712
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,040
Don't you feel that urge to become a human whenever you see me?

713
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,309
Unlike when I was a gumiho, I had a 360-degree turn

714
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,290
and now living my life proactively.

715
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,010
Aren't you just envious of me?

716
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,360
After a 360-degree turn, you're back to where you are.

717
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,750
You little...

718
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,669
Fine, smarty-pants.

719
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,110
But if you're so smart, why haven't you become a human yet?

720
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,709
What's the point of having so much knowledge

721
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,610
if you can't wheedle a human?

722
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,989
Why don't you stop improving your knowledge

723
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,949
and improve your communication skills not to offend women?

724
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,140
Hey.

725
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,370
I'm saying this because if you keep treating her like that, she might leave.

726
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,280
Actually, you might not be able to see her again.

727
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,259
 Miss Dam, I...

728
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,060
 I made a mistake.

729
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,230
I shouldn't have been so mad at you.

730
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,260
 I didn't mean to, but I seem to have upset you.

731
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,440
Please be generous and understanding.

732
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,230
 - I'm sorry.  
 - I apologize.

733
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,000
Will this make him feel better?

734
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,800

735
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,840
Oh, you are home.

736
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,260
Yes.

737
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,760
Sir.

738
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,100
I...

739
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,730
I...

740
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,940
I lost my phone. Have you seen it?

741
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,769
What?

742
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,340
I think I left my phone here. Have you seen it?

743
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,510
Oh. I haven't seen it.

744
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,519
Can I borrow your phone then?

745
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,370
I would like to try calling mine.

746
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,480
Here.

747
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,520
There it is.

748
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,280

749
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,550
Sir, did you delete my contact?

750
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,779
I didn't. I have never saved it.

751
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,420
Oh. I see.

752
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,370
Here.

753
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,059
I want you to save it though.

754
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,570
In case of emergency.

755
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:43,860
Okay.

756
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,890

757
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,850

758
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,009
Why is there no one?

759
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,989
Because there is no one.

760
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,459
- Not even family? 
 - No.

761
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,690
Not even friends?

762
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,549
Not really.

763
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,270
Don't you have acquaintances?

764
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,470
Are you done using it?

765
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,840
But...

766
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,320
He literally has no one.

767
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,060
 At first,

768
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,410
 I was really going to let you go.

769
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,830
 But then it hit me

770
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,570
 that I had to stay behind all by myself to figure this out,

771
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,470
 and it made me feel hopeless.

772
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,650
He must have been really lonely.

773
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,370

774
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,440
Sir.

775
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,660
Well,

776
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,320
I think I was a bit rude earlier.

777
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,630
And...

778
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,479
thank you for letting me use your phone,

779
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:42,609
for your dating simulation,

780
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:45,580
and for curing my stomachache.

781
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,890
So...

782
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,970
would you like to go eat some jokbal with me? 
  (T/N:  Korean dish consisting of pig's trotters cooked with soy sauce and spices)

783
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:01,970

784
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,370
Eat up.

785
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,039
It's for you.

786
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:21,410
I figured out that you liked lean meat.

787
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,880
Oh.

788
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,719
We should have gone to an ox blood restaurant.

789
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:36,049
You said you liked ox blood.

790
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:38,249
We can ask them to wrap this for takeout and go.

791
00:51:38,249 --> 00:51:42,700
We came here because you like this food. So enjoy.

792
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,470
That's not why I brought you here.

793
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,050
I brought you here because I wanted to talk to you.

794
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,860
I'm sorry about earlier.

795
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,119
My brother is four years younger than me, and he acts up sometimes.

796
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,650
Then I'm like, "That brat", and I want to give him a noogie.

797
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,730
And I, who is hundreds of years younger than you, got up against you.

798
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,700
It must have seemed just outrageous to you.

799
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,450
Don't say that.

800
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:19,170
I'm sorry to have upset you, who is way younger than me.

801
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,650
By the way, Miss Dam,

802
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:28,280
as I said already, I cannot think like humans.

803
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,510
I'm merely copying what I've seen over a long time.

804
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:36,680
I guess I can call it a learned sentiment.

805
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,499
So I might be not so good

806
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:42,470
at empathizing with others

807
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,690
and resolving relationship problems.

808
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,340
I'm sorry I didn't understand

809
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,549
why you got upset and angry.

810
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:54,679
Don't say that. You are not like me,

811
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:58,460
and you don't have anyone around you, so I understand you didn't know...

812
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:03,010
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,369
Why are you saying you're sorry?

814
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:08,849
I mean, I thought I might have said it too casually

815
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:11,750
that you had no one around you.

816
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,310
You must have been very lonely.

817
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,969
That's also a human idea, to think it's lonely to be alone.

818
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:22,099
I rather find it uncomfortable

819
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:24,470
spending time with others.

820
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,850
I see.

821
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,990
Does staying with me make you feel uncomfortable too then?

822
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,940
Are you coping with the inconvenience because of the Bead?

823
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,430
Because of the Bead?

824
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:01,950
♫  Again tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking  of you. Oh every night  ♫

825
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,700
 From now on, I'll try not to be scared of you.

826
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,409
 You have to keep your word.

827
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:09,350
 I will.

828
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,800
 How about Oldmiho?

829
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,080
 "Sir" sounds good to me.

830
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,060
 Let's get inside, sir.

831
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:20,660
 I'm so envious that you got to live in so many eras.

832
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,820
 Sir. How about we try

833
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,520
 to live through this day?

834
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,110
 If we repeat that, I believe good days will come in the end.

835
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,380
 Let's tough it out together.

836
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:43,530
♫  Though I know I’m still awkward and inexperienced  ♫

837
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:55,710
♫  Still, I’ll hold out my hand  ♫

838
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,240
 Don't forget about our date tomorrow. Good night.

839
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,480
Has he left already? I wish he had said bye at least.

840
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,429
 Have a good day today, and call me if you need me.

841
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:58,899
 And it wasn't just because of the Bead.

842
00:55:58,899 --> 00:56:03,300
 It is true that being with others makes me feel uncomfortable,

843
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,810
 but you were okay, Miss Dam.

844
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,640
All right. I'll do this right for his sake.

845
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,669
Is jjajangmyeon okay with you?

846
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:26,199
I thought having jjajangmyeon

847
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,179
with a clear view of Han River would be better

848
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,010
than having popcorn in a theater.

849
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,490
Right. Why not?

850
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,909
Here. It will taste good.

851
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:39,800
 You will completely lose your appetite.

852
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,189
This reminds me of your kindness.

853
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,469
I followed your advice and wrapped the toilet like this.

854
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,720
I wrapped it tightly so the air doesn't go inside.

855
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,600
Sorry. That was unappetizing.

856
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,710
 You will completely lose interest in me.

857
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,720
But eat up. It will taste really good.

858
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,760
It looks so tasty.

859
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,869
Oh, no.

860
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:10,129
I took so many pickled radishes, right?

861
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,369
That was so selfish of me, right?

862
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:13,479
It's okay.

863
00:58:13,479 --> 00:58:16,430
I can eat jjajangmyeon without pickled radish.

864
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,620
That's great.

865
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,909
 I'll make this more cheesy

866
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,750
 than eating jjajangmyeon without pickled radish.

867
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:27,289
Sunbaenim, you know what? There are three kinds of mayonnaise in Korea.

868
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,320
Do you know what they are?

869
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,210
No.

870
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,670
Chicken and mayonnaise.

871
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,530
Tuna and mayonnaise.

872
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,700
And "Don't smile like that, because that mayonnaise makes my heart flutter." 
  (T/N: Play on words with "mayo" sounding like "don't")

873
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,070
 What's going on? This is going weird.

874
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,690
Gosh, sunbaenim.

875
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:29,679
 I'm also okay with staying with you.

876
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,300
 Actually, I'm more than just okay with it, I like it a little.

877
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,540
 I'm just saying.

878
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:47,059
 Sir, let me share the progress because I don't want to worry you.

879
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,949
 Everything is fine here.

880
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:52,350
 I'm going home early. Let's have dinner together.

881
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,629
I didn't know it'd rain today.

882
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,570
We should call a cab.

883
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,119
I spent all my money buying the jjajangmyeon earlier.

884
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,930
Where do you live? I can take you home.

885
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,290
That little...

886
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,820
Pardon?

887
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,789
My little sister stole my money.

888
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:40,300
She does that all the time. What do we do now?

889
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,499
Oh, well.

890
01:00:41,499 --> 01:00:44,649
Let's just run to the bus stop. It will take ten minutes from here.

891
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,610
Which bus do you take?

892
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,330
Well, I've never taken a bus before.

893
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,729
Then what have you been riding?

894
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,500
My car or taxis.

895
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,950
And my car happens to be in a repair shop today.

896
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,339
Oh, well.

897
01:00:58,339 --> 01:01:00,009
Follow me then.

898
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,930
I'll make sure you have a safe bus ride.

899
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,700
Hurry up!

900
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,840
You can take this bus.

901
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,170
It's raining so much.

902
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,459
 The bus is arriving soon.

903
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,609
The bus is coming.

904
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:05,390
Take that bus and get off the bus after nine stops.

905
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,440
Okay. Thanks.

906
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:13,430
Get on the bus now. Have a safe trip home.

907
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:22,109
 When you get home safely,

908
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,130
 please call me.

909
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:44,460
He just ignored me. He must have lost interest in me completely.

910
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,790
I'll be clingy until the last moment.

911
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,379

912
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,229
 Sunbae, are you going home all right?

913
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,280
 I feel bad we had to say goodbye. Have a safe trip home.

914
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,060
 Did you get on the bus, too?

915
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,610
 I wish my car wasn't in the repair shop.

916
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,860
 Okay.

917
01:03:24,861 --> 01:03:30,620

918
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,259
 I had fun today.

919
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,630
 I'm sorry we had to say goodbye so suddenly.

920
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:43,640
 Don't worry! I'm having ox blood soup for dinner today,

921
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,589
 so I was planning on going home early anyway.

922
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,330

923
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,430
What's with this tone?

924
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,980
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

925
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,410
Both my battery and I are worn out.

926
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:14,350

927
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,510
It's raining so much.

928
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,500

929
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,250

930
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:23,910

931
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,650
♫   Close your eyes and feel my dream   ♫

932
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,880
♫   Close your eyes and touch my soul   ♫

933
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:40,860
♫   A long day has passed  ♫

934
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,590
Sir, how did you come all the way here?

935
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:47,160
You weren't answering your phone.

936
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,960
Right. I was going to tell you when I got home.

937
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,760
Miss Dam.

938
01:05:54,940 --> 01:06:00,130
From now on, always answer my phone. Even when I'm right next to you.

939
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:07,210
♫   Suddenly, they fill up my heart one by one   ♫

940
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:11,000
♫   It confuses me   ♫

941
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,480
♫   Because without even knowing   ♫

942
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:21,250
♫   You’ve grown so big   ♫

943
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,910
♫   All about you   ♫

944
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,560
♫  all about you my love  ♫

945
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:34,850
♫   I want to feel it without saying anything   ♫

946
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:39,830
♫   I want to get   ♫

947
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:43,860
♫  a little closer to you  ♫

948
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:47,320
♫   That’s how I feel   ♫

949
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:52,920
♫   That’s what I want to do, that’s all   ♫

950
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,379

951
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,519

952
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,240

953
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:00,280

~ Preview ~

954
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,000
 I'm thinking of going to this place called school.

955
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,759
 Don't you need someone who can observe that girl closely?

956
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,950
 The first assignment is "romantic relationship".

957
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:13,699
 Speaking of which, why don't we set a date?

958
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,950
 How about Saturday?

959
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:19,430
 I think we need a curfew.

960
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,490
 If you break it...

961
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:27,340
 Aren't you nervous, anxious, and sleepless these days?

962
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,800
 My heart suddenly starts to pound

963
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,110
 and my mind gets a little fuddled. What do you think this is?
