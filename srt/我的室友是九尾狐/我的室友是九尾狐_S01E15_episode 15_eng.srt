1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:13,340

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,949

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,760

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,240

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,420

6
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,350

7
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,320
Did you sleep well?

8
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,610
Yes.

9
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,750
I'll make some coffee. Take your time before you come out.

10
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,369
Well, I don't need to feel awkward. I'm also an adult now.

11
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,570
So I'll keep my composure...

12
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,900
It's all right, okay?

13
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,330
I have years of experience.

14
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,240
Let's stay calm.

15
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,760
Ouch, that's hot.

16
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,890
Keep your cool.

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,490

18
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,710

19
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,940

20
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,170

21
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,020
 I can't keep my composure.

22
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,440
 I can't focus on my homework.

23
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,880
 I can't stay calm. I can't focus on anything.

24
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,960
 - Stop thinking about it. 
 - Stop recalling it.

25
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,539

26
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,310
Then have another good day today.

27
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,240
I know you like coffee, but make sure you eat too.

28
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,200
And don't eat too much, Miss Dam. Keep it moderate.

29
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,139
I should go that way, then.

30
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,479
Okay. Call me after your class.

31
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,080
Okay.

32
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,840
Goodbye, Sir.

33
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,200
Dam!

34
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,720
What? Are you two really an item?

35
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,389
You bow to him, speak way too formally and the way you call him 'Sir'... we're not in a historical drama you know.

36
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,739
- Whatever. 
 - Goodness.

37
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,499
How much more do I have to teach you?

38
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,350
- Dam. 
 - Don't get near me.

39
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,760
- You're here early. 
 - I am.

40
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,129
- Have you eaten? 
 - Not yet.

41
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,369
Honey. My love!

42
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,160
Sweetie. My baby.

43
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,559
- What's with you? 
 - You're giving me chills.

44
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,729
I just threw some examples of good pet names for a couple.

45
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,879
There are so many pet names in the world, why did Dam choose to call him something like 'Sir'?

46
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,440
What's so bad? You said you liked it.

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,860
You wanted a Sir of your own.

48
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,049
That's when I thought Professor Shin was dating Professor Seo.

49
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,179
They're both older, so I said that thinking they were being cute.

50
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,290
But you're 22. Don't be so outdated.

51
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,390
Jae Jin, you tell me.

52
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,170
Honey, I missed you so much. Here's girlfriend one.

53
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,659
Sir, how I have missed you.

54
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,129
And here's girlfriend two, who's way too polite. Which one?

55
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,029
They both sound awful when you do it, but I'd still go with one.

56
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:27,019
Anyway, this is the reality.

57
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,909
Professor Shin is only in his early 30s.

58
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,919
Don't you think he'd want to be your boyfriend than be treated like an elderly man?

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,169
She's right. If you call him Sir, no one would think you two are dating.

60
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,109
They'd think you're volunteering at an old people's home.

61
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,299
An old people's home?

62
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,249
Think about it.

63
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:45,719
When you call him sweetie, you'd imagine a couple having some beer and nachos at a pub.

64
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,609
But if you call him Sir,

65
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,489
it sounds like you'd be at a mountain eating herbal Sarcodon baeksuk. 
  (T/N: Boiled chicken)

66
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,310
- Herbal Sarcodon baeksuk? 
 - Yes.

67
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,870
I wish I could call him something sweet.

68
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,380
But why can't I stand it? I just want to break something.

69
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,290
Still, I want to try it at least once.

70
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,939
 Honey. My love.

71
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,810
 Sweetie. I missed you.

72
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,999
No, never. I can't do that.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,689
- Oppa, what should we eat today? 
 - Yes?

74
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,870
Whatever you want, baby.

75
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,650
Let's eat something good, Oppa.

76
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,350
I think I can call him Oppa.

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,500
♫  Among the never-ending questions,  ♫

78
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,001
   Miss Dam, let's go home together if you're done with your classes.

79
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:48,330
Okay. I know he's trying very hard too.

80
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,900
I can do this.

81
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,250
Oppa.

82
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,380
♫  I've lived my life, day by day  ♫

83
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,600
♫  The only thing left with me  ♫

84
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,130
- Oppa. 
 - You're here.

85
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,490
I can do this.

86
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,030
♫  I can't continue like this  ♫

87
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,360
I'm here, Oppa.

88
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,640
- What? 
 - What?

89
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,260
♫  I'll profusely  ♫

90
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,019
- I didn't get that. 
 - I didn't say anything.

91
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,510
Gosh, I'm hungry. I'm starving.

92
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,000
- What do you want to eat? 
 - Well...

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Okay, let's give it another try.

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,679
Hey, Oppa. You, Oppa, Oppa, Oppa.

95
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,499
You should get your girlfriend a necklace, Oppa.

96
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,259
- Girls love this. 
  - He's a stranger,

97
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,000
 and she's obviously much older, but she called him Oppa so much.

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,549
 I'm so jealous of her bold personality.

99
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,589
Unnie, Unnie, Unnie. You're wearing gray and white,

100
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,879
- so go with a silver necklace. 
 - We'll come back next time.

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,239
Which next time?

102
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,619
Come quickly. Go take a round, then come back.

103
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,509
You two make such a cute couple.

104
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,189
I hope you two stay together for long. Have a great day!

105
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,320
So where are we going?

106
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,300
What are we eating?

107
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,559
I'm up for anything.

108
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,099
Is there anything you want, O...

109
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,479
 Oppa! Hey, Oppa, Oppa, Oppa!

110
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,700
- How about omurice? 
 - Omurice. 
  (T/N: omelette with fried rice)

111
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,340
- Sounds great. 
 - Right? Let's go.

112
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,850
 Should I give this one last try?

113
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,690
 It will feel less awkward if I think of him as an older cousin.

114
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,010
Did you pick one, Dam?

115
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,020
You haven't?

116
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,349
I wanted to be more casual with each other like other couples.

117
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,930
Let's use casual nicknames and speak casually too.

118
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,220
♫   If I carefully approach you  ♫

119
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,210
All of a sudden?

120
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,680
Wait, did you hear me call you Oppa?

121
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,160
♫   If only you would look at me and hold my heart  ♫

122
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,179
Well, I was just getting prepared.

123
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,070
I mean, you'll become a human soon, Sir.

124
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,589
Then you won't be 999 years old,

125
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,969
but you'll be young enough for me to call you Oppa.

126
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,260
So I was just practicing.

127
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,550
♫   And your heart is also  ♫

128
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,830
Isn't it awkward?

129
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,150
No, I like it.

130
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,000
♫   Slowly flowing towards me  ♫

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Then may I call you Oppa every now and then?

132
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,160
Okay, Dam.

133
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,500
I'll speak casually from time to time. Is that okay?

134
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,560
Okay.

135
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,130
What do you want, Dam?

136
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,690
♫   And embrace your heart that has returned  ♫

137
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,990
Anything, Oppa.

138
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,849
This is insanely sweet, something that Dam would love, right?

139
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,869
- Yes. 
 - Is she out on a date?

140
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,210
Yes, she's caught up in the storm of love.

141
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,019
I hope this storm of love doesn't just pass by like a storm.

142
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,349
I hope they stay together for a long time. I'm worried.

143
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,729
You're worrying excessively. I'm sure she'll manage.

144
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,969
It's because I've already seen her cry excessively.

145
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,949
She broke down so miserably the last time they broke up,

146
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,290
and I've never seen her like that.

147
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,470
And I think other students keep talking about it.

148
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm absolutely worried about my friend who's chosen to take a difficult journey of love.

149
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,050
On top of that, I'm concerned about her personality.

150
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,240
What about her personality?

151
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,880
I love her loyalty and energy. She's like a brother to me.

152
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,310
Exactly, the problem is that she's like a brother to Professor Shin too.

153
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,349
She uses honorifics and calls him Sir.

154
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,679
Hey, maybe she felt so awkward that she hasn't kissed him yet.

155
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,069
Wait, hey. We're two people who have different sex chromosomes.

156
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:46,009
I don't want to talk about something like this.

157
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,159
What? Stop pretending to be so conservative.

158
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,140
You're as open-minded as Hollywood celebrities.

159
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,360
- What do you mean? 
 - Before you dated Hye Sun,

160
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,209
you had a one-night stand with someone...

161
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,570
Why are you bringing that up?

162
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,710
If you're serious about her, make sure you never tell her

163
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,950
that you've had a one-night...

164
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,170
That you've done something like that, okay?

165
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,409
- What? 
 - Women like men

166
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,870
who are serious and cautious when it comes to physical contact.

167
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,229
We prefer men who cherish us and keep us safe, you playboy.

168
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:19,850
Playboy?

169
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,930

170
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,590
Hey, Hye Sun.

171
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,810
Are you done with your group study?

172
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,210
Thanks, Hye Sun. I should be taking you home.

173
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,840
I'm the one who has a car. Don't mind it.

174
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,759
Don't be like a man from the Joseon era.

175
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,920
I've already been there, done that. More than enough times.

176
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,550
What?

177
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,260
I meant that we should act our age in this relationship.

178
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,200
Hye Sun, one second.

179
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,180
 Wait, is he about to kiss me?

180
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,960
 Do kids these days just randomly kiss?

181
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,559
 What? I think I gave her a wrong idea.

182
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,810
 I'm not ready for this yet.

183
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,280
 Forget it. If she's ready, who cares if I'm not ready?

184
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,939
 We prefer men who cherish us

185
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:36,420
 and keep us safe,

186
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,899
 you playboy.

187
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,760
 You playboy.

188
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,180
I'm not a playboy!

189
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,700
- What? 
 - What?

190
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,200
What?

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,949
No, wait. I...

192
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,280
I meant that I weigh a lot more than you'd think. 
  (T/N: the word also means 'light')

193
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,679
I may look like I don't weigh much, but actually, this is all muscle so I'm pretty heavy, around 77 kg.

194
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,210
I get it, but why are you suddenly talking about how much you weigh? We're not at the butcher's.

195
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,920
It wasn't exactly showing it off.

196
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,280
And there's something here.

197
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,460
Were you trying to get this off?

198
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,000
Anyway, I dozed off for a moment.

199
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,820
I think I was just asleep. Did I sleep for a while?

200
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,070
No, only like ten seconds.

201
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,710
I see. What a relief.

202
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,429
If I fall asleep again, you have to wake me up right away.

203
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:37,100
Okay, I'll wake you up right away.

204
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,939
 That was so smooth.

205
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:45,640
 I'd rather be a woman who suddenly falls asleep than someone desperate for a kiss.

206
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,289
 That was smooth.

207
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,640
 It's better to seem like I can't take a hint than coming off as a playboy.

208
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,410
Gosh, look at the time.

209
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,019
Sir, you gave lots of lectures today. Aren't you tired?

210
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,749
I don't even realize how tired I am whenever I'm with you.

211
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,529
I'm not some kind of a pick-me-up.

212
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:06,390
That's over(exaggerating).

213
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,580
Over? No.

214
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm your Oppa.

215
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,809
Stop teasing me.

216
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,429
I want to be smooth like you,

217
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,050
but it feels a little awkward and stuff.

218
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,290
Anyway, that's that.

219
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,900
To be honest, it's awkward and embarrassing for me too.

220
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,750
But I like feeling such emotions too.

221
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,170
What are you up to?

222
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,109
I was looking at the Bead.

223
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,750
It looked more blue.

224
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,219
Really? I can't see it.

225
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,110
How much has it changed?

226
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,900
More than half, but it's not completely blue.

227
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,350
I still can't put a finger on it.

228
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,580
One second, Sir.

229
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,989
About this much.

230
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,099
That's amazing. I guess you've become more human.

231
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:48,400
If you fill this up a little more, you can become a human.

232
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,440
Look how happy you are.

233
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,890
Well, I am happy about it.

234
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,900
It's a shame, though.

235
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,069
It would've been great if I knew it was my humanity

236
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,160
that turns the Bead blue.

237
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,070
Even if you knew that, you couldn't have done this without me.

238
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,140
It's all thanks to you, Miss Dam.

239
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,360
Thank you so much.

240
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,560
Then keep putting your trust in me.

241
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,229
Let's stick it up over there.

242
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,410
Let's put it up.

243
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:29,050
Sir, can you color this whenever it turns blue?

244
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,190
It seems like we're almost there.

245
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,120
How are we going to finish this?

246
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,820
- I have a great idea. 
 - What?

247
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,499
I mean, now that the Bead has turned mostly blue,

248
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:53,929
I wanted to make sure we have a solid way of completing it.

249
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,959
But it's not like I can sit here

250
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,369
and give you a lecture on Kant's moral philosophy.

251
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,879
I'm still a high school graduate, and you hold a doctorate.

252
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,649
Also, by the time Kant was born, you were already 700 years old, Sir.

253
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,008
So forget such theories.

254
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:11,340
I tried to think of something we can do in real life to help you

255
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,629
to learn more about humanity.

256
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:15,799
When you do keep doing something, it becomes a habit, right?

257
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,700
For example,

258
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,680
I continuously had late-night snacks

259
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,850
and never worked out, which resulted in this shape.

260
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,650
That was convincing.

261
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,279
Anyway, it's not like there is one definition of a good person.

262
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,199
So why don't we try living a day without saying or doing anything bad?

263
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:36,680
And if possible, do one good deed a day.

264
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,570
What if you turned that into a habit?

265
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,340
Sounds great. Let's give it a try.

266
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,070
And so it begins today.

267
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,769
Sir, I've been curious for a while.

268
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,310
What's the first thing you want to do once you become a human?

269
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,910
I'm not sure.

270
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,839
That wish faded a while ago, so I haven't thought about it.

271
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,470
And now, I just want to remain by your side for a long time.

272
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,449
But still, if you had a bucket list, it might become your motivation.

273
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,080
Let's come up with something.

274
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,960
That was startling.

275
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,300
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

276
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,450
- My gosh. 
 - Man.

277
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,070
This is irritating.

278
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,010
Sir, you aren't supposed to say anything bad or negative.

279
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,170
This is irritating.

280
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,269
Sir.

281
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:34,909
Saying it in a nice voice doesn't make it positive.

282
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,599
When you say it with a smile, you seem like a psychopath...

283
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,170
I mean, it's weirder.

284
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,310
All right, then.

285
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,670
I'll do my best.

286
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,760
- He's a professor. 
 - What is he doing at school?

287
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,930
Sir.

288
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,249
You just had a mean thought, right?

289
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,030
What?

290
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,709
No, I wouldn't.

291
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,179
No, I can tell by your eyes.

292
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:18,510
You did, right?

293
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,279
When you keep thinking about food, it will lead to binge eating.

294
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,269
So if you keep thinking mean thoughts, it'll lead to mean actions.

295
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,529
Please be cautious from now on, okay?

296
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,550
I'll do my best.

297
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,310
   Done with the ancient history report?

298
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,350
Oh no. I forgot to bring my ancient history report from home.

299
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,949
I don't have a lecture right now, so I'll give you a ride.

300
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:42,199
No, it's the first period, so I only have ten minutes left.

301
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,130
This is bad.

302
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,050
Then we have no other choice.

303
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,550
Let's go.

304
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,930
By your magic?

305
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,120
Well, at this rate, you'll probably become a human soon,

306
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,510
so let's make use of it.

307
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,240
My goodness!

308
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,720
What are you two doing?

309
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,840
Why are we here?

310
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,710
You almost shocked me to death.

311
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,139
Well, since you're 999 years old,

312
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,240
it'd be tough to find a way home thanks to your old age.

313
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,060
It's not because of my old age.

314
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,919
- My magic just... 
 - Exactly.

315
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,190
You couldn't use your magic properly

316
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,990
because you're getting too old.

317
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,069
Yes, you're 999, so it's about time you lost your functions.

318
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,390
I think I have enough energy to make this car stop in the middle of the road.

319
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,370
Do you want me to do it?

320
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,820
Sir, you said you won't say anything mean.

321
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,420
In order to do that, we'd better run along.

322
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,110
Bye, Hye Sun.

323
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,830
Gosh, this time, it worked.

324
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,740
So why did that just happen?

325
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,930
I could tell it hasn't happened before by what Hye Sun said.

326
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,709
I wonder. I must've been a little tired.

327
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,170
Oh, you were feeling under the weather.

328
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,020
I might be late. I'll pick up my report.

329
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,360
Are you serious?

330
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,820
Are you really moving abroad to study?

331
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,390
It turned out that way.

332
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,900
He's going to take over his father's business,

333
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,289
so he had been talking about it for a while.

334
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,480
Exactly.

335
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,430
He was only talking about it, so why did it suddenly become final?

336
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,120
Sunbae, is it because of Dam?

337
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,089
Do I look like that big of an idiot?

338
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,239
Stop talking nonsense and apologize to Dam for uploading that photo.

339
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,240
- Wait for me. 
 - Seon Woo Sunbae.

340
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,190
Hey, Sunbae. Seon Woo!

341
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,350
What was that?

342
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,350
It's a fact that Dam didn't behave right and led him on,

343
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,460
then hit on Professor Shin behind his back.

344
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,100
- Why is he getting mad at us for uploading a stupid photo? 
 - Tell me about it.

345
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,860
Why is he always on her side?

346
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,190
I can't believe this.

347
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,060
Hey, Seok.

348
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,209
Yes. Okay, we'll pick it up.

349
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,710
"To be honest, I still like you."

350
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,730
"You wouldn't know how I feel, would you?"

351
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,040
Hey, Seok, how does it feel to have someone publicly confess...

352
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,670
- their love for you on Everyday Time? 
 - Cut it out.

353
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,899
I've never had this happened to me.

354
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,830
- Does your heart race... 
 - Da Young is here! And so is Jin.

355
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,270
Hey, you're here.

356
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,250
- Are these it? 
 - Yes, thanks.

357
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,819
- Did you see Everyday Time? 
 - We did.

358
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,620
- I mean, someone uploaded a public... 
 - Yes, we just said we saw it.

359
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,250
You turned her down when she asked you out two years ago,

360
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,520
but she's now mean to you on purpose.

361
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,880
Who is it? If she asked you out before, you'd know who she is.

362
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,549
- Is she pretty? 
 - Just the initials.

363
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,630
- It's none of your business. 
 - Just a letter.

364
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,729
- Is she prettier than me? 
 - What?

365
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,900
Gosh, tell us.

366
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,040

367
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,270
Hey,

368
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,470
I know you're in a relationship, but don't forget that you're a student. How could you forget your report?

369
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,200
Exactly.

370
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,340
And our finals are soon. Are you ready for the tests?

371
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,830
Somewhat.

372
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,570
Somewhat? You can't be somewhat prepared.

373
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,149
You'll be a senior next year. How can you get a job with a GPA of 3.5?

374
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,469
Man, I'm so angry.

375
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,730
Why are you so furious over my low GPA?

376
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,410
It's not that. It's Da Young and Jin.

377
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,889
They're bringing up grades and fairness into this, but those can't be the reasons.

378
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:42,270
They hated me already, so they wanted to mess with me.

379
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,709
You dated him before he began here, and you took his class fairly too.

380
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,870
Who do they think they are to upload that photo and make you known?

381
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,920
They're so annoying.

382
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,530
I also find them irritating, but I'll just let it go.

383
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,130
Now that I know I have to set an example,

384
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,440
I feel like I should stay away from saying or doing bad things.

385
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,990
Set an example?

386
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,400
To whom?

387
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,240
I meant that many people have their eyes on me, so I should be careful.

388
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,950
I have to turn this in, so you can go ahead.

389
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,360
- Okay. See you. 
 - See you.

390
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,190
Gosh, I'm so full.

391
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,430
Thanks for lunch, Seok. You're the best.

392
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,160
I'll buy you a meal next time.

393
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,480
Okay.

394
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,060
Why? Are you looking for something?

395
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,000
My notebook.

396
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,189
I made that to prepare for the finals.

397
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,380
What? It's not like your notebook has feet.

398
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,270
Did I leave it in my locker?

399
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,690
Hey, Soo Kyeong.

400
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,080
Was it you?

401
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,460
- What? 
 - I mean, you were here alone while we were out eating.

402
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,080
I know grades are important to you, but you shouldn't steal things.

403
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,530
Whatever. What do you think of me?

404
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,010
Think about it. You've always kept him in check.

405
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,520
But still, you shouldn't go down this low.

406
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,050
Hey, stop blaming the innocent without any evidence, and get lost!

407
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,520
Of course, we have evidence.

408
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,610
Your attitude toward him is the evidence.

409
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,870
To be frank, you're the only one who's mean to Seok in our department...

410
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,119
It was you. It's you!

411
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,340
You confessed your love on Everyday Time!

412
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,140
It's you.

413
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,900
You had feelings for Seok?

414
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,760
Is that why you have been so immature?

415
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,150
Hey!

416
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,959
I didn't write that! I don't even like him,

417
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,360
and you two are old enough now. Try to act your age.

418
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,679
Stop framing people and speaking ill of others.

419
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,620
Don't be so pathetic.

420
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,879
Hey, are you done talking?

421
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,239
Yes, what if I'm done talking?

422
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,570
I can't take you anymore!

423
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,399
- You totally deserved that. 
 - What's going on?

424
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,080
- Dam. 
 - Get up.

425
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,340
They claimed I stole Seok's notebook he made for his finals.

426
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,619
I never even went near it.

427
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,740
Of course, you stole it.

428
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,399
Man, I hate her so much.

429
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,469
Where are you going? You need to apologize.

430
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,669
Hey, you two need to cut that out.

431
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,489
Don't pretend to be fine, cool or high and mighty. So pretentious!

432
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,350
I'm sick and tired of you two.

433
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,590
Hey, you need to apologize before you go.

434
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,190
- Let me go. 
 - Then stop doing things to apologize for.

435
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,949
- I won't be patient for long. 
 - So what if you don't stay patient?

436
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,149
What can you do anyway? What will you do?

437
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,559
- Hey, let me go. 
 - No.

438
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,739
- Let me go! 
 - No.

439
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,820
I told you to let me go!

440
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,359
Hey, you jerk. I told you to let me go!

441
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,350
- Come here! 
 - I'll get you!

442
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,980
- Let me go! 
 - No!

443
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,900
That brat.

444
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,850
You!

445
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,700
- Hey, break it off. 
 - What's going on?

446
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,500
- Stop it. 
 - Don't do that.

447
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,449
- Hey, stop. 
 - Stop it.

448
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,900
Seok, Soo Kyeong is the one who stole your notebook!

449
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,309
And she was mean to you because she likes you!

450
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,649
- Enough is enough! 
 - What? Am I wrong?

451
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,269
Tell me. Am I wrong?

452
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,670
The evidence is online. You can't keep...

453
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,310
I said no!

454
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,970
The one I liked isn't Seok.

455
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,580
It's Jae Jin.

456
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,830
- What? 
 - What?

457
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,470
- What? 
 - She's right.

458
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,780
Soo Kyeong liked Jae Jin.

459
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,650
Wait, Do Jae Jin?

460
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,549
 - Dance! 
 - Dance!

461
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,539
 I've been too focused on my studies,

462
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,970
 so I don't think I can dance.

463
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,260
 You just killed our vibe.

464
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,920
 Hey, back in my days, all freshmen just got up and danced.

465
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,010
 - Preach it. 
 - Here comes the beat.

466
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,960
 What?

467
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,490
 I'll dance.

468
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,580
 - You're so cool. 
 - He's a hero, isn't he?

469
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,350
♫  That I wanna say is  ♫

470
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,320
♫  People might be watching. That is what I'm wanting  ♫

471
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,900
♫  The halo that I can see  ♫

472
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:40,040
♫  Maybe I am weirdo. All my friends are talkin'  ♫

473
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,640
 Hi, Jae Jin.

474
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,040
 You couldn't find more references on modern history,

475
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,380
 so I stayed up all night to find you some.

476
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,920
 Why you ask?

477
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,470
 Because you captured my heart.

478
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,511

479
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:54,560
 Go out with me.

480
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,180

481
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,050
 Hey, Seok. I'm glad I ran into you.

482
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,290
 You take Sex and Culture, right?

483
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,180
 Yes. I had to get the syllabus from the professor and have it copied,

484
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,369
 but something urgent came up. Could you do it for me?

485
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,300
 Today is the first class, so I don't know what the professor looks like.

486
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,450
 Well, stay in front of the lecture hall,

487
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,050
 and if a woman in her early 40s come by with a file, it's her.

488
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,440

489
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,940
 Jae Jin, let's meet in front of the lecture hall.

490
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,250
 I have something for you.

491
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,440
 A woman in her early 40s with a file.

492
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,180
 - Should I send it or not? 
 - It must be her.

493
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,020
 I'll take that.

494
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,559
 Sorry? Who are you?

495
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,420
 He said he was busy, so I'm picking it up.

496
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,330
 - Instead of him? 
 - Yes, thank you.

497
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,805

498
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,659
 I'm sorry, I'm not coming to school today. Can we meet tomorrow?

499
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,540
 - What? 
 - Yes, thank you.

500
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,460
 Wait, then who was that guy earlier?

501
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,580
 Here's the syllabus.

502
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,740
 Here's the syllabus.

503
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,550
 Hey, turn to the last page.

504
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,380
 - What's this? 
 - "Go out with me"?

505
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,820

506
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,900
 Hey!

507
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:30,039
 Why did you take my letter and do this?

508
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,580
 Sorry?

509
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,059
 I thought it was the syllabus.

510
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,290
 Aren't you the professor?

511
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,030
 I'm a freshman.

512
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,210
 I just turned 20!

513
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,680
 I'm sorry.

514
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,229
Because of him,

515
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,259
the love letter I wrote with all my heart was spread as a syllabus.

516
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,580
For a while, my nickname

517
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,519
was Professor.

518
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,419
When I heard the word "professor" from my back, I couldn't even look back

519
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,780
because my heart dropped.

520
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,729
Soo Kyeong, I'm sorry about that time.

521
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,980
I didn't go to the orientation, so I didn't know the freshmen's faces.

522
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,700
Whatever.

523
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,179
I told you.

524
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:22,230
I will never forgive you.

525
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,770
Hey, Seok.

526
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,230
Isn't this yours? I found it on the ground just now.

527
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,379
Hey, it's your fault that you decided to study there alone

528
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:38,530
while all others go eat.

529
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,219
Hey, can't you see you're supposed to make an apology now,

530
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:42,889
not excuses?

531
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:45,290
She's right!

532
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,890
Is this why the professor is going out with you?

533
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,199
Because you're so condescending?

534
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,889
You are f*cking annoying!

535
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:52,510
You think I don't know how to swear?

536
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,070
You worthless piece of garbage.

537
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,350
You crazy b*tch.

538
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,899
 So why don't we try living a day without saying or doing anything bad?

539
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:09,210
 What if you turned that into a habit?

540
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,599
It may seem like a bad behavior at a glance,

541
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,709
but what I did was actually a nice thing to do.

542
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,569
I couldn't just sit back and watch my friend getting hurt.

543
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:29,420
It was a righteous and loyal thing to do.

544
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,630
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,659
I'm supposed to keep you on the straight and narrow

546
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,600
and be a model example.

547
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,309
I'm thinking of quitting teaching after this semester.

548
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,379
Why? Because I had fights with other kids?

549
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:48,500
Partly, yes.

550
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,830
The main reason I came here was to see you.

551
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,170
But I don't need to be at school to see you anymore.

552
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,400
And I don't want to cause you trouble by staying.

553
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,339
There's no reason to.

554
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,429
Still, at school, you get to deal with many people,

555
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,240
and it will help you learn about humanity better.

556
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,169
I can look for another job.

557
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,910
I had hundreds of jobs already.

558
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,459
I'm not the kind who can settle down for one job anyway.

559
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,980
It's about time to quit.

560
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,480
So don't worry, Miss Dam.

561
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,460
And don't fight with others from now on.

562
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,470
I don't want you to get hurt.

563
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,370
You came here because you were worried about me, right?

564
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,299
I know you can feel it when I'm in danger.

565
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,610
That's why you came, right?

566
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,940
 My goodness!

567
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,200
 I know you can feel it when I'm in danger.

568
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,780
But why?

569
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,100
 It works.

570
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,940
 It doesn't work.

571
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,189
 It works.

572
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,500
Why in the world did you use that magic?

573
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,080
I was reminded of my mistake earlier, so I was testing it out.

574
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,450
Am I a test dummy or what?

575
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,349
You can't just summon a person like that.

576
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,989
I was just about to get some sausages.

577
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:58,830
Sometimes, it works, and sometimes, it doesn't.

578
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,080
What do you think is going on?

579
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,259
I'm sure it's because you're tired

580
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:04,969
with all the school work and your girlfriend.

581
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,239
You have never been this busy in your 999 years of life.

582
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,890
The Bead is becoming bluer.

583
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,530
What?

584
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,039
Of course. You were spending too much time with Lee Dam lately.

585
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,779
So the energy...

586
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:21,500
It's not energy that changes the color of the Bead.

587
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,220
What? What do you mean?

588
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,120
Really?

589
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,039
Humanity is what changes the color of the Bead?

590
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,360
I know it's confusing, but...

591
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,470
Now I get it.

592
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,459
It's because I'm much more humane, kinder, purer,

593
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,780
and have better a personality than you.

594
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,610
That's why I was the only to turn into a human.

595
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,069
Hang on.

596
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,650
If it's about humanity,

597
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,050
I should have turned into a human after 7 years, not 700 years.

598
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,330
Why did it take so long?

599
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Wait.

600
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,080
I remembered something.

601
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,329
Four years ago, I teleported to Paris for shopping.

602
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,489
Then when I wanted to come back, I couldn't use magic.

603
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,449
So I got caught as an illegal alien.

604
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:06,019
I even said "I love you" in French, but it didn't work.

605
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,130
But one second before I was handcuffed,

606
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,949
I managed to come back at the last minute.

607
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,970
Then a few days later, I became a human.

608
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,229
- What? 
 - You said it works on and off.

609
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:20,760
I think that's a sign that you're turning into a human.

610
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,109
I told you.

611
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:24,529
When I became a human, I could just feel it.

612
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:27,299
One morning, I realized I couldn't use magic nor feel the energy.

613
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:30,360
I was straight-up just human.

614
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,850
Oh, my. I think you're actually becoming a human now.

615
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,420
Hye Sun is the last person I would trust.

616
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,860
 What do you think will happen if a wolf falls in love with a sheep?

617
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,840
 The more you want her, the bigger your appetite will grow.

618
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:16,640
She may be ignorant, but she has always been intuitive.

619
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,550
Let's not jump to conclusions.

620
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,210
Hello, Professor.

621
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,219
Oh, no. Watch out.

622
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,360
Thank you, sir.

623
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,610
 I couldn't feel any energy.

624
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,360
 Could it be that I don't need energy anymore?

625
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,660
Miss Dam, can we meet now?

626
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,820
Sir.

627
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,800
- Hey. 
 - Why are you smiling?

628
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,960
I'm not.

629
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,040
Even now, you're smiling.

630
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,990
Did you win the lottery?

631
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,669
I don't need to. I'm already rich.

632
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:19,260
Right.

633
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,390
Then what's up?

634
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,400
I'd like to take you out for a nice dinner today.

635
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,680
Oh, no.

636
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,939
Soo Kyeong is feeling down today,

637
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,770
so we made a plan to go out and drink together.

638
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,480
That's a shame. Have fun then.

639
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,190
Don't forget to call me if it gets late.

640
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,040
What's with this vibe?

641
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,050
I heard about it.

642
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:04,990
I heard that you had a crush on me.

643
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,579
I wished things like this would never happen to us.

644
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:12,339
It's a long time ago.

645
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:15,569
When I was a freshman, I thought he helped me get out of trouble,

646
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:18,019
but it turned out that he just wanted to dance.

647
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:21,420
Come on. It lasted only three weeks.

648
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,120
- I'm sorry. 
 - You don't have to be.

649
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,500
You may say you're okay, but it must have been really hard for you.

650
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,180
From now on, I'll try my best not to hurt you.

651
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,970
What are you saying?

652
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,560
Soo Kyeong.

653
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,180
What on earth did you like about me?

654
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:48,359
My hands get veiny when I work out, and I knew they were kind of sexy.

655
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,379
Was that what you liked about me?

656
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:51,639
If so, I'll quit exercising.

657
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,959
- What? 
 - Wasn't that it?

658
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:57,159
Then was it my eyes that look like an innocent boy's when I smile?

659
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:00,359
I sometimes felt like that's my charm.

660
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,600
Was that it?

661
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,129
Then I'll stop smiling.

662
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,019
Damn it, it wasn't like that.

663
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,399
The more I got to know you, the clearer it became how horrible you were,

664
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,629
which helped me get over you.

665
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,609
Actually, there was nothing to get over.

666
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,109
Just get lost, will you?

667
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,729
- Go away. Get lost. 
 - Okay. I will.

668
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,870
I have an appointment with Hye Sun anyway.

669
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,410
Are you leaving?

670
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,659
Hey, Choi Soo Kyeong.

671
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,950
Never have a crush on me again.

672
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,120
Promise me.

673
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,329
Gosh, this is exactly why I haven't ever told him about this.

674
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,579
The only thing I'm grateful to Seok for

675
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,869
is that he stopped me from telling him about it.

676
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,799
Exactly. He did you a big favor.

677
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,469
So stop hating him so much.

678
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,629
I always wondered why you treated him like your enemy.

679
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,619
And after hearing his side, he didn't even do it on purpose and seemed to feel awful about it.

680
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,119
I decide whether to hate him or not.

681
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,370
How's your hair?

682
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,650
Well, my scalp still burns a bit, but it's all right. What about you?

683
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,359
I'm all right too. In fact, I feel great.

684
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,699
I wanted to beat some sense into them so they would never mess with you again.

685
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,209
You saw how agile I was.

686
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,009
I must be the best fighter in the department.

687
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,259
Right. And you got hurt the most.

688
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,249
Hey. Real fighters attack invisible spots.

689
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,910
I can tell you, they're going to feel it tomorrow.

690
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,480
By the way, I'm sorry about what happened.

691
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,120
Maybe you didn't want to make a big deal out of it

692
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,389
and I ruined it.

693
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,790
Don't say that. You wouldn't have sat back and watched me being hit either.

694
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,089
And to be honest, it's my fault.

695
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,620
They probably picked a fight with you because you're my friend. I'm sorry.

696
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,830
No way. Don't say you're sorry.

697
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,420
Cheers.

698
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,389
Anyway, I won't do the same again.

699
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,689
I don't want to worry him. That's the least I can do for him.

700
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,049
Worry?

701
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,149
Oh, you're talking about Professor Shin.

702
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:02,430
I'm the one who got hurt for you, and yet you worry about him, not me.

703
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,440
Well, that's love I guess. That's love.

704
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,830
To love.

705
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:12,749

706
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,940
Is he really turning into a human?

707
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,419
Well, let's not be excited about it yet.

708
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,960
It's not over until it's over.

709
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,239
Hye Sun, I'm sorry I'm late.

710
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,370
- That's okay. 
 - Oh, thanks.

711
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,880
I heard Soo Kyeong's first crush was you.

712
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,710
Well, I heard that only today too.

713
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,399
She said it lasted three weeks, so don't worry.

714
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,620
Why would I worry? You're going out with me now.

715
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,159
What were you doing?

716
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,109
It's called Instagram. All young people use it these days,

717
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,440
so I made an account too.

718
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,709
"Young people"?

719
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,169
What's your username? I want to be your first follower.

720
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,950
- You do? 
 - Yes.

721
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,520
This is my account.

722
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,140
That's a really nice profile photo.

723
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,170
I'll follow you then.

724
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,259
Okay.

725
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,019
 Why is he being so shy?

726
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,950
 Come on. Is he seven? 
 (T/N: Confucian saying that says a boy and a girl should not sit together until they are seven.

727
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:15,020
That's my older brother. I'll be right back.

728
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,880
Do Jae Jin. Follow.

729
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,699

730
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,520
 Hye Sun is the most beautiful girl in the world.

731
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,840
 It's the cafe you went with me before.

732
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,680
Who's this?

733
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,200
His ex-girlfriend?

734
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,240

735
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,080
Hye Sun, I'm done now.

736
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,539
Hey, what is this? Explain right now.

737
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,550
What? What is it?

738
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,520

739
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,929
Why did she post an old photo? She must have lost her mind.

740
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,600
Hye Sun, it's not what you think it is.

741
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,589
We're really done. Believe me.

742
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,670
Then why does she still leave comments on your photos?

743
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,299
I don't know.

744
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,629
Maybe I should block all comments. I'll block all comments.

745
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,100
You went to the cafe with her?

746
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,639
Why did you take me there?

747
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,910
Well, you wanted to go there, so...

748
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,600
From now on, we're only going to new places. How does that sound?

749
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,690
Let's do that.

750
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,600
So how do I block comments?

751
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:47,710
 Why is he being shy around me when he already did everything with his ex?

752
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,130
 Is he saving it or what?

753
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,240
 Am I the one forcing it on him?

754
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,050
 Sir, I've been curious for a while.

755
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,850
 What's the first thing you want to do once you become a human?

756
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,020
Dad!

757
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,320
Hey! Be careful, man!

758
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,520
"Man"?

759
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,690
- Miss Dam. 
  - Sir.

760
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,659
Did you drink a lot?

761
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,500
 No, I had just enough to feel tipsy.

762
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,890
Three bottles of soju.

763
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,400
- Do you want me to come pick you up? 
  - Yes. I'll be waiting.

764
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,719
I was worried you might not make the cutest girlfriend,

765
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,209
but look at you, being cute and all.

766
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,980
- Of course! 
 - Do you like him so much?

767
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,200
Yes! Way more than chicken!

768
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,079
I like him more than anything in the world.

769
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,359
Of course. Why not?

770
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,339
He's smart and good-looking.

771
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,719
Seriously, you're one lucky girl.

772
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,269
If someone like him tells me he loves me,

773
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,270
I would gladly give him all my money.

774
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,639
What? Did you already give him all your money?

775
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,170
- I don't have money. 
 - Then what's with the face?

776
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:36,459
Wait. Has he not told you he loves you yet?

777
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,610
That's not it.

778
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:43,680
It's not? Did he tell you he loves you then?

779
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,839
He didn't,

780
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,359
but I didn't say I love him yet either.

781
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,779
That doesn't mean he can't say it first.

782
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,979
What's wrong with him?

783
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,479
He knows he's your first boyfriend

784
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,710
and you're the kind of girl who can't say cringy things.

785
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,920
He could have said it first.

786
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,780
Hey.

787
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:09,019
Maybe he doesn't love you.

788
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,639
He does.

789
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,109
Is it one-sided love?

790
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,139
- No, it's not. 
 - Yes, it is.

791
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,230
No, it's not.

792
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,560
Oh, look! He's here.

793
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,780
The professor who doesn't love you is here.

794
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,040
- Thank you for riding me home. 
 - Sure.

795
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,039
And what happened today was really just a misunderstanding.

796
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,780
It will never happen again.

797
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,940
Believe me.

798
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,160
Well, then. Safe trip home.

799
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,510
Okay.

800
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,080
Hey.

801
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,259
What is it? I'm sorry.

802
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,549
Why are you sorry? What for?

803
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,810
Do you even know what you're apologizing for?

804
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,200
Isn't it about Jin Ah?

805
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,070
Do you think I'm doing this because of your clingy ex?

806
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,470
You covered all bases with your ex,

807
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,050
and you always stay close to Dam, too.

808
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,680
So why do you never touch me?

809
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,580
Well, it's because I feel bad.

810
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,560
What do you mean?

811
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,290
You know,

812
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,250
we already went all the way,

813
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,019
but I don't remember a thing.

814
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,909
Our relationship may have started casually,

815
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,690
but I don't want to see you just casually.

816
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,099
That's why I'm being careful.

817
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,650
What do you mean by, we went all the way?

818
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,899
We slept together.

819
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,570
After the festival afterparty,

820
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,649
we slept together in your suite room.

821
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,379
Oh, that. We did sleep.

822
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,110
I slept on the sofa, and you slept on the bed.

823
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,349
- What? 
 - What?

824
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,209
Are you saying nothing happened between us then?

825
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,309
Yes.

826
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,729
Then why did you say I should take responsibility?

827
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,059
I meant, you should take responsibility for our poor grade in Communications.

828
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,760
Since you said those who end up being a couple get an A-plus.

829
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,389
Thank goodness.

830
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:50,020
I thought I got wasted and did something trashy to you.

831
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,349
Hold on. What?

832
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,390
Have you been nice to me because you felt bad?

833
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,489
No way.

834
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:01,160
I told you. I like you now.

835
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,330
Hye Sun.

836
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,080
Do you like me?

837
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,010
I...

838
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:25,310
like you very much.

839
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:31,430
So I'm really glad

840
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,730
nothing happened that day.

841
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,120
From now on, whatever we do,

842
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,409
I hope we do it because we both want to.

843
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,700
When you finally like me back.

844
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,110
But if you say it doesn't matter to you,

845
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,120
I will be pretty upset.

846
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,710
Why are you crying again?

847
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,370
I like you too.

848
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,920
- What? 
 - It's okay.

849
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,070
If you want to take it slow, we can take it slow.

850
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,280
I can wait.

851
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,890
 I can't believe I'm saying this.

852
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:37,000
Could you close your eyes?

853
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,980
Okay, then.

854
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:46,370
♫  Your face that I can see in the night sky  ♫

855
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:54,650
♫  Keeps rising up in my heart  ♫

856
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,740
♫  I'll find the way  ♫

857
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,130
 He's going to get here tomorrow.

858
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:05,120
♫  To the end of the night  ♫

859
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,190
♫  when we first met  ♫

860
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:16,990
♫  I'll always be there  ♫

861
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,520
Jae Jin.

862
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,310
Why do you have to make out with a girl in front of our house?

863
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:33,410
Let me go home.

864
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,410
Jae Jin.

865
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:38,350
Jae Jin. Can't you hear me?

866
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,570
Jae Jin.

867
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,760
Is he not him?

868
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,810
Jae Jin? It is him.

869
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,110
Hey.

870
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,330
You're blocking my way home.

871
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,079
There's an alley in there. Do it over there.

872
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,120
Why do you have to be kissing in front of the house?

873
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,360
- Bye. 
 - Bye! See you!

874
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,599
Are you feeling all right?

875
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,000
It can't be worse.

876
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,460
What?

877
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,790
Is there anything you want to say when you see me?

878
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,769
Do you want to eat tiramisu?

879
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,399
No, not that.

880
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,960
Is there anything you want to say when you look at me?

881
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:39,069
You look cute?

882
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,359
It's not about my appearance.

883
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,510
For example, "I..."

884
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:49,650
"I want to go for a walk."

885
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,560
You wanted to go for a walk.

886
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,270
Then let's go for a walk. It will help you sober up too.

887
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,170
Dam.

888
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,880
I thought

889
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,040
I wouldn't mind quietly disappearing from this world.

890
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,100
But you made me want to live.

891
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,410
I have always found it uncomfortable being with someone,

892
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,850
but I like having you around.

893
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,350
Seeing you hurt makes me angry,

894
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,090
and going to pick you up when you get drunk

895
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,880
doesn't bother me at all.

896
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,880
That's right.

897
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,920
This is me

898
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,350
saying I love you.

899
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,530

900
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:37,330

901

00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:03,210
♫   I wanna be your star   ♫

907
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,180
It looks good on you.

908
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,040
♫  (your moon, your stars, you)  ♫

♫  I wanna be your star  ♫

♫  (your moon, your stars, you)  ♫

911
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,069
- Do you like it? 
 - Of course.

912
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,110
I haven't gotten a necklace before.

913
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,039
Now I feel bad for always complaining and not saying nice things to you.

914
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,950
I think you're much more humane than...

915
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,840
Right. Did the Bead change?

916
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,099
It's the same.

917
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,129
You have been saying nice things today

918
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,109
and gave me such a nice present,

919
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,089
so I thought it might have changed.

920
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,880
Too bad.

921
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,930
I really wish you can become a human.

922
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,749
You always seemed calm.

923
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:03,520
But when you told me the Bead turned blue with a smiling face,

924
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,590
I realized you really wanted it, too.

925
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,490
Which made me want it even more.

926
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,070
Actually, there's something I want to tell you.

927
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:25,839
It may be too early to say, but I think you'll be excited to hear it.

928
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,630
What is it?

929
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,040
Well...

930
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,340
I might...

931
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:04,249

932
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,490

933
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,280
I was wrong.

934
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,840
What?

935
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,180
I think

936
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,890
the end is near.

 You said the end was near. Maybe you're already a human.

01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,009
 I wish I was.

949

 What is a good breakup?

 Don't talk like this is our last goodbye.

951

 I'm worried

952
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:52,160
 you'd be left here alone

953
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,120
 and would have to cry alone

954
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,160
