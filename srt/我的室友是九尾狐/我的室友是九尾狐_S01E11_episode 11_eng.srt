1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:10,960

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,949

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,060

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,700

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,780

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,970

7
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,310
You drove here, right? Do you want me to call you a chauffeur?

8
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,460
No.

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,590
I'll walk home.

10
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,330
You can't walk to Seocho-dong.

11
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:09,310
You remember where I live.

12
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,349
You're drunk.

13
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,789
Instead of staying here all alone, go back inside, sober up, and...

14
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,410
It's a free hug.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,160
It's free for you.

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,360
Please get him home safely.

17
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,100
Let me go. You need to go home.

18
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:20,370
He was hammered.

19
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,360
I'll be honest with you.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,100
He got drunk, then he hugged me.

21
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,479
But it's not a big deal. It's just like getting a free hug.

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,720
Miss Dam, I love how you're always honest,

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,580
but keep something like that to yourself.

24
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,240
It only makes me angry.

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,890
Oh, okay.

26
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,979
Let's go. Let me walk you home.

27
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,139
Anyway, you came for the wrap-up party,

28
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,580
but you couldn't even say hello to everyone because of me.

29
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,050
Well, I was using the party as an excuse to be here,

30
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,760
because I actually came to see you.

31
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,740
Why did you leave so early?

32
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,380
I have a report due tomorrow.

33
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,320
I see. Then you must be busy tomorrow.

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,979
I wanted to ask you out since it's the weekend.

35
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,700
Wait, since it has been a while, may I come over?

36
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,589
To my place?

37
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,760
Your study is as good as a library.

38
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,920
It'll be great like the old days.

39
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
Back when we lived together, we were alone in that huge house...

40
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,929
Why is this kind of music playing all of a sudden?

41
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,060
Yes, exactly.

42
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,980
Anyway, don't worry about me touching you.

43
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,309
I'll keep my hands away as much as possible to leave you in peace.

44
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,990
- Do you trust me? 
 - Yes, I do.

45
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,810
 It's nothing. I won't be concerned.

46
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,820
 One's fate cannot be this simple.

47
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,200
How long has it been?

48
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,860
Are you going out?

49
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,979
Yes, you know... just to a friend's house.

50
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,669
What's going on? You can say it's Soo Kyeong

51
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,510
or Jae Jin's house since you don't have any other friends.

52
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,959
Are you going to Seon Woo's place by any chance?

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,160
Stop talking nonsense.

54
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,009
It's a study group.

55
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,130
"It's a study group."

56
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,430
You're obviously going to your boyfriend's. Stop lying.

57
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,860
Anyway, I have to go.

58
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,770
Okay, good luck!

59
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,259
I can't believe how quick he is. How did he even notice that?

60
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,350

61
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,310
Hey, Jae Kang.

62
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,250
What? Jae Jin didn't come home last night?

63
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,850
Well, we had a wrap-up party after the festival yesterday.

64
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,770
Then where did he stay last night?

65
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,070

66
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,509
 Jae Jin, where did you stay last night?

67
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,189
    Oppa, are you asleep?

68
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,089
   My little brother, you better be home while I'm still nice.

69
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,069
My gosh.

70
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,410
My head hurts.

71
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,960
Jae Kang, when did I get home last night?

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,180
What's going on?

73
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,900
You're up.

74
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,890
What's going...

75
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,840
What happened?

76
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,110
Why am I at a hotel with Hye Sun?

77
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,150
And why is my shirt off?

78
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,500
No way.

79
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,160
Hey.

80
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,410
I had your shirt laundered. It'll be here soon.

81
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,520
- Yesterday, you ended up... 
 - Wait, Hye Sun.

82
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,390
Last...

83
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,880
Last night, did we...

84
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,620
sleep together?

85
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,930
Yes, we did.

86
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,599

87
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,929

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,589
 Jae Jin, wake up.

91
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,239
 Hye Sun, don't worry about me. You should go home.

92
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,900
 I'm...

93
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,279
 I don't want to be

94
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,930
 a nuisance to you anymore.

95
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,220
 Oh no.

96
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,400
 - It's cold. 
 - No.

97
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,480
 What do I do now? What's this?

98
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,380

Hey, Dan.

122
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,100
What? What happened?

123
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,330
Okay, I'll be there right now.

124
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,749

125
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,149
 Sir, something happened to my brother, so I can't be there today.

126
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,340
 I'll call you later. I'm sorry.

127
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,519

128
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,839
Hey, Dan.

129
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,580
Dam.

130
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,200
What is this? What happened?

131
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,940
Are you his sister?

132
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,170
I'm the owner of the scooter he smashed.

133
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,489
The victim, so to speak.

134
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,390
And the perpetrator who broke my bow.

135
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,260
What are you talking about?

136
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,380
I knocked over her scooter by mistake, then...

137
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,230
 Darn it.

138
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,809
 Hey! How dare you run away?

139
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,750
 Stop right there!

140
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,490
 - Hey! 
 - What?

141
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,609
Just take it easy and settle the case.

142
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,059
The estimates were about the same,

143
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,289
so you can each fix your...

144
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,300
That's not fair. He started this.

145
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,820
I'll wait for my guardian too.

146
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,980
My brother will be here soon.

147
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,510
- Why did you call me this time? 
 - Seon Woo.

148
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,630
That guy.

149
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,350
Sunbae.

150
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,069
You could've just talked it out with him. Why did you bother the police?

151
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,969
I just wanted to make sure who's wrong in this.

152
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,310
Why are you only yelling at me?

153
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,409
I should've called Mom instead.

154
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,919
Should I call her and tell her you bought a scooter?

155
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,169
Forget it. You and I are over.

156
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,849
Then you won't need my credit card.

157
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,990
I was going to pay to fix that.

158
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,630
Thank you so much for coming, Seon Woo.

159
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,550
Here.

160
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,300
Goodbye.

161
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,539
I'm sorry she blew this up.

162
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,569
If his bow is badly damaged, I'll...

163
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,510
It's okay, Sunbae. Each to their own, remember?

164
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,549
I'm so sorry.

165
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,039
My sister can be stubborn.

166
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,030
Don't mention it.

167
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,770
Forget that.

168
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
We finally get to meet, my brother-in-law.

169
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,589
Hey, no. I have a boyfriend.

170
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,779
Really?

171
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,629
So you aren't dating him?

172
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,339
How many times do I have to tell you?

173
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,550
- Run along. You said you were late. 
 - Fine.

174
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,340
Not only is he good-looking, but he's also unbelievably generous. So why not?

175
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,930
I should get going too, Seon Woo.

176
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,940
Wait, Dam.

177
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,930

178
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,750
Yesterday was a mistake.

179
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,100
I usually don't drink that much.

180
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,840
I'm sorry.

181
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,260
Yes, you shouldn't drink too much.

182
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,480
Goodbye.

183
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,860
Bye.

184
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,929
 When the red thread of fate ties two people together,

185
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,970
 the two will surely begin to get attracted to one another.

186
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,579
Therefore, a man and a woman tied with that thread

187
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,000
will always end up together no matter what.

188
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,830
That's the red thread I know about.

189
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,690
So? What about it?

190
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,970
Well, I just got curious.

191
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,660
Is there a way to break it off?

192
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,040
No, there aren't many people who can go against their fate.

193
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,489
This is really suspicious.

194
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,080
You never cared about this. Why do you ask?

195
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,390
Dam and Seon Woo are

196
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,870
tied up by a red thread.

197
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,880
What? Why?

198
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,090
Wait, was it the old man?

199
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,289
I mean, of course.

200
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,899
I get it's frustrating to see you not doing anything before your time is up.

201
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,249
But you said you'll deal with it. Why does he take things this far?

202
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,790
Has he really gone senile?

203
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,620
You poor thing.

204
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,979
The Bead just teases you by changing colors once every blue moon.

205
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,769
You were about to be happy with your first girlfriend in centuries,

206
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,879
but you got hungry and become a threat to her.

207
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,169
But now that girlfriend is tied by a red thread

208
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,009
to another man?

209
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,280
It's the worst of the worst.

210
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,050
Was I too detailed about my concerns?

211
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,610
Detailed?

212
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,570
Do you know how to spell it?

213
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,539
Why are you bringing that up?

214
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,570
Am I not allowed to be worried if I can't spell that?

215
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,459
You've been fine for a while, but you're getting arrogant again.

216
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,110
This is why the mountain spirit punished you with the red thread.

217
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,820
Punishment? Hardly.

218
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,519
That thread is nothing.

219
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,700
Hey, Miss Dam.

220
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,350
Is everything all right with your brother?

221
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,250
We're each going to pay for the damage.

222
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,589
 So I'm looking for a new part-time job.

223
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,839
Dan will need at least a million won

224
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,470
to have his bow fixed.

225
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,699
Let me know if you need my help.

226
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,480
 It's all right.

227
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,629
It would've been horrible if she was stubborn,

228
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,030
but it was someone I knew, so things went well.

229
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,250
Someone you know?

230
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,940
The scooter happened to belong to Seon Woo's little sister.

231
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,169
 He suddenly showed up as her guardian.

232
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,910
 What a surprise.

233
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,950
 Hello? Sir?

234
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,470
Yes, I'm listening.

235
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,220
Then I'll call you after I finish my report.

236
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,880
- See you later, Dad. 
 - Wait, Seon Woo.

237
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,699
You already maxed out your credit card limit.

238
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,340
- Yesterday, Seo Woo... 
 - Give it back.

239
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,719
- What? 
 - If you need money, sell your car,

240
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,789
get a part-time job, or do whatever else.

241
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,890
Leave the credit card here and go to school.

242
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,880
 This is shocking.

243
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,930
I heard you're dating someone.

244
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,069
And why am I hearing this news on my best friend from someone else?

245
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,180
You broke my heart.

246
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,009
Soo Kyeong, I'll tell you everything once I figure out everything.

247
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,939
I just started seeing him, and...

248
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,409
Why? Is this a short fling?

249
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,209
So it's not very serious?

250
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,709
That's not the case.

251
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,610
No.

252
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,300
It's not the case. This can't be happening.

253
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,780
My friends.

254
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,099
Could you sleep with someone you don't even like?

255
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,200
What? What have you done?

256
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,380
What are you talking about?

257
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,279
When I woke up,

258
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,989
I was half-naked in a hotel.

259
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,529
- You dog. 
 - You jerk.

260
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,339
What's with you? Have you gone insane?

261
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,740
You're crazy!

262
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,840
All right. I'd rather feel pain in my body.

263
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,489
I feel so uneasy in my heart.

264
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,430
What am I going to do?

265
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,700
So who's the girl?

266
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,700
Well, that's none of our business. What did she say?

267
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,150
Nothing.

268
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,869
And it's not like she's avoiding me.

269
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,940
She acts as if nothing has happened.

270
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,089
That means she doesn't have any intention of talking it out.

271
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,369
If you two didn't have any feelings,

272
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,800
just let it go as a mistake.

273
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,350
What else can you do?

274
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,110
I don't think I can do that.

275
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,730
Hey, our midterm grades are almost all out.

276
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,109
I didn't date anybody or made stupid mistakes

277
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:25,370
but studied all the time.

278
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,570
I'm sure I'm the top of our department, I don't even need to check.

279
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,550
I'm off to my class.

280
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,390
Get a grip, Jae Jin.

281
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,370
Bye.

282
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,970
Why do you bother staying alive? Why?

283
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,690
I almost got a perfect score. I knew it.

284
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,540
Great job, myself.

285
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,690
What am I going to do? I completely botched up my finals.

286
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,280
Me too. That professor is tough on grades, though.

287
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,500
Hey, how did you do in Modern History?

288
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,049
Oh, I got 1 point deducted, so 29.

289
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,860
I thought I'd get perfect scores on all subjects, but I lost one point.

290
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,689
Really?

291
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,930
I heard Seok got perfect scores on all subjects.

292
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,860
Really?

293
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,140
Perfect scores?

294
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,110
Gosh, maybe Seok will become the top of our department this semester.

295
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,250
Stop that. Get ready for class.

296
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,720
I knew this relationship was nothing but evil.

297
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,479
 Did you see how we got a C on our couple project?

298
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,229
 What did we do wrong?

299
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,310

300
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,380
Why won't she talk about that night?

301
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,240
She's really going to let this pass? An incident like this one?

302
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,020
 Hye Sun, let's meet up and talk.

303
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,469

304
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,270
What's wrong with my report card?

305
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,820
Woo Yeo is going to think I'm a joke again if he finds out.

306
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,720
Hi, Hye Sun.

307
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,799
Hey. I got your coffee. You can have that.

308
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,420
Okay. Thanks.

309
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,030
Anyway,

310
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,060
we got a horrible grade for the report.

311
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,279
Have our dates been too normal, drinking coffee and watching movies?

312
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,449
If what happened yesterday happened sooner,

313
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,999
we could've written about what happened at the hotel.

314
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,500
Hye Sun.

315
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,269
There's no need to share that much information on some report.

316
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,670
Why not?

317
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,740
I've lived long enough, but that was such a new experience.

318
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,540
 - It's cold. 
 - No.

319
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,570
That was the first time something like that ever happened.

320
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,740
First?

321
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,740
Anyway, you were really heavy.

322
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,330
My back really hurt.

323
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,540
Your back?

324
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,190
Hye Sun.

325
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,790
I'll take responsibility.

326
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,620
What?

327
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,570
If you want, I'll take responsibility in any form.

328
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,670
 Is he talking about the bad grade?

329
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,510
It's okay. It's not one person's fault.

330
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,909
What do you mean, it's not one person's fault?

331
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,350
Are you saying it was consensual?

332
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,750
Of course.

333
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,410

We did it together.

334
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,130
I see.

335
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,340
And by my standard, it wasn't that bad.

336
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,010
Really? I wasn't that bad?

337
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,690
I'm glad.

338
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,260

339
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,779

340
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,449

341
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,109
   Hey, so one couple really started dating?

342
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,690
   Yes, Bo Rim and Jae Hyun.

343
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,920
   I'm jealous.

344
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,029
 If you start dating, you get an A plus even if you bomb the finals.

345
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:14,180
Jae Jin, what are they saying?

346
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,939

347
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,139
Oh, the lecture itself is

348
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,969
about the understanding of communication between people.

349
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:24,490
So if two people begin to date by understanding each other

350
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,319
through this dating application project, he always gives an A plus.

351
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,230
- Then let's start dating. 
 - Okay, let's...

352
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,870
- What? 
 - You said you'll take responsibility.

353
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,300
- Of course. 
 - Then we're dating, okay?

354
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,770
Let's say you asked me out first. Okay?

355
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, okay.

356
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,629
- Come here. 
 - What?

357
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,510
Come.

358
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,560
One, two, three.

359
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,110
What's this picture? Are Jae Jin and Hye Sun dating?

360
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,660
What? Jae Jin?

361
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,390
No way. Wouldn't you say I'm better?

362
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,030
No way. Sir, Jae Jin and Hye Sun are dating.

363
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,570
What?

364
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,300
Jae Jin claims they're only pretending to date for grades.

365
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,050
But he's not the type who worries about grades.

366
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,310
Is Hye Sun the type who loves to study?

367
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,710
No way.

368
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,109
Then why?

369
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,920
 Wait, did Jae Jin make that mistake with her?

370
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,659
 No way.

371
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,990
What do you mean, they're pretending to date for grades?

372
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,200
We get an A plus if we become a couple in our Communications lecture.

373
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,019
Is it because I haven't gone on too many dates with Seon Woo?

374
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:50,500
The grade for our report doesn't look too great.

375
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,070
Wait, sir.

376
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,250
Are you concerned about Seon Woo?

377
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,579
Of course,

378
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,390
you wouldn't be happy after you saw him hug me.

379
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,330
But you seemed down since yesterday.

380
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,720
It's not that I think you're jealous.

381
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,920
But I am jealous.

382
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:42,220
I have to think about all kinds of things to get closer to you like this.

383
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,220
But it seemed too easy for him.

384
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,510
So don't get too close to him.

385
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,970
Don't make me jealous.

386
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,830
Okay. I won't.

387
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,719

388
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:16,970
Sir, I was told to come for the part-time job interview.

389
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,110
- Come again. 
 - Sure.

390
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,720
Uncle, could you please let me borrow three million won?

391
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,310
Three million, my foot. I'll beat you three million times.

392
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,999
I opened up my restaurants two weeks ago,

393
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:37,269
but you never visited me once.

394
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,200
Then when you actually come, you come asking me for money?

395
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,389
What can I do? My dad cut me off his credit card.

396
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,530
No, I can't.

397
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,359
Of course, you took after me the most among all of my nephews,

398
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,410
so it's true that I especially adore you.

399
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,270
But I know what my brother-in-law means, so I can't let you borrow money.

400
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,349
- Gosh, what do I do? 
 - He's hot.

401
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,999
- He's really good-looking. 
 - He is.

402
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,170
Look at how hot he is.

403
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,159
- What are you doing? 
 - You needed money.

404
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,539
Things have been hectic since I opened up,

405
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,089
so I was going to hire new part-timers.

406
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,259
You need money, I need part-timers.

407
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,929
It's a win-win situation, my nephew.

408
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,260
Whatever, Uncle. I can't work here.

409
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,450
Excuse me, hello.

410
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,170
I'm here for the part-time job interview.

411
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,969
Yes, you must be Ms. Lee Dam.

412
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,509
You're right.

413
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm the owner here.

414
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,829
Please take a seat. Let me grab your resume.

415
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,200
Okay, sir.

416
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,809
Gosh, why are you standing there?

417
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:04,620
Uncle, you have to hire her.

418
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,960
You can't try to pull strings the moment you start here.

419
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,350
On top of that, why should I?

420
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,940
- She's pretty. 
 - What?

421
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,589
Are you sure you can start today?

422
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,909
You said you're in need.

423
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,769
And I'm grateful that you're willing to hire me after hearing my story.

424
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,089
Don't mention it.

425
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,220
It's wonderful that you're doing this for your brother.

426
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,539
Then do you want to start now?

427
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,780
Of course, I signed the employment contract.

428
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,570
- Sunbae. 
 - Hey.

429
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,510
What?

430
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,219
You two know each other?

431
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,360
Yes, she's a junior at school.

432
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,700
He's my uncle.

433
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,470
You look startled.

434
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,380
You must have thought I was his brother.

435
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,190
My gosh.

436
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,550
Why have I been running into him all the time lately?

437
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,520
I don't think my sir will be happy about it.

438
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,430

439
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,359
Sir, did you see my message?

440
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,870
I'm working starting today.

441
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,799
Yes, I saw it.

442
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,369
How is it? Is it all right?

443
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:27,499
Yes, it's doable, but...

444
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,219
 It's near Hongdae, right?

445
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,820
Do you want me to pick you up after work?

446
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,090
Pick me up?

447
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,540
Actually, the thing is...

448
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,519
Oh, no.

449
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,209
- Hang on. Let me... 
 - Oh, no.

450
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,319
Sir, I'll talk to you later.

451
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,410
 Seon Woo, are you okay?

452
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,860
Professor Shin. Hi.

453
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,260
Wait.

454
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,340
Would you like to have a cup of coffee?

455
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,300
I have good coffee beans in my lab.

456
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,210
Maybe next time. Now, if you'll excuse me.

457
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,460
- Soo Kyeong. 
 - Yes?

458
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,610
Please don't mind what they said earlier.

459
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,019
What?

460
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,439
Oh. You mean, that I keep you in check?

461
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,889
Of course, I don't mind.

462
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,860
I'm the only rival of myself.

463
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,690
Soo Kyeong.

464
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,490
Do you hate me because...

465
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,340
of what happened two years ago?

466
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,890
If you haven't gotten over it yet...

467
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,770
I'll be late for my class.

468
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,409
Hey, Dam. What are you up to? Want to grab a drink...

469
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,519
Sorry, I'm working now. I'll call you back.

470
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,960
Work?

471
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,650
When did she even get a job?

472
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,430
Since when does she keep this many secrets from me?

473
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,000
Jae Jin.

474
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,680
Since when is he going out with Hye Sun?

475
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,820
 Everyone has a secret.

476
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,769
 Dam, who had always been single and told me every single thing going on in her life

477
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,330
 kept her boyfriend a secret.

478
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:15,049
 And Jae Jin, whom I thought was a one-woman man,

479
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,500
 had a one-night...

480
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,480
 Well, he made some shocking moves and suddenly got a girlfriend.

481
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,240
 And...

482
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,230
 he's my secret.

483
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,310
 The secret of mine that gave me

484
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,340
 an incurable wound.

485
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,910
 My biggest secret.

486
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,080
 I'll see you tomorrow.

487
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,110
 I'm leaving.

488
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,710
Dam.

489
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,620
I'll walk you home.

490
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,639
If you feel uncomfortable, I'll just walk you to the station nearby.

491
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,629
Wherever you walk me, it'll make me uncomfortable anyway.

492
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,520
I just have a lot of things to ask regarding work.

493
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,210
- Then let's talk about it on the way. 
 - Okay.

494
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,390
- Hi, Sir. 
  - Have you finished work?

495
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,640
Yes. I was just about to go home.

496
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,530
 Was it all right?

497
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,209
Yes. It wasn't so hard. My boss seems like a nice person, too.

498
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,950
 How about your coworker?

499
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,770
 I don't want to worry him for nothing.

500
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,280
I think everything was fine.

501
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,910
 Are you sure everything is okay?

502
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,420
- Yes. 
  - Okay.

503
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,960
 Then have a safe trip back home.

504
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,510
Thanks.

505
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,380
Was that your boyfriend?

506
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,340
Yes. It's my boyfriend, whom I really like a lot.

507
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,600
I didn't ask how much you like him.

508
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,410
Surprise!

509
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,199
I couldn't make it last weekend, so I came today.

510
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,059
I was crushed because I was really looking forward to our indoor date.

511
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,599
You should have called me.

512
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,010
I did, but you didn't answer.

513
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,110
The battery is dead.

514
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,290
Nothing has changed.

515
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:51,549
The huge TV, the comfortable sofa,

516
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,239
and you, a dashing man standing right there.

517
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,430
I've missed you all so much.

518
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,560
So...

519
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,630
come here and have a seat.

520
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,670
Come on.

521
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,749
I brought something for us.

522
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,980
Surprise!

523
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,240

524
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,840
Here.

525
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,240
Come on and try.

526
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,369
I don't feel like it.

527
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:29,970
Why not? Try it at least.

528
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,989
I want to open it up.

529
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,450
I don't like that it's hiding things.

530
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,869
Who knows what's inside the bun?

531
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,589
I can tell you what's inside.

532
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,359
Bacon, salami, lettuce...

533
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,490
I'll pass.

534
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,330
 I thought she came to tell me the truth.

535
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:53,680
 I came to tell him the truth, but his mood seems...

536
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,340
It's tasty.

537
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,550
Miss Dam.

538
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,140
The sound.

539
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,380
Okay.

540
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,660
 What a petty man.

541
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,629
Wait here.

542
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:35,360
I'll make you the coffee you used to like.

543
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,000
Sir, wait.

544
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,810
I have something to tell you.

545
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,990
It looks like the light went out.

546
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,590
I think it's a blackout.

547
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:55,570
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

548
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,160
It's okay.

549
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,959
I should have some candles. Do you want to come with me?

550
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:02,740
Sure.

551
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,250
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

552
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,440
I'm sorry.

553
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,259
- Ouch. 
 - What's the matter?

554
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,930
I got a cramp.

555
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,260
Open your mouth.

556
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,080
Did you swallow it?

557
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,830
Yes.

558
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,720
What do we do now?

559
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,129
Since I swallowed it anyway,

560
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,529
should I keep it for a few days?

561
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,209
I don't have much energy anyway, so...

562
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,850
No. Hurry and give it back.

563
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,380
How? Should I hit my chest really hard?

564
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,000
Don't you remember?

565
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,550
You have taken the Bead out before.

566
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,740
I'll be closing my eyes, so do whatever you have to do to take it back.

567
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,570
What's wrong?

568
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,370
I'm afraid I might take your energy too.

569
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,590
Then let me do it.

570
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,300
What?

571
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,650
I don't know how to spit it out,

572
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,850
so you take care of the rest.

573
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:29,460
♫  It touches me, the look in your eyes  ♫

574
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:36,770
♫  Somehow, unbeknownst to me  ♫

575
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:42,730
♫  I am waiting for you  ♫

576
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:49,980
♫  As if it's by chance  ♫

577
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:56,530
♫  Your face that I can see in the night sky  ♫

578
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,780
♫  Keeps rising up in my heart  ♫

579
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,750
I don't think it was this long before.

580
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,060
You told me to take care of it.

581
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,250
And I took care of it all right.

582
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:26,560
♫  I'll always be there  ♫

583
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:35,870
♫  Please come back to me  ♫

584
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,570
How was it?

585
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,120
Well.

586
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,920
My heart fluttered.

587
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,690
No, I mean...

588
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,630
How did you feel?

589
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,769
Did you feel weak, by any chance?

590
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,350
Oh, that. I think I feel fine.

591
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,560
Actually, whenever I see you,

592
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:12,420
I want to hold your hands and stay close to you.

593
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,470
But I'm afraid that might hurt you.

594
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:20,560
You always say that, but you have never actually hurt me.

595
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,450
You said you would find a way.

596
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,680
And this is the way I came up with.

597
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,820
This way, you can take a little bit of energy from me,

598
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,650
and I can be very happy.

599
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,060
- Miss Dam... 
 - Come on. Let me do this at least.

600
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,850
I trust you.

601
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,660
I want you to trust me, too.

602
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,730
Right. There's something I need to tell you.

603
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,910
I'm working

604
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,640
with Seon Woo.

605
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,809
I didn't mean to lie to you.

606
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,710
I didn't tell you because I didn't want to worry you.

607
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,660
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,390
You probably couldn't tell me

609
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,940
because my jealousy made you feel uncomfortable.

610
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,690
But I can't promise I won't get jealous.

611
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,790
Actually, there's a reason

612
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,430
why he bothers me.

613
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,270
I'll be honest with you too.

614
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,960
But I don't see anything.

615
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:15,830
Is that why I keep getting involved with him these days?

616
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,130
I guess destiny does exist...

617
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,750
Whatever.

618
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,200
I made a promise.

619
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,929
 Red thread? What do we do now?

620
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:38,040
 Just like me more.

621
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,990
 Don't change.

622
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,010
 Like me as much as I like you.

623
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,450
There's no such thing as destiny.

624
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,450

625
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,340

626
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,280
 Hye Sun, I'm arriving soon. Is there anything you want to eat?

627
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,990
What? Why did he send this to me...

628
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:08,420
 Hey, Dam. Did I make any mistake there?

629
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,670
 Did I write anything women hate to hear?

630
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,700
I thought we were dating to get good grades, not to actually go on dates.

631
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,880
Excuse me.

632
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,640
Can I have your phone number?

633
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,979
I have a boyfriend.

634
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,100
We can just be text buddies too.

635
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,930
I said, I have a boyfriend.

636
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,190
Do you have a problem with my girlfriend?

637
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:48,400
No. I'm sorry.

638
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,470
Oh.

639
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,850
Sorry, I held your hand without asking. I just wanted to help you.

640
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,850
It's just like the time at the festival. Being pretty must be hard.

641
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,950
What are you saying? Come on. Let's go eat.

642
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,740
Okay.

643
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,170
Hye Sun, have this too. It's really tasty.

644
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,140
- Why don't you have some too? 
 - I had enough already.

645
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,539
Do you want me to take photos of you?

646
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,680
That's so random.

647
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,270
Look over here.

648
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,970
You look great. Do you want to have a look?

649
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,520
If you don't like it, I can take you some more.

650
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,040
Don't bother.

651
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,020
 Why is he being so nice to me?

652
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,410
Do your legs hurt?

653
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,300
No.

654
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,550
Are you bored? Should we do something else?

655
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,200
Something else?

656
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,029
 Hye Sun, do you want to go somewhere and take some rest?

657
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,400
 Shall we get inside now?

658
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,610
 They're all so predictable.

659
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,060
Let's have a chit-chat.

660
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,089
What? Have a what?

661
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,949
Well, we didn't get to talk much.

662
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,280
You may not believe this because of our start,

663
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,570
but I like taking it slowly and properly.

664
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,169
We agreed to go out anyway,

665
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,070
so I'd like to get to know you better to entertain you.

666
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,060
Let's talk.

667
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,920
 What is he saying?

668
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,550
I don't really have anything to talk about.

669
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,330
Oppa.

670
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,960
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

671
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,910
- Let's go, Hye Sun. 
 - Seriously?

672
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,600
Why did you not answer my call? I said I had something to say to you.

673
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,210
I don't have anything to say nor to hear from you.

674
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,840
Don't you remember?

675
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,110
We broke up. You dumped me.

676
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,910
But you weren't like this before.

677
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,490
You don't even reply to my texts anymore.

678
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,160
You think I should always answer your calls and texts

679
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,050
and listen to whatever you tell me to do?

680
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,860
You think that's my job?

681
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,570
Enough already. You've crossed the line.

682
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,080
Then let me ask you just one thing.

683
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,120
Are you two going out?

684
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,960
Yes. She's my girlfriend.

685
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,580
I'm sorry, Hye Sun.

686
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:33,160
I should have just ignored her.

687
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,020
I ruined our first date.

688
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,870
Did you like her so much?

689
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,900
That's not what it is.

690
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,290
I was unsure if I could see anyone else after breaking up with her.

691
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,780
I felt like I couldn't trust anyone anymore

692
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,620
and I kept losing confidence in myself.

693
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,590
I must be the problem.

694
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,370
I'm sorry.

695
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,580
I really wanted to make this work today.

696
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,160
You must be confused.

697
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,060
 I was confused indeed.

698
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,770
 You were different from the guys I've met.

699
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,509
 At some point,

700
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:28,909
 I started to avoid men, who seemed to seriously care about me.

701
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:32,760
 I would like to marry you one day, Hye Sun.

702
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:35,240
 I'm sorry.

703
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,110
 Because I knew, in the end, everything was meaningless,

704
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:44,669
 I only had shallow relationships where I knew what I wanted from it.

705
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:46,480
 Should we break up?

706
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,930
 Sure, why not?

707
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:54,029
 The superficial and calculative relationship lasted only until it was enjoyable.

708
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:57,310
 Eventually, I ended the relationship or the relationship ended me.

709
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,800
 Having relationships like that,

710
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,910
 I forgot how to love and to be loved.

711
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,830
It's not your problem.

712
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,400
The problem is the one who doesn't know how to be loved.

713
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,300
Don't cry, Jae Jin.

714
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,730
Don't cry. Let's talk.

715
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,010
I'll bad-mouth her with you.

716
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,020
Stop crying.

717
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,950
I'm not crying.

718
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,289
We don't have tissues, so stop crying so much.

719
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,310
I'm not crying.

720
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:54,510

721
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,130
Dam, why are you so late?

722
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,089
All the front seats are taken because it's Professor Shin's lecture.

723
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:07,690
It's like an idol concert. I barely managed to take this seat.

724
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:10,150
I'll sit in the back then.

725
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,540
I'll sit here. This is the only seat left.

726
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,370
Okay.

727
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:41,860
 So the red thread is tying us together.

728
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,010
 But why?

729
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,000
 - Hello, Professor. 
 - Hello, Professor.

730
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,900
There are two views about understanding historical events.

731
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,940
One argues that historical events happened for real...

732
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,440
There was a piece of thread on.

733
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,200
Seon Woo, no matter what it is that is on my hair,

734
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,820
unless it's threatening my life, please don't touch me.

735
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,680
But...

736
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,490
Miss Dam.

737
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,779
Please don't get me wrong. There was a piece of thread on my hair.

738
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,820
I didn't get it wrong.

739
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,310
I just wanted to see you up close.

740
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,810
From now on, please sit on the front seat when you take my lecture.

741
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,050
But they are not facts.

742
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:38,470
Let's start with the first argument.

743
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,629
To quote a German historian of the 1800s,

744
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:50,680
"How things actually were is history."

745
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,350
Miss Dam.

746
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,070
Sir.

747
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,780
See?

748
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:36,949
This is what happens when you mess with the destiny that the deity has prepared for you.

749
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:40,060
Are you the one who tied the thread?

750
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,819
- Why... 
 - Consider yourself lucky.

751
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,560
To meet the one tied with you by the red thread is not easy.

752
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:55,220
Don't you want to know what your destiny is?

753
00:57:55,220 --> 00:58:01,210
Does that mean my destiny or future is all decided?

754
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:06,160
The deity cannot tell the future either.

755
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,620
But the deity can show what might be the future.

756
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,560
I'll let you dream.

757
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,770
 Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

758
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,720
 No, I'm fine.

759
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,780
Miss Dam.

760
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,180
What did you do?

761
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,040
I just let her dream.

762
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,790
A short dream, which will end in a blink of an eye.

763
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:45,150
You're a mere animal.

764
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:48,950
Therefore you don't have the right to decide your own destiny.

765
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:55,410
Whatever this girl chooses for her destiny, you have to accept it.

766
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,900
I'm sure you want to know what she's seeing.

767
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:09,950
I'll let you see what can be her future, too.

768
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:59,920

769
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,660
Dam.

770
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,170
Wake up.

771
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:12,290
Stop

772
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,590
looking at that.

773
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,200

01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,390
 Their ordinary day looked nice.

785
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,519
 Those are the things I can't offer her.

786
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,490
 I'll be away for two days, one night.

787
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:05,439
 To be honest, I don't want you to go.

788
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,550
 I wish you stay away from him.

789
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,860
 One day, there will come a moment

790
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,720
 when you can't stand that you're actually a fox.

791
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:18,180
 I felt that way because of the red thread?

792

♫   I couldn’t recognize your sadness  ♫

793
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:24,110
