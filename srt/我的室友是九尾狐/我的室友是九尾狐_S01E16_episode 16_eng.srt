1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:10,180

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,899

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,010

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,740

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,780

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,020

7
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,520
Actually, there's something I want to tell you.

8
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,050
It may be too early to say, but I think you'll be excited to hear it.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,670
What is it?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,590
Well...

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,180
 My goodness!

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,070
 What are you two doing?

13
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,999
 My magic suddenly wouldn't work.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,120
 I know you can feel it when I'm in danger.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,499
 And I can't feel any signs or human energy.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,300
 I think you're actually becoming a human now.

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,820
I might...

18
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,060
I was wrong.

19
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,370
What?

20
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,800
I think

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,160
the end is near.

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,460
What do you mean, the end is near?

23
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,060
Do you mean that you'll become human?

24
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,899
I mean, if you can't use magic or feel anything,

25
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,600
that means you're becoming ordinary.

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,610
My gosh, Sir.

27
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,700
Congratulations!

28
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,170

29
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,860

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,569
Ta-da!

31
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,320
I prepared this to celebrate since you're becoming human soon.

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,790
I hope you can say goodbye to your long, difficult years as a gumiho

33
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,030
and become human quickly!

34
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,850
Wait, should we have a celebratory drink tonight?

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,050
Well, I guess it could be a bore to open the champagne too soon.

36
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,328
Okay, on the day you become human,

37
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,160
I'll treat you to a hundred bottles of champagne!

38
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,740
What's wrong? What's with that expression?

39
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,490
So everything was a sign of your dissipation?

40
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,750
You couldn't use your magic, you lost your sixth sense,

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,790
and your hands started disappearing.

42
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,120
You still have months until your 1,000th year. So why is it happening already?

43
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:58,250
We shouldn't just sit around. Let's go see the old man.

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,249
If we can find out what's going on—

45
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,300
I've been looking for him,

46
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,280
but he won't answer me.

47
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,580
What?

48
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,840
I'm sure it's not a big deal.

49
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,449
That old man can be pretty nasty,

50
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,279
but he's not the type to cut his own deadline short.

51
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,588
So don't get scared, and let's focus on dying the Bead blue.

52
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,980
You just need to become human before you dissipate.

53
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,760
But you know...

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,999
Hey, Dan. Is everything alright?

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,319
- Have you eaten? 
  - I'm okay.

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,559
Why do you sound so down? Is something going on?

57
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,539
Did I keep you waiting?

58
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,599
I did wait for a while.

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,820
But it's all right since you're pretty.

60
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,380
What's this? You just made my heart race!

61
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,489
When we sit like this, all I can think about is you.

62
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,500
So I'll keep trying my best.

63
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,039
For your sake, if anything.

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,620
Actually, I was so excited I couldn't sleep last night.

65
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,689
But I think I need to be away for a few days

66
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,490
during this crucial time. I'm sorry.

67
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,889
I just got off the phone with Dan.

68
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,609
It's only a few days before his competition,

69
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,549
but he hasn't been performing well.

70
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,239
So I think I'd better go home and help him stay calm.

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,849
You've been doing well, so I'll go home for just a few days.

72
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,139
- Don't go. 
 - What?

73
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,530
I need you too.

74
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,859
It's not like I'm leaving forever. It'll be just a few days.

75
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,910
What, you don't want to be apart for even a moment?

76
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,300
No, I don't.

77
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,449
What is this?

78
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,940
It feels like you're being a bit pushy, so why am I happy?

79
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,540
Your brother is an archer, right?

80
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,250
Who is he?

81
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,790

82
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,629
Ah, say hello. He's my boyfriend.

83
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,749
Come on! Don't say things that can offend people.

84
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:33,769
I'm sorry. My sister loses her mind sometimes.

85
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,040
Hey, he really is my boyfriend!

86
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,369
Nice to meet you.

87
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,989
What, it's true?

88
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,408
Wait, wh-why? Why are you her boyfriend?

89
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,879
Did she blackmail you? Or did you lose a fight?

90
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,649
You psycho! He's really my boyfriend.

91
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,329
He came to help you, since you're in a slump.

92
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,739
Right?

93
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,629
He used to shoot.

94
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,949
Did you compete professionally?

95
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,849
Well, not exactly.

96
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,619
I don't know, the professional world is different.

97
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,109
I'm not doing this as a hobby.

98
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,829
And I'm a reservist on the national team,

99
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,379
so I've already worked with all kinds of coaches.

100
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,400
May I borrow this for a moment?

101
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,890
That's an expensive bow.

102
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,500
What? He's holding it like that?

103
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,800
Do you want to try it?

104
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I think your shoulder will hurt less if you fix your posture a bit.

105
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,440
Wow, how did he know my shoulder hurts?

106
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,900
- Should we start? 
 - Yes, Brother-in-law!

107
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,640
What, brother-in-law? What's with him?

108
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,980
They just met today and he's calling him brother-in-law?

109
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,520
Gosh.

110
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,610
Sir, I think your advice was helpful.

111
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,660
Dan said he broke his old record.

112
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,369
He asked me to thank his brother-in-law.

113
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,620
Why does he keep calling you that?

114
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,870
Why not? I like it.

115
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,820
Get some rest, then.

116
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,079
Thank you, Sir.

117
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,890
I know you made an effort for my sake.

118
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,370
It was also for me.

119
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,010
Your brother needed to be well so I could keep you with me.

120
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,900
And, to be honest,

121
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,780
I wanted to meet your family.

122
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,939
Sir, you really seem to have changed.

123
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,459
You didn't even greet Dan before and used magic to disappear.

124
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,650
So when you wanted to meet him today, you surprised me.

125
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,600
You said it seems like the end is near. Maybe you've become a human already.

126
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,130
I wish I was.

127
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,020
Yes?

128
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,629
Sir, you're still awake?

129
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,540
- I want to sleep with you. 
 - What?

130
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm going to sleep next to you every night.

131
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,649
- Why? 
 - I told you before.

132
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,980
I never want to be apart from you.

133
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,710
♫   All about you   ♫

134
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,459
- Miss Dam. 
 - Yes?

135
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,680
Let's fall asleep together like this

136
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,680
every night.

137
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,790
♫   I want to get a little   ♫

138
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,990
♫  closer to you  ♫

139
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,350
♫   That’s how I feel   ♫

140
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,190
♫   That’s what I want to do, that’s all   ♫

141
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,449
Should we simply have toast for breakfast?

142
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,750
But you don't like simple meals, Miss Dam.

143
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,770
That's true.

144
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,789
We don't have classes now, so how about we eat out?

145
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,529
Sir, why do you always tempt me with food?

146
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,159
It makes my heart race!

147
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,270
I'll go get dressed.

148
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,690
Sir,

149
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,410
I prepared something for you.

150
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,969
Ta-da!

151
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,509
I asked you what you most wanted to do

152
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,929
when you become human,

153
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,859
and you said you weren't sure.

154
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,109
So I tried making a list for you.

155
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,010
Now, look.

156
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,369
Number one, lining up at a specialty restaurant.

157
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,659
It's really tough to wait for hours

158
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,649
unless you're seriously craving that food.

159
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,249
So I want to do that with you once you actually have an appetite.

160
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,849
And number two, looking after your health.

161
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,399
People can get hurt or sick sometimes.

162
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,729
I'm worried you might lose your health

163
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,709
once you suddenly become human.

164
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,599
So I wanted to work out and stuff with you.

165
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,099
Miss Dam.

166
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,340
Let's discuss the future later.

167
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,619
What do you want to do now?

168
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,299
Now? We have to go to classes.

169
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,530
I don't want to go to school.

170
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,250
Let's cut class.

171
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,320
♫   I’m thinking of you, oh every night   ♫

172
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:49,080
♫   What am I to you? I’m curious. Please tell me now   ♫

173
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:57,220
♫  Without even knowing, my feelings grow deeper. 
 I’m seeping into you  ♫

174
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,290
Almost there! Yes!

175
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,530
♫  Ask the moon  ♫

176
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,430
Let me help you.

177
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,750
♫   Tell me now, how are you doing it?   ♫

178
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,500
♫   My nights are filled with you   ♫

179
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,230
- Is it magic? 
 - It's skill.

180
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,860
♫   Stare at me now, I wanna be your moon   ♫

181
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:24,630
♫   Though I know I’m still awkward and inexperienced  ♫

182
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,850
♫  Still, I’ll hold out my hand   ♫

183
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,760
Wow, it's so pretty! I always wanted to come here.

184
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,479
I'm the one who wanted to cut class today,

185
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,069
but you seem to be having more fun.

186
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,439
It really is fun, but I can't do this again.

187
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,400
I have to raise my GPA.

188
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,280
Okay.

189
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,250
Let's go over there.

190
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,519

191
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,800

192
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,500
Look at all these people's wishes.

193
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,769
You should write one too.

194
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,999
Me?

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,620
No, thanks. I've been traumatized from making wishes.

196
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,829
Traumatized?

197
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,629
I made a wish on the stone tower

198
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,259
when we took that trip together,

199
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,729
but you erased my memories and our relationship almost ended.

200
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,489
I'm scared of making wishes now.

201
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,290
Did you have a tough time

202
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,649
back then?

203
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,839
Of course.

204
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,259
You can't just end things that way.

205
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,110
Suddenly ghosting someone is the worst kind of breakup, you know?

206
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,569
I still think that was too much.

207
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,740
I was really sad.

208
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,360
Then what do you think

209
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,830
would be a good breakup?

210
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,990
A good breakup?

211
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,280
A good breakup.

212
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,659
Isn't that an oxymoron,

213
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,720
like a happy hunger?

214
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,810
I don't know about a good breakup,

215
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,349
but I just wouldn't want it to be too sudden.

216
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,890
It's heartbreaking to say goodbye without any preparation.

217
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,949
You'd need some time to accept it,

218
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,950
and to say goodbye.

219
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,900
Let's go.

220
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,460
Sir—

221
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,740
Where did he go?

222
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,179
Sir, what was that?

223
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,359
Well, it's—

224
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,169
That was an awful prank.

225
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,839
You really shocked me.

226
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,740
Don't ever disappear without a word again.

227
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,020
 By the way,

228
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,890
 will it be okay for you two

229
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,620
 to live in the same house?

230
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,630
 If Dam

231
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,740
 happens to see

232
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,070
 your disappearance,

233
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,550
 it may be a great shock.

234
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,900
 It will be a great shock.

235
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,870
 Also,

236
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,800
 I'm worried

237
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,460
 you'd be left here alone

238
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,800
 once I disappear.

239
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,400
 And you would have

240
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,090
 to cry alone.

241
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,929
You want me to return home?

242
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,830
All of a sudden? Why?

243
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,110
I've thought about it, and you should be there for your brother.

244
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,368
I've been too selfish.

245
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,809
But I promised to stay with you until you become human.

246
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,960
You've helped me a lot, so I think it'll be okay now.

247
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,830
Good night, then.

248
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,989
Sir, did I do something wrong?

249
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,319
When I wanted to come home for a few days,

250
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,829
you held me back, saying you never wanted to be apart.

251
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,460
So it feels a bit odd, suddenly getting sent back so late at  night.

252
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,880
Is there another reason?

253
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,070
There's no other reason.

254
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,149
I'm a little sad and lonely when I think

255
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,219
that I'll be away from you.

256
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,970
But you seem totally fine, so I feel a bit disappointed.

257
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,860
Bye.

258
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,040
♫  Not once  ♫

259
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:01,280
♫  was I able to tell you that I love you  ♫

260
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,790
♫  And I still haven't been able to show you  ♫

261
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,680
♫  all of my sincere feelings  ♫

262
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,790
♫  So now, I will go to you  ♫

263
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,390
♫  Get close to you  ♫

264
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,730
♫  Like you and I,  ♫

265
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,800
♫  crossing each other in the cold breeze  ♫

266
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,360
No.

267
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:36,930
♫  I'm scared I won't be able to see you again  ♫

268
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:44,530
♫  Today I'm walking circles around memories of you again  ♫

269
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,070
♫  and waiting  ♫

270
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,910
♫  Let me protect you,  ♫

271
00:19:52,910 --> 00:20:00,000
♫  like this forever  ♫

272
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,130
♫  If passed memories call for you  ♫

273
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,500
♫  Then look back at me once  ♫

274
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,790
♫  Once again, I spent a night filled with you  ♫

275
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,159
What brings you here so late?

276
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,149
You said you haven't been sleeping well, so I brought wine.

277
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,099
In moderation, it's supposed to really help with sleep.

278
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,800
Thanks.

279
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,970
- Do you want to come in? 
 - Sure.

280
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,389
Do you want some too?

281
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,470
No. I said I'd be home soon, so I have to go.

282
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,850
But it's not because you're worried about something, is it?

283
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,650
Of course not.

284
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,060
- Should I leave it there? 
 - Yes.

285
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Have a glass, then sleep well.

286
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,970
Okay.

287
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,830
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,199
What's this? It looks antique.

289
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,630
Antique? It's just really old.

290
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,159
Antique means a very old item.

291
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,570
Oh, really?

292
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:35,210
It does look really old. Did you inherit it from your mom?

293
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,109
I don't have a mom.

294
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,919
I see. Then was it from your dad?

295
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,300
I don't have a dad either.

296
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,740
- Did they pass away? 
 - I never had any.

297
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,340
What?

298
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,450
Sorry.

299
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,610
She has no family.

300
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,340
She must've been lonely.

301
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,029
All right. From now on, I'm going to stay by her side.

302
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:24,780
I won't ever let her be alone.

303
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,790
What's this?

304
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,800
Military Personnel Administration?

305
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,910
Oh! You startled me.

306
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,780
Why did you come so suddenly?

307
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,490
I suddenly wanted a drink.

308
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,939
Then you should come in properly, through the door.

309
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:07,230
I just wanted to see

310
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,330
if I could still use magic.

311
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,969
You're so upset that you're actually drinking? And with me?

312
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:40,050
I thought that it was a good thing you've been there.

313
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,570
Are you

314
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,330
saying that to me?

315
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,500
Yes, you.

316
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,960
I know you care about me.

317
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,130
You showed up again right before my 1,000th year

318
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,450
because you were worried about me.

319
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,120
I know that too.

320
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,669
Thank you for everything.

321
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,660
Don't do that.

322
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,060
Don't talk like this is our last goodbye.

323
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,200
Let me ask you for a favor.

324
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,760
I'm going to share the truth

325
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,610
with Miss Dam.

326
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,540
So...

327
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,860
 I think the end is near.

328
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,389
 Then what do you think

329
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,140
 would be a good breakup?

330
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,220
 That was an awful prank.

331
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,030
 Well, it's...

332
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,150
Was his sudden disappearance

333
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,610
not a prank?

334
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,930
Yeah?

335
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,589
What's that? Weren't you staying with Soo Kyeong until the break? Why are you here?

336
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,049
I wanted to focus on my studies, so I came home.

337
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:24,540
I see.

338
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,220
Anyway, is Brother-in-Law going somewhere?

339
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,789
- No, why? 
 - When he came to help me,

340
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,220
he asked me to look after you.

341
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,340
And he sounded like someone who's about to go far away.

342
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,030
Noona!

343
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,190
 Miss Dam, I can't bring myself

344
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,990
 to tell you when I'm with you,

345
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,680
 so I'm writing this letter that I hope you'll never see.

346
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,950
 It seems like I may have to let go

347
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,970
 of this long life I've lived.

348
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,590
 Yes,

349
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,920
 over the many years I've lived

350
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,560
 I've been through too much,

351
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,520
 and lived for too long.

352
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,440
 So I was tired of everything, as if I'd stayed up all night.

353
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,360
 At times, I was sick of facing another morning.

354
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:08,080
 That's how things were until I met you.

355
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,850
 You were my only joy,

356
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,660
 the only reason why I waited for a new morning.

357
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,990
 Perhaps I knew from the start,

358
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,350
 that you would

359
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,060
 change my destiny.

360
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,400
Sir, I'm on my way there right now.

361
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,360
Anyway...

362
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,610
did you mean something else

363
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,360
when you said the end is near?

364
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,820
I really have a weird feeling...

365
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,360
Sir.

366
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,760
Sir!

367
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,880
 Perhaps I knew from the start,

368
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,560
 that you would

369
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,230
 change my destiny.

370
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,870
 That you'd bring meaning...

371
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,480
 to my meaningless

372
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,720
 and fruitless life.

373
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,000
♫  And I still haven't been able to show you  ♫

374
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,540
♫  all of my sincere feelings  ♫

375
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,720
♫  So now, I will go to you  ♫

376
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,350
♫  Get close to you  ♫

377
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,670
♫  Like you and I,  ♫

378
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:24,320
♫  crossing each other in the cold breeze  ♫

379
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,820
♫  I'm scared I won't be able to see you again  ♫

380
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:39,280
♫  Today I'm walking circles around memories of you again  ♫

381
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,910
♫  and waiting  ♫

382
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,810
♫  Let me protect you,  ♫

383
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:55,530
♫  like this forever  ♫

384
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:01,910
♫  If passed memories call for you  ♫

385
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,350
♫  Then look back at me once  ♫

386
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:14,810
♫  Once again, I spent a night filled with you  ♫

387
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,880

388
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:25,200
♫  One day, pain might make us cry again  ♫

389
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,220
My Sir disappeared.

390
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,920
He was trying to save me. It's my fault.

391
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,730
♫   Don’t erase me.  ♫

392
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,850
It's not your fault.

393
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,980
♫  and I love you   ♫

394
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,050
♫  Let me protect you,  ♫

395
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,760
We can only blame destiny.

396
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,270
Don't blame yourself.

397
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,510
What destiny!

398
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:01,990
He promised to stay by my side. This isn't fair!

399
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:07,300
♫  Then look back at me once  ♫

400
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:14,430
♫  Once again, I spent a night filled with you  ♫

401
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,300

402
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,259
Noona, aren't you going to eat?

403
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,630
What's wrong?

404
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,210
Wait. Why is he...

405
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,360
He's not gone yet.

406
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,480
If I wait,

407
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,150
he might come back.

408
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,940
 I needed that futile hope

409
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,790
 to hold on,

410
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,009
 to get through those times.

411
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,160
It's spring.

412
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,940
 Spring came,

413
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,980
 but I didn't feel warm at all.

414
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:08,710
 I was still living in a cold winter.

415
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,390
How much longer will you stay here?

416
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,430
Until he comes back.

417
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,779
He's not coming back.

418
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,060
No, he can't.

419
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,770
This is why Woo Yeo asked for a favor. He knew you'd be this silly.

420
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,280
A favor?

421
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
What do you mean?

422
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,600
 If Dam is hurting too much

423
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,040
 after I disappear,

424
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,600
 could you erase her memories with your Bead?

425
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,130
 Do you even hear yourself?

426
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,539
 It was so hard for me to dye the Bead blue.

427
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,389
 The mountain spirit granted me one wish,

428
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,710
 and you want me to use it on you?

429
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,359
 He left me that Bead to use just once,

430
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,119
 in case I can't adjust

431
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,929
 to my new human life

432
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,670
 and really need help!

433
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,080
 Instead of worrying like that, work on becoming human!

434
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,840
 Don't give up until the very end!

435
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,900
 I'm sorry. Please do me the favor.

436
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,400
This is the final decision he made in his thousand years of life.

437
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,240
He wants you to be happy,

438
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,570
even if you forget him completely.

439
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,650
Miss Dam.

440
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,240
♫  The meaningless answer,  ♫

441
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,000
♫  that look on your face  ♫

442
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,450
 I take pity on you and will grant your wish.

443
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,890
 Before the thousand years is up,

444
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,800
 before you grow more than nine tails,

445
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,890
 if you learn patience,

446
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,230
 love,

447
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,660
 and sacrifice,

448
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,150
 and eventually find a reason to live...

449
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,120
 If someone who desperately wishes you to live is waiting...

450
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,750
♫   My words for you have hurt us   ♫

451
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:06,950
♫   I couldn’t recognize your sadness  ♫

452
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:13,570
♫   In the past   ♫

453
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:21,300
♫   The reason I cannot see you when I turn back   ♫

454
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,080
No.

455
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,320
I don't want to forget a single moment

456
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,540
even if I have to be heartbroken for the rest of my life

457
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:38,010
and I can never see him again.

458
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,560
How have you been, Miss Dam?

459
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,020
 Before the thousand years is up, before you grow more than nine tails,

460
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,870
 if you learn patience, love, and sacrifice,

461
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,370
 and eventually find a reason to live...

462
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,450
 If someone who desperately wishes you to live is waiting,

463
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,030
 beast will become human.

464
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,360
Hye Sun, I'm here—

465
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,699
What's wrong?

466
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,810
I can't believe it.

467
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,119
Why are you crying?

468
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,010
- I'm so relieved. 
 - What?

469
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,670
- It's okay. 
 - I thought he was really dead.

470
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,600
H-He's not, it's okay.

471
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,340
I'm so relieved.

472
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,559
Fragile. Easily broken. Gosh.

473
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,820
Fra-Fragile. Easily broken.

474
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,940
Easily broken.

475
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,720
It's exactly one week until you report for military service.

476
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,919
Poor you.

477
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,759
Hye Sun must be crying every night.

478
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,319
No, I'm the one who's crying every night.

479
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,029
Hye Sun doesn't know yet.

480
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,990
I couldn't tell her.

481
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,509
What do you mean, you haven't told her yet?

482
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,480
Then how did you explain taking a leave from school?

483
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,770
I just said I had a situation.

484
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,470
Thing is, when I told my exes that I was going for military service,

485
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,709
they dumped me right away.

486
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,659
So I'm afraid that Hye Sun will want to break up too.

487
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,730
What are you afraid of?

488
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,600
What? What are you so afraid of?

489
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,119
- Actually, Jae Jin is— 
 - G-Ghosts!

490
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,589
- I'm afraid of ghosts. 
 - What? Ghosts?

491
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,369
Yeah. I'm usually so tough that it must be really unexpected,

492
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,219
but I'm actually very scared of ghosts.

493
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,530
Vampires, Chucky, gumiho... 
  (T/N: Chucky - possesed toy from the movie Child's Play)

494
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,410
They're so scary!

495
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,630
Even a gumiho?

496
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,409
Of course, a gumiho takes people's livers.

497
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,870
I can't even think about it.

498
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,530
 I didn't take any livers,

499
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:46,230
 but I guess I'd better not tell him I was a gumiho.

500
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,050
 I can't keep it a secret forever.

501
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,350
 When do I tell her that I'm starting military service?

502
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,959
By the way, I haven't seen Dam around lately.

503
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,430
Right. Since Professor Shin came back, she must be busy hanging out with him.

504
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,770
He must be busy.

505
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,659
He was practically reborn, so there must be so many things he wants to do.

506
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,640
Reborn?

507
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,169
That distant relative of mine was seriously ill.

508
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:14,250
He didn't want to worry Dam,

509
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,090
so he didn't tell her he went abroad for treatment.

510
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,480
Now that he's recovered, it's like being reborn.

511
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,250
He was ill?

512
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,699
Anyway, it must be fun.

513
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,350
Each day must be so precious to them.

514
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,610
- Is that the place? 
 - Yes.

515
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,320

516
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,510
I think we'll have to wait for at least an hour. Is that okay?

517
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,819
Of course.

518
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,600
I now have this fascinating new desire called appetite,

519
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,079
so I'm more than happy to wait.

520
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,169
If you're pushing yourself because of my bucket list—

521
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:11,340
I'm not.

522
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,019
When I couldn't come back,

523
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,510
I endured by imagining myself waiting with you at a specialty restaurant.

524
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,620
Thanks for waiting for me.

525
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,070
You mean in front of Granny's Stir-Fried Octopus?

526
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,649
Let's talk in detail when we're stir-frying the rice.

527
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,270
- Sounds good. 
 - I can't wait.

528
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,540
I'm sorry, we ran out of ingredients. Please come again.

529
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,199
No way. I was so close to tasting the chewy octopus and crunchy bean sprouts

530
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,530
in the sweet and spicy sauce.

531
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,570
And I was so excited to stir-fry rice

532
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,610
in that sauce and eat it with shredded roasted laver. No!

533
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,930

534
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,520
Now you're speaking my language.

535
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,629
But don't be disappointed yet.

536
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:58,060
I plan to make it for you at home.

537
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,690
What? With your cooking skills?

538
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,569
Why don't we just order in?

539
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,410
Miss Dam.

540
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:10,580
I wasn't a great cook... during my gumiho days.

541
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,739
Since I developed a sense of taste, I've become interested in cooking.

542
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,090
My skills have grown by leaps and bounds.

543
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,430
You won't be disappointed!

544
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,760
How did you stir-fry the octopus to make the kitchen look so...

545
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,279
What's important is that I managed to quell the fire without panicking.

546
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:36,550
And a company will come soon to make repairs.

547
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,960
Since you look so hot, I can't even complain.

548
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,079
We should have ordered food in the first place.

549
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,719
- Is there anything you'd like to eat? 
 - Pork bone soup.

550
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,550
Yum woon sen, garlic chicken,

551
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,949
spicy jokbal, sandwich.

552
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,149
These just crossed my mind. Pick one.

553
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,279
So attractive! A man who craves so many dishes.

554
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,750
Shall we start with sandwiches then?

555
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,770
What would you like?

556
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,010
- I'd like a shrimp sandwich. 
 - Shrimp.

557
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,700
I'm bored.

558
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,920
When do you think you'll be done?

559
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,719
How could you do this to someone who came back from the dead?

560
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,199
I'm in my senior year. I have to work like I'm about to die.

561
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,620
I need to get a job soon.

562
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,950
I envy you. You don't need to get a job.

563
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,220
I'll be getting a job too.

564
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,759
But I can't change careers so often anymore, so I want to be careful.

565
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,430
Then why don't you keep writing?

566
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,920
Many people liked your books.

567
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,940
You got a lot of comments too.

568
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,500
- Really? 
 - Yes.

569
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,359
"So touching!" "This is so good!"

570
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,650
"Is this a novel? Have you ever studied history?"

571
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,680
"Stop printing..."

572
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,260
- Let me... 
 - No, I don't think you need to see...!

573
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,860
Kids these days are so spoiled.

574
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:18,720
In the past, you had to walk all the way to the capital to file a complaint.

575
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,450
But now, all you need to do is to type away from your bedroom!

576
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:27,290
Sir, you're human now. Why don't you stop talking about the past?

577
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,599
It's already past 10:00 p.m.

578
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,810
You should go to bed. You must be tired.

579
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,819
Why do I have to go to bed early? I'm not a child.

580
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,039
Well, you're not nocturnal anymore, so I thought you might be tired.

581
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,819
Tired? I'm just as healthy as before.

582
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:42,560
I've been exercising for a thousand years to stay fit.

583
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,600
Right. Speaking of which, let me bring you some healthy tea.

584
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,290

585
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,420
Why are you taking vitamins? You said you were just as healthy.

586
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,970
I'm taking it for you.

587
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,429
Taking care of each other's health was also on your bucket list.

588
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,830
Oh, you did it for me.

589
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,969
Looks like Sunbae Seon Woo is leaving for good tomorrow.

590
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,220
He'd been traveling back and forth with meetings and all.

591
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,279
I guess you've stayed in touch with him?

592
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,370
What? No, I read it in the department group chat.

593
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,199
Awesome!

594
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,609
I'll be using your room, Oppa.

595
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,260
Your room is bigger and your desk is better.

596
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,020
What's the point of having a good desk when you never use it?

597
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,990
You're like a trip I look forward to.

598
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:59,930
Because I want you to leave as soon as possible.

599
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,930
Be nice to your brother.

600
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,610
Get in, we don't want to be late.

601
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,960
Take this and get lost.

602
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:16,070
 I had too much stuff, so I'm leaving this. Keep it if you want.

603
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,190
Oppa.

604
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:21,770
Oppa!

605
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,520
Oppa.

606
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,000
Oppa!

607
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,850
I'm happy, but I'm sad.

608
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,130
I'm sad, but I'm happy.

609
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,310
This is all because of that Dan or whatever's noona.

610
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,340
If she hadn't rejected my oppa, he wouldn't have left so pitifully.

611
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,139
My bag! Hey!

612
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,360
Give me my bag!

613
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:11,080
- Hey! Stop there! 
 - Throw it.

614
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,410
- Hey. 
 - Shoot.

615
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,130
See if it's all there.

616
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,970
- Congratulations! 
 - Cheers!

617
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,240
- Nice! 
 - Drink as much as you'd like.

618
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,190
I promised to buy a hundred bottles of champagne when he became human.

619
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,800
I'd ring the silver bell if there was one here.

620
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,340
You must mean the golden bell.

621
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,010
You'd better treat me well.

622
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,779
Since I became human first, I have a lot of useful tips.

623
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:39,100
Really?

624
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,869
You may have become human first, but you seem to have had it much easier.

625
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,660
So I'm not so sure.

626
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,920
- What? 
 - Goodness.

627
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:52,189
You see, my hands disappeared and my Bead cracked.

628
00:51:52,189 --> 00:51:56,339
I experienced all kinds of bad omens and nearly died before I became human.

629
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:01,550
Compared to that, I feel like you didn't do anything.

630
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,580
I didn't do anything? I suffered a lot too.

631
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,140
Feeling like my heart was tearing after a breakup, then loving again.

632
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,019
Another painful breakup. Then I fell in love again.

633
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,900
If I collected the tears that I shed to become human,

634
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,820
it would've filled Daedong River. 
  (T/N: a major river in today's North Korea)

635
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,160
You're the one who got lucky because of the mountain spirit's trap.

636
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,589
- I got lucky? 
 - Am I wrong?

637
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:29,479
It was a test to see if you'd sacrifice your life for her, and you just fell into it.

638
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,680
Stop acting like you're so cool because you're not.

639
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,789
I'm not just acting.

640
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:35,520
I sacrificed my life for someone I love.

641
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,259
I learned love, patience, and sacrifice,

642
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,769
so that I found a reason to live, and achieved humanity—

643
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,440
I can't hear you.

644
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,539
- Why do you keep cutting me off— 
 - I can't hear you!

645
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,720
Why? Every time I hear this story, I'm so touched.

646
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,539
Especially the part where you woke up because you heard me crying.

647
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:58,080
It means you were able to come back because I waited for you.

648
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,649
Right, Oppa?

649
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,020
That's right, Dam.

650
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,600
When is Jae Jin coming?

651
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:13,020
Just talk about that cheesy stuff when you're alone!

652
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,410
Then I'll go get some water.

653
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,729
- I'll go get water. 
 - I'll come with you.

654
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,579
You take care of this!

655
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,830
Take care of what?

656
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:32,470
Well, it is kind of nice that they're unswayed by his past.

657
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,380
I don't like having secrets either.

658
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,430
Hye Sun.

659
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,520
Jae Jin, what took so long?

660
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,039
You were gone for a while.

661
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,360
I didn't want you to get sick tomorrow, so I got you some hangover pills.

662
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,099
 Should I tell him?

663
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,949
 Even if he does break up with me.

664
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:00,580
 I have to tell her now.

665
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,490
 Even if she does dump me.

666
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,610
- Actually— 
 - Actually—

667
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,950
You go first.

668
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,869
- I used to be a gumiho. 
 - What?

669
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:19,420
I was a gumiho for over 700 years before I became human five years ago.

670
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,109
You seem quite drunk. You should take the pills.

671
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:26,070
I'm not drunk. It's all true.

672
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,130
That's why I don't have parents or a family.

673
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:33,310
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

674
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:37,710
If it really bothers you, we can just break up.

675
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,430
Hye Sun, why would you say that?

676
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,599
Whether this is a joke, or you're drunk,

677
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,560
or even if you actually were a gumiho, I don't care.

678
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,460
What?

679
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,380
Even if you're still a gumiho now, I really don't care.

680
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,850
I can just give you my liver or spleen, or whatever.

681
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,319
Wait, I probably shouldn't be saying this in my situation.

682
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,859
I don't want to burden you.

683
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,230
What situation?

684
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:08,209
Right, you also had something to tell me.

685
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,800
What is it?

686
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,900
The thing is...

687
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,200
- I'm starting my military service. 
 - What?

688
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,179
When?

689
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,410
The day after tomorrow.

690
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,399
Why are you only telling me now?

691
00:55:24,399 --> 00:55:26,869
I was afraid that you would break up with me.

692
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,510
Do Jae Jin.

693
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,380
Why would you say that?

694
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,070
How long is it these days?

695
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,839
About a year and a half.

696
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,330
Compared to 700 years, that's nothing.

697
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,400
- I'll wait. 
 - What?

698
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,369
It's okay. It'll be hard for you.

699
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:51,350
You don't want me to wait then?

700
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,140
I want you to wait.

701
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:01,030
I'll be cool when I come back.

702
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,400
You're not so bad now.

703
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,000
Gosh, Jae Jin!

704
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,310
What, are you okay? Did you get hurt?

705
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,880
- I'm just messing with you. 
 - Hey!

706
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,169
You and Hye Sun still seem like really good friends.

707
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,849
You say mean things to each other,

708
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:27,080
but she was really happy when you came back as a human.

709
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,490
Of course, I was probably the happiest.

710
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:33,560
To be honest, I was really scared.

711
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,430
I was afraid you might never come back.

712
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,850
I was afraid too, that I might never be able to come back to you.

713
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,460
What changed the most after you became human?

714
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,529
Sometimes I realize that the late night air can be chilly like this,

715
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:00,070
- and sometimes I want to sleep in. 
 - Oh!

716
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,400
 Actually, nothing much has changed.

717
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,839
 My heart still flutters when I see you.

718
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,590
Hey, Dan.

719
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,400
Congratulations on winning the gold medal.

720
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,190

721
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:24,020
Thanks. But why would you congratulate...

722
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,679
I don't like talkative men.

723
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,720
- Why are you suddenly holding— 
 - Shush.

724
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,040
I don't like questions either.

725
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,080
Since you got prize money, the tteokbokki is on you.

726
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,739
I didn't know we were that close.

727
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,340
We are, starting today.

728
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,679
Because I'm going out with you starting today.

729
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:43,870
- What? 
 - Let's go.

730
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:45,640
Wait. Why are you suddenly...

731
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,180
♫   and hold my heart  ♫

732
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,229
We really don't have much time left now.

733
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,940
I know.

734
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,240
Hold on.

735
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,130
♫   One step closer   ♫

736
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:04,150
I made a list of good specialty restaurants.

737
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,759

738
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,430
And this is a first-aid kit.

739
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,000
Please don't get sick while I'm gone.

740
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,880
What do I do?

741
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,260
I'm going to miss you so much.

742
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:24,300
I really don't want to go.

743
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,060
When I think about leaving you alone,

744
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,210
I just don't want to leave.

745
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,720
Is that so?

746
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:39,650
♫   If I carefully approach you  ♫

747
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:43,750
 I still want you by my side.

748
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,460
His username is Handsome Face?

749
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,500
How handsome is he to...

750
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,819
They're friends, so they must be both handsome.

751
00:58:52,819 --> 00:58:54,849
Right? I'm so excited!

752
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,739
Hello, are you Wingless Angel?

753
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,950
I'm Handsome Face, Kim Moo Geun—

754
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,530
- What are you doing here? 
 - What's this?

755
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,209
Sunbae, you're Handsome Face?

756
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,059
You should be Gruesome Face!

757
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,509
Delete that dating app right now.

758
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,609
What about you?

759
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,790
You're Wingless Angel?

760
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:14,740
 Sometimes, something unexpected may come up and trouble us again.

761
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:20,610
So you fought as soon as you met them, then just left?

762
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:23,579
Hey, grow up.

763
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,869
 Whatever. Are the girls there pretty?

764
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,419
 If you make a girlfriend in a week, I'll send you 100,000 won.

765
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,470
I don't bet anymore.

766
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:34,620
 But as I always have, I will change in step with you.

767
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:39,640
♫   I want to give that to you 
 and embrace your heart that has returned  ♫

768
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,020
Hi, Soo Kyeong.

769
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,710
Nice presentation today.

770
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,770
Right, well.

771
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,370
Of course, but thank you anyway.

772
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,040
I'm sorry.

773
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:29,200
 You will always be my one destiny.

774
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,380
Miss Dam.

775
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:00,330
You were supposed to carry the Bead, not fall in love with its owner.

776
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:05,110
What about you? You were supposed to steal my energy, not my heart!

777
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,089
Then,

778
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:15,439
since we risked our lives and fell in love, let's stay together for a long time.

779
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,590
Shall we go home now?

780
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:31,820
Yes. Let's go home.

781
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:50,100
