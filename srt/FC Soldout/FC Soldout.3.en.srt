1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,440
Friends.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,800
It's not him.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,800
I mean, hypothetically,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,510
if you encountered your true love in the workplace,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,880
how would you handle it?

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:21,860
[It's Monday morning, and there are many heartbroken people. This won't happen! Chant "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!" "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!", hahaha]

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,640
The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,910
Everyone says "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!"

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,930
but I'm becoming a lucky die-hard fan.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,300
[Ryu Kyung-jae: I mainly listen to jazz music.]

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,570
I mainly listen to jazz music.

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,980
[Ryu Kyung-jae: like Miles Davis or Chet Baker?]

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,820
Like Miles Davis or Chet Baker.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,500
[Ryu Kyung-jae: I listen to classical music when reading scripts...]

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,250
I listen to classical music when reading scripts.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,700
[Ryu Kyung-jae: because I... don't like loud music...]

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,680
Because I don't like loud music.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,280
Apartment, apartment.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,170
Apartment, apartment.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,680
When I'm at home, I usually read books.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,060
[Ryu Kyung-jae: because reading is food for the soul, right?!]

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,400
Because reading is food for the soul.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,260
I'm going crazy.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,140
[Ryu Kyung-jae: in the morning, I either enjoy a cup of hand-brewed coffee leisurely]

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,760
In the morning, I either enjoy a cup of hand-brewed coffee leisurely.

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,220
[Ryu Kyung-jae: or organize my work for the day.]

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,300
Or organize my work for the day.

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,700
[Just woke up in the morning, why does your face look so good? Is this a coffee advertisement? ~]

29
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,550
Everyone,

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,400
you've been fooled by him too.

31
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,060
[Mr. Seo, the team boss]

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,910
Hey, boss.

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,210
What is it?

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,960
Is this a good choice?

35
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,950
Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

36
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,320
It feels good.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,990
If it's like this, the older brothers should be able to do it too.

38
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,290
If it's this, the players should also be able to handle it.

39
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,540
Why aren't you at the stadium but gathered here?

40
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,940
Mr. Seo.

41
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,940
No, it's the boss's request to upload the challenge content today.

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
What challenge?

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,240
Oh, you haven't done this before, right?

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
Actually, it's not that difficult.

45
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,829
-How can we do this?
-How can we do this?

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,620
Hey, you're saying it's not hard?

47
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,130
Of course. Let's demonstrate first.

48
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,260
You guys watch carefully.

49
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,110
Easy, right?

50
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,310
Finally, let Kyung-jae finish it off.

51
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,680
Okay.

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
Let's start.

53
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,470
Good.

54
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,210
Very good.

55
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,520
You guys try it.

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,340
No, why are we doing this?

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,870
Yeah, what does this have to do with soccer?

58
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,070
Sports entertainment.

59
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,300
Like this, like this.

60
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,590
Don't come close to me.

61
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,620
Keep dancing.

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,840
Like this, like this.

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,050
-That's right.
-Like this.

64
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,870
Like this.

65
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,180
Good job, good job.

66
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,810
-Spin around.
-Spin around.

67
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,250
-Go backwards.
-Backwards.

68
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,360
-Go backwards.
-Backwards.

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,110
What are you doing, really?

70
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,260
Why do you always fall?

71
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,950
Left foot, clap.

72
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,910
Clap hands.

73
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,640
Right foot, left foot.

74
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,530
Clap.

75
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,280
Clap hands.

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,340
One, two, three.

77
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,490
I won't do it, I won't do it.

78
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,040
Six, seven, eight.

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,650
-One, two...
-I won't do it, I won't do it.

80
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,700
This is more tiring than playing a full match without a substitute.

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,659
If I do it again, I think I'll do better.

82
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,630
We seemed to have underestimated this.

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,690
Oh, it's uploaded.

84
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,470
Really.

85
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,350
I'm so embarrassed.

86
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,680
I can't watch this.

87
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,770
They...

88
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,330
thought they danced well and uploaded it directly.

89
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,150
Let's go.

90
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,620
Outdo them all.

91
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,880
Now it's our turn.

92
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,080
Then let's see what you're capable of.

93
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,980
What should we do?

94
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,770
Why ask when you already know?

95
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,620
This is a corner kick.

96
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,520
Is it?

97
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,500
Here it comes.

98
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,510
What are you doing?

99
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,920
Hey, what are you doing?

100
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,020
As soccer players, how can you dodge the ball?

101
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,130
Let's do it again.

102
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,160
That kick was weak.

103
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,320
Kyung-jae, show everyone your skills.

104
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,670
You've even filmed a movie before.

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,680
You need to kick harder.

106
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,190
That's exactly what I was thinking.

107
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,870
Kyung-jae.

108
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,860
I said no heading the ball.

109
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,230
Kyung-jae.

110
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,100
Kyung-jae, are you okay?

111
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,250
Boss.

112
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,690
Boss, what are you doing?

113
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,290
Hey, kid.

114
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,940
If you head the ball, Kyung-jae's face could get hurt.

115
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,400
Are you kidding me?

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,740
How can you play soccer without heading the ball?

117
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,420
Use your feet, you can kick it with your feet.

118
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,300
Are you saying that this handsome face might get hurt during the match,

119
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,580
so we should avoid the ball?

120
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,210
Kyung-jae.

121
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,360
If you hurt your face while heading the ball,

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,660
I'll be in big trouble with the boss.

123
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,060
Sorry, he said no heading.

124
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,610
Hey.

125
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,480
No heading, let's do something else.

126
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,360
Next, let's see your shooting skills.

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,200
Line up.

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,520
My basic athletic abilities are still pretty good.

129
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,180
I even received special training for the soccer movie.

130
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,230
Next.

131
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,640
Wait, wait.

132
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,980
Pinch your cheeks and look at the camera.

133
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,730
What are they doing?

134
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,950
Sure enough, the ending fairy, Sun-bin.

135
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,490
What fairy?

136
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,360
Haven't you heard of the ending fairy?

137
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,790
In music shows,

138
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,070
the member who decorates the ending shot during the final performance.

139
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,690
They do actions like these.

140
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,490
In the past, Sun-bin was famous for these kinds of actions.

141
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,400
Are you here to play soccer or to have fun?

142
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
Hey, Sun-bin.

143
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,670
Stop it and come over here.

144
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,050
Do you think training is a joke?

145
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,440
Is playing soccer so great?

146
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,620
It's just the fourth-tier league.

147
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,420
What?

148
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,970
Hey, kid.

149
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,520
Say that again to my face.

150
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,210
Everyone, calm down.

151
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,670
It's my fault.

152
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,770
I shouldn't have brought the camera here.

153
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,920
Thinking of yourself as a great star?

154
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,390
You're not an idol anymore either.

155
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,110
-That brat is really...
-Captain.

156
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,640
Please understand.

157
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,490
Actually, Sun-bin...

158
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,340
What's going on?

159
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,800
Is something wrong?

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,260
He got rejected again during the audition.

161
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,900
The boy band Sun-bin used to be in

162
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,040
recently won a big award and made a big splash.

163
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,310
Even if he left voluntarily,

164
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,820
it must have been really hard for him.

165
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,390
Because he fell from the peak to the bottom suddenly.

166
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,900
Under normal circumstances, it would be unbearable.

167
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Then why did he leave voluntarily?

168
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,280
Umm...

169
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,080
You'd better ask him yourself.

170
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,940
[FC Soldout]

171
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:28,180
[Have you seen Sun-bin? The manager is looking for him. I saw him at the stadium earlier, but I haven't seen him since. Huh, hope nothing happened to him. I shouldn't have said those things earlier...]

172
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,940
Is playing soccer so great?

173
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,130
It's just the fourth-tier league.

174
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,920
What?

175
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, kid.

176
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,780
Say that again to my face.

177
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,470
Darn it.

178
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,100
Got a light?

179
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,210
You've never smoked before, have you?

180
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,750
Sun-bin.

181
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,690
Our bodies are our assets,

182
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,050
like our annual salary.

183
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,550
And as the team captain,

184
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,650
the health of my teammates is also an asset.

185
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,310
In short, we are...

186
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,340
A community of shared future...

187
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,280
That's right.

188
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,700
Who gave you permission?

189
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,090
Everyone is looking for you.

190
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,360
Didn't you check the group chat?

191
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,340
Whatever.

192
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,040
You're pretty harsh. So cute.

193
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,510
Your interests are weird.

194
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,610
I naturally like annoying juniors.

195
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,200
I can tell just by looking at you that you're harder to deal with than Do Ji-woo.

196
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,560
Your cigarette.

197
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,980
I'm confiscating this.

198
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,180
I'll be watching you from now on

199
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,850
to see if you dare to mistreat your body.

200
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,830
Did you understand?

201
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,680
I'm leaving first.

202
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,000
What are you guys doing?

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,440
Ji-woo, don't shout.

204
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,790
Really.

205
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,040
I mean,

206
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,550
we wanted to throw a surprise party to apologize to Sun-bin,

207
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,130
but the delivery was late and everyone fell asleep.

208
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,420
Yeah.

209
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,450
So you could have woken them up.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,070
Bro,

211
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,600
you know how strict the captain is about late-night snacks.

212
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,380
That's true.

213
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,590
But it's a special situation, so the seniors should understand, right?

214
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,350
It's so cold outside, I don't want to run around the stadium.

215
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,590
Then let's destroy the evidence ourselves.

216
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,330
It's not a lot of food,

217
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,060
just enough for the three of us.

218
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,950
Wow, it smells so good.

219
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,400
This is not ordinary fried chicken,

220
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,800
it's sweet and savory sauce-flavored fried chicken.

221
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,200
I can't take it anymore.

222
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,870
Anyway... Let's calm down first.

223
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,190
This isn't your hand, is it?

224
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,680
It... doesn't seem like mine.

225
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,000
So who could it be?

226
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
Senior.

227
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,490
What are you guys doing?

228
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,630
Captain.

229
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,530
It's fried chicken.

230
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,040
Bro, this is to comfort him...

231
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,120
-Why am I here?
-Why am I here?

232
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,760
Let's... eat the fried chicken.

233
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,180
-Wow, great!
-Nice.

234
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,980
The rich flavor of the canola oil and sauce

235
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,710
woke up the diet zombies from their sleep.

236
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,670
After eating dry chicken breast for so long,

237
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,910
the smell of fried chicken was unbearable.

238
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,220
Haven't you eaten fried chicken for a long time?

239
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,830
Idols have to strictly manage their bodies.

240
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,520
Your lives are pretty tough.

241
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,550
Yeah.

242
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,460
It's not just us who have a tough life.

243
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,070
Here.

244
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,240
Then let's have a special late-night snack tonight.

245
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,350
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

246
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,790
Good.

247
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,230
Alright, let's toast then.

248
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,160
But what should we say?

249
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,140
FC Soldout.

250
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,260
Only sold-out merchandise

251
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,810
can save us from this tough life.

252
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,100
Something like that.

253
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,760
That's a good one.

254
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,950
Alright, then.

255
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,670
To FC Soldout.

256
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,329
Cheers!

257
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,069
Getting relegated in the league,

258
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,030
you won't understand unless you've been through it.

259
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,450
It's similar for idols.

260
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,380
They're evaluated at the end of each month and grouped.

261
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,770
If you're not careful, a group that's supposed to debut...

262
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,970
Just says goodbye.

263
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,230
Since it's already this way, no matter what happens,

264
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,110
if I have to do it, I want to do it well.

265
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,840
We can do it well.

266
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,240
Including soccer and the projects that you hope for.

267
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,610
Thank you.

268
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,510
Ji-woo, is your dream to be a soccer player?

269
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,670
Yeah.

270
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,820
I just... like playing soccer.

271
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,560
When I was a kid, it was just a dream.

272
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,650
I actually joined the team pretty late.

273
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,170
When was that?

274
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,520
In high school.

275
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,410
After transferring to Suyeong High.

276
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,610
Dong-hee, what about you?

277
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,550
Is your dream to be a YouTube blogger?

278
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,870
No.

279
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,090
I want to be president. That's my dream now.

280
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,360
And you?

281
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,340
Is your dream to be an actor?

282
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,260
No.

283
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,990
So I think it's actually good.

284
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,670
I'm using this time to find a new career.

285
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,190
You'll be back soon too.

286
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,040
Honestly, I have no attachment to this profession.

287
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,330
Ready.

288
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,660
Action.

289
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,070
We must win.

290
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,300
-We must win.
-We can do it.

291
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,190
We must win.

292
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,850
-We can do it.
-We must win.

293
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,120
-We must win.
-Good.

294
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,370
-We must win.
-Move closer.

295
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,590
-We must win.
-We can't lose.

296
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,720
-We must win.
-We can do it.

297
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,410
-We must win.
-You closed your eyes just now.

298
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,020
-Kangjae closed his eyes first.
-He closed his eyes first.

299
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,840
Closed eyes.

300
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,360
-Kyung-jae closed his eyes first.
-He closed his eyes first.

301
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,320
Really.

302
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,820
The referee will decide now.

303
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,150
Both of you accept the punishment friendly

304
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,000
and stand in the balcony for ten minutes.

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
What are you talking about? He closed his eyes first.

306
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,850
You closed your eyes first.

307
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,990
It's fair. It's very fair this way.

308
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,430
-Just go out.
-Go out.

309
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,790
Hurry up and go out.

310
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,840
Both of you, go out.

311
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,900
Take them out quickly.

312
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,370
You really can't play games.

313
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,330
Your breath is too heavy, making it hard for me to open my eyes.

314
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,100
You're just all talk.

315
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,430
But... Was what you said inside just now true?

316
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,350
What?

317
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,240
-That you have no attachment to that profession?
- No.

318
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,940
You said you have no attachment to acting.

319
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,910
Is that true?

320
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,850
I've never thought of acting as my calling.

321
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,200
But...

322
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,350
There are a lot of people who like you.

323
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,600
And you won that award before.

324
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,970
I may not be able to explain it well,

325
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,210
but your face is made for acting.

326
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,850
So you still have no attachment?

327
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,050
Some people don't even remember, and talk about an acting face.

328
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,550
How long have you known me? You don't use honorifics and dare to provoke me.

329
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,590
How dare you touch my stuff without my permission?

330
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,900
"How long have you known me?"

331
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
Right?

332
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,200
It seems... You don't remember.

333
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,790
Before too, what are you talking about?

334
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,520
Because you don't remember.

335
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
What?

336
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,320
Suyeong High.

337
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,570
That one located at the top of the hill, called Shumulangma.

338
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,340
And the history teacher and Japanese teacher getting married.

339
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,480
We made fun of them all the time, calling them traitors.

340
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,550
Classmates?

341
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,660
What? So we were classmates?

342
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,230
But...

343
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,510
But why... Did you always bully me?

344
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,230
Me?

345
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,620
Including that time with the soccer shoes.

346
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,680
You deliberately slammed the locker door in front of me.

347
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,190
And made fun of me all the time.

348
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,100
That wasn't making fun, it was just laughing...

349
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,030
Okay, you're absolutely right.

350
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,180
Soccer shoes, sports time.

351
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,260
How important could it be? And you arranged those mineral water bottles so neatly.

352
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,510
Why are there so many jinx?

353
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,800
Is your daily life normal?

354
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,660
And those soccer shoes were really expensive.

355
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,700
Other... Other things.

356
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,840
Forget it.

357
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,370
It was just pretending to be friendly. Yes.

358
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,920
No matter who looks at it, it was making fun.

359
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,810
Who laughs like that with a "tsk"?

360
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,420
And...

361
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,720
Were we close in high school?

362
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,130
No.

363
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,910
Then why did you...

364
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,800
So that's it.

365
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,430
Sorry, I was just imagining we were close.

366
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,100
Why did you...

367
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,300
Actually... I'm very sentimental.

368
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,160
Don't laugh.

369
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,440
You... Laugh a lot at times like this.

370
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,090
It's cold.

371
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,750
Okay, let's go in.

372
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,370
It's not even ten minutes yet.

373
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,350
We'll pretend to argue so we can go in.

374
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,160
What are you talking about?

375
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,440
Actually, I saw you close your eyes first.

376
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,560
I've been letting you win all along. Damn it.

377
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,820
You... Do you think you're great because you always cheat?

378
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,180
Fighting again?

379
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,640
This guy keeps cheating.

380
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,590
Who are you calling a cheater?

381
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,640
Because you're arguing nonsense.

382
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,370
Is that so? Let's fight it out then.

383
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,560
-Follow me.
-What?

384
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,240
-You follow me.
-Go in. Okay.

385
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,940
We'll talk about it inside. We'll settle this today.

386
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,000
-Okay.
-Alright, you think I'm scared?

387
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,160
-Hey, come at me.
-Try it.

388
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,590
Come up here. Let's go.

389
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,870
Really.

390
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,730
-Let go.
-Come here.

391
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,210
It's cold.

392
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,890
Still not letting go.

393
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,240
It's so cold.

394
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,500
My legs are numb. Numb.

395
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,600
You really come up with all sorts of things.

396
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,360
Let me see.

397
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,610
Ouch, ouch.

398
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,050
Ouch.

399
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,430
-Ouch, ouch.
-Jiyoo, are you okay?

400
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,110
Ouch, ouch.

401
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,210
Do Ji-woo.

402
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,000
Are you hurt?

403
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,260
People outside must think I'm hitting you, Ji-woo.

404
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,200
I win this time.

405
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,790
You closed your eyes first.

406
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,710
Who gave you permission to start without permission?

407
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,860
Ouch.

408
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,640
Hey...

409
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,900
Come here, come here.

410
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,200
Catch.

411
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,370
Pass it, pass it.

412
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,170
Give me the ball.

413
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,760
Backwards, backwards.

414
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,680
Come on.

415
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,960
Kick the ball over here.

416
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,690
Thank you.

417
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,670
Sorry.

418
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,050
You should have kicked it instead.

419
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,470
The first impression is weird.

420
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,340
Why is he smiling so happily?

421
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,220
If he kicked it, he definitely would have scored.

422
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,900
Watching them play soccer every noon has become my habit.

423
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,600
Later, I realized that Do Ji-woo...

424
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,010
Always smiles like this

425
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,060
after giving others the chance.

426
00:25:53,020 --> 00:26:03,060
