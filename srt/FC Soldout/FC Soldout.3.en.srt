1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,440
Friends.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,800
It's not him.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,800
I mean, hypothetically,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,510
if you encountered your true love in the workplace,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,880
how would you handle it?

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,770
(It's Monday morning, and there are many heartbroken people. This won't happen! Chant "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!" "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!", hahaha)

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,640
The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!
(It's Monday morning, and there are many heartbroken people. This won't happen! Chant "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!" "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!", hahaha)

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,910
Everyone says "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest!"

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,930
but I'm becoming a lucky die-hard fan.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,890
(Ryu Kyung-jae: I mainly listen to jazz music.)

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,570
I mainly listen to jazz music.
(Ryu Kyung-jae: I mainly listen to jazz music.)

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,300
(Ryu Kyung-jae: I mainly listen to jazz music.)

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,340
(Ryu Kyung-jae: like Miles Davis or Chet Baker?)

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,980
Like Miles Davis or Chet Baker.
(Ryu Kyung-jae: like Miles Davis or Chet Baker?)

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,820
(Ryu Kyung-jae: I listen to classical music when reading scripts...)
Like Miles Davis or Chet Baker.

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,250
I listen to classical music when reading scripts.
(Ryu Kyung-jae: I listen to classical music when reading scripts...)

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,110
(Ryu Kyung-jae: because I... don't like loud music...)

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,680
Because I don't like loud music.
(Ryu Kyung-jae: because I... don't like loud music...)

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,280
Apartment, apartment.

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,170
Apartment, apartment.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,680
When I'm at home, I usually read books.

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,239
(Ryu Kyung-jae: because reading is food for the soul, right?!)

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,400
Because reading is food for the soul.
(Ryu Kyung-jae: because reading is food for the soul, right?!)

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,060
(Ryu Kyung-jae: because reading is food for the soul, right?!)

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,260
I'm going crazy.

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:18,840
(Ryu Kyung-jae: in the morning, I either enjoy a cup of hand-brewed coffee leisurely)

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,760
In the morning, I either enjoy a cup of hand-brewed coffee leisurely.
(Ryu Kyung-jae: in the morning, I either enjoy a cup of hand-brewed coffee leisurely)

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,780
(Ryu Kyung-jae: or organize my work for the day.)

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,300
Or organize my work for the day.
(Ryu Kyung-jae: or organize my work for the day.)

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,220
(Ryu Kyung-jae: or organize my work for the day.)

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,700
(Just woke up in the morning, why does your face look so good? Is this a coffee advertisement? ~)

32
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,550
Everyone,

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,400
you've been fooled by him too.

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,060
(Mr. Seo, the team boss)

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,910
Hey, boss.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,210
What is it?

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,960
Is this a good choice?

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,950
Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

39
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,320
It feels good.

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,990
If it's like this, the older brothers should be able to do it too.

41
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,290
If it's this, the players should also be able to handle it.

42
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,540
Why aren't you at the stadium but gathered here?

43
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,940
Mr. Seo.

44
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,940
No, it's the boss's request to upload the challenge content today.

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
What challenge?

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,240
Oh, you haven't done this before, right?

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
Actually, it's not that difficult.

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,829
-How can we do this?
-How can we do this?

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,620
Hey, you're saying it's not hard?

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,130
Of course. Let's demonstrate first.

51
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,260
You guys watch carefully.

52
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,110
Easy, right?

53
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,310
Finally, let Kyung-jae finish it off.

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,680
Okay.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
Let's start.

56
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,470
Good.

57
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,210
Very good.

58
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,520
You guys try it.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,340
No, why are we doing this?

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,870
Yeah, what does this have to do with soccer?

61
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,070
Sports entertainment.

62
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,300
Like this, like this.

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,590
Don't come close to me.

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,620
Keep dancing.

65
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,840
Like this, like this.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,050
-That's right.
-Like this.

67
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,870
Like this.

68
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,180
Good job, good job.

69
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,810
-Spin around.
-Spin around.

70
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,250
-Go backwards.
-Backwards.

71
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,360
-Go backwards.
-Backwards.

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,110
What are you doing, really?

73
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,260
Why do you always fall?

74
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,950
Left foot, clap.

75
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,910
Clap hands.

76
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,640
Right foot, left foot.

77
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,530
Clap.

78
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,280
Clap hands.

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,340
One, two, three.

80
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,490
I won't do it, I won't do it.

81
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,040
Six, seven, eight.

82
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,650
-One, two...
-I won't do it, I won't do it.

83
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:45,700
This is more tiring than playing a full match without a substitute.

84
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,659
If I do it again, I think I'll do better.

85
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:51,630
We seemed to have underestimated this.

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,690
Oh, it's uploaded.

87
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,470
Really.

88
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,350
I'm so embarrassed.

89
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,680
I can't watch this.

90
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,770
They...

91
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,330
thought they danced well and uploaded it directly.

92
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,150
Let's go.

93
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,620
Outdo them all.

94
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,880
Now it's our turn.

95
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,080
Then let's see what you're capable of.

96
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,980
What should we do?

97
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,770
Why ask when you already know?

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,620
This is a corner kick.

99
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,520
Is it?

100
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,500
Here it comes.

101
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,510
What are you doing?

102
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,920
Hey, what are you doing?

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,020
As soccer players, how can you dodge the ball?

104
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,130
Let's do it again.

105
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,160
That kick was weak.

106
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,320
Kyung-jae, show everyone your skills.

107
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,670
You've even filmed a movie before.

108
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,680
You need to kick harder.

109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,190
That's exactly what I was thinking.

110
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,870
Kyung-jae.

111
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,860
I said no heading the ball.

112
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,230
Kyung-jae.

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,100
Kyung-jae, are you okay?

114
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,250
Boss.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,690
Boss, what are you doing?

116
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,290
Hey, kid.

117
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,940
If you head the ball, Kyung-jae's face could get hurt.

118
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,400
Are you kidding me?

119
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,740
How can you play soccer without heading the ball?

120
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,420
Use your feet, you can kick it with your feet.

121
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,300
Are you saying that this handsome face might get hurt during the match,

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,580
so we should avoid the ball?

123
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,210
Kyung-jae.

124
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,360
If you hurt your face while heading the ball,

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,660
I'll be in big trouble with the boss.

126
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,060
Sorry, he said no heading.

127
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,610
Hey.

128
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,480
No heading, let's do something else.

129
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,360
Next, let's see your shooting skills.

130
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,200
Line up.

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,520
My basic athletic abilities are still pretty good.

132
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,180
I even received special training for the soccer movie.

133
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,230
Next.

134
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,640
Wait, wait.

135
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,980
Pinch your cheeks and look at the camera.

136
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,730
What are they doing?

137
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,950
Sure enough, the ending fairy, Sun-bin.

138
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,490
What fairy?

139
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,360
Haven't you heard of the ending fairy?

140
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,790
In music shows,

141
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,070
the member who decorates the ending shot during the final performance.

142
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,690
They do actions like these.

143
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,490
In the past, Sun-bin was famous for these kinds of actions.

144
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,400
Are you here to play soccer or to have fun?

145
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
Hey, Sun-bin.

146
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,670
Stop it and come over here.

147
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,050
Do you think training is a joke?

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,440
Is playing soccer so great?

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,620
It's just the fourth-tier league.

150
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,420
What?

151
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,970
Hey, kid.

152
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,520
Say that again to my face.

153
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,210
Everyone, calm down.

154
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,670
It's my fault.

155
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,770
I shouldn't have brought the camera here.

156
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,920
Thinking of yourself as a great star?

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,390
You're not an idol anymore either.

158
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,110
-That brat is really...
-Captain.

159
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,640
Please understand.

160
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,490
Actually, Sun-bin...

161
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,340
What's going on?

162
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,800
Is something wrong?

163
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,260
He got rejected again during the audition.

164
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,900
The boy band Sun-bin used to be in

165
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,040
recently won a big award and made a big splash.

166
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,310
Even if he left voluntarily,

167
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,820
it must have been really hard for him.

168
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,390
Because he fell from the peak to the bottom suddenly.

169
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,900
Under normal circumstances, it would be unbearable.

170
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Then why did he leave voluntarily?

171
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,280
Umm...

172
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,080
You'd better ask him yourself.

173
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,940
(FC Soldout)

174
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:28,180
(Have you seen Sun-bin? The manager is looking for him. I saw him at the stadium earlier, but I haven't seen him since. Huh, hope nothing happened to him. I shouldn't have said those things earlier...)

175
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,940
Is playing soccer so great?

176
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,130
It's just the fourth-tier league.

177
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,920
What?

178
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,470
Hey, kid.

179
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,780
Say that again to my face.

180
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,470
Darn it.

181
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,100
Got a light?

182
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,210
You've never smoked before, have you?

183
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,750
Sun-bin.

184
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,690
Our bodies are our assets,

185
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,050
like our annual salary.

186
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,550
And as the team captain,

187
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,650
the health of my teammates is also an asset.

188
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,310
In short, we are...

189
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,340
A community of shared future...

190
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,280
That's right.

191
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,700
Who gave you permission?

192
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,090
Everyone is looking for you.

193
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,360
Didn't you check the group chat?

194
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,340
Whatever.

195
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,040
You're pretty harsh. So cute.

196
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,510
Your interests are weird.

197
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,610
I naturally like annoying juniors.

198
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,200
I can tell just by looking at you that you're harder to deal with than Do Ji-woo.

199
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,560
Your cigarette.

200
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,980
I'm confiscating this.

201
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,180
I'll be watching you from now on

202
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,850
to see if you dare to mistreat your body.

203
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,830
Did you understand?

204
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,680
I'm leaving first.

205
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,000
What are you guys doing?

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,440
Ji-woo, don't shout.

207
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,790
Really.

208
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,040
I mean,

209
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,550
we wanted to throw a surprise party to apologize to Sun-bin,

210
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,130
but the delivery was late and everyone fell asleep.

211
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,420
Yeah.

212
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,450
So you could have woken them up.

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,070
Bro,

214
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,600
you know how strict the captain is about late-night snacks.

215
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,380
That's true.

216
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,590
But it's a special situation, so the seniors should understand, right?

217
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,350
It's so cold outside, I don't want to run around the stadium.

218
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,590
Then let's destroy the evidence ourselves.

219
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,330
It's not a lot of food,

220
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,060
just enough for the three of us.

221
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,950
Wow, it smells so good.

222
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,400
This is not ordinary fried chicken,

223
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,800
it's sweet and savory sauce-flavored fried chicken.

224
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,200
I can't take it anymore.

225
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,870
Anyway... Let's calm down first.

226
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,190
This isn't your hand, is it?

227
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,680
It... doesn't seem like mine.

228
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,000
So who could it be?

229
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
Senior.

230
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,490
What are you guys doing?

231
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,630
Captain.

232
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,530
It's fried chicken.

233
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,040
Bro, this is to comfort him...

234
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,120
-Why am I here?
-Why am I here?

235
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,760
Let's... eat the fried chicken.

236
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,180
-Wow, great!
-Nice.

237
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,980
The rich flavor of the canola oil and sauce

238
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,710
woke up the diet zombies from their sleep.

239
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,670
After eating dry chicken breast for so long,

240
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,910
the smell of fried chicken was unbearable.

241
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,220
Haven't you eaten fried chicken for a long time?

242
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,830
Idols have to strictly manage their bodies.

243
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,520
Your lives are pretty tough.

244
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,550
Yeah.

245
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,460
It's not just us who have a tough life.

246
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,070
Here.

247
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,240
Then let's have a special late-night snack tonight.

248
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,350
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

249
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,790
Good.

250
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,230
Alright, let's toast then.

251
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,160
But what should we say?

252
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,140
FC Soldout.

253
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,260
Only sold-out merchandise

254
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,810
can save us from this tough life.

255
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,100
Something like that.

256
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,760
That's a good one.

257
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,950
Alright, then.

258
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,670
To FC Soldout.

259
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,329
Cheers!

260
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,069
Getting relegated in the league,

261
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,030
you won't understand unless you've been through it.

262
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,450
It's similar for idols.

263
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,380
They're evaluated at the end of each month and grouped.

264
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,770
If you're not careful, a group that's supposed to debut...

265
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,970
Just says goodbye.

266
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,230
Since it's already this way, no matter what happens,

267
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,110
if I have to do it, I want to do it well.

268
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,840
We can do it well.

269
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,240
Including soccer and the projects that you hope for.

270
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,610
Thank you.

271
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,510
Ji-woo, is your dream to be a soccer player?

272
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,670
Yeah.

273
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,820
I just... like playing soccer.

274
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,560
When I was a kid, it was just a dream.

275
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,650
I actually joined the team pretty late.

276
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,170
When was that?

277
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,520
In high school.

278
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,410
After transferring to Suyeong High.

279
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,610
Dong-hee, what about you?

280
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,550
Is your dream to be a YouTube blogger?

281
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,870
No.

282
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,090
I want to be president. That's my dream now.

283
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,360
And you?

284
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,340
Is your dream to be an actor?

285
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,260
No.

286
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,990
So I think it's actually good.

287
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,670
I'm using this time to find a new career.

288
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,190
You'll be back soon too.

289
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,040
Honestly, I have no attachment to this profession.

290
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,330
Ready.

291
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,660
Action.

292
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,070
We must win.

293
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,300
-We must win.
-We can do it.

294
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,190
We must win.

295
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,850
-We can do it.
-We must win.

296
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,120
-We must win.
-Good.

297
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,370
-We must win.
-Move closer.

298
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,590
-We must win.
-We can't lose.

299
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,720
-We must win.
-We can do it.

300
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,410
-We must win.
-You closed your eyes just now.

301
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,020
-Kangjae closed his eyes first.
-He closed his eyes first.

302
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,840
Closed eyes.

303
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,360
-Kyung-jae closed his eyes first.
-He closed his eyes first.

304
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,320
Really.

305
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,820
The referee will decide now.

306
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,150
Both of you accept the punishment friendly

307
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,000
and stand in the balcony for ten minutes.

308
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
What are you talking about? He closed his eyes first.

309
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,850
You closed your eyes first.

310
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,990
It's fair. It's very fair this way.

311
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,430
-Just go out.
-Go out.

312
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,790
Hurry up and go out.

313
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,840
Both of you, go out.

314
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,900
Take them out quickly.

315
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,370
You really can't play games.

316
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,330
Your breath is too heavy, making it hard for me to open my eyes.

317
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,100
You're just all talk.

318
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,430
But... Was what you said inside just now true?

319
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,350
What?

320
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,240
-That you have no attachment to that profession?
- No.

321
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,940
You said you have no attachment to acting.

322
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,910
Is that true?

323
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,850
I've never thought of acting as my calling.

324
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,200
But...

325
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,350
There are a lot of people who like you.

326
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,600
And you won that award before.

327
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,970
I may not be able to explain it well,

328
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,210
but your face is made for acting.

329
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,850
So you still have no attachment?

330
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,050
Some people don't even remember, and talk about an acting face.

331
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,550
How long have you known me? You don't use honorifics and dare to provoke me.

332
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,590
How dare you touch my stuff without my permission?

333
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,900
"How long have you known me?"

334
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
Right?

335
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,200
It seems... You don't remember.

336
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,790
Before too, what are you talking about?

337
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,520
Because you don't remember.

338
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
What?

339
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,320
Suyeong High.

340
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,570
That one located at the top of the hill, called Shumulangma.

341
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,340
And the history teacher and Japanese teacher getting married.

342
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,480
We made fun of them all the time, calling them traitors.

343
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,550
Classmates?

344
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,660
What? So we were classmates?

345
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,230
But...

346
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,510
But why... Did you always bully me?

347
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,230
Me?

348
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,620
Including that time with the soccer shoes.

349
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,680
You deliberately slammed the locker door in front of me.

350
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,190
And made fun of me all the time.

351
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,100
That wasn't making fun, it was just laughing...

352
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,030
Okay, you're absolutely right.

353
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,180
Soccer shoes, sports time.

354
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,260
How important could it be? And you arranged those mineral water bottles so neatly.

355
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,510
Why are there so many jinx?

356
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,800
Is your daily life normal?

357
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,660
And those soccer shoes were really expensive.

358
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,700
Other... Other things.

359
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,840
Forget it.

360
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,370
It was just pretending to be friendly. Yes.

361
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,920
No matter who looks at it, it was making fun.

362
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,810
Who laughs like that with a "tsk"?

363
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,420
And...

364
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,720
Were we close in high school?

365
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,130
No.

366
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,910
Then why did you...

367
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,800
So that's it.

368
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,430
Sorry, I was just imagining we were close.

369
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,100
Why did you...

370
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,300
Actually... I'm very sentimental.

371
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,160
Don't laugh.

372
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,440
You... Laugh a lot at times like this.

373
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,090
It's cold.

374
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,750
Okay, let's go in.

375
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,370
It's not even ten minutes yet.

376
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,350
We'll pretend to argue so we can go in.

377
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,160
What are you talking about?

378
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,440
Actually, I saw you close your eyes first.

379
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,560
I've been letting you win all along. Damn it.

380
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,820
You... Do you think you're great because you always cheat?

381
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,180
Fighting again?

382
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,640
This guy keeps cheating.

383
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,590
Who are you calling a cheater?

384
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,640
Because you're arguing nonsense.

385
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,370
Is that so? Let's fight it out then.

386
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,560
-Follow me.
-What?

387
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,240
-You follow me.
-Go in. Okay.

388
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,940
We'll talk about it inside. We'll settle this today.

389
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,000
-Okay.
-Alright, you think I'm scared?

390
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,160
-Hey, come at me.
-Try it.

391
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,590
Come up here. Let's go.

392
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,870
Really.

393
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,730
-Let go.
-Come here.

394
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,210
It's cold.

395
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,890
Still not letting go.

396
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,240
It's so cold.

397
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,500
My legs are numb. Numb.

398
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,600
You really come up with all sorts of things.

399
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,360
Let me see.

400
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,610
Ouch, ouch.

401
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,050
Ouch.

402
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,430
-Ouch, ouch.
-Jiyoo, are you okay?

403
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,110
Ouch, ouch.

404
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,210
Do Ji-woo.

405
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,000
Are you hurt?

406
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,260
People outside must think I'm hitting you, Ji-woo.

407
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,200
I win this time.

408
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,790
You closed your eyes first.

409
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,710
Who gave you permission to start without permission?

410
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,860
Ouch.

411
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,640
Hey...

412
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,900
Come here, come here.

413
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,200
Catch.

414
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,370
Pass it, pass it.

415
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,170
Give me the ball.

416
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,760
Backwards, backwards.

417
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,680
Come on.

418
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,960
Kick the ball over here.

419
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,690
Thank you.

420
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,670
Sorry.

421
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,050
You should have kicked it instead.

422
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,470
The first impression is weird.

423
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,340
Why is he smiling so happily?

424
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,220
If he kicked it, he definitely would have scored.

425
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,900
Watching them play soccer every noon has become my habit.

426
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,600
Later, I realized that Do Ji-woo...

427
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,010
Always smiles like this

428
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,060
after giving others the chance.

429
00:25:53,020 --> 00:26:03,060
(FC Soldout)
