1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Long time no see. Senior.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,710
What... What are you doing here?

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,730
By the way,

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,560
I'll join FC Forworld as of today.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,190
May I ask where the locker room is?

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm sorry. Outsiders can't use the club's facilities.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,470
Please leave.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,490
You haven't heard of it?

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,110
I guess Mr. Kim hasn't announced it yet.

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,340
Just now, Fast forworld flow and I signed the contract.

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm an entertainer

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,740
and a new player.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,290
Are you following me?

14
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,110
You're so narcissistic.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,750
Logically, we don't want to see each other again.

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,610
I tried to avoid you,

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,790
but you followed me here.

18
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,190
What are you doing?

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,050
Don't get me wrong.

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,340
I signed a contract as an entertainery.

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,740
As for the team, I'll just need to show up several times

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,990
and help sell the merchandise.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,760
That's why you should do well.

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,270
By the way,

25
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,770
I don't know if you can continue to be an actor.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,550
You should at least seize this opportunity.

27
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,480
Right.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,230
They always bring outdated artists.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,850
What else can we expect?

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,680
The public is very calm now.

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,210
Right?

32
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,390
You should be able to catch this ball.

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,940
This player Yoo Kang-jae wouldn't have dodged it.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,140
He brought in a player who can't even catch the ball.

35
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,070
Mr. Kim was wrong.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,930
Let's talk privately.

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,230
Follow me.

38
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,780
Hey, Yoo Kang-jae.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,330
(FC Soldout)

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,020
Not bad.

41
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,650
Why did you come here?

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,630
I told you.

43
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,840
We're in the same team now.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,740
Mr. Kim suddenly got attracted

45
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,490
by some sports entertainment.

46
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,620
I didn't join the team under a favorable term, though.

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,420
Are you kidding me?

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,410
What's your purpose?

49
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,100
Previously, “I've already apologized to Si-woo in private.”

50
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,329
“There is no more hatred.”

51
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,980
The apology letter seems to be fake.

52
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,680
Yes,

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,340
I have no hatred toward you anymore, so

54
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,410
don't bring our problems here.

55
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,870
For the players, this team is both their livelihood and their life,

56
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,250
So don't mess with the team and stir up trouble.

57
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,490
But, Mr. Kim said we need to create some media buzz.

58
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,550
Whether it's good or bad publicity,

59
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,640
it needs a catalyst.

60
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,750
Please.

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,870
Do you want to call a ceasefire?

62
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,910
Fine.

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,230
(Kyung-jae, are you safely home?
Yeah, and you? Did you sort things out with him? Did you go back?)

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,400
He asked me first. Why hasn't he replied?

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,850
It's really worrying.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,530
I think his name is Jeong Si-woo.

It is said that Yoo Kang-jae, though the lead, was dissatisfied with his small role, especially after Jeong Si-woo took away what little screen time he had. After an argument, he physically attacked him.
As a result, Jeong Si-woo needs three weeks of treatment to recover, and the drama's filming has been halted.

-You came really early.
-Hmm.

85
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,600
I think I... have completely adapted to the team now.

86
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,870
What did you talk about yesterday?

87
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,970
We agreed to get along well.

88
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,320
We won't stir up trouble, so don't worry.

89
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,370
I'm not worried about that.

90
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,740
What I'm worried about now... is you.

91
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,300
Are you okay?

92
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,300
Is Do Ji-woo worried about me now?

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,340
I never thought I'd see a day like this.

94
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,920
Don't joke around.

95
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,010
About that thing of yours,

96
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,690
It's not just what the news said, right?

97
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,190
Is there something else?

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,620
No matter what it is,

99
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,990
it's all my fault.

100
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,160
This is definitely not just your fault.

101
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,920
I... believe in you.

102
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,200
Thank you, a friend like you still believes in me.

Let's wash together.

104
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,320

-What is this for?

It's not allowed, really.

107

Come on.

108
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,930
They look like they're really close.

109
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,820
I didn't know they were high school classmates at first.

110
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,930
At first, they couldn't stand each other.

111
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,040
I went through a lot trying to mediate between them.

112
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,740
Now that I think about it, I don't know when they started

113
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,040
being together all the time.

114
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,720
Did they get close through living in the same room?

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
Yeah?

116
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,380

Hey.

124
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,590
Look at you.

125
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,890
Where did your muscles go?

126
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,000
You're not putting your chopsticks down until you've had

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,900
enough protein today.

128

Come on.

129
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,470
Open your mouth.

Let me try too.

131
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,130
Captain, you eat so well.

132
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,660
I always eat well.

133
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,880
Maybe I should try doing a mukbang too.

134
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,420
You better not do that.

135
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,030
What's wrong? I also want to think about life beyond football.

136
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,100
I don't want anyone else to watch you eating well.

137
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,620
If you really want to do it, then do a mukbang just for me.

138
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,110
I'll pay.

139
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,169
What?

140
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm just kidding.

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,320
Hey...

142
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,570
Why are you always messing with me?

143
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,490
Go ahead and eat.

144
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,210

Come on, let's clap.

152
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,620
I'm just lucky.

Yeah, right on my tail.

Ji-woo, congratulations.

157
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,390
Now we're making a profit.

158

Clap.

162

165
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,440
You scared me.

166
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,490
So this is the secret behind Ji-woo's sales numbers.

That's not it.

So, what are you doing?

170

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,190
Is this what being a fan is like?

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,560
No.

175
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,630
You're just down bad. Really down bad.

176
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:29,960
(Today's news: Yoo Kang-jae's assault on Jeong Si-woo.)
(It seems like he's not acting anymore. Seeing his recent situation, haha, he's playing football in a team no one's heard of.)
(No matter if Yoo Kang-jae acts or not, compared to the malicious commenters, he's doing just fine!)
(It's obvious Yoo Kang-jae was being a condescending senior.)
(Do you know him? Were you there and saw it with your own eyes?)

177
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,830
Ugh.

178
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,770
Alright.

179
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,600
Keep spouting nonsense. I'll keep guarding him until the end.

180
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,810
Seriously.

181
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,810
Yoo Kang-jae's comfort doll is Do Ji-woo.

182
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,820
Good.

183
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:00,990
(Where did this photo come from? Reposted from Yoo Kang-jae's heated discussion group, haha)
Good.

184
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,260
(Where did this photo come from? Reposted from Yoo Kang-jae's heated discussion group, haha)

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,450
My heated discussion group?

186
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,200
I have a group like that?

187
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,390
Well, that's normal.

188
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:19,610
Yoo Kang-jae.

189
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,500
(Participate in open chat: Join Yoo Kang-jae's heated discussion group)
Yoo Kang-jae.

190
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,210
(Join open chat: Close to Kyung-jae's heated discussion group)

191
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:31,950
(I'm so happy today because I saw Kyung-jae's photo, haha.)
(I can't wait to meet him. Do I have to wait until soccer season to see him?)
(I wonder if he received my fan letter)
(I wonder if he read my fan letter)

192
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,270
Aren't you going to read them?

193
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Read what?

194
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,900
The fan letters--aren't you going to check them out?

195
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,480
I never said I wouldn't read them.

196
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,690
You're such a bad person.

197
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,640
What?

198
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,460
If so many people are cheering for me,

199
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,750
I'd feel so supported.

200
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,130
But you just stuffed their sincerity into your closet...

201
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,690
That's not very nice.

202
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:21,340
(He'll definitely read them! Because it's hard to fulfill the wishes of fans who want to see him. Even if he doesn't read them immediately... he will definitely read them. He'll definitely keep them safe.)

203
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,110
Crisp and Tender Lion.

204
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,010
(Crisp and Tender Lion)
Crisp and Tender Lion.

205
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,150
(Crisp and Tender Lion)

206
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't call anymore, these malicious commenters.

207
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,640
Hey, Mom.

208
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,220
Yes.

209
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,910
No.

210
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,440
I should be heading out now.

211
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,990
Cleaning?

212
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,890
Got it.

213
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,690
Come here later.

214
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,640
You know the password, right?

215
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,330
Okay.

216
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,550
Mom?

217
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,330
(The fresh air of the South Sea is coming your way.)

218
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,450
Darn it.

219
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,950
What should I do about all these?

220
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:57,090
(Watch their story, you'll cry. Striker, they won't give up!)

221
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,840
Do you need help?

222
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,020
Listen to me... It's not what you think. That...

223
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,060
What's going on?

224
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,540
Senior Kyung-jae is here too.

225
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,690
Oh, he must be in pain.

226
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,260
Look at how scared you are. It's pretty normal.

227
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,890
I totally understand.

228
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,880
So...

229
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,360
This... I hope you can keep it a secret for me.

230
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,570
Does Yoo Kang-jae not know?

231
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,360
Listen to me.

232
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,940
Kyung-jae and I just started getting along.

233
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,320
So I don't want things to get awkward.

234
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,130
I don't want him to know that I'm his fan.

235
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,960
And I don't expect anything else.

236
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,340
No proof?

237
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,160
What?

238
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,710
It'd be best if you have some kind of feeling, just take a photo.

239
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,960
Is it fine to just follow the script?

240
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,410
You should also act a little bit.

241
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,650
But...

242
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,990
It says here he hit his head.

243
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,480
It's acting, it's fine.

244
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,790
I see.

245
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,530
I hope you can help me this time.

246
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,470
Because I always forget my lines.

247
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,390
If you can seriously cooperate with me and act,

248
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,940
I can keep the things I saw earlier a secret for you.

249
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,050
Why hit me?

250
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,470
Dad, what did you do for me?

251
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,080
Do you want me to kick you too?

252
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,030
No, you need to take this seriously.

253
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,080
Aren't you awake yet?

254
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,420
Bro.

255
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,730
It's you.

256
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,770
Thanks for earlier.

257
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,840
Mm.

258
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,500
This is for you, bro.

259
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,910
What is this?

260
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,090
Hats and T-shirts, things like that.

261
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,240
They're sponsored by the brand.

262
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,570
Because this color doesn't suit me,

263
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,160
I thought it might look good on you.

264
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,750
No need, I don't need this.

265
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,370
I don't need it either.

266
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,530
If you don't want to wear it, just throw it away.

267
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,160
But if possible,

268
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,890
instead of throwing it away, let someone who suits it wear it.

269
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,020
Thanks.

270
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,120
Darn it.

271
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,050
Suddenly, becoming so close.

272
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,640
You guys aren't using honorifics anymore.

273
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,830
No, it's not like you think.

274
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,760
Earlier... together.

275
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,660
Earlier, together...

276
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,040
What did you do?

277
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,500
Practice.

278
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,990
Practice?

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,300
Hey.

280
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,910
The person who wants to get along with him is me,

281
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,260
not for you guys to get along.

282
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,750
Didn't you say everything was settled?

283
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,200
Don't trust that guy too much.

284
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,610
I don't think he's that bad.

285
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,340
Anyway...

286
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,230
Don't be too polite with him.

287
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,550
Got it.

288
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,060
Darn it.

289
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,650
Ji-woo.

290
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,640
I've been your supporter since TA started.

291
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,020
I support you guys.

292
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,560
Okay, thank you.

293
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,810
Fighting.

294
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,510
Wait a minute.

295
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,600
Thank you for cheering for us.

296
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,620
Hello.

297
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,330
I've been supporting you guys

298
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,460
for three years since FC TA started.

299
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,070
Although a lot has happened this year...

300
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,250
I just want to say that I still support you.

301
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,490
Because FC Forworld

302
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,950
is a strong force in my daily life.

303
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,390
Even if the sponsor changes, the supporters won't leave.

304
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,510
I'll be content if I can see you guys

305
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,220
on the field in the next season.

306
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,640
Let's go to the next level.

307
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,900
This week's friendly match,

308
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,560
you have to win. I'll cheer for you all.

309
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,200
I really want to win this game.

310
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,410
Don't think of this as just a friendly match.

311
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,970
The season hasn't started yet, so don't underestimate it.

312
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,630
I also want to win this match.

313
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,320
Me too.

314
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,290
Then let's win.

315
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,540
Let's go.

316
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,590
One, two.

317
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,500
-Forworld, Forworld.
-Forworld, Forworld.

318
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,310
-Fighting.
-Fighting.

319
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,590
Friends, we finally...

320
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,780
(Forworld isn't over yet!! We have to play well in the second half. Do Ji-woo seems a bit off today. Hoo, this is the last chance, we must win. The opponent seems tough, trembling. We have to win the second half! How many do you think it will be? The defense has to be solid. Tae-ryong, fighting~ Anyway, it's much better than last time~ Forworld fans, raise your hands~ No matter what, I still believe in Do Ji-woo player. Jiwoo, go~~~ Yoo Kang-jae is pretty good, huh? Please make sure to catch the ball when it's passed over. Dong-hee's defense behind him, whew. Even though it's not an official match, I still hope we can win. Anyway, the artist team is a bit... What's going on? The first half ended like this?! Looking for Forworld supporters. FC Forworld, come on! Watching this, you start to feel attached. Let's really win this time. The opponent team is tough too, but even though we lost to Hamsan FC, this time we will definitely win! Do Ji-woo, fighting!!!!!! Kyung-jae, I believe in you.)

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,810
The final friendly match.

335
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,490
Guys, the match is only halfway through. Stay focused.

336
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,360
Dong-hee.

337
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,610
I told you, you can't always neglect the defense behind you.

338
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,930
Yes.

339
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,670
Hey, if you're going to play like this, you might as well quit.

340
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,130
I also want to quit.

341
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,170
If Mr. Kim didn't assign it,

342
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,970
Ji-woo,

343
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,020
you need to be more confident. Be confident.

344
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,820
If you get the chance to shoot, just go for it.

345
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,300
You can do it, Do Ji-woo.

346
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,800
Yes.

347
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,640
Yeah, Ji-woo, you can do it.

348
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,930
FC Forworld can do it.

349
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,770
Please, win the second half.

350
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,310
Let's go. Let's all cheer together.

351
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,650
Gather round, gather round.

352

Do Ji-woo.

355
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,670
You once asked me, when filming Striker,

356
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,000
which person I referred to.

357
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,350
That person was you.

358
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,850
What?

359
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,210
You also asked me

360
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,590
if I remembered leaving my umbrella on the school playground.

361
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,720
I still remember.

362
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,160
That wasn't me forgetting.

363
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,690
I left it there for you to use.

364
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,180
I think you were really cool,

365
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,810
the way you played football at the time.

366
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,100
You were the protagonist in my movie.

367
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,520
Whether back then or now,

368
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,570
Do Ji-woo, you've always been the protagonist in my story.

369
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,610
You probably didn't even know that.

370
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,090
Because it was so silly.

371
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,820
But now you should know. You are so brilliant.

372
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,420
Yoo Kang-jae.

373
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,640
Let's go.

374
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,250
We have to win.

375
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,660
Yoo Kang-jae player got the ball in a good position.

376
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,750
Don't hesitate, kick it.

377
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,800
Pass it to Do Ji-woo, Do Ji-woo.

378
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,670
Ji-woo.

379
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,670
Good, good, very good.

380
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,400
Keep going, keep going.

381
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,840
Keep going, shoot, shoot!

382
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,260
Shoot, Do Ji-woo, goal!

383
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,540
Goal! Do Ji-woo!

384
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,060
Wow, Do Ji-woo!

385
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,410
