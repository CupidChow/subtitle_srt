1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,970
Do Ji-woo.

2
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,020
Senior.

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,250
I knew you'd come first.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,100
Did you do it on purpose?

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,800
I've always had this habit.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,620
Actually... It's not really a jinx.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,920
I know.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,350
There's talk of Do Ji-woo coming to work earlier than the ghosts in the locker room.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,570
Stop making fun of me.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,470
I'm saying it's good, you fool.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,470
By the way, Senior,

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,050
did you make a deal with Mr. Kim too?

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,820
You mean...

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,520
The so-called "soldout"?

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,350
What about you?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,250
I want to try my best.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,250
What about you, Senior?

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,670
How could I leave you here and go off on my own?

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,650
Wow. As expected from our leading player.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,270
How have you been?

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,350
Without me around, you must've been really happy, right?

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,620
No. I've said I'm not going.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,850
But you're the one who sent me to another actor.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,100
When I'm on a break, you won't make any money even if you stay by my side.

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,020
And I don't know how long this break will last.

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
What about soccer?

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,700
Have you really made up your mind?

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm at the soccer field now.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,170
So early?

30
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,620
I can't fall sleep again after I wake up these days anyway.

31
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,770
Wow. You used to nag me

32
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,020
about coming to pick you up too early.

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,400
Seems like you've changed a lot.

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,270
That's true.

35
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,920
So...

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,070
What have you been up to lately?

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,670
Why is he here?

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,100
-But he said he couldn't get up early in the morning.
-What?

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,400
Who?

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,750
No... Nothing.

41
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,850
Why are you looking at me like that?

42
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,950
You...

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,020
I...

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,050
You... I?

45
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,850
What are you trying to say?

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,250
What?

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,650
Darn it.

48
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,370
Friends.

49
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,650
If...

50
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,700
I mean if

51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,020
you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work,

52
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,120
(Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?)
you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work,

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,500
(Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?)

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
what will you do?
(Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?)

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,260
(Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?)

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,860
(Resign) (If Kyung-jae came, I'd love the company even more) (This isn't your real experience, right, "Crisp and Tender Lion"?) (Ryu Kyung-jae didn't show up at your club, did he?) (Gosh, I feel so happy just thinking about it...) (It's Monday morning, and there're many more people who are hurt) (That won't happen! Repeat "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" to yourself!) ("The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" LOL)

57
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,870
(Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?)
(Resign) (Gosh, I feel so happy just thinking about it...) (If Kyung-jae came, I'd love the company even more) (It's Monday morning, and there're many more people who are hurt) (That won't happen! Repeat "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" to yourself!) ("The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" LOL) (This isn't your real experience, right, "Crisp and Tender Lion"?) (Ryu Kyung-jae didn't show up at your club, did he?)

58
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,700
As the saying goes, "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest."
(Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?)
(Resign) (Gosh, I feel so happy just thinking about it...) (If Kyung-jae came, I'd love the company even more) (It's Monday morning, and there're many more people who are hurt) (That won't happen! Repeat "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" to yourself!) ("The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" LOL) (This isn't your real experience, right, "Crisp and Tender Lion"?) (Ryu Kyung-jae didn't show up at your club, did he?)

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,780
(Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?)
(Resign) (Gosh, I feel so happy just thinking about it...) (If Kyung-jae came, I'd love the company even more) (It's Monday morning, and there're many more people who are hurt) (That won't happen! Repeat "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" to yourself!) ("The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" LOL) (This isn't your real experience, right, "Crisp and Tender Lion"?) (Ryu Kyung-jae didn't show up at your club, did he?)

60
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:42,220
(Since it's early Monday morning, I was just thinking out loud. Of course, "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest...")

61
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,770
The biggest fans are always the unluckiest.

62
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,670
Turn off the lights.

63
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,670
I will. Because I'm heading out.

64
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Shall we go for a run together?

65
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,570
Starting to run early in the morning

66
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,300
is something only crazy people do.

67
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,500
But why are you sleeping here?

68
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,050
Did I say I was sleeping?

69
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,700
Then why are you lying here instead of going back home?

70
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,350
Because I woke up.

71
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,500
So, all that stuff he said in the interview about having trouble getting out of bed in the morning was a lie?

72
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,300
The hell.

73
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,350
I didn't expect the disaster alarm to go off again

74
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,900
after a period of silence.

75
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,970
Where did they go?

76
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,100
They were right here.

77
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,870
What are you doing?

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,070
Nothing.

79
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,620
I'm such an idiot. Come on, think about it.

80
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,920
What happened?

81
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,120
Ji-woo?

82
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,100
My soccer shoes... They disappeared.

83
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,700
I thought you cherished those shoes.

84
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,400
You only wore them for important games, right?

85
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,350
Why? Because they're expensive?

86
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,700
No, that's Ji-woo's jinx.

87
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,120
Something bad will happen to the team

88
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,900
if he doesn't wear those shoes in important games.

89
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,570
Huh...

90
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,450
As a sportsman,

91
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,800
such trivial things are sometimes even more important than your life.

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,650
It's the little things that make the difference between winning and losing.

93
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,900
Why did they suddenly disappear?

94
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,620
Hey.

95
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,620
-Go look for them too.
-Yes.

96
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
This is bad.

97
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,600
I finally arrived first.

98
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,600
I don't even care about the jinx.

99
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
At this rate, I'll die from lack of sleep.

100
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,500
Could I really have lost them?

101
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,170
Hey, Jinx Elf.

102
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You're here.

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,700
You startled me.

104
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,320
Why did you come out of there... Today?

105
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,820
Oh, right.

106
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,420
Those jinxed... Soccer shoes.

107
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,900
I looked for them too.

108
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,370
When did you start caring about others' affairs?

109
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,320
Forget it.

110
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,320
Here.

111
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,600
What... Is this?

112
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,900
I found them on my way here.

113
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,100
Soccer shoes?

114
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,350
To be honest,

115
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,470
I didn't know about that. I threw them away. I'm sorry.

116
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,800
The soccer shoes'... Jinx.

117
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,450
What?

118
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,620
I want to say something in my defense.

119
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,200
Actually, I didn't know what happened.

120
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,520
They were right in front of my locker.

121
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,470
I thought they were discarded, so I casually put them aside.

122
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,500
But later I found they were gone.

123
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,470
I looked for them all day yesterday.

124
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,870
Maybe the cleaner took them.

125
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm not quite sure.

126
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,000
How long would it take for soccer shoes to look like that?

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,420
Those shoes should be thrown away.

128
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,920
It was like those shoes were saying,

129
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,320
"Please throw us away," or

130
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,450
"Please kill us..."

131
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,800
That kind of thing.

132
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,700
This pair of shoes is several times more expensive than that one.

133
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,420
Why don't you take this opportunity to wear something nicer?

134
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,170
Why don't you use honorifics when talking to me?

135
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,550
What?

136
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,800
You've been like this since the beginning.

137
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,670
Why don't you use honorifics?

138
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,870
You threw it away?

139
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,020
You're a celebrity, so what?

140
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,220
Why else would I have done that?

141
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,370
So why is that?

142
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,850
We've only known each other for a short time. How dare you not use honorifics in front of me and even mess with me?

143
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,850
How dare you touch my stuff without my permission?

144
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,600
Do you think I'm someone who can be easily bullied?

145
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,950
"We've only known each other for a short time?"

146
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,100
Is that so?

147
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,300
It seems... You don't remember.

148
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,100
Right, I think you can be easily bullied. So what?

149
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,950
You jerk.

150
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,980
(FC Soldout)

151
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,420
Guys! Guys! Stop!

152
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,600
No! No!

153
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,050
Guys, stop!

154
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,750
What happened between you two?

155
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,470
I already apologized to you.

156
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,300
I don't want your apology or your soccer shoes. So get lost!

157
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,850
Look how bad your character is.

158
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,870
I should have realized it when you were arranging the water bottles.

159
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,070
Stop!

160
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,670
That's not a jinx.

161
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,250
It's all in your head. That's the only way you can feel at ease.

162
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,900
What do you know? How dare you keep talking nonsense?

163
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,700
-The hell...
-Stop it!

164
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,900
Let go of me!

165
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,020
Well... Is this the content you talked about?

166
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,050
Are you trying to make a gangster movie?

167
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,220
Why are they fighting...

168
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,370
The most urgent issue at the moment is the teamwork between the players.

169
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,820
Yes, but it's like the so-called teamwork has been fed to dogs.

170
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,400
Okay.

171
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,850
Dong-hee.

172
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,670
The winter training starts now.

173
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,800
Winter training?

174
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,170
Go film it.

175
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,470
So... Can I livestream it?

176
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,150
Of course.

177
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,150
How long would it take for soccer shoes to look like that?

178
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,050
Why don't you take this opportunity to wear something nicer?

179
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:09,380
(Urgent!!!) (New gif posted) (New New New) (Gosh, is Kyung-jae finally done living in seclusion?!)

180
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,180
(Urgent!!!) (New gif posted) (New New New) (Gosh, is Kyung-jae finally done living in seclusion?!) (Who's the guy next to him?) (What's going on? Is that their team uniform???)

181
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:21,820
(They all look so handsome) (Gosh, it seems that's a soccer team) (Why are they so handsome? Is this a celebrity soccer team?) (Is that guy next to him an idol?? Who knows his name!!! This is urgent!!!)

182
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,940
(He's not an idol... He's a soccer player.)

183
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,770
Hello, Dong-hee's friends.

184
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,050
This is "The World in Dong-hee's Eyes: Dong-hee's World TV."

185
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,770
I've posted a trailer in the community before.

186
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,850
I'm going to record the behind-the-scenes video for our team.

187
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,970
Today is the day we set off for winter training.

188
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,520
Wow...

189
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,450
Player Kang Min-soo.

190
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,300
What?

191
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,170
I'm sorry. I thought you wanted to steal my...

192
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,400
Darn it.

193
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,400
Player Ji-woo.

194
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,970
How do you feel about the winter training?

195
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,350
Are you in good condition?

196
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
What are you doing? Give me some reaction.

197
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,520
If you have nothing to say, you could at least make a heart for the camera.

198
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,050
Hey.

199
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,070
Whatever it is, content or container, just stop filming.

200
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,170
Stop bothering him.

201
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,750
No matter what kind of emotional environment Ji-woo is in,

202
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,750
his heart rate won't exceed 60 beats per minute.

203
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,320
He can be called the AI of soccer.

204
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,670
He won't get mad even if the opponent blocks him hard.

205
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,670
Instead, he'll only start running with the ball. He knows nothing but playing soccer.

206
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,070
So you'd better not film him or make him your video content.

207
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,570
But... This is about playing soccer. Why do you need any content?

208
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,020
I'm a YouTuber with a million followers.

209
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,150
Haven't you heard of "Dong-hee's World TV"?

210
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,200
Don't any of you know?

211
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,620
Are your lives just about eating and playing soccer?

212
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,450
Yes.

213
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,570
-Yes.
-Yes.

214
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,470
Is this our car?

215
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,820
It can't be.

216
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,070
Our team's bus...

217
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,950
Is everyone here?

218
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,150
Mr. Seo, is it only us?

219
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,800
What about the others?

220
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,020
We only picked players who needed training in teamwork this time.

221
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,950
It's too crowded.

222
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,050
Mr. Seo.

223
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,120
Don't you have a better car?

224
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,020
I rented this car for the right number of people.

225
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,820
Anyway, the weather is nice.

226
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,070
That's true.

227
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,750
What's wrong?

228
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,520
You're indeed handsome, but it's a pity.

229
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,200
You can even be an idol.

230
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,250
How is he handsome?

231
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,349
He's got the look of a good soccer player.

232
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,369
He is handsome. I have high standards.

233
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,950
You must be happy then.

234
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,400
With such low standards, no wonder you fall for people a lot.

235
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,420
What... What about you?

236
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,670
What about you?

237
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,400
Do you think you look...

238
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,450
The person who was on my phone screen

239
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,300
is now right in front of me. It's really unbelievable.

240
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,070
Aren't we... Here for training?

241
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,000
This hotel looks familiar.

242
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,870
I know this place.

243
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,300
Because I'm a big fan of "Lovers' Day".

244
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,150
What's "Lover's Day"?

245
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,720
-It's a dating show.
-Oh?

246
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,270
How should we train here?

247
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
Attention.

248
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Our CEO often says that

249
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,900
soccer games start in the changing room.

250
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,850
And the winner also depends on the changing room.

251
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,220
What does that mean?

252
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,570
Training is not just about exercise.

253
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,370
To form a team,

254
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,870
you need to trust each other

255
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,000
and improve the team atmosphere. That's equally important.

256
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,870
Could this be because of me?

257
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,250
There are indeed some key figures who undermine teamwork here,

258
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,800
but it’s not all about that.

259
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,400
This was decided after monitoring the team atmosphere for a week.

260
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Alright then.

261
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,150
Let's go inside

262
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,550
and start with choosing your roommates.

263
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,520
Name a team member you want to learn more about,

264
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,670
okay?

265
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,620
It must be fun.

266
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,120
Yes.

267
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,800
Let's go in.

268
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,250
Let's start. Who wants to go first?

269
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,050
Since no one has raised their hand, I'll go first.

270
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,250
As for me...

271
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,250
Why is he acting so shy?

272
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,200
I have objections.

273
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,750
Don't do that.

274
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,220
I like Min-soo too.

275
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,770
I want him to be my roommate.

276
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,450
Let's do that then.

277
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,950
Let's go.

278
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,550
Hurry up and choose your rooms.

279
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,050
Otherwise, the good ones will be taken.

280
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,650
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

281
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,100
I'll pick Ji-woo then.

282
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,270
Me?

283
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,150
Okay.

284
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,070
By the way, he snores.

285
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,770
He always snores on the bus.

286
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,350
Be careful about your choice.

287
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,670
What's this about? Why are you always targeting me?

288
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,670
Whatever. Let's go random then.

289
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,400
You've all made your choice, right?

290
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,320
You can open your eyes now.

291
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,700
Who is No. 201?

292
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,320
Hey, you guys are in cahoots, right?

293
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,420
We're not.

294
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,970
I'm No. 202.

295
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,500
Come with me then.

296
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,220
What? Am I the only one who'll live alone?

297
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,820
You don't want to be alone? How about switching with me?

298
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,650
No.

299
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,600
Hey, you can't abandon your roommate.

300
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,420
Darn it.

301
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
See you later.

302
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,850
Let's go too.

303
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,400
When exactly are we going to play soccer?

304
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,820
When?

305
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,120
We need to put our luggage away before we do anything else, right?

306
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,670
Are you not coming?

307
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,970
If you don't like it, go to Dong-hee's room.

308
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,850
Oh, this is nice.

309
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,600
It's 100 times better than my place.

310
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,770
Oh, right, Brother.

311
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,850
What is it?

312
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,600
Can I call you Brother?

313
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Oh... Sure.

314
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,770
As expected. I've liked you since the beginning.

315
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,550
I always feel like we've known each other for a long time.

316
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,470
Do you feel the same?

317
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,750
Me too.

318
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,750
-Really?
-Yes.

319
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,300
Why are you already working out? We just got here.

320
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,770
Because I'm a soccer player.

321
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,920
I thought you said you were an idol.

322
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,250
Then dance next to me.

323
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,250
You didn't say that to make me laugh, did you?

324
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,150
Yeah, I'm serious.

325
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,550
Why don't you come work out with me?

326
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,520
I'll help you correct your posture.

327
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,750
Forget it.

328
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,520
I've done commercials for this before.

329
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,520
So what?

330
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,420
What are you trying to say?

331
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,650
What are you doing? Let me see.

332
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,150
Don't come near me.

333
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,820
-Let me see.
-Don't follow me.

334
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,000
-Let me see.
-Stop it...

335
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,350
I was once the spokesperson of this brand.

336
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,050
You must be happy since you shot so many commercials.

337
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,550
Not a lot, actually.

338
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,250
But are you sure you've never seen my commercials?

339
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,770
No, I haven't.

340
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,500
But a lot of the products you use are my commercials.

341
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,700
That's... Just a coincidence.

342
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,650
I'm so tired.

343
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,300
Actually, there are more.

344
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
In my bag.

345
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:07,320
(It's Monday morning, and there are many more people who are hurt) (That won't happen! Repeat "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" to yourself!) ("The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" LOL)

346
