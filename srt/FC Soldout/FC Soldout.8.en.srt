1
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,250
(Do Ji-woo, No. 7)

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,330
-Excuse me...
-Excuse me...
(Do Ji-woo, No. 7)

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,510
You want to talk about it later?

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,520
Sure.

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,570
Let's talk somewhere else.

6
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,110
I'm... Sorry about earlier.

7
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,310
It's all my fault for getting inexplicably worked up.

8
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,470
Are you okay?

9
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,340
There's no misunderstanding here, right?

10
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,760
Misunderstanding?

11
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,270
What misunderstanding?

12
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,759
Did you misunderstand anything?

13
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,890
No.

14
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,020
So if there wasn't any misunderstanding...

15
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,110
I didn't get carried away at the moment.

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,630
Then what is it?

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,780
To be precise, we...

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,870
We've waited for each other for seven years.

19
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,329
Because I...

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,030
I think I've fallen in love with you since that moment.

21
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,110
You don't have to answer me right away.

22
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,650
I've been in unrequited love with you for seven years.

23
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,560
If you keep me waiting a bit longer...

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,050
It's okay.

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,660
I...

26
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,260
Anyway,

27
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,150
I don't hate you.

28
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,060
If you don't hate me, it means you like me.

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,190
That's not what I meant.

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,120
You'll go back to another world anyway...

31
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,290
(Their story will surely bring you to tears
Striker: They won't give up!)

32
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,800
Hey... Who put it here?

33
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,740
It's a photo of me.

34
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,500
Is it yours?

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
No.

36
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,750
Then why are you hiding it?

37
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,620
Give it to me.

38
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,510
Since it's not yours.

39
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,420
What do you want to do with it?

40
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,660
Throw it away.

41
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,120
What?

42
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,420
Are you crazy? No way!

43
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,709
Wow.

44
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,180
It turns out my Ji-woo

45
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,130
is actually a fan of mine.

46
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,690
No wonder.

47
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,840
The products you carry are always the ones I've endorsed before.

48
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,460
I knew it.

49
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,180
That being said...

50
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't hold that fake Yoo Kang-jae anymore.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,390
The real Yoo Kang-jae is here.

52
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,210
Please give me a hug...

53
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,400
In real life.

54
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,350
Okay?

55
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,930
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

56
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,680
-Come here.
-It hurts.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,840
Hey, go away.

58
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:55,870
(FC Soldout)
Hey, go away.

59
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,530
What are you doing?
(FC Soldout)

60
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,659
Hey, go away.
(FC Soldout)

61
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,320
(FC Soldout)

62
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,470
Ji-woo.

63
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,010
Your favorite person is here.

64
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,880
This psycho.

65
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,110
Give me the ball.

66
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,180
Why?

67
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,510
I want to sign it for you.

68
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

69
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,720
Don't you know I'm known for loving my fans?

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,760
(Yoo Kang-jae)

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,190
Wow, in this situation,

72
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,570
you should be called a successful fan, right?

73
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,570
How did you come to that conclusion?

74
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm just about to unstan you.

75
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,470
Anyway, I've confessed my feelings to you.

76
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,880
I like you as much as you like me.

77
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,200
How's that? How's that?

78
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,580
You'll give me a reply in no time, right?

79
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,280
I'll wait for you.

80
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,260
Got it.

81
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,820
I already said got it, so move your face away.

82
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm leaving.

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,010
(Yoo Kang-jae)

84
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,290
(Their story will surely bring you to tears
Striker: They won't give up!)

85
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,020
I like you as much as you like me.

86
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,980
You'll give me a reply in no time, right?

87
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,350
I'll wait for you.

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,560
Darn it.

89
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,040
It's exactly because I'm a fan of yours

90
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,100
that this isn't a simple question, you fool.

91
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,330
(I'm going to share some photos taken by a friend who witnessed him.)

92
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,490
What is this?
(I'm going to share some photos taken by a friend who witnessed him.)

93
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,409
So annoying.

94
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,070
Why is he so cute?

95
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,360
(Gosh, he's so cute.
In a suit... Was he filming a new movie?)

96
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,490
What's going on?
(Gosh, he's so cute.
In a suit... Was he filming a new movie?)

97
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,440
(Gosh, he's so cute.
In a suit... Was he filming a new movie?)

98
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,220
(Please take this photo down.
Please take it down (in tears)
I don't think it's Yoo Kang-jae...!)

99
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,810
This isn't me.
(Please take this photo down.
Please take it down (in tears)
I don't think it's Yoo Kang-jae...!)

100
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,150
(Please take this photo down.
Please take it down (in tears)
I don't think it's Yoo Kang-jae...!)

101
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,970
Please take this photo down.
(Please take this photo down.
Please take it down (in tears)
I don't think it's Yoo Kang-jae...!)

102
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,850
This... Seriously...
(Please take this photo down.
Please take it down (in tears)
I don't think it's Yoo Kang-jae...!)

103
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,460
This... Seriously...

104
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,320
I can't let him know about this!

105
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,940
Hey.

106
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,260
You're here.

107
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,780
Well, you know I'm your fan.

108
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,140
Isn't it normal for me

109
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,560
to put up such a handsome photo of yours?

110
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,390
I should have printed it bigger.

111
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,610
Hey!

112
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,670
I know. I know.

113
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,780
You made up a fake wedding.

114
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,430
That's a secret, right?

115
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,950
Could it be...

116
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,429
Because you heard me praise another actor looking good in a suit

117
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,280
that you wore a suit that day?

118
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,870
Oh my god.

119
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,670
It seems I'm not the successful fan here.

120
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,170
Do you want me to sign for you, Yoo Kang-jae?

121
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,150
Right. I did get jealous, so what?

122
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,070
I became so pathetic all because of Do Ji-woo.

123
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,350
Then hurry up...

124
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,500
And take responsibility for me.

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,840
Or agree to date me!

126
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,770
-What is this about?
-Come on!

127
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,030
-What do you plan to do?
-What?

128
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,540
-Tell me. What do you plan to do?
-What are you doing?

129
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,660
Darn it. Seriously.

130
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,530
Hey, I said go away!

131
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,040
Tell me!

132
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,310
-They...
-Come on. Hey.

133
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,970
-Tell me...
-That's why it's useless to train a junior.

134
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,640
-What is it? Tell me.
-What?

135
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,380
-You trained him really well.
-Go now.

136
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,970
I said I'm not going.

137
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,180
Go away.

138
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,730
Why did you hit me?

139
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,940
Kim Do-hyung?

140
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,870
You used to be a player of FC TA, right?

141
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,750
Are you sure this script is for me?

142
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,000
Kang-jae. Didn't I tell you that

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,810
soccer would definitely work?

144
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,130
As long as you're willing to show your face, everything will be fine.

145
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,950
Make a comeback with this role.

146
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,900
Although you'll be playing a supporting role, it's a great role.

147
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,030
I refuse.

148
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,180
Hey, brat.

149
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,130
What's wrong with you?

150
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,910
Kang-jae.

151
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,310
About that incident...

152
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,360
It's time to forget.

153
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,210
Si-woo promised to keep his mouth shut before he signed the new contract.

154
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,290
Anyway, as long as you make up your mind,

155
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,300
I'll persuade the youngest staff who was there at the scene

156
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,680
to never mention that incident again.

157
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,790
You really need to take this role.

158
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,160
This is not about acting.

159
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,840
You don't know why I agreed to join the team, do you?

160
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,760
Right.

161
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,020
All you think about is selling more merchandises.

162
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,740
We're also doing this for your own good.

163
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,150
I...

164
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,190
I don't think I'm cut out to be an actor.

165
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
This actor thing...

166
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,720
I quit.

167
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,620
What did you say?

168
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,730
Hey.

169
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,390
Yoo Kang-jae!

170
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,710
Yoo Kang-jae.

171
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,280
Kang-jae.

172
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,520
What happened?

173
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,620
It's not like you at all. Why are you running in the middle of the night?

174
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,920
Are you...

175
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,320
Feeling burdened because I like you?

176
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,890
Such a sudden question?

177
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,270
You told me before that
even if I find the fans' love overwhelming,

178
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,140
I must stand up and keep going.

179
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,120
Something must be bothering you.

180
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,840
I... I got a role.

181
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,270
That's great. Congratulations.

182
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,420
But I don't want to do it.

183
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,570
What?

184
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,050
Why?

185
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,970
It's because of that incident, isn't it?

186
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,410
Jeong Si-woo?

187
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,010
What is the truth about that?

188
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,320
Was it really you...

189
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,470
Who hit him first?

190
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,160
Yes.

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,820
There must be a reason for that.

192
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,940
You're not the kind of person who would hit someone for no reason.

193
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,510
When I was filming "Striker",

194
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,810
he criticized my acting, saying it was tacky.

195
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,710
And he said my character was really bad.

196
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,610
Senior.

197
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,230
That movie "Striker".

198
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,310
I don't know if it was his tacky acting or the character itself,

199
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,330
anyway, the leading role was really bad.

200
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,990
Even if we try to rationalize it,

201
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,640
his acting is third-rate, and his mental state is still that of a child.

202
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,620
People like him

203
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,320
would feel happy even if they spent their whole lives as losers.

204
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,840
What's so good about that kind of plot? To think you wasted your money on the tickets...

205
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,530
You bastard!

206
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,680
But you still shouldn't have... Hit him.

207
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,350
You don't want to act?

208
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,360
No.

209
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,100
I also don't want to act anymore in the future.

210
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,510
What?

211
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,220
In the future?

212
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,800
I also made myself clear when I saw Mr. Seo today

213
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,760
that I don't want to be an actor anymore.

214
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,500
At first, I thought acting was fun.

215
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,260
But now, I'm not sure if it suits me anymore.

216
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,430
Ouch! Ouch!

217
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,920
Gosh.

218
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,790
Hey, it hurts!

219
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,170
You...

220
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,340
You once asked me how I overcame my low points.

221
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,140
Actually, I haven't got through it yet.

222
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,550
But...

223
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,050
Because of you,

224
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,310
I can still hold on.

225
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,410
Do you know why?

226
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,510
It's because I'm your fan.

227
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,990
Even if the game didn't go well and I wanted to die one day,

228
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,830
just because I'm someone's fan,

229
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,880
I'd think there's still a small spot in the world that belongs to me.

230
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,960
You told me before that I needed to achieve victory.

231
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,310
Is quitting acting the real victory you want?

232
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,480
Be honest with me.

233
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,330
Do you want to get back into acting?

234
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,440
Even if it's for your fans, please start your acting career over.

235
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,960
No.

236
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,760
Even if it's for me,

237
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,960
please start it over.

238
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,770
Bad news!

239
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,850
Ji-woo... Ji-woo, he...

240
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,310
What happened? What's with the shouting?

241
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,030
What happened to Ji-woo?

242
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,380
Look at this.

243
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,770
(Jeong Si-woo, a model and actor, revealed bullying in FC Forworld.
Jeong Si-woo said, "When I joined FC Forworld, I was bullied by Do Ji-woo at that time.
Kim Do-hyung continued to expose FC TA's affairs, saying that at that time, "Do Ji-woo assaulted his juniors and showed no respect for his seniors. It was unbearable.
"Do Ji-woo kept assaulting his juniors in the name of instructing them.")

244
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,250

246

How could Ji-woo possibly have done such a thing?

247
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,900
No wonder

248
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,230
when Jeong Si-woo showed up, I noticed something was off.

249
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,150
His target isn't Yoo Kang-jae,

250
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,780
but Do Ji-woo.

251
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,080
Call Ji-woo right now.

252
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,150
Okay.

253
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,900
That bastard Yoo Kang-jae. Where did he bring this kind of scum from?

254
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,270
Where are you?

255
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,030
Did you see the news?

256
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,550
Just stay home and don't come out.

257
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,280
If the reporters find out, things will get out of hand.

258
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,890
What do you plan to do?

259
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,950
The news is not true. Just deny it.

260
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,800
Jeong Si-woo isn't someone to be trifled with.

261
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,440
He must have been fully prepared to refute us.

262
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,020
Besides...

263
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,410
This is my problem. I'll take care of it.

264
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,170
Do you trust me?

265
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,560
Yes.

266
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
Be careful.

267
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:10,810
(Jeong Si-woo)

268
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,630
Pulling the vanishing act, huh?
(Jeong Si-woo)

269
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,319
Pulling the vanishing act, huh?

270
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,240
You'll be dead if I catch you. Darn it.

271
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,500
Gosh.

272
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,110
I should've taken care of you first.

273
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,130
You startled me.

274
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,470
What are you doing here so late?

275
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,840
You punk.

276
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,550
Tell me, what should Ji-woo do now?

277
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,310
Where did you bring back such a scum? You messed up the whole team.

278
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,530
You seduced the guy who only cared about soccer. Calling him your old classmate,

279
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,720
yet you're trying to make him give up his career as a soccer player?

280
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,430
When did I seduce him?

281
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,990
Darn it.

282
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660
Yes.

283
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,760
I did seduce him. Satisfied?

284
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,500
What do you mean satisfied?

285
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,110
You know Ji-woo and I are close, don't you?

286
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,810
To save our team in trouble, we...

287
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,220
I also came here to save this team.

288
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,450
I even gave up being an actor.

289
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,470
What did you give up?

290
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,780
They didn't even ask you to play Crony No. 3.

291
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,950
You barely made it into the team.

292
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,380
It wasn't Crony No. 3, but Crony No. 1, okay? Darn it.

293
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,110
Whether it was Crony No. 3 or Crony No. 1,

294
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,660
if you want to live, bring everything back to normal,

295
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,430
and bring Ji-woo back to the soccer field.

296
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,180
Ji-woo...

297
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,670
If he can't play soccer, he won't be able to live.

298
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,820
Mr. Seo, promise me one thing,

299
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,690
and I'll agree to be an actor.

300
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:20,960
(Remember to eat!!! Are you tired?
I'm okay! I miss you so much.)

301
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,730
(Me too.)

302
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,170
Why are you here?

303
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,590
Brother.

304
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,070
I asked, what are you doing here?

305
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,400
Let's talk.

306
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,130
Then let's talk here.

307
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,260
Even if someone takes the photo of us being together

308
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,030
and makes a thing out of this, it won't have anything to do with me.

309
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,050
Sure. It won't be your business.

310
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,500
Are you feeling better now?

311
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,840
Yes, I feel good.

312
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,330
It seems you don't think you can beat me with soccer,

313
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,240
and you have no pride. You just do whatever Jeong Si-woo tells you to do.

314
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,950
I just borrowed his name, that's all.

315
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,760
Because I felt bitter about you and that tall guy.

316
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,290
I didn't expect things to get so out of hand, okay?

317
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,510
Anyway,

318
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,490
if that's why you're here, I have nothing to say.

319
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,240
I can also take this opportunity to experience what it's like to be a celebrity.

320
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,790
You were also used by him.

321
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,510
The moment we were dragged in,

322
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,350
from the past to now,
all our teammates were and will continue to be the talk of the town,

323
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,220
and it will come back to you.

324
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,580
Everyone will get hurt because of this.

325
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,910
That's...

326
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,570
Why I can't forgive him.

327
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,420
What the hell?

328
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,900
He just replied "Me too" and nothing else.

329
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,880
That's not right...

330
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
He should have asked me "What did you do today",

331
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,450
or "What are you doing?", things like that.

332
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,990
Come on.

333
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,580
(I... I'm the youngest staff who was there at the scene. Let's meet.)

334
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,680
Senior.

335
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,340
We're in the same company.

336
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,020
It's nice that we can meet like this.

337
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,160
Since we can meet like this, why didn't you answer my calls?

338
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,750
Is that so?

339
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,830
What is this about?

340
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,130
You... Do you know her name?

341
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,680
She's the youngest staff who said she saw us

342
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,820
at the scene the day I hit you.

343
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,670
Wasn't she your fan?

344
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,310
Have you forgotten?

345
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,860
I heard that...

346
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,850
After you learned she's your fan,

347
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,690
you ignored, humiliated, and threatened her even more.

348
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,250
You're a terrible human being.

349
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,900
What are you talking about?

350
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,850
(Recent Calls

This is her name.

353
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,990
You better remember it.

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,950
Why should I?

355
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,490
Because she once gave you abundant love,

356
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,840
and she'll be the one who defeats you.

357
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,990
Read the news, Junior.

358
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,620
You're too slow in updating your information.

359
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:30,150
(About the Yoo Kang-jae and Jeong Si-woo incident, the staff at the scene who knows the truth spoke up.
The situation has changed because of the statements of the staff at the scene. It's understood that as Do Ji-woo's fan, on that incident, Lee XXX...

360
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,200
Oh, right.

361
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,800
I once asked her why she liked someone like you.

362
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,100
She said you were actually not that kind of person,

363
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,200
and that you had a hard time due to your conflict with the company.

364
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,900
That's how she replied.

365
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,880
You'd better not toy with your fans who love you.

366
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,190
You'll go to hell.

367
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,390
Also,

368
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,340
don't mess with Do Ji-woo.

369
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,390
Get back to work.

Ji-woo!

374
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,390
What?

375
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,160
Kang-jae.

376

What?

377
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,480
What?

378
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,040
Why are you calling their names again?

379
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,780
Ji-woo and Kang-jae...

380
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,350
-They've sold out.
-They've sold out.

381
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,940
-Us?
-Us?

382
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,560
Really?

383
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,110
-Oh, my.
-Oh, my.

385
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,680
It's sold out!

386
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,260
Didn't you say you wanted to hang out?

387
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,730
We're hanging out now.

388
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,490
What do you usually do when you hang out?

389
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,110
Exercise.

390
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,720
So annoying.

391
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,040
Try it first.

392
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,810
I'm good at mixing soju and beer.

393
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,960
See? You finished it in one gulp.

394
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,410
It's delicious.

395
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,480
Open your mouth.

396
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,790
What?

397
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,770
Flirting.

398
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,330
(Have a beer on a day like this)

399
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,250
We should go home.

400
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm drunk.

401
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
Tell me your address.

402
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,240
I wasn't talking about going back to my place,

403
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,010
but yours.

404
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,580
-My place?
-Yes.

405
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,590
What's this supposed to mean?

406
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,590
Flirting.

(FFF CEO, Kim Dae-soo)

408
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,850
You don't look very happy.

409
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,020
Well... It's not an upgrade.

410
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,320
It's just the merchandise was sold out.

411
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,040
Anyway, I managed to prove a bit of my blueprint to everyone.

412
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,690
You can't find another club

413
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,240
that can achieve such results in the off-season.

414
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,490
Alright then. Player Do Ji-woo.

415
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,140
What's your request?

416
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,540
Please bring back all the players you fired.

417
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,240
I remember telling you before

418
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,020
why I fired those players.

419
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,120
Looks don't mean everything.

420
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,130
Those players either harmed team cooperation

421
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,280
or caused bad rumors among fans.

422
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,650
Still...

423
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,090
Please give them another chance.

424
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,290
They might have reflected on their actions.

425
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,400
Okay.

426
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,860
I'll try to lower the standard.

427
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,020
But...

428
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,730
I can't guarantee that all of them will be brought back.

429
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,410
After all, I need to maintain FC Forworld's marketability.

430
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,040
You may leave now.

432
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,190
Excuse me...

433
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,700
Kang-jae...

434
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,480
What was Yoo Kang-jae's request?

435
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,080
I won't give up being an actor.

436
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,570
But...

437
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,420
But?

438
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,700
I'll continue playing football.

439
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,280
Got it.

440
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,480
So when the movie starts shooting...

441
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,830
Right.

442
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,910
So, please keep my back number.

443
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,250
Also...

444
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,190
The locker next to Do Ji-woo's will always belong to Yoo Kang-jae.

The locker next to Do Ji-woo's will always belong to Yoo Kang-jae.

How do you feel about the first match of the new season?

450

Since these are the sneakers that bring me good luck,

451
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,060
I'm sure I'll win.

And...

What's your reply to Yoo Kang-jae's confession of love?

Didn't you know?

456
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,190

Hey.

460
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,270
I said we shouldn't meet for now.

461
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,730
I'll interfere with your filming.

00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,490
But I missed you. What should I do?

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,390
Also,

464
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,030
I want to return you a pair of sneakers.

465
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,670
I... Found it.

466
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,030
It's exactly the same.

467
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,290
Is the shoe size right?

468
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,300
Yes.
