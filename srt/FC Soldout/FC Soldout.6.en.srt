1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,160
Hey, Do Ji-woo.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,640
Do-hyung.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,220
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,890
I'm here for a field training.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,770
I just happened to contact Min-soo

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,870
and learned that you're doing really well.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,260
I'm sorry

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,690
for not being in touch with you.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,310
It's just I've been really busy lately...

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,860
Wow, you look absolutely great.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,510
Do-hyung...

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,760
I knew it.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,440
You said you'd try to trust us and make an effort.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,990
I was such a fool for having believed you.

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,810
You found it pretty good after giving it a try, right?

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,340
That company is really rich. They've long forgotten about us.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,720
No, it's not like that.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,740
We're still trying our best now.

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,390
Forget it. It's all in the past.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,730
I received an offer from another team.

21
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,230
I'm here to train with that new team.

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,600
Good for you.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,030
What do you mean "good for you"?

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,069
You're the one who's doing better here, okay?

25
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,540
What?

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,250
Since you hit rock bottom,

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,340
I've been the one starting in matches,

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,460
and I've been the one in the spotlight.

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,039
Now that I'm gone, you must be really happy, right?

30
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,090
Do-hyung.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,160
Have you always considered me as this kind of person?

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,760
-Come on, be honest with me, Ji-woo.
-Do-hyung!

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,980
Darn it.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,370
Oh?

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,590
You look familiar.

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,759
I remember you, you rude guy.

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,460
You know me?

38
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,720
Do you want my autograph?

39
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,610
It's all your fault, you self-righteous people.

40
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,590
He still has things to say to his former teammate here who got fired.

41
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,940
So please step aside.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,820
Oh, I see.

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,260
But here's the thing.

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,770
I'm his current teammate.

45
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,740
Besides, he's not a colleague of the former FC TA anymore.

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,390
He's my roommate and the striker of FC Forworld.

47
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,860
He's now of high status and needs to go back early.

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,260
What are you waiting for?

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,870
Let's go, Ji-woo.

50
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,170
Why did you just stand there and listen to his nonsense?

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,100
It was out of courtesy to my former colleague.

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,370
Do-hyung... It must have been difficult for him, too.

53
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,940
You... You could have scored by yourself,

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,910
but you passed the ball to that guy, right?

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,490
You passed the ball to him, didn't you?

56
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,900
In front of the goal,

57
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,860
passing the ball to a teammate who has a better chance of scoring

58
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,570
is only natural.

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,300
What can I say to an AI like you?

60
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,700
Anyway...

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,680
The team's victory is my victory.

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,990
Is that what you want?

63
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,670
Yes.

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,730
What... What is this?

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,220
You just told me not to buy it.

66
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,880
Well, you said it was hard to get.

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,950
So we should buy it while we still can.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
By the way, what's that dream you sold me?

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,079
What?

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,980
I have a feeling that I only did that

71
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,100
because I spent unnecessary money on a weird dream.

72
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,680
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,250
Forget it.

74
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,280
You've got to overcome your low point.

75
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
You've got to do better than that guy.

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,260
I'll help you.

77
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,270
Why... Do you want to help me?

78
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,269
I don't know, either.

79
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,970
Well...

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,190
I'm just curious about the victory you want.

81
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,870
You...

82
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,530
Just play the game you usually play.

83
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,110
And...

84
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,700
You've got to win.

85
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,520
Got it?

86
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,760
What if...

87
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,650
I don't really know

88
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,220
what I want to do?

89
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,530
What if I'm confused now?

90
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,960
Think about it then.

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
Isn't that even better?

92
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,910
It's hard to find a time like this when you can be freely confused.

93
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,060
Come on.

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,110
(FC Soldout)

95
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,960
This is nice.

96
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,990
How was it?

97
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,310
Do you need to take another one?

98
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,580
No, it's great.

99
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,470
Just post this one.

100
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,200
Oh...

101
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,440
Wow, you're a celebrity now, aren't you, Do Ji-woo?

102
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,850
I'm working hard here, yet you're making fun of me.

103
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,610
Why? Do you feel threatened?

104
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,750
I mean you did well.

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,670
Good job. Try again.

106
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,420
Come here and let him take a photo of you, too.

107
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,920
Give it a try.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,500
You need to come here and demonstrate for me.

109
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,050
You want me to demonstrate?

110
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,190
Gosh.

111
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,890
It seems you're getting along really well.

112
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,080
Look.

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,310
The winter training was a wise decision, wasn't it?

114
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,710
Let's ride the momentum and win the upcoming warm-up match.

115
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,140
A warm-up match?

116
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,020
Guys.

117
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,880
This will be the historic first match for FC Forworld.

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,960
Although it's just a warm-up match,

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
think about how much they look down on us,

120
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,320
actually requesting to have a warm-up match with us.

121
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,580
Which team is it?

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,350
(Hamsan FC)

123
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,320
Wow, nice uniform.

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,880
Thank you.

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,520
You guys are so fair-skinned.

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,260
I heard you've been filming some videos like clowns and posting them on social media.

127
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,170
You must be really happy since

128
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,580
you found something that suits you instead of playing soccer.

129
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,770
If you're jealous of our new uniform, just say it.

130
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,880
Don't be sarcastic.

131
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,640
You should get a new uniform too.

132
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,940
It's easy to confuse your team's name with "Hotdog Soccer."

133
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,240
Did I ever say I wanted to wear that kind of uniform?

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,770
I heard it was you who suggested it. The warm-up match.

135
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,290
Yes, it was me.

136
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,790
It's perfect to have a relaxing warm-up match before the season starts.

137
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,130
This way, we can easily defeat a team with no strength

138
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,260
and also gain confidence.

139
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,110
Okay then.

140
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,340
Let's compete.

141
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,970
Fair and square.

142
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,540
You'd better be careful not to get hurt.

143
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:56,720

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,780
When I was still a die-hard soccer fan,
(What? Are you doing mukbang now?? Where is that supporter of TA~ The fried chicken looks really delicious LOL. When did this live stream become a mukbang? This suddenly became a mukbang live stream LOL. Make sure you enjoy it. Fried chicken is a mukbang classic. I'm so hungry. Are there any fans of TA here?

162
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,500
I would bring this fried chicken to the stadium every time.

Senior, please switch with Dong-hee.

202

It's just a warm-up match. You don't have to act tough.

203

Thank you then.

204
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,820

Don't worry too much.

There's grass.

212

Guys, let's start our counterattack!

213
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,860
Kyung-jae.

214
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,150
That guy. Darn it.

215
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,470
Kyung-jae!

216
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,560
Are you okay?

217
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,940
I'm okay.

218
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

219
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,730
What did I do?

220
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,390
I didn't expect you to be not only ignorant

221
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,390
but also such a terrible person.

222
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,070
Get out of my way, you little brat.

223
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,490
Little brat?

224
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,930
Let's have a contest then.

225
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,880
Brother, hold on.

226
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,800
Hold on. Control yourself.

227
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,090
So why don't you just keep doing what you used to do?

228
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,180
You've already messed up your main job. Why are you still thinking about playing soccer?

229
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,310
Is playing soccer funny to you guys?

230
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,600
Darn it.

231
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,500
You're the one who thinks it's funny.

232
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,730
"You"?

233
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,090
Did you just call me "you"?

234
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,770
Hey, Do Ji-woo. You've got some nerve.

235
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,790
You brat... Darn it.

236
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,870
Let go.

237
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,100
-Everyone!
-Let go!

238
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,450
You all, disperse.

239
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,640
Are you really okay?

240
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,800
What...

241
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,580
Yes.

242
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,510
There's grass.

243
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,630
I was actually looking forward to it.

244
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,210
But in the end, FC Forworld lost

245
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,280
to Hamsan FC with a score of 5-0.

246
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,990
After all, some of the players were artists before.

247
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,240
I think in terms of organization ability and individual ability,

248
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,810
(5-0 is a huge score difference. It's indeed improper to compete with celebrities. Isn't this the expected result? Anyway, I'm cheering for FC Forworld. It was a good game. I didn't expect it to be a battle between Do Ji-woo and Kim Do-hyung. But to put those two teams against each other...)

although Hamsan FC scored more goals,

252
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,150

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,660
Am I the only one who thinks so?
(5-0 is a huge score difference. It's indeed improper to compete with celebrities. Isn't this the expected result? Anyway, I'm cheering for FC Forworld. It was a good game. I didn't expect it to be a battle between Do Ji-woo and Kim Do-hyung. But to put those two teams against each other... The appearance LOL. Wow, this is a humiliation for Hamsan FC. They won with his looks. Why are they all so good-looking? It's annoying. LOL)

255
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,760

256
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,300
Darn it.

257
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,710
Those clowns.

258
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,680
Do-hyung!

259
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,340
What?

260
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,570
You want to punch me?

261
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,820
Are you going to show your true colors

262
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,640
now that you're in another team?

263
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,030
Before you hit someone, you should first see who he is.

264
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,380
You should be grateful Kyung-jae didn't get injured.

265
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,590
Are you his lover or something?

266
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,800
Why are you here making a scene?

267
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I...

268
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,170
I really respect you as a player.

269
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,010
I also gave you the chance to score multiple times.

270
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,210
But...

271
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,780
I never...

272
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,860
Liked you as a human.

273
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,810
What?

274
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,180
On the last day before,

275
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,650
I went to ask Mr. Kim

276
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,250
what he meant by "real commodity nature."

277
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,180
(CEO of FFF Entertainment, Kim Dae-soo)

278
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,060
Commodity nature?
(CEO of FFF Entertainment, Kim Dae-soo)

279
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,950
Yes, commodity nature.
(CEO of FFF Entertainment, Kim Dae-soo)

280
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,380
Why did you say I have commodity nature in me,

281
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,510
and Do-hyung doesn't?

282
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,160
Do you want to know?

283
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,990
Yes.

284
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,090
Kim Do-hyung

285
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,670
gets in conflict with fans a lot.

286
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,930
Although the team has been losing the whole time,

287
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,890
the fans even followed them to away games to cheer them on.

288
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,690
However, not to mention apologies,

289
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,110
just because he was laughed at a few times, he even deliberately ran to the audience

290
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,040
and insulted them.

291
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,830
Do you know that he's been reselling the gifts from his fans online?

292
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,580
What?

293
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,950
He's also had several financial transactions with several fans.

294
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,840
No... No way.

295
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,110
That's true.

296
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,440
Before I took over this team,

297
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,470
I had already received the relevant report from the inspection office.

298
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,250
So even if I hadn't taken over,

299
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,060
Kim Do-hyung would still have been fired.

300
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,820
This is the so-called commodity nature.

301
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,210
Because a commodity needs to stay clean.

302
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,760
Nonsense.

303
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,510
Then just keep going like this.

304
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,730
Based on your performance today, even though you went to another team, you haven't made any progress.

305
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,040
I...

306
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,300
I plan to beat you.

307
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,160
And I will.

308
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,070
You advised me to take care of my health,

309
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,770
but your own health is in such a terrible state.

310
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,610
Are you that worried about me?

311
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,530
You said all players in the team are one.

312
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,760
You're our captain and team leader,

313
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,270
yet you got injured.

314
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,900
It seems we're doomed to lose.

315
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,130
How are you going to play soccer in the future with your knee like that?

316
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,840
I'll do my best, and then retire.

317
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,050
To be honest,

318
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,850
when FC TA was sold,

319
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,260
I also considered this matter seriously.

320
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,520
Hey.

321
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,020
Have you ever seen someone whose life ended along with their match?

322
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,349
Did you think that your life was over just because you quit the boy group?

323
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,589
Life goes on.

324
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,790
Yes.

325
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,349
In the field of soccer, there are not only players,

326
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,950
but also coaches.

327
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,060
As long as you don't give up, life will continue.

328
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,960
Something like that.

329
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,750
And I even met such a lovely little brother like you.

330
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,160
(Their story will surely bring you to tears
Striker - They won't give up!)

331
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,360
Don't smile.

332
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,260
It's all your fault. You made my heart race.

333
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,110
(He's not going to quit being an actor for soccer, is he? No matter what he does, it's good enough that we can still see him. I don't know soccer, so I don't understand what you're talking about.)

334
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:29,960
(I decided to believe in Kyung-jae no matter what he does. We should cheer for soccer player Kyung-jae too...)

335
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,890
(Their story will surely bring you to tears
Striker - They won't give up!)

336
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,240
Roommate.
(Their story will surely bring you to tears
Striker - They won't give up!)

337
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,570
Roommate.

338
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,450
I used to have a roommate, but now I don't. I feel really empty.

339
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,270
What are you doing?

340
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,770
There's grass.

341
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,180
Right.

342
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,730
A dream is just a dream. Reality is what is real.

343
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,420
Do Ji-woo.

344
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,450

Do you need my help?

I'm stretching. What help can I possibly need?

368
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,390
You... Be my comfort doll.

369
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,780
What?

370
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,100
You don't like it?

371
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,260
What's that?

372
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,770
I don't know. I just heard there's something like that.

373
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,400
It's just...

374
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,000
It's cold. Let me hug you for a while.

375
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,610
How warm.

376
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,460
No...

377
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,590
What are you doing? Let go...

378
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,360
I still think

379
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,810
it's time to admit it.

380
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,730
What are you doing?

381
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,950
Lee Sun-bin.

382
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,580
How did you seduce people before?

383
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,080
What?

384
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,260
How did you seduce the members of your group

385
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,990
back when you were an idol?

386
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,400
What do you mean seduce? Everyone does that.

387
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
So how have you been seducing people so far?

388
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,200
Good question.

389
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,550
Oh, right.

390
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,240
Well...

391
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,650
As long as I ask them to date me, they'd say yes.

392
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,330
Without hesitation?

393
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,410
You wouldn't say something like that to them right after meeting, right?

394
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,060
Of course not.

395
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,430
I only say that after about an hour of meeting.

396
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,270
Huh? So infuriating.

397
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,530
So as long as you say it, they'd say yes, right?

398
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,430
Well... Most of them.

399
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,920
But

400
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,720
this time, if I speak out, I might get directly rejected.

401
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,240
Who are you trying to seduce?

402
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,120
Do Ji-woo.

403
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,730
I knew it.

404
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,890
What?

405
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,060
How did you know?

406
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,230
I told you. I'm a huge fan of dating shows.

407
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,540
Forget it.

408
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,790
If you don't want to help, I'm leaving.

409
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,920
Flirting.

410
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,600
Flirting?

411
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,020
Do you have something...

412
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,600
To say to me?

413
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,170
What?

414
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,530
No.

415
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,000
Have a good day today.

416
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,720
Okay.

417
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,610
Okay.

418
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,610
You too.

419
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,620
Darn it. I shouldn't have said that, right?

420
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,730
Good.

421
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,760
I didn't know you love perilla leaves so much.

422
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,840
No, you eat it.

423
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,940
No, you eat it.

424
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,630
No, you eat it.

425
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,400
No, I said you eat it.

426
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,060
No, you eat it.

427
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,330
No, you eat it.

428
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,780
No, it's not that I want to eat it...

429
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,710
Are you... Feeling unwell?

430
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,610
Seeing him become so kind, it seems his time is up.

431
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,000
What did you just say?

432
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,910
I'm such a fool for having believed that.

433
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,460
Things like "flirting with front teeth" and "flirting with perilla leaves."

434
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,510
I guess you've never really tried to seduce anyone before.

435
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,210
How could you just copy everything you heard?

436
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,180
What should I do now?

437
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,720
Don't you see how Do Ji-woo treats me as a madman now?

438
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,290
Seriously...

439
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,960
I messed up.

440
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,590
Why should you feel frustrated over such a trivial matter?

441
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,890
Did Ji-woo talk about his ideal type before?

442
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,680
Like who he thinks is cool or handsome?

443
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,790
His ideal type?

444
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,600
Yes. That handsome guy was in a suit for that commercial.

445
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,820
Handsome guy?

446
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,050
I've also worn a suit before.

447
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,520
Darn it.

448
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
So he did talk about it.

449
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,590
You're finally back.

450
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,510
Are you going somewhere?

451
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,520
To a wedding.

452
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,140
On a weekday?

453
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,840
Well...

454
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,060
You may not know,

455
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,980
but that's how the entertainment industry is.

456
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,610
They get married on weekdays, too.

457
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,980
Is there a hall nearby?

458
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,650
By the way,

459
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,580
I left my wallet in the locker room.

460
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,920
I need to give them cash as a wedding gift.

461
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,740
-Anyway, I'm leaving.
-Hey, Ryu Kyung-jae.

462
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,960
You look good in this.

463
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,200
I mean you're handsome.

464
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,350
I know.

465
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,590
What am I doing?

466
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,640
Why don't I just... Confess my love to him?

467
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,460
(Beverage)

468
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,510
Ji-woo.

469
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,320
It's quite cold.

470
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,150
Let's go back.

471
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,600
-You're back already?
-What?

472
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,810
Yes.

473
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,110
I headed back right after giving them the gift money.

474
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,490
Here.

475
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,480
The store in front of the auditorium had a lot of these in stock.

476
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,800
I bought them all.

477
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,490
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

478
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,080
Is it because, as you said before,

479
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,300
you want to lend a hand in my victory?

480
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,780
That's also true.

481
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,000
Anyway, have you thought about it?

482
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,960
What exactly do you want?

483
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,570
Yes. I want to win.

484
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,300
Whether it's playing soccer or selling out merchandise,

485
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,970
I'll do anything I can.

486
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:48,970
And I'll confidently make a request to Mr. Kim

487
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,450
to protect our team.

488
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,980
I don't want him to fire the current players or replace them,

489
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,800
but rather to promise that those who want to return can rejoin the team,

490
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,410
and also to have him protect our home ground.

491
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,300
Quite heroic.

492
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,990
By the way,

493
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,970
there's something I'm curious about.

494
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,680
Back in high school,

495
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,730
I once used the umbrella you left behind.

496
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,600
Do you remember?

497
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,030
Umbrella...

498
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,480
I guess you don't remember.

499
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,500
-I do...
-Long time no see, Senior.

500
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,290
What... What are you doing here?

501
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,380
By the way,

502
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,250
I'll join FC Forworld as of today.

503
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,760
May I ask where the locker room is?

504
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:25,500
(FC Soldout)
