00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,160
Hey, Do Ji-woo.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,640
Do-hyung.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,220
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,890
I'm here for a field training.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,770
I just happened to contact Min-soo

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,870
and learned that you're doing really well.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,260
I'm sorry

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,690
for not being in touch with you.

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,310
It's just I've been really busy lately...

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,860
Wow, you look absolutely great.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,510
Do-hyung...

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,760
I knew it.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,440
You said you'd try to trust us and make an effort.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,990
I was such a fool for having believed you.

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,810
You found it pretty good after giving it a try, right?

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,340
That company is really rich. They've long forgotten about us.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,720
No, it's not like that.

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,740
We're still trying our best now.

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,390
Forget it. It's all in the past.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,730
I received an offer from another team.

21
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,230
I'm here to train with that new team.

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,600
Good for you.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,030
What do you mean "good for you"?

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,069
You're the one who's doing better here, okay?

25
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,540
What?

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,250
Since you hit rock bottom,

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,340
I've been the one starting in matches,

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,460
and I've been the one in the spotlight.

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,039
Now that I'm gone, you must be really happy, right?

30
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,090
Do-hyung.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,160
Have you always considered me as this kind of person?

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,760
-Come on, be honest with me, Ji-woo.
-Do-hyung!

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,980
Darn it.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,370
Oh?

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,590
You look familiar.

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,759
I remember you, you rude guy.

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,460
You know me?

38
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,720
Do you want my autograph?

39
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,610
It's all your fault, you self-righteous people.

40
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,590
He still has things to say to his former teammate here who got fired.

41
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,940
So please step aside.

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,820
Oh, I see.

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,260
But here's the thing.

44
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,770
I'm his current teammate.

45
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,740
Besides, he's not a colleague of the former FC TA anymore.

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,390
He's my roommate and the striker of FC Forworld.

47
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,860
He's now of high status and needs to go back early.

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,260
What are you waiting for?

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,870
Let's go, Ji-woo.

50
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,170
Why did you just stand there and listen to his nonsense?

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,100
It was out of courtesy to my former colleague.

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,370
Do-hyung... It must have been difficult for him, too.

53
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,940
You... You could have scored by yourself,

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,910
but you passed the ball to that guy, right?

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,490
You passed the ball to him, didn't you?

56
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,900
In front of the goal,

57
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,860
passing the ball to a teammate who has a better chance of scoring

58
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,570
is only natural.

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,300
What can I say to an AI like you?

60
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,700
Anyway...

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,680
The team's victory is my victory.

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,990
Is that what you want?

63
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,670
Yes.

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,730
What... What is this?

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,220
You just told me not to buy it.

66
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,880
Well, you said it was hard to get.

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,950
So we should buy it while we still can.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
By the way, what's that dream you sold me?

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,079
What?

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,980
I have a feeling that I only did that

71
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,100
because I spent unnecessary money on a weird dream.

72
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,680
What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,250
Forget it.

74
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,280
You've got to overcome your low point.

75
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
You've got to do better than that guy.

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,260
I'll help you.

77
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,270
Why... Do you want to help me?

78
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,269
I don't know, either.

79
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,970
Well...

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,190
I'm just curious about the victory you want.

81
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,870
You...

82
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,530
Just play the game you usually play.

83
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,110
And...

84
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,700
You've got to win.

85
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,520
Got it?

86
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,760
What if...

87
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,650
I don't really know

88
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,220
what I want to do?

89
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,530
What if I'm confused now?

90
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,960
Think about it then.

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
Isn't that even better?

92
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,910
It's hard to find a time like this when you can be freely confused.

93
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,060
Come on.

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,110
[FC Soldout]

95
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,960
This is nice.

96
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,990
How was it?

97
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,310
Do you need to take another one?

98
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,580
No, it's great.

99
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,470
Just post this one.

100
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,200
Oh...

101
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,440
Wow, you're a celebrity now, aren't you, Do Ji-woo?

102
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,850
I'm working hard here, yet you're making fun of me.

103
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,610
Why? Do you feel threatened?

104
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,750
I mean you did well.

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,670
Good job. Try again.

106
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,420
Come here and let him take a photo of you, too.

107
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,920
Give it a try.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,500
You need to come here and demonstrate for me.

109
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,050
You want me to demonstrate?

110
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,190
Gosh.

111
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,890
It seems you're getting along really well.

112
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,080
Look.

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,310
The winter training was a wise decision, wasn't it?

114
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,710
Let's ride the momentum and win the upcoming warm-up match.

115
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,140
A warm-up match?

116
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,020
Guys.

117
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,880
This will be the historic first match for FC Forworld.

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,960
Although it's just a warm-up match,

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
think about how much they look down on us,

120
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,320
actually requesting to have a warm-up match with us.

121
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,580
Which team is it?

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,350
[Hamsan FC]

123
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,320
Wow, nice uniform.

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,880
Thank you.

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,520
You guys are so fair-skinned.

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,260
I heard you've been filming some videos like clowns and posting them on social media.

127
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,170
You must be really happy since

128
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,580
you found something that suits you instead of playing soccer.

129
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,770
If you're jealous of our new uniform, just say it.

130
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,880
Don't be sarcastic.

131
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,640
You should get a new uniform too.

132
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,940
It's easy to confuse your team's name with "Hotdog Soccer."

133
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,240
Did I ever say I wanted to wear that kind of uniform?

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,770
I heard it was you who suggested it. The warm-up match.

135
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,290
Yes, it was me.

136
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,790
It's perfect to have a relaxing warm-up match before the season starts.

137
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,130
This way, we can easily defeat a team with no strength

138
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,260
and also gain confidence.

139
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,110
Okay then.

140
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,340
Let's compete.

141
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,970
Fair and square.

142
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,540
You'd better be careful not to get hurt.

155
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,630
What do you mean commercial?

156
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,440
There's no commercial in my live stream.

157
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,380
You need to get the commercial first before you can promote it, right?

158
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,840
I bought this with my own money.

159
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,090
Let me tell you some anecdotes about this fried chicken.

160
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,780
When I was still a die-hard soccer fan,

161
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,360
I would bring this fried chicken to the stadium every time.

162

Speaking of the time when I was still a die-hard soccer fan,

164
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,150
it reminds me of the past FC TA. You know that, right?

Who made you do this fried chicken commercial? What brand is this fried chicken? The decoration has completely changed. That's funny. Huh? Isn't this supposed to be a soccer live stream? Are the soccer fans still here? No, I'm here to watch soccer~~]

171
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,950
What a shame.

173
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,890
If I had become a mukbang live streamer earlier,

174
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,620
I could've communicated with you like this. How nice.

175
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,780

176
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,190
Let's start eating then.

What?

180
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,310
[TA Forever has donated!

181
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,390
You mean FC Forworld?

182
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,380
If not, I'll block you.

TA Forever has donated 10,000 won. Players who left FC TA are having a match with those who chose to stay in the team!! Are you serious? That FC Forworld? It's live streaming on the renamed YouTube channel. Gosh, TA's supporters, are you going to do nothing? Saying mukbang is the best, if you don't want to eat, give it to me! Once a TA supporter, always a TA supporter. I believe in you~ From fried chicken to soccer, are you changing your content again? Haha, I'm really curious]

184
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,080

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Do Ji-woo is having a match against Kim Do-hyung? Is that true?

188
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,980
Those two players used to be in the same team. They were even in the same position.

189
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,110
[From chicken to football] Are you going to change your direction? I'm curious to know if they don't want to eat fried chicken, Then give it to me! Once they become TA supporters, They always support TA. I trust you. From chicken to soccer. Are you going to change your direction? I'm really curious. But Do Ji-woo versus Kim Do-hyung? They're really against each other. Do Ji-woo and Kim Do-hyung aren't very close, right? They were almost rivals. Compared to Kim Do-hyung, Do Ji-woo was better? Which team is Kim Do-hyung meeting? Ji-woo. Let's go!

190
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,020
They are currently playing for their respective teams.

191
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,370
And they're playing against each other now, you say?

192
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,800
My goodness!

193
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,190
What's wrong?

194
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,110
Nothing. I'm okay.

195
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,290
I'm really okay.

196
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,900
You don't seem to be okay.

197
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,290
It's his knees, right?

198
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,270
Senior, please switch with Dong-hee.

199
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,930
It's just a warm-up match. You don't have to act tough.

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,410
Thank you then.

201
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,820
It has been acting up quite often since he got injured a year ago.

202
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,960
Don't worry too much.

203
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,590
He knows his own condition the best.

204
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,600
Let's focus on the game.

205
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,900
You have grass on your head.

206
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,330
Here too.

207
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,120
What are you doing?

208
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,970
There's grass.

209
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,270
Guys, let's start our counterattack!

210
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,860
Kyung-jae.

211
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,150
That guy. Darn it.

212
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,470
Kyung-jae!

213
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,560
Are you okay?

214
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,940
I'm okay.

215
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

216
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,730
What did I do?

217
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,390
I didn't expect you to be not only ignorant

218
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,390
but also such a terrible person.

219
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,070
Get out of my way, you little brat.

220
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,490
Little brat?

221
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,930
Let's have a contest then.

222
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:19,880
Brother, hold on.

223
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,800
Hold on. Control yourself.

224
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,090
So why don't you just keep doing what you used to do?

225
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,180
You've already messed up your main job. Why are you still thinking about playing soccer?

226
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,310
Is playing soccer funny to you guys?

227
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,600
Darn it.

228
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,500
You're the one who thinks it's funny.

229
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,730
"You"?

230
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,090
Did you just call me "you"?

231
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,770
Hey, Do Ji-woo. You've got some nerve.

232
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,790
You brat... Darn it.

233
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,870
Let go.

234
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,100
-Everyone!
-Let go!

235
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,450
You all, disperse.

236
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,640
Are you really okay?

237
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,800
What...

238
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,580
Yes.

239
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,510
There's grass.

240
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,630
I was actually looking forward to it.

241
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,210
But in the end, FC Forworld lost

242
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,280
to Hamsan FC with a score of 5-0.

243
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,990
After all, some of the players were artists before.

244
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,810
I think in terms of organization ability and individual ability,

245
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,610
[5-0 is a huge score difference. It's indeed improper to compete with celebrities. Isn't this the expected result? Anyway, I'm cheering for FC Forworld. It was a good game. I didn't expect it to be a battle between Do Ji-woo and Kim Do-hyung. But to put those two teams against each other...]

246
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,840
they're clearly behind Hamsan FC.

247
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,270
That being said,

248
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,080
although Hamsan FC scored more goals,

249
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,060
I think they lost this match.

250
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,760
[5-0 is a huge score difference. It's indeed improper to compete with celebrities. Isn't this the expected result? Anyway, I'm cheering for FC Forworld. It was a good game. I didn't expect it to be a battle between Do Ji-woo and Kim Do-hyung. But to put those two teams against each other... The appearance LOL. Wow, this is a humiliation for Hamsan FC. They won with his looks. Why are they all so good-looking? It's annoying. LOL]

251
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,660
Am I the only one who thinks so?

252
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,300
Darn it.

253
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,710
Those clowns.

254
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,680
Do-hyung!

255
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,340
What?

256
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,570
You want to punch me?

257
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,820
Are you going to show your true colors

258
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,640
now that you're in another team?

259
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,030
Before you hit someone, you should first see who he is.

260
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,380
You should be grateful Kyung-jae didn't get injured.

261
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,590
Are you his lover or something?

262
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,800
Why are you here making a scene?

263
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I...

264
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,170
I really respect you as a player.

265
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,010
I also gave you the chance to score multiple times.

266
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,210
But...

267
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,780
I never...

268
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,860
Liked you as a human.

269
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,810
What?

270
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,180
On the last day before,

271
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,650
I went to ask Mr. Kim

272
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,250
what he meant by "real commodity nature."

273
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:03,770
[CEO of FFF Entertainment, Kim Dae-soo]

274
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,060
Commodity nature?

275
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,950
Yes, commodity nature.

276
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,380
Why did you say I have commodity nature in me,

277
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,510
and Do-hyung doesn't?

278
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,160
Do you want to know?

279
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,990
Yes.

280
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,090
Kim Do-hyung

281
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,670
gets in conflict with fans a lot.

282
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,930
Although the team has been losing the whole time,

283
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,890
the fans even followed them to away games to cheer them on.

284
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,690
However, not to mention apologies,

285
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,110
just because he was laughed at a few times, he even deliberately ran to the audience

286
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,040
and insulted them.

287
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,830
Do you know that he's been reselling the gifts from his fans online?

288
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,580
What?

289
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,950
He's also had several financial transactions with several fans.

290
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,840
No... No way.

291
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,110
That's true.

292
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,440
Before I took over this team,

293
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,470
I had already received the relevant report from the inspection office.

294
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,250
So even if I hadn't taken over,

295
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,060
Kim Do-hyung would still have been fired.

296
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,820
This is the so-called commodity nature.

297
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,210
Because a commodity needs to stay clean.

298
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,760
Nonsense.

299
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,510
Then just keep going like this.

300
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,730
Based on your performance today, even though you went to another team, you haven't made any progress.

301
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,040
I...

302
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,300
I plan to beat you.

303
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,160
And I will.

304
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,070
You advised me to take care of my health,

305
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,770
but your own health is in such a terrible state.

306
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,610
Are you that worried about me?

307
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,530
You said all players in the team are one.

308
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,760
You're our captain and team leader,

309
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,270
yet you got injured.

310
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,900
It seems we're doomed to lose.

311
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,130
How are you going to play soccer in the future with your knee like that?

312
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,840
I'll do my best, and then retire.

313
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,050
To be honest,

314
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,850
when FC TA was sold,

315
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,260
I also considered this matter seriously.

316
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,520
Hey.

317
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,020
Have you ever seen someone whose life ended along with their match?

318
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,349
Did you think that your life was over just because you quit the boy group?

319
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,589
Life goes on.

320
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,790
Yes.

321
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,349
In the field of soccer, there are not only players,

322
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,950
but also coaches.

323
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,060
As long as you don't give up, life will continue.

324
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,960
Something like that.

No, you eat it.

418
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,780
No, it's not that I want to eat it...

Why should you feel frustrated over such a trivial matter?

431
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,890
