00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,030
That's him.

179
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,570
Am I a bit more handsome?

180
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah.

181
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,280
You are definitely more handsome, senior.

182
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,260
-Take it easy, our Ji-woo.
-Yes.

Today, we're doing a special live broadcast for fans.

184
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
A live broadcast?

185
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,180
Aside from football, this is a first.

186
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,240
Waiting for something, curious and interested in
the little moments of daily life.

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,430
Still, I'm not his fan.

188
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,210
Definitely… not a fan.

Letters of apology and silence.

194
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,940

195
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,430
How is that possible?

Come in.

197
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,230
The locker room is so cozy. Hello, subscribers.

198
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,230
Player Do Ji-woo.

199
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,330
What?

200
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,740
I'm your fan.

201
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,370
Do you know me?

202
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,720
I've seen your matches.

Let's get along.

204
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,200
Actually, I'm a fan of yours too...

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,630
-Ji-woo.
-Bro.

206
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,720
The atmosphere is a little strange, huh?

207
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,410
Hey, do you have something to say?

208
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,110
Did you know each other before?

209
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,800
No.

210
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,100
We didn't.

211
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,490
I see.

212
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,180
Well, a little tension isn't a bad thing in any case.

213
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,590
Alright.

214
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,300
This is Mr. Seo, the person I trust most at FFF Entertainment.

215
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,020
He'll serve as the interim team owner.

216
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,130
He has an impressive track record in this industry

217
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,920
and will be a great help to you all.

218
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,210
“This industry”?

219
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,420
Nice to meet you.

220
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,910
They're not only artists under our management

221
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,790
but also players who will join the team next season.

222
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,350
Say hello.

223
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

224
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,120
-What's the standard?
-The standard?

225
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,730
Only marketability.

226
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,290
I've had enough of you already.

227
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,090
Are you saying…

228
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,300
Looks are the standard?

229
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,660
Are you picking idols or something?

230
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,460
No, I never said that.

231
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,580
Marketability includes many factors.

232
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,200
Listen carefully.

233
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,650
This club, now owned by Fast Forward Flow Entertainment,

234
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,770
will become an entirely different team.

235
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,300
Mr. Seo.

236
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,230
Player Kim Do-hyung, the right winger,

237
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,310
is notorious for his short temper,
often clashing with opposing players or fans.

238
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,450
He's decent overall,
but first, a trip to the dermatologist is mandatory.

239
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,380
His jawline needs refinement – at least three laser treatments.

240
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,260
His hairline should be adjusted, and a few minor procedures are required.

241
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,460
This is the basic level required

242
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,520
to compete with our new recruits.

243
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,720
If you want to stay, are you willing to do it?

244
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,020
What did you just say?

245
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,370
Kyung-jae, where are you going?

246
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,390
I'm not doing it.

247
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,810
Ryu Kyung-jae!

248
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,770
I said I'm not doing it.

249
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,270
Do you want to be a one-hit-wonder star
and fade away just like that?

250
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,310
I heard you were offered a role in a historical drama.

251
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,780
Playing the third henchman.

252
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,450
It's not the third henchman – it's the first henchman.

253
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,180
Right, the first henchman. That first henchman.

254
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,620
Do you want your career to end as the first henchman?

255
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,820
The same director who used to beg you

256
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,780
to star in their projects is now setting you up.

257
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,770
Do you realize that no one would even offer you a henchman role anymore?

258
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,000
Fine, I get it. I'll reflect on myself.

259
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,850
What does playing ball have to do with entertainment anyway?

260
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,080
-“Playing ball”?
-You jerk.

261
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,310
What?

262
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,010
It's called playing ball because it involves a ball.

263
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,800
Isn't that right?

264
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,830
Playing ball like this, whether you're the first henchman or the third,

265
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,730
shouldn't it be more dignified than that?

266
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,090
What?

267
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,160
Listen to me.

268
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,100
Boss,

269
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,900
no matter what, you can't just dismiss the players…

270
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,860
What exactly are you thinking?

271
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,190
Can they even play football?

272
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,940
Everyone calm down! Do you think we'd act rashly?

273
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,460
You all have at least neighborhood-level football skills, right?

274
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,470
Yes.

275
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,530
Forget it.

276
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,810
We won't join this kind of team.

277
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,780
Strike. We'll go on strike together.

278
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,060
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

279
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,020
Looks like we'll need something more persuasive.

280
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,910
Yes, sir.

281
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,990
When does your contract end, bro?

282
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,340
You don't even know I'm not on a yearly salary?

283
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,440
Just getting match allowances already breaks my heart.

284
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,890
Getting dismissed like this… is this even reasonable?

285
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,450
Why do you think he's doing all this?

286
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,820
Yeah, why?

287
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,940
Hey,

288
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,780
wasn't that tall guy just now an actor?

289
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,160
Wasn't he the one in that photo you showed me?

290
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,950
Yeah, I heard he caused a scandal not long ago

291
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,330
and left a drama cast.

292
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,770
No, Ji-woo,

293
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,950
do you know the first henchman?

294
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,900
The vibe between you two seemed unusual.

295
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,830
Not the third henchman – the first henchman.

296
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,190
No, I just met him for the first time today.

297
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,040
I thought...

298
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,350
You looked like you were meeting your dream lover just now,

299
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,860
slowly walking toward him.

300
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,599
Are you okay?

301
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,980
I think that rude guy has no skills at all.

302
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,560
He's just a rookie.

303
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,640
Are they trying to create an idol football team?

304
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,599
Strike. Let's just go on strike.

305
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,390
Hey,

306
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,640
are you joking about going on strike?

307
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,750
You should first think about how to protect the team.

308
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,310
Do-hyung, we're professional players.

309
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,770
Have you forgotten that just because we were relegated?

310
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,160
We need to find a way to stay.

311
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,480
Look for another chance to negotiate. That's the right thing to do.

312
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,280
Bro.

313
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,800
Calm down first.

314
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,910
Let's find a way to turn things around.

315
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,000
It won't end like this. Are we just going to give up?

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,340
How have we protected this team until now?

317
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,080
You think you've survived, don't you?

318
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,910
Here, I'm the only one being dismissed.

319
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,180
I don't want to hear your so-called comforting words.

320
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,290
Goodbye.

321
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,100
Hey, Do-hyung.

322
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,860
-Bro!
-Bro!

323
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,860
Let him go.

324
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,180
Even if we keep him here now, it won't help.

325
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,010
We need to wait and see, then figure something out.

326
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,640
Brothers, I think I'm the youngest here.

327
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,480
My name is Han Dong-hee.

328
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,040
You're running a YouTube channel, right? I'm one of your subscribers.

329
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
Are you Dongdong?

330
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
Thank you.

331
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,770
This is Sun-bin. He practiced with me before.

332
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,270
When Sun-bin debuted, he won first place on a music show,

333
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,620
while I was still an unknown nobody.

334
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm Lee Sun-bin.

335
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,100
Got it. Got it.

336
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,530
I even participated in Challenge the Sun-bin Group...

337
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,960
Is this introduction time now?

338
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,780
If so,

339
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,590
this guy is…

340
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,510
From Canada, he came to Korea to become an idol

341
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,220
and is struggling hard—K.

342
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,480
During practice, he's the best,

343
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,750
but he has stage fright.

344
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,570
When he's on a show, he shakes all over like a scared fool.

345
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,170
Also, if you use the content you're filming right now

346
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,270
without my permission,

347
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,210
prepare to be sued for violating my portrait rights.

348
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,310
Ryu Kyung-jae, the actor.

349
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,540
What is it?

350
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm your fan.

351
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,140
Doesn't seem like it.

352
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
What?

353
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,700
How many male fans do I even have in Korea nowadays?

354
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,350
Especially guys.

355
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,080
Oh, really?

356
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,630
Just now, the atmosphere between you and that somewhat handsome player was odd.

357
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,910
Do you know each other?

358
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,380
No, we don't.

359
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,610
You're lying.

360
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,760
Hey, Sun-bin.

361
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,870
Actually, I felt it too. You've met before, right?

362
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,040
We've met.

363
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,850
Sports entertainment.

364
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,480
Nowadays, sports are part of the entertainment industry.

365
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,470
Popular sports stars earn as much as a business does.

366
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,740
Their fans' support is no less than what idols receive.

367
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,660
Our company plans to become a leader in the sports entertainment sector.

368
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,240
[Merchandise Plan: Eco bags, baseball caps, football balls & towels, player cards]

369
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,580
Let me ask: Did Do Ji-woo ever get scouted

370
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,340
on the street as a child?

371
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,080
Although I bought the FC team at a low price,

372
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,990
it was also because of the influence of the existing roster.

373
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,810
Players like Yoon Tae-ryong and Do Ji-woo...

374
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,320
I'm not interested.

375
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,410
Please restore the team to its original state.

376
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,750
Yes,

377
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,900
we may indeed be at a standstill now,

378
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,980
but we've staked everything on football.

379
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,660
Everyone here is gathered because of football.

380
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,020
Championship teams and bottom-ranked teams both take it seriously.

381
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,880
This is not some toy that people like you

382
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,980
can manipulate at will.

383
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,350
Fine.

384
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,300
Then…

385
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,480
Why don't you try selling something?

386
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,610
What?

387
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,820
Selling what?

388
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,170
The merchandise.

389
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,880
-Us?
-Us?

390
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,310
Whoever sells the most merchandise, I'll do everything I can

391
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,900
to get them a TV appearance.

392
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,690
Really?

393
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,740
K, it's time for you to become a star.

394
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,980
Yes, I'll try my best.

395
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,550
Sun-bin,

396
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,580
you can make a comeback too.

397
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,790
As they say, “Ten years can change a dynasty.”

398
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,630
Kyung-jae.

399
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,110
In the entertainment world, it only takes a year for the tides to shift.

400
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,340
Disappear from sight, and you'll be erased from memory.

401
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,930
This is what they call a rising star.

402
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,800
I haven't even been on a break for that long.

403
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,640
You've been off the radar for over three months.

404
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,220
You need to appear in front of the public,

405
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,060
but not in a way that feels like an official comeback.

406
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,660
An image of actor Ryu Kyung-jae,

407
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,140
sweating on the football field, as if returning to his roots.

408
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,400
That kind of image would be perfect to show the public.

409
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,340
As for me,

410
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,740
I just want to play football.

411
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,180
I'm not interested in selling merchandise.

412
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,250
Honestly,

413
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,150
I was considering relocating the team's home ground.

414
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,750
But then we'd lose our league qualification, so I was worried about that.

415
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,340
This would also be heartbreaking news for the local fans

416
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,930
who've been supporting us all along.

417
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,220
The players' salaries are barely covered by subsidies

418
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,580
from local government organizations.

419
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,060
I doubt even that will continue for much longer.

420
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,490
Are you threatening me?

421
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,600
No, I'm worried. Concerned.

422
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,420
Do Ji-woo,

423
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,900
let's give it a try together, shall we?

424
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,200
This is about saving the team financially.

425
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,010
Without a team...you can't play football, can you?

426
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,930
Kyung-jae,

427
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,420
think carefully about what the CEO said.

428
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,900
You need to get back on stage naturally.

429
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,180
Didn't things go well after filming Strike?

430
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,630
No questions asked, no probing.Just one request, right?

431
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,230
Yes, that's right.

432
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,390
Alright.

433
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,640
Deal.

434
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,480
Great. Thank you. That's the right way to think about it.

435
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,560
You can make your comeback.

436
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:07,460
