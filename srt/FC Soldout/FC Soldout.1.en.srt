00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,460
Well...

23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,930
I heard they've found a new sponsor. Let's wait and see.

24
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,500
But the company that bought them...

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,040
It was chosen out of nowhere.

Hey, Kang Min-soo.

29

Turn that off.

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,450
Have we really been sold to some entertainment company?

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,410
Were we really sold?

32
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,540
Didn't you see the press conference?

33
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,990
So… that person called the CEO...

34
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,920
Is he really the team owner?

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,540
Darn it. Just holding a press conference isn't enough, is it?

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,130
At least show his face!

37
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,120
Hello, everyone.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,290
Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,590
I'm your new team owner.

40
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,560
Your match was impressive.

41
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,780
He's...

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,170
An actor, isn't he?

43
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,079
No.

44
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,110
I'm Kim Dae-soo, the CEO

45
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,630
of Fast Forward Flow.

46
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,090
Fast what?

47
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,100
Oh, right.

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,900
Since you guys just play football, you might not get it.

49
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,840
It's an entertainment company.

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,410
Think of it as a talent management agency, and you'll understand.

51
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,570
Anyway,

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,410
nice to meet you all.

53
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,690
Do you think we're happy to see you?

54
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,720
Didn't you watch the match?

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,390
Do you have any sense at all?

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,430
Why...

57
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,910
Why would an entertainment company buy
a team that's been relegated to the fourth division?

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,130
Because it was cheap.

59
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,120
What?

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,290
When I was considering expanding my business into sports entertainment,

61
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,460
I came across this cheap team.

62
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,020
But,

63
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,510
I think it's already lost its value.

64
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:44,240
Which one of you is the best player here?

65
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,250
"The best player," he said.

66
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,770
No one? Then I'll pick myself.

67
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,570
Wow, this one looks like a good player.

68
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,300
Out.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,329
What?

70
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,200
You too...

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,980
Out.

72
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,860
This guy… looks decent.

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,990
You're a candidate.

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,290
Oh, nice.

75
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,690
Very good. Keep it up.

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,860
You there...

77
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,820
Do you not want to meet my gaze?

78
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,830
Just with your eyes.

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,210
You don't want to?

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,330
Out.

81
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,050
And you…

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,030
-Out. -Wait a minute.

83
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,320
What do you mean "out"?

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,760
What are you doing?

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,940
Listen carefully. Players who are "out," starting today

86
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,000
cannot stay with us.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,409
-What?
-What are you saying?

88
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,400
What are you saying?

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,950
-What are you saying?
-Move! Move!

90
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,670
Everyone, calm down.

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,290
Let's talk this out. Let's talk it out properly.

92
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,390
Listen to me, Mr. Actor.

93
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,540
This man is the team owner.

94
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,660
As the team owner, can you just fire players at will?

95
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,020
Because I won't invest in a business that won't make a profit.

96
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,140
It's difficult to even band together the team now,

97
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,340
yet you're firing half the players as soon as you arrive?

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,270
It's precisely because the team can't even stand united.

99
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,820
If you want to survive, you'll have to follow my orders. Understood?

100
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,430
Do you know how many players are needed to play football?

101
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,960
How are we supposed to play the next match like this?

102
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,880
Mr. Seo.

103
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,909
Yes.

104
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,220
Come in.

Move!

117

Darn it. How did I survive the past five years?

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,970
I can't believe it went bankrupt like this.

119

If I had known it would turn out like this, I would have transferred back then.

120

Darn it.

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,910
I would still pass it to you.

165
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,350
Wow, seriously…

166
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,550
Ryu Kyung-jae.

We've invited an actor who can warm everyone's hearts

177
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,020
during this cold winter – Ryu Kyung-jae.

178
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,330
Hello, everyone. I'm the sunny man, actor Ryu Kyung-jae.

179
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,790
Bro, are you okay?

180
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,160
Yeah.

181
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,690
Look, look.

182
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,150
My sister is absolutely crazy about him.

183
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,940
Is he that popular?

184
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,590
Apparently so.

185
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,140
Didn't you recommend a movie called Strike before?

186
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,830
He really knows how to pick projects.

187
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,220
That's odd…

188
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,530
If it's decent, he's bound to be in it.

189
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,790
Is that so?

190
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,030
That's him.

191
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,570
Am I a bit more handsome?

192
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah.

193
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,280
You are definitely more handsome, senior.

194
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,260
-Take it easy, our Ji-woo.
-Yes.

195
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,320
Today, we're doing a special live broadcast for fans.

196
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
A live broadcast?

197
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,180
Aside from football, this is a first.

198
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,240
Waiting for something, curious and interested in
the little moments of daily life.

199
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,430
Still, I'm not his fan.

200
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,810
Definitely… not a fan.

201
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,210
(3rd Month of Denying Being a Fan)
Definitely… not a fan.

What?

214
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,740
I'm your fan.

215
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,370
Do you know me?

216
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,720
I've seen your matches.

217
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,720
Let's get along.

218
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,200
Actually, I'm a fan of yours too...

219
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,630
-Ji-woo.
-Bro.

220
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,720
The atmosphere is a little strange, huh?

221
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,410
Hey, do you have something to say?

222
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,110
Did you know each other before?

223
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,800
No.

224
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,100
We didn't.

225
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,490
I see.

226
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,180
Well, a little tension isn't a bad thing in any case.

227
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,590
Alright.

228
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,300
This is Mr. Seo, the person I trust most at FFF Entertainment.

229
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,020
He'll serve as the interim team owner.

230
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,130
He has an impressive track record in this industry

231
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,920
and will be a great help to you all.

232
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,210
“This industry”?

233
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,420
Nice to meet you.

234
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,910
They're not only artists under our management

235
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,790
but also players who will join the team next season.

236
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,350
Say hello.

237
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

238
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,120
-What's the standard?
-The standard?

239
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,730
Only marketability.

240
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,290
I've had enough of you already.

241
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,090
Are you saying…

242
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,300
Looks are the standard?

243
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,660
Are you picking idols or something?

244
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,460
No, I never said that.

245
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,580
Marketability includes many factors.

246
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,200
Listen carefully.

247
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,650
This club, now owned by Fast Forward Flow Entertainment,

248
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,770
will become an entirely different team.

249
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,300
Mr. Seo.

250
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,230
Player Kim Do-hyung, the right winger,

251
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,310
is notorious for his short temper,
often clashing with opposing players or fans.

252
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,450
He's decent overall,
but first, a trip to the dermatologist is mandatory.

253
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,380
His jawline needs refinement – at least three laser treatments.

254
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,260
His hairline should be adjusted, and a few minor procedures are required.

255
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,460
This is the basic level required

256
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,520
to compete with our new recruits.

257
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,720
If you want to stay, are you willing to do it?

258
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,020
What did you just say?

259
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,370
Kyung-jae, where are you going?

260
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,390
I'm not doing it.

261
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,810
Ryu Kyung-jae!

262
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,770
I said I'm not doing it.

263
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,270
Do you want to be a one-hit-wonder star
and fade away just like that?

264
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,310
I heard you were offered a role in a historical drama.

265
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,780
Playing the third henchman.

266
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,450
It's not the third henchman – it's the first henchman.

267
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,180
Right, the first henchman. That first henchman.

268
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,620
Do you want your career to end as the first henchman?

269
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,820
The same director who used to beg you

270
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,780
to star in their projects is now setting you up.

271
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,770
Do you realize that no one would even offer you a henchman role anymore?

272
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,000
Fine, I get it. I'll reflect on myself.

273
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,850
What does playing ball have to do with entertainment anyway?

274
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,080
-“Playing ball”?
-You jerk.

275
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,310
What?

276
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,010
It's called playing ball because it involves a ball.

277
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,800
Isn't that right?

278
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,830
Playing ball like this, whether you're the first henchman or the third,

279
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,730
shouldn't it be more dignified than that?

280
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,090
What?

281
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,160
Listen to me.

282
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,100
Boss,

283
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,900
no matter what, you can't just dismiss the players…

284
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,860
What exactly are you thinking?

285
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,190
Can they even play football?

286
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,940
Everyone calm down! Do you think we'd act rashly?

287
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,460
You all have at least neighborhood-level football skills, right?

288
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,470
Yes.

289
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,530
Forget it.

290
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,810
We won't join this kind of team.

291
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,780
Strike. We'll go on strike together.

292
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,060
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

293
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,020
Looks like we'll need something more persuasive.

294
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,910
Yes, sir.

295
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,990
When does your contract end, bro?

296
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,340
You don't even know I'm not on a yearly salary?

297
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,440
Just getting match allowances already breaks my heart.

298
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,890
Getting dismissed like this… is this even reasonable?

299
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,450
Why do you think he's doing all this?

300
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,820
Yeah, why?

301
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,940
Hey,

302
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,780
wasn't that tall guy just now an actor?

303
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,160
Wasn't he the one in that photo you showed me?

304
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,950
Yeah, I heard he caused a scandal not long ago

305
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,330
and left a drama cast.

306
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,770
No, Ji-woo,

307
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,950
do you know the first henchman?

308
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,900
The vibe between you two seemed unusual.

309
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,830
Not the third henchman – the first henchman.

310
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,190
No, I just met him for the first time today.

311
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,040
I thought...

312
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,350
You looked like you were meeting your dream lover just now,

313
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,860
slowly walking toward him.

314
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,599
Are you okay?

315
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,980
I think that rude guy has no skills at all.

316
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,560
He's just a rookie.

317
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,640
Are they trying to create an idol football team?

318
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,599
Strike. Let's just go on strike.

319
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,390
Hey,

320
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,640
are you joking about going on strike?

321
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,750
You should first think about how to protect the team.

322
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,310
Do-hyung, we're professional players.

323
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,770
Have you forgotten that just because we were relegated?

324
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,160
We need to find a way to stay.

325
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,480
Look for another chance to negotiate. That's the right thing to do.

326
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,280
Bro.

327
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,800
Calm down first.

328
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,910
Let's find a way to turn things around.

329
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,000
It won't end like this. Are we just going to give up?

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,340
How have we protected this team until now?

331
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,080
You think you've survived, don't you?

332
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,910
Here, I'm the only one being dismissed.

333
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,180
I don't want to hear your so-called comforting words.

334
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,290
Goodbye.

335
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,100
Hey, Do-hyung.

336
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,860
-Bro!
-Bro!

337
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,860
Let him go.

338
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,180
Even if we keep him here now, it won't help.

339
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,010
We need to wait and see, then figure something out.

340
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,640
Brothers, I think I'm the youngest here.

341
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,480
My name is Han Dong-hee.

342
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,040
You're running a YouTube channel, right? I'm one of your subscribers.

343
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,440
Are you Dongdong?

344
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
Thank you.

345
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,770
This is Sun-bin. He practiced with me before.

346
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,270
When Sun-bin debuted, he won first place on a music show,

347
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,620
while I was still an unknown nobody.

348
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm Lee Sun-bin.

349
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,100
Got it. Got it.

350
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,530
I even participated in Challenge the Sun-bin Group...

351
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,960
Is this introduction time now?

352
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,780
If so,

353
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,590
this guy is…

354
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,510
From Canada, he came to Korea to become an idol

355
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,220
and is struggling hard—K.

356
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,480
During practice, he's the best,

357
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,750
but he has stage fright.

358
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,570
When he's on a show, he shakes all over like a scared fool.

359
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,170
Also, if you use the content you're filming right now

360
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,270
without my permission,

361
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,210
prepare to be sued for violating my portrait rights.

362
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,310
Ryu Kyung-jae, the actor.

363
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,540
What is it?

364
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,680
I'm your fan.

365
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,140
Doesn't seem like it.

366
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
What?

367
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,700
How many male fans do I even have in Korea nowadays?

368
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,350
Especially guys.

369
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,080
Oh, really?

370
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,630
Just now, the atmosphere between you and that somewhat handsome player was odd.

371
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,910
Do you know each other?

372
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,380
No, we don't.

373
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,610
You're lying.

374
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,760
Hey, Sun-bin.

375
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,870
Actually, I felt it too. You've met before, right?

376
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,040
We've met.

377
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,850
Sports entertainment.

378
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,480
Nowadays, sports are part of the entertainment industry.

379
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,470
Popular sports stars earn as much as a business does.

380
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,740
Their fans' support is no less than what idols receive.

381
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,380
Our company plans to become a leader in the sports entertainment sector.

382
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,660
(Merchandise Plan: Eco bags, baseball caps, football balls & towels, player cards)
Our company plans to become a leader in the sports entertainment sector.

383
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,240
(Merchandise Plan: Eco bags, baseball caps, football balls & towels, player cards)

384
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,580
Let me ask: Did Do Ji-woo ever get scouted

385
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,340
on the street as a child?

386
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,080
Although I bought the FC team at a low price,

387
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,990
it was also because of the influence of the existing roster.

388
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,810
Players like Yoon Tae-ryong and Do Ji-woo...

389
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,320
I'm not interested.

390
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,410
Please restore the team to its original state.

391
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,750
Yes,

392
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,900
we may indeed be at a standstill now,

393
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,980
but we've staked everything on football.

394
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,660
Everyone here is gathered because of football.

395
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,020
Championship teams and bottom-ranked teams both take it seriously.

396
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,880
This is not some toy that people like you

397
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,980
can manipulate at will.

398
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,350
Fine.

399
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,300
Then…

400
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,480
Why don't you try selling something?

401
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,610
What?

402
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,820
Selling what?

403
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,170
The merchandise.

404
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,880
-Us?
-Us?

405
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,310
Whoever sells the most merchandise, I'll do everything I can

406
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,900
to get them a TV appearance.

407
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,690
Really?

408
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,740
K, it's time for you to become a star.

409
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,980
Yes, I'll try my best.

410
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,550
Sun-bin,

411
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,580
you can make a comeback too.

412
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,790
As they say, “Ten years can change a dynasty.”

413
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,630
Kyung-jae.

414
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,110
In the entertainment world, it only takes a year for the tides to shift.

415
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,340
Disappear from sight, and you'll be erased from memory.

416
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,930
This is what they call a rising star.

417
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,800
I haven't even been on a break for that long.

418
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,640
You've been off the radar for over three months.

419
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,220
You need to appear in front of the public,

420
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,060
but not in a way that feels like an official comeback.

421
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,660
An image of actor Ryu Kyung-jae,

422
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,140
sweating on the football field, as if returning to his roots.

423
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,400
That kind of image would be perfect to show the public.

424
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,340
As for me,

425
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,740
I just want to play football.

426
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,180
I'm not interested in selling merchandise.

427
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,250
Honestly,

428
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,150
I was considering relocating the team's home ground.

429
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,750
But then we'd lose our league qualification, so I was worried about that.

430
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,340
This would also be heartbreaking news for the local fans

431
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,930
who've been supporting us all along.

432
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,220
The players' salaries are barely covered by subsidies

433
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,580
from local government organizations.

434
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,060
I doubt even that will continue for much longer.

435
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,490
Are you threatening me?

436
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,600
No, I'm worried. Concerned.

437
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,420
Do Ji-woo,

438
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,900
let's give it a try together, shall we?

439
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,200
This is about saving the team financially.

440
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,010
Without a team...you can't play football, can you?

441
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,930
Kyung-jae,

442
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,420
think carefully about what the CEO said.

443
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,900
You need to get back on stage naturally.

444
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,180
Didn't things go well after filming Strike?

445
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,630
No questions asked, no probing.Just one request, right?

446
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,230
Yes, that's right.

447
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,390
Alright.

448
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,640
Deal.

449
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,480
Great. Thank you. That's the right way to think about it.

450
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,560
You can make your comeback.

451
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:07,460
(#7 Do Ji-woo)
