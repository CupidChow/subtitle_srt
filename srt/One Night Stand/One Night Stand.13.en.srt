1
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,754
Who is it, then?

2
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,589
Who's waiting for Queen
in that room?

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,015
Coach Kwang claims
he doesn't know either.

4
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,857
He left
that place after that.

5
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,089
But there is something that can
tell us.

6
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,433
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME, I HAVE TO
GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO YOU…

7
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,920
Of course.
I'll take care of it.

8
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,707
I'M IN ROOM 703.
Tomorrow.

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,640
Coach Kwang decided to
tell Gale his room number.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,819
He thought
if violence occurs...

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,582
...Gale can help him.

12
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:37,078
As you know,
Queen died the next day.

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,341
So…

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,015
Did Gale go to the room that
mentioned by Kwang Training?

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,361
This is what I want
I learned from Gale.

16
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,837
Why don't you go?
ask Gale?

17
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:52,652
I've spoken to him.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,765
Gale is still convinced...

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,729
...he doesn't remember
the incident that night.

20
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,687
I am not sure
if he is confused...

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,895
...or afraid of something.

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,775
Or he doesn't trust me.

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,988
That is why…

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,622
...I need your help.

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,442
How to help you?

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,901
Can you ask?
on Gale...

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,042
...what is the truth
happened that night?

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,796
Gale might be more comfortable
talk to you.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,598
- I think…
- I beg you.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,495
In fact, in this case
you are not helping me.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,872
Let's say...

32
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:31,901
...you help your friend.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,725
Helping Queen to rest
in peace.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,055
The police ask you to
I remember something?

35
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,738
Why?
He thinks I'm lying?

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,473
Not really. Well…

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
He knows you don't remember
about that night.

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,160
So he asked Papang
to help you.

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,880
I know how evil it is
Queen to us.

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,160
If he is killed...

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,655
...shouldn't we
uphold justice for him?

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,175
What do you want me to do?

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,493
I'm not lying, I'm not
hiding anything. I just…

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,256
I don't remember anything.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,640
I guess
everyone should calm down.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,240
We have to take the time
to think about it.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,855
Come on, don't worry.

48
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,535
Whatever happens,
I will be by your side.

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,312
We all
will be by your side.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,939
I may
using your computer?

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,613
Queen sent me a message to
met him in the hotel room.

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,695
I didn't see the message
on my phone.

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,100
Maybe Toy
already deleted the message.

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,209
Message has been deleted on phone...

55
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,839
...but still visible
in the system.

56
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,926
The message will appear
if we log in to our account.

57
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,642
Coach Kwang said
he sent me this room number.

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,258
So Coach Kwang
tell the truth.

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,261
Strange.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,810
Queen speaks as if she knows
that would be his last message.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,942
As if he knew
he will die.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,953
If so, at least…

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,026
...maybe he wants to
return your secret.

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,294
Queen knows
someone wants him dead.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,330
He also called me
in his final moments.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,966
It means someone
in that room...

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,689
...from the start of planning
wants to kill Queen.

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,926
But who? Who is…

69
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,158
...that angry with him?

70
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,417
Queen, I've arrived.

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,169
You are okay?

72
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,404
No.

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,254
I'm angry with myself because
forget what happened that night.

74
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,357
I should be
a person who knows everything.

75
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,080
If Toy hadn't drugged me
until I don't remember anything...

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,227
- ...everything will be easier.
- Gale, Gale.

77
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,149
It doesn't matter.

78
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,667
I believe in people's memories
will return.

79
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,468
One day, later
your memory will come back.

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,142
But it takes time.

81
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,926
Do you think I still have time?

82
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,040
The police will call me
to ask me further.

83
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,725
And I won't be able to either
say anything.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,175
Will I be a suspect?

85
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,175
You have to calm down.
It doesn't matter.

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,215
Trust me.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,754
Can you think of
someone now?

88
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Someone who is very
hate Queen so much...

89
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,695
...become his enemy
and plan to kill him?

90
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,461
I can think of 1 person.

91
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,155
Not me,
he who thought about this.

92
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,376
Tell them
who do you suspect.

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
What?

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,200
Do not be like that.

95
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
Your baby is strong.

96
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,280
Happy! A baby girl.

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,814
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

98
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,560
Honey, look at our baby.

99
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,530
Baby girl.

100
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,653
- Thank you very much.
- Sure. Congratulations again.

101
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
Our baby is so cute.

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,040
Yes. Don't forget to give it a name.

103
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,488
Why the rush?

104
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,815
We just found out
gender.

105
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:56,516
It's still a long time until he's born.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Come on dear.

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,760
If you are lifted
become deputy minister...

108
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,495
...you won't have time
for this.

109
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,914
So you have to help me
give it a name now.

110
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,361
- What is it?
- Welcome to news coverage.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,680
Police officer
postpone the investigation report...

112
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,015
...development of death
Miss Katariya Kijnueng...

113
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,446
...or Queen,
a famous celebrity.

114
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,760
The evidence and witnesses do not match.

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,129
Long time no see.

116
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,729
You look more attractive.

117
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,048
I wonder how?
This is your moment of awakening.

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,783
So you look attractive
from head to toe.

119
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,718
Tell me what you think?

120
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,438
Why are you so arrogant?
if it will be promoted?

121
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,760
Are you afraid of your wife?

122
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh yeah, congratulations.

123
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,879
I saw your wife uploading
on her IG that she was pregnant.

124
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,895
You must have
baby boy.

125
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,400
Because if it's a woman,
I'm afraid karma will...

126
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,358
...befalls your daughter.

127
00:08:07,164 --> 00:08:08,918
Tell me your wish...

128
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,413
...or I'll go.

129
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,384
Ah.

130
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,773
I need your help.

131
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
You've gotten a lot from me.
A huge amount.

132
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,655
And you promised me every time
you will delete the video.

133
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,171
I never saw you
even if you keep your promise.

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,861
It's your fault
and your stupidity.

135
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,510
You want to sleep with me.

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,323
And you fell for my trick
the simple...

137
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,335
...that I asked you
send your sex video...

138
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,400
...and Gale and then…

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,155
I will make you
impressed more than Gale.

140
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,544
And you fall
into my trap.

141
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Hey.

142
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,454
What is it?
I still haven't uploaded it.

143
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,423
Or do you want
I upload it now?

144
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,796
You want that?

145
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,507
This is the last money
that I give you.

146
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
No.

147
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,443
You will give me money
each month.

148
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,334
And the amount must be
3 times bigger than this.

149
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,852
Are you crazy?

150
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,815
From where
can i get money?

151
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Huh?

152
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,285
Why the candidate for deputy minister
stingy like this?

153
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,055
Just think of it like this...

154
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,175
...you can give me money
what I asked for...

155
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,856
...or you can refuse it,
Which one destroys you more?

156
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,455
A professor who
harassing his own students...

157
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,454
...recording video...

158
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,615
...and share it
to other students.

159
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,751
People like this
can run a country?

160
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:08,320
Forget the high position
and that's great.

161
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,935
According to you
your wife won't mind?

162
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,298
You become a father
from her baby...

163
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,910
...if he knew
how despicable are you?

164
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,129
If I
indeed a monster...

165
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,450
...you are also a monster like me...

166
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,269
...for forcing me like this.

167
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,341
What is so funny?

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,566
Stop laughing
right now. Hey!

169
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Okay.

170
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,720
You can call me
as you wish...

171
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,747
...and praise yourself
like an angel...

172
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,053
...does not matter.

173
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,586
You just give me
the money I asked for.

174
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,695
Otherwise, I will show you
to them your true self.

175
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,986
When will this end?

176
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,095
Let me ask...

177
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,004
...when is enough for you?

178
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,711
Maybe until…

179
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,077
...one of us dies.

180
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,335
If you think about it...

181
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,455
...your only secret
which is kept by Queen...

182
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,376
...is about
you and Prof. Phat.

183
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,440
So there is a big possibility...

184
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,455
...this scandal is not only
will affect you...

185
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,737
...but also influences
Prof. Phat.

186
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,807
Currently living Prof. Phat...

187
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,095
...very comfortable.

188
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,059
Let's think about it
Queen's nature...

189
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,653
...there is a possibility
he blackmailed her.

190
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,644
But can he kill Queen?

191
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,040
Let's think again.

192
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,655
If the secret gets out...

193
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,640
...Prof. Phat will lose a lot.

194
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,715
Shouldn't he do
anything to keep it a secret?

195
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,327
Just my guess,
whether true or not.

196
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,077
Why don't we
just ask?

197
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,845
What do you think?

198
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,211
I don't think there is any
the point of asking.

199
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,699
He won't say anything,
he is not stupid.

200
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,019
We need strong evidence before
ask someone like that.

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,215
Where we can
found the evidence?

202
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
From RJ.

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,454
RJ can tell us.

204
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,345
He can tell
who did he bring Queen to?

205
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,909
Where are you?

206
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,606
It's been a long time
I'm waiting at the cafe.

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,347
He's not there?

208
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,495
Who?

209
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,575
I'm busy today so I
ask someone to go there.

210
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,478
Wait, I'll press him.
to get there soon.

211
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,092
Hello, sir.

212
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,126
Are you in my class?

213
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,600
Not suprisingly
You don't recognize me.

214
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,802
I always skip your class, Dad.

215
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,744
Hello?

216
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,548
I have arrived.
I was talking to him.

217
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,758
Okay, I'll go.

218
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,400
Where is the money?

219
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,178
You have to bribe Queen
to keep quiet, right?

220
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,059
Just hand over the money
so I can go.

221
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,340
This?

222
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,843
Why should you
do this for him?

223
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,715
My reasons are the same as yours.

224
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,231
Dad paid for it...

225
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,166
...but I am his slave.

226
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,197
Become his slave?

227
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Well…

228
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,949
I have to do
whatever the command.

229
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,695
What did he tell you to do?

230
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,811
Most things are not good.

231
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Recently, he told me
spread the news...

232
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,179
...if I
sleeping with his friend.

233
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,115
Because he was worried about his friend
will steal someone's lover.

234
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,495
Evil, right?

235
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,144
He really is a monster.

236
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,600
So you mind too?

237
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,755
Who wouldn't mind?

238
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,273
I…

239
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,639
I want to kill him.

240
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
But…

241
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,449
I do not dare.
Do you dare, sir?

242
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,023
I have to go. Bye.

243
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,736
Can you stop?
smoke a while?

244
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,624
I don't like the smell.

245
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,608
Where is Toy?

246
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,753
How are you?

247
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,634
I asked
How are you.

248
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,412
I'm not okay.

249
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,588
I should
didn't do it.

250
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,099
I shouldn't have done that
what do you suggest.

251
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,871
What if…

252
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,175
...we go to the police
to end this? Okay?

253
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,512
You have to focus.

254
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,710
The situation is already bad.

255
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,855
But, sir, I think
can get away with this?

256
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,264
This is getting out of control.

257
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,052
Everything can be solved.

258
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,481
You're scared.

259
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,777
Listen to me.

260
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,775
Think about Queen's actions
to us.

261
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,766
He deserved to die
like this.

262
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,278
We did nothing wrong.

263
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,615
The world is in a different place
better since he left.

264
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,419
- You bastard!
- Hey!

265
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,235
This is because of you.

266
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,055
You ruined everything.

267
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,130
You can't blame
everything to me.

268
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,983
You refused to give me money.

269
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,287
Damn it! Enough.

270
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,415
I called you both here
to sort things out...

271
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,862
...not to fight.

272
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,809
Unlucky!
We have enough problems already.

273
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,032
Then who brought it?
problem for us?

274
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,019
Isn't it because of you?

275
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,307
What did you say?

276
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,505
What exactly are you saying?

277
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,335
Unlucky!

278
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,375
If you're not stupid enough
to move the body...

279
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,640
...it must be over.

280
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,789
I don't know...

281
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,970
...you two are planning
kill that damn woman.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,521
If I had known...

283
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,166
...since the beginning
I won't get involved.

284
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,840
Poor me.

285
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,418
I am the most unlucky one.

286
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,807
I don't know
could be this bad.

287
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,876
Dad never said
will do this.

288
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,811
You too.
As he just said.

289
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,947
If you weren't that stupid,
this can be over now.

290
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,061
Hey, I told you to stop.
Damn it!

291
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Now what?

292
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Who knows.

293
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,829
Just get it done.

294
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,827
What do you think?

295
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,130
If you are sure you can get through...

296
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,173
...then go ahead.

297
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,014
But I have to go.

298
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,224
Before I go...

299
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,400
...I will invite you
Gale is with me.

300
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:05,528
PROF. PHAT

301
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,211
- Hello.
- Gale?

302
00:18:35,452 --> 00:18:36,943
We need to talk.

303
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,876
About what?

304
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,583
About that night?

305
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,139
I think it's time
we talk.

306
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,124
Queen. I've arrived.

307
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,333
Come in.

308
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
What's this?

309
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,795
You need money, right?

310
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,555
You said you would run away
to a place.

311
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,561
If you really need money...

312
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,842
...I should be the first person
what you asked for.

313
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,845
You work for me.
You are my person.

314
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,110
Why are you asking for money?
from other people?

315
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:05,606
You have to run
through the Cambodian border.

316
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,637
I have friends there.

317
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,655
He will take care of it
fake passport and visa for you.

318
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,412
Then you can run
to another country.

319
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,101
Thank You.

320
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:25,483
- I go...
- Hey.

321
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,760
I can take you.

322
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,914
I think I should go
go there yourself.

323
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,499
I told you not to.

324
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,423
I will take you there.
It won't be long.

325
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,398
Close the door.

326
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Hey!

327
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Damn it!

328
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,711
GALE

329
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,054
Hello, Gale.

330
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,494
Prof. Phat?

331
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,961
I think we should talk.

332
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,095
I'm home now.

333
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,101
Come here
to meet me.

334
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,452
Of course.

335
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:47,091
RJ

336
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Hello, RJ?

337
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:49,656
Come on!

338
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,520
Prof. Phat will kill me!

339
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,827
What did you say?

340
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,992
Prof. Phat will kill me.

341
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,458
Wait, calm yourself.
Where are you?

342
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,237
Phutthamonthon maybe?

343
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Where is it?

344
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,028
I don't know, I don't care.

345
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,840
Listen carefully,
if something happens to me...

346
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,961
...Prof. Phat is the perpetrator.

347
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,327
Actually,
he is the mastermind behind all this.

348
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,889
He also killed Queen.

349
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,043
What? What did you say?

350
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,331
Prof. Phat killed Queen.

351
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,894
But…

352
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,095
I didn't do anything.

353
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,695
I just brought it
to that room.

354
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,720
But I think he'll just take it
some of her photos to blackmail her.

355
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,784
I don't know
he will kill him…

356
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,144
RJ?

357
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:30,986
Hello?

358
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,570
RJ, can you hear me? Hello?

359
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,001
Athens, RJ just called me.

360
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,461
Gale?

361
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,355
Gale?

362
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,523
I told you to calm down.

363
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,755
What are you doing?

364
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,880
Do you want to get in trouble?

365
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,447
Do you want to go to jail?

366
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,512
Sir... Sorry.

367
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,883
Please, don't hurt me.

368
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,130
Please.

369
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,827
I won't do anything.

370
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,059
I just want to take you there.

371
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,358
Please, sir, I…

372
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,523
I won't say anything.

373
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,164
Really.

374
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,871
You just spoke
who with?

375
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,271
I only…

376
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,798
I let it slip.
The police won't believe me anyway.

377
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,302
I will tell the police
If I trap you, okay?

378
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,958
People will be more
trust Dad over me.

379
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,978
Please, sir?

380
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,600
Come on,
they won't believe it...

381
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,856
...someone like you
kill Queen.

382
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,927
Listen to me.

383
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,492
It's not about who I kill,
but I can't get involved in this.

384
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,160
I can't take responsibility
on bad things...

385
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,726
...which is conducted
kids like you.

386
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,924
My life could be better.

387
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,400
Nothing can
stop me.

388
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,199
Get in the car.

389
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,800
If you don't want to come in,
I will finish you off here.

390
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,144
Okay, I'll go.

391
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Yes?

392
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,048
Well, I…

393
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,168
I have a meeting tonight.

394
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,266
This meeting will take some time
all night.

395
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,135
See you tomorrow morning.

396
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Okay?

397
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:40,616
Let go.

398
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,112
Let me go.

399
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:15,767
MARCH 31
Queen is going to the party tonight?

400
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,840
Correct.

401
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:18,887
At the nightclub &quot;One Night Stand&quot;.

402
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,012
Will he use drugs?
in the same hotel?

403
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,646
I'm not sure, but...

404
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,235
...I do not think so.

405
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:29,880
The man she has a crush on
will be there.

406
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,697
If he is there,
quickly give me a sign.

407
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,666
Will you really reply?

408
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,691
I can't stand it anymore.

409
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,425
I know.
I can't stand him either.

410
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,909
What are you doing?

411
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,514
Didn't I tell you?
if you don't stop...

412
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,545
...I will kill you?

413
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,040
I've been here for a long time
planning this...

414
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,793
...since I knew...

415
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,836
...you booked this room
to use drugs.

416
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,836
I will give
this drug...

417
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,034
...to you...

418
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,432
And I will
push you off the balcony.

419
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,838
Nothing is
will pay attention, right?

420
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,664
They will be sure
you're stoned and...

421
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,628
...you jump by yourself.

422
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,804
You can't speak?

423
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,836
Are you scared now?

424
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,133
How does it feel
become a victim?

425
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,154
Not good at talking anymore?

426
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:29,560
Who's afraid?
I think you're the one who's scared.

427
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,577
I know...

428
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,211
...you wouldn't dare
do it.

429
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,633
Are you challenging me?

430
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,746
Please!

431
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,208
Kill me.

432
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Come on.

433
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
Unlucky!

434
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,912
Why are you laughing?

435
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,236
Look at my face.

436
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Oh!

437
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,548
Who would believe...

438
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,376
...I got high and jumped?

439
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,407
Damn it!

440
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,041
The police will definitely know...

441
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:34,361
...I was hurt.

442
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:45,880
Stupid.

443
00:28:46,721 --> 00:28:48,022
I don't care anymore.

444
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,802
I will kill you.

445
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,050
Queen, I've arrived.

446
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,125
RJ. What happened?

447
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Hey...

448
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,174
...Forgive me.

449
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,518
This is my fault.

450
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,502
It's all my fault.

451
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:34,735
And I apologize.

452
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,527
Forgive me.

453
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,054
It doesn't matter.

454
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Gale.

455
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,547
Let me go.

456
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Why?

457
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,107
You can meet
with your ex.

458
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,600
And you left as soon as you saw
your current boyfriend?

459
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,525
Why are you like that?
want to know about that night?

460
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,511
Better
forget everything, right?

461
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,123
- But Queen was killed.
- So what?

462
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,154
He is indeed a monster.

463
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,112
Why do you care?
how did he die?

464
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:27,817
I am the one who loves you.

465
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,507
Shouldn't it be
do you care about me?

466
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,016
There is no one in this world
who loves you like I do.

467
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,252
I do not think so.

468
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,540
This is not love.

469
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,404
Then what do you call it?

470
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,525
I want to ask
something to you.

471
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,359
Why your ambition
hard to achieve?

472
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,491
Does anyone love you?

473
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,806
The professor is fooling you
to sleep with him.

474
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,076
Queen always betrays you.

475
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,960
Your own mother
don't even love you.

476
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,478
I am.

477
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,145
I am the only one
who loves you.

478
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,248
Why don't you love me?

479
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,216
We together...

480
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,118
...not because I love you...

481
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,200
...but because of me
not loving myself enough.

482
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,295
And I will not be
that guy again.

483
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,655
- Hey!
- Please.

484
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,426
Do as you please!

485
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,469
Let me tell you something.

486
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,975
You can kill me...

487
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,721
...and my answer will remain...

488
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:32,147
...i never loved you
and never will.

489
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,848
Gale, Gale.

490
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,917
- Let me go.
- I'm sorry, Gale.

491
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,759
Gale, I'm sorry.

492
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Gale.

493
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,089
Please, let's run away together.

494
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,955
You know what I did?
that night because of you.

495
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,768
Gale, Gale.

496
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,413
What do you mean?

497
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,455
If you don't show up
that night...

498
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,420
...I'll just run away
to save myself.

499
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,194
But you were there.

500
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Gale.

501
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,551
Do you know the first thing
what comes to my mind?

502
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,760
What?
You think I killed him?

503
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,674
You know very well...

504
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,308
...what is the logic.

505
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,618
Gale.

506
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,580
Let's get started
new life together.

507
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,074
You have to be responsible
because I became like this.

508
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
Gale.

509
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,147
- Gale, please?
- No!

510
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,107
Gale!

511
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,680
I don't have to be responsible
on anyone's life.

512
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,230
Everyone should
take care of his own life.

513
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,415
CHIVAS

514
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,538
Prof. Phat?

515
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Why did you…

516
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,962
Enter into.

517
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,280
- Queen, Queen!
- Gale.

518
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,033
What happened?

519
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:31,095
What did you do to my friend?

520
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,292
Your friend?

521
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,893
You still call him your friend?

522
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,308
He's going to kill me.
He had been planning it for a long time.

523
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,484
I wonder if he
will absolutely do it.

524
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,341
Is this a joke? This is not funny.

525
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,701
If you knew what he did...

526
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,480
...you can be a person
who wanted to kill him.

527
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,760
He still has our videos.

528
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,982
He uses it
to blackmail me.

529
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,695
He used it as a threat
so that I give him money.

530
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,440
I've already
give him a lot of money.

531
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,306
When I asked him
to stop...

532
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,672
...he ruined my life.

533
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:05,311
So what?

534
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:08,900
A monster like you
deserve it.

535
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,946
Gale, you agree to this.

536
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,055
He ruined your life.

537
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,612
You will be happy
if I ruin his life.

538
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,637
Shut up.

539
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,775
Gale.
He ruined my life today.

540
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,913
And he can also destroy
your life one day.

541
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
You still…

542
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,141
...save the video?

543
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Gale.

544
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,074
I'm not keeping it
to destroy you.

545
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,161
My target is him.

546
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,560
You will get in trouble
if he leaks it.

547
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,145
It's enough.

548
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,393
I'll take you home.

549
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,391
Gale, that's it.

550
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,645
- Gale! Gale!
- Ouch!

551
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,165
- Ouch!
- Gale.

552
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,743
Ouch!

553
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,462
Ouch!

554
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,395
Toys!

555
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
- Toys?
- Gale.

556
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,020
- Toys?
- Calm down.

557
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:15,133
RJ has surrendered himself.

558
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,334
He admitted everything.

559
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,236
And Prof. Phat is dead.

560
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,031
He tried to kill RJ
and RJ defends himself.

561
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,803
How did I get here?

562
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,834
When Toy…

563
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,930
I woke up in the middle of the night
and didn't see you.

564
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,100
I'm worried about you
and I followed you to your house.

565
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,055
I see Toy
trying to kidnap you...

566
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,504
...so I called the police.

567
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,580
Toy has been arrested.

568
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
Gale.

569
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:49,466
Why did you do that?

570
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,888
Why did you go?
meet him yourself?

571
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,752
I'm really worried about you.

572
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,497
Forgive me.

573
00:35:58,726 --> 00:35:59,808
I…

574
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,242
...want to talk to the police.

575
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:04,972
Gale.

576
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,631
You should rest.

577
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,635
I'm ready.

578
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,736
I already remember
everything now.

579
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,979
After he drugged Queen...

580
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,707
...Prof. Phat brought it
get out of the room.

581
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,252
I can't concentrate...

582
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,236
...and I'm afraid of him.

583
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,421
I can't
save the Queen.

584
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,821
This is my fault.

585
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,430
It's my fault I was there.

586
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,628
But I can't
save the Queen.

587
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,520
Just that?

588
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:46,960
Correct.

589
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,433
Prof. Phat killed Queen.

590
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,941
It's over now.

591
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,805
You won't get hurt anymore.

592
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,040
Thank you. Thank you.

593
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,767
1 YEAR LATER

594
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,580
Happy April Fool's Day, Everyone.

595
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,655
Actually, I feel...

596
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,100
...we shouldn't
celebrating today.

597
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:25,565
That's enough.

598
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:28,967
At least we know
we've been through this together.

599
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,223
That night
change our lives.

600
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,291
You can say that.

601
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,870
Actually,
I think our lives are the same.

602
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,125
Same how?

603
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,294
Well, we're dating now.

604
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,917
You two are so cute.

605
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,859
Don't make fun of me.

606
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,002
You and Chivas
also a cute couple.

607
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,001
I miss Queen.

608
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,267
I know.

609
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,935
I don't want to think about him.

610
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,904
But I can't help it,
I still think about him.

611
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,629
Let's talk about something else.

612
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:14,680
We celebrate &quot;April Fool's Day&quot;.

613
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,314
Let's play.

614
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,982
Let's lie
but make it sound real.

615
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
Okay?

616
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:22,082
You started it first.

617
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,372
- I?
- Yes.

618
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,839
- What?
- Uhh...

619
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,703
Okay.

620
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,551
I'm sick of you.

621
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,486
I want to date someone else.

622
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,763
How?

623
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,620
Fake. Absolutely fake.

624
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,582
Actually, I don't really like it.
people like you.

625
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,770
I'm dating you
just for fun.

626
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,477
Oh yes?

627
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,089
- Yes.
- You're fake too.

628
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,901
Now it's your turn.

629
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,100
- I?
- Yes.

630
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,214
Queen is
the woman I love the most.

631
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,636
And forever
will remain as it is.

632
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Why?

633
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,133
Did I say something?
wrong?

634
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:15,633
Gale, now it's your turn.
Make it sound real.

635
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:17,196
Actually...

636
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,685
...Prof. Phat didn't kill Queen.

637
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:24,172
I was the one who killed Queen.

638
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,468
You started off badly,
so fake.

639
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,600
Come on, cheers!

640
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,558
What a strange game!

641
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,629
Queen! Queen!

642
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Queen!

643
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,225
Queen, Queen.

644
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,815
How are you?

645
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Queen!

646
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Queen!

647
00:40:19,972 --> 00:40:20,997
Queen!

648
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,484
Queen! Where are you going?

649
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Queen!

650
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:36,872
Queen!

651
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,116
Queen,
you should delete that video.

652
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,626
If the video leaks,
I will get in trouble.

653
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,203
I am an actress,
you understand, right?

654
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:54,365
Queen!

655
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,604
Up to you.
We can talk later.

656
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,625
Let us go home.

657
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,754
You are very…

658
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
...stupid.

659
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,957
I'm serious.

660
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:27,807
You're such an idiot, Gale.

661
00:41:29,276 --> 00:41:31,236
Papang is also stupid.

662
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,616
Everyone in this world...

663
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:39,320
...so stupid, everyone.

664
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:45,832
But you are…

665
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,703
...the most stupid.
