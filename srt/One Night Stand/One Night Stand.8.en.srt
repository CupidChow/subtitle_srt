1
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,097
- Hey.
- Yes?

2
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,669
You see a man in a shirt
black is glancing at me?

3
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,124
- Hey, don't be like that!
- Yes?

4
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,378
He glanced at you?

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,972
Well, he glanced at us.

6
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,501
Who's he?
He looks familiar.

7
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:32,974
Her name is Toy.

8
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,513
He just came in
magazine cover.

9
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,080
He is also on the list
as one of the dream men this year.

10
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,492
Do you know...

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,461
...he is a nephew
deputy director general of police?

12
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,615
His father is
permanent assistant secretary.

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,000
Her older brother proposed
to be a representative.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,823
His family is full
with great people.

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,440
It's clear, he comes from
from a respected family.

16
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,720
But I think
he's not that attractive.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,789
He is just someone
who likes to show off wealth.

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,440
Come on, he's our age.

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
Or he is a little older than us.
What else do you expect from him.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,624
But you have to
thinking about the future.

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,173
He definitely has a bright future,
grew up in this family.

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,104
What are you waiting for?
Get close to him!

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,532
Can't.

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,440
You can't
tease her like a man...

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,950
...that you invite to do
one night stand.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,789
He would misunderstand and think
I want something from him.

27
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,836
Misunderstanding or not?

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,671
Just think I'll tease him
indirectly here.

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,729
I will wait for him
come to me.

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
Oh yeah, Gale.

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,815
Tor asked me to ask you...

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,803
...when will you
reply to the message?

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,497
When will you
stop matching me?

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,200
- I told you I don't want a boyfriend.
- Just talk to him.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,040
There is no harm in it.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
He is nice.

37
00:02:57,948 --> 00:02:59,695
If he is good, then why
you're not dating her?

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,320
Why did you
introduce him to me?

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
He likes you, not me.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Not true.

41
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,920
I know he tried
date you first.

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,749
But you don't like it.

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,120
Well, I've talked to him.
and he's not my type.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,684
So I introduced him
to you, good, right?

45
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,776
Thank you for your kindness,
but no need.

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,198
I want to go to the bathroom.

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Gale.

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,215
Advertisements that
you auditioned...

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,935
...the director has already chosen
others.

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,787
Thank You
has come for the audition.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Thank You
already told me.

52
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,340
Please tell me
if there is another audition.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,000
Excuse me.

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,666
It doesn't matter.

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,177
Are you Queen's friend?

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Correct.

57
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Well...

58
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,137
...you look very familiar.

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Have I known you before?

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,038
Are you a star?

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
Correct.

62
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,455
I think so.

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,508
Well, right?

64
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,836
I already guessed!

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,499
I've been watching you for a long time.

66
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,215
If you want to talk
with Queen...

67
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,495
...then go
talk to him.

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,578
Don't take advantage of me.

69
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,236
I don't want to
become a matchmaker.

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Wait.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,912
Why do I want to?
talk to him?

72
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,236
Can I ask for something?
your IG account?

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,622
He approached me.

74
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,120
That man.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,314
He doesn't like you, Queen.

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,753
He likes me.

77
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,267
Are you going home?

78
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,644
I will take you there.

79
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,068
Have you ever thought...

80
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,718
...your life will be better...

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,597
...if you don't know Queen?

82
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
What?

83
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,765
I can't go home.

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
I…

85
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,021
I'm afraid to meet
with him there.

86
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,081
You can stay here.

87
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,742
At least it's safe.

88
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,604
Thank You.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,981
But I feel bad.

90
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,331
Do not take it wrong.

91
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,840
I don't doubt you
at all.

92
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,215
I only…

93
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,358
It doesn't matter.

94
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,283
I understand.

95
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,762
Where will you stay?

96
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,415
I'm sorry I have to ask you to leave.

97
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,354
Gale gets into trouble
and he wants to stay here.

98
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,185
It's okay. From the start.
I don't plan on staying overnight.

99
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,427
Are you going to see the police tomorrow?

100
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:45,240
Not yet. I will go in.
my morning class first.

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,227
I skip school too often,
I don't want to fail.

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,291
But I will go
after my class.

103
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,086
I think you should tell
the police to talk to Peanut.

104
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,307
Otherwise, I guess...

105
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,271
...they won't be too
trust us.

106
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,503
I will check
Peanuts tomorrow.

107
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,412
Thank You.

108
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,733
GALE: I WILL BE THERE SOON

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,244
Gale is almost there.

110
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,528
Come on.

111
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,711
Did you forget something?

112
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,360
No. Come on.

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,800
My friend is coming. Go.

114
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Okay.

115
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,448
Contact me if anything happens
anything, anytime.

116
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,920
Thank You.
Be careful when driving.

117
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Gale.

118
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,240
Go.

119
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,867
Of course.
I will call you tomorrow.

120
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
Who's that?

121
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,831
I'll tell you later.

122
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,037
I didn't interrupt anything, did I?

123
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
No. Come on.

124
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,977
It seems you can't
wear my clothes.

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,269
But before Queen
stay here.

126
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:45,843
And he left
the clothes are here.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,405
You don't mind?

128
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,559
It doesn't matter.

129
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,903
We always take turns
wear the clothes.

130
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,979
Not really. Well...

131
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,323
...at that time
Queen is still alive.

132
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,880
Should we change?
the topic of conversation?

133
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Change what?

134
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,400
Something exciting.

135
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,660
About that man.

136
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,378
What's his name?

137
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,930
Chivas, right?

138
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:36,375
I told you...

139
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,496
...he's like
Queen's older sister.

140
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,535
And he wanted to know what
what actually happened.

141
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,360
I don't want to know
about him and Queen.

142
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,077
I want to know
about you and him.

143
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,693
What? That night you met
with him at the nightclub...

144
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,367
...and he approached you, right?

145
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,785
What's next?

146
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,943
Let's make it like this.

147
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,615
If I tell you
about him...

148
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,932
...you have to tell me
about Athens, okay?

149
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,544
But we don't have
any relationship.

150
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,932
Oh really? Are you sure?

151
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,905
Come on, tell me.
Chivas, right?

152
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,200
How?

153
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,400
I want to take a shower.

154
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,560
Come on, tell me.

155
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,185
I want to take a shower.

156
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,416
DELETE PHOTO?
CANCELLED

157
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Gale.

158
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,600
Are you sure you want to go to class?

159
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:56,735
Actually,
you can just stay in my room.

160
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,521
Toy won't know where you are.

161
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,843
No. I don't want to run.

162
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,052
I don't know how much longer
I have to run.

163
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:05,805
Hmm.

164
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,895
Don't worry.

165
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,548
When you are with me...

166
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,802
...I won't let it happen
Toy will do anything to you.

167
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,615
How about you?

168
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,932
What will you do?
You didn't go to the police?

169
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,080
I have spoken
with Athens.

170
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,095
I will wait
until Peanut wakes up.

171
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,920
He who will speak
with the police.

172
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,142
Gale.

173
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,680
Huh? Toy!

174
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,104
What is
what are you doing here?

175
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,369
I don't want to talk to you,
damn woman!

176
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,702
Move!
I want to talk to my boyfriend.

177
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Your boyfriend?

178
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,345
You can't
calling her your girlfriend again.

179
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,935
- I told you to move!
- Hey!

180
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,400
- Get out of my way! You jerk!
- Enough!

181
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,280
It's enough.
This is a campus.

182
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,137
Be civilized.

183
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,215
We have to find a place
to talk alone.

184
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,657
No, don't talk to him.

185
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,296
- The board...
- Don't!

186
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:05,056
I need to talk to him.

187
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,919
I don't want to
draws attention here.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on.

189
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:29,665
Is Athens with you?

190
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,692
No problem?

191
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,855
Please tell him
if he skips practice one more time...

192
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,994
...I won't invite him
join the swimming team.

193
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,610
What do you want to talk about?

194
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,620
Hurry up. I have class.

195
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,885
Why?

196
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,732
You have to delete
all our photos on your IG?

197
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,493
Isn't that a bit excessive?

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,200
No,
compared to your actions.

199
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,805
What if the journalist
ask this?

200
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,546
I will tell them.

201
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:13,387
Tell me what?

202
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,200
Which are actually.

203
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,738
What is the reason for a woman
delete your girlfriend's photo on IG?

204
00:14:20,397 --> 00:14:21,397
But...

205
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,934
Do you want to break up with me?

206
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Can't.

207
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,619
This is not funny.

208
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Funny?

209
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,095
You think this is a joke?

210
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Gale.

211
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

212
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,916
I want to ask.

213
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,673
Aren't you tired of saying that?

214
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
You said it was your fault,
what's wrong with you?

215
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,762
Hurt me?

216
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,280
Or because it becomes
drug dealer?

217
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,573
Or because you cover up
Queen's corpse problem?

218
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Gale.

219
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,383
I can explain.

220
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,262
Don't waste your time
explain anything.

221
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,372
Save your explanation
to the police.

222
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,088
From now on your life will be
face more problems.

223
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,622
You have to focus
take care of your life.

224
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,095
No.

225
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,405
- We have to talk about it.
- Enough.

226
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,162
There is nothing more necessary
he talked to you.

227
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Let's go.

228
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,155
Seriously? From the source
that can be trusted, right?

229
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,400
Yes, last night...

230
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,820
...my friends are partying
at RJ's place.

231
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:38,410
He says
RJ tells it all...

232
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,519
...if on the night of the Queen's death...

233
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,662
...RJ is high on drugs.

234
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,463
And Papang sleeps
with swimming club members.

235
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Hey!

236
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,430
Once upon a time I was a murderer.

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,338
Now you change the plot?

238
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
Well...

239
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,575
...there is a new source.

240
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,394
We just update the news.

241
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,608
The three of you
no brain, huh?

242
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,090
You guys don't know
what is true and not true?

243
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,992
Or do you think
can you just talk?

244
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,302
Then tell me...

245
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,742
...what is the truth.

246
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,796
We want to know too.

247
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,958
- Come on, say it.
- Forget it.

248
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,695
There is no point
talk to them.

249
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,202
After all they are looking for
fake news.

250
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Come on.

251
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,191
Never mind, the truth
will be revealed soon.

252
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,255
Let them talk.

253
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,740
Don't mind them.

254
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
ATHENS

255
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Where are you?

256
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,345
Coach Kwang
asked me to ask you.

257
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,720
Oh yes?

258
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,329
It's okay. Where are you?

259
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,369
In the hospital,
check out Peanut.

260
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,137
How is Peanut?
Is he awake?

261
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:04,269
He was moved to another place.

262
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Huh?

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,204
What did you say?

264
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:08,962
Where is he now?

265
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,815
I also do not know...

266
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,680
...the staff here is not
say anything.

267
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,472
I called their parents and
no one answered. Strange, right?

268
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Hello?

269
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,718
You are okay?

270
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,184
Where are you?

271
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,584
In the classroom.

272
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,092
Nothing. I'm just trying.
thinking about what's next.

273
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
Okay,
I'll be there soon.

274
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Okay.

275
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:40,695
What is it?

276
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,085
Athens called and
said Peanut disappeared.

277
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,440
He didn't know Peanut had moved.
to another hospital or somewhere.

278
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,225
Does it have any effect?

279
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,460
Of course.

280
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:52,148
He is the only witness who can
confirmation of the issue of covering up Queen's body.

281
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,895
It means from now on...

282
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,533
...if we say something to
police, that would be unbelievable.

283
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,060
I think RJ must be there
relation to this.

284
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,815
Maybe Toy.

285
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Where?

286
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Where?

287
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,656
Hey, where are you going?

288
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:30,156
I also do not know.

289
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,757
I'm confused.

290
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,360
I don't know
what to do next.

291
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,320
Take it easy.

292
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,501
All is certain
will be solved later.

293
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,681
Hi darling.

294
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,080
Where are you taking Peanut?
You moved him, right?

295
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,473
Where's Peanut?

296
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,360
Unlucky!

297
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,196
He was just transferred
to another hospital.

298
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Where to?

299
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,953
Ask his parents.

300
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,772
I also do not know.

301
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,109
Never think
you can get away with your actions.

302
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,360
I will make you
pay for your actions.

303
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,714
Pay what?

304
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,533
I didn't do anything.

305
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,647
Queen who did
all this by myself.

306
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,449
And Toy, your girlfriend...

307
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,547
...messed everything up.

308
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,074
But you drugged me.

309
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,641
According to you
who told me?

310
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Queen.

311
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,344
I didn't do it
anything to you.

312
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,520
Papang, don't waste it
time to talk to him.

313
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,679
Let's go.

314
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Darling.

315
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,987
Why don't we
end this easily?

316
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,100
Actually, neither of us need to
be in trouble like this.

317
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,440
Listen to me.

318
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,297
I can
confirm your location.

319
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,451
So you don't need to
talk to the police.

320
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,873
We can both get through this
easily.

321
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,058
I will never
lie to anyone.

322
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,658
And I definitely wouldn't want to
lying for someone like you!

323
00:19:55,118 --> 00:19:56,545
Up to you.

324
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,175
If you think you are telling the truth
and people will trust you...

325
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
...go ahead!

326
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Do!

327
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,020
Let's just go.

328
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,160
Unlucky.

329
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,763
Where are you?
Why aren't you in class?

330
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,243
No. I'm home.

331
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,900
Do you want me to come?

332
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,750
No need, you have to
swimming practice, right?

333
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,223
Gale.

334
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,879
You should break up with Toy.

335
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,317
He is like a monster
hurting both of us physically.

336
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,163
And he was involved with
drug dealer.

337
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,556
If you continue dating him,
then you are an idiot.

338
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,469
Forgive me.

339
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,536
I...

340
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,583
I got too carried away.

341
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,473
Let's talk about your problem.

342
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,415
Are you sure
don't want to go to the police?

343
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,312
Because of being drugged by RJ
and his friends?

344
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,087
What is the point?

345
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,817
I don't have any proof anyway.

346
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,551
- But I think…
- I have to find evidence.

347
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,565
Or should I
make them confess.

348
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,560
How are you?

349
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,092
I…

350
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,759
I'm trying.

351
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,237
Why this crazy thing
befall us?

352
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:38,079
Why?

353
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Hey, Guy.

354
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,118
Where's Peanut?

355
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Who knows.

356
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,944
Come on,
how could you not know?

357
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:15,369
Damn it!

358
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,080
Please.

359
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,281
Can you not interfere?

360
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Why?

361
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,654
You're afraid I'll find out
all your evil deeds?

362
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,879
Don't worry.
Peanut told me everything.

363
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,935
He said you guys
hypnotize Papang...

364
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,210
...until he was unconscious
and don't remember anything.

365
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,049
And you work together with Toy
to cover up the Queen's corpse issue.

366
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,855
If you are so sure...

367
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,360
...then go to the police.

368
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,946
What are you doing here?

369
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,576
Why did you appear here?

370
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:49,360
Huh?

371
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,589
The coach allowed me
back to practice.

372
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,489
If he knew
all your evil deeds...

373
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,440
...I'm certain
he will fire you.

374
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
What action?

375
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Oh yes.

376
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,266
Because Papang let us
sleep with him?

377
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Watch your words!

378
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,880
Stop! Stop now!

379
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,400
Stop it now!
What happened?

380
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,360
Hey.

381
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,520
It's the first day
I let you in.

382
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,280
- Do you want to be punished again?
- He started it.

383
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,440
- Shut up! No!
- Watch your words!

384
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
Stop! Both of you!

385
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Enough!

386
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,895
Start warming up. All of you.

387
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
Go!

388
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,950
Go! Now! Quickly!

389
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:35,935
Can't it just be one day?
are we calm?

390
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,258
You guys are always fighting.

391
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
Athens.

392
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Let's talk.

393
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,472
Are you serious about this?

394
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,954
I won't lie
about something like this.

395
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:55,760
The three of them drugged Papang.

396
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,920
And they use drugs
with Queen before she died.

397
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,981
Peanut himself who
tell me everything.

398
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,976
Before telling me
about other people...

399
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,331
...you have to focus
on yourself.

400
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,128
Why did you just show up?

401
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,800
The swimming competition is approaching.

402
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,726
I told you so
You should practice harder.

403
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,521
The actions of RJ and his friends
very cruel.

404
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,760
They are involved in drugs...

405
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,175
...sexual harassment...

406
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,175
...cover the corpse
and lie to everyone.

407
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,080
Besides that, I don't see them.
feel guilty at all.

408
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,829
Okay. I understand.

409
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,880
To be honest,
I don't really like RJ.

410
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,349
I have no power to issue
anyone from the club, you understand?

411
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,975
We have to report
this to the committee.

412
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,640
RJ's father is
sponsor of this university.

413
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,193
At least, we have to report
and investigate them.

414
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,920
Where is the proof? Do you have it?

415
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:50,579
Or you can rely on
Peanut's words.

416
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,520
But he definitely wasn't lying.

417
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,392
I believe he is honest with me.

418
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,970
He disappeares
just like this.

419
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,050
Leave it to the police
carry out his duties.

420
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,653
If they investigate RJ
and he is guilty...

421
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:07,576
...I will definitely
teach him a lesson.

422
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,126
But now,
focus on yourself.

423
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,575
I am not sure...

424
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,376
...you are the right person
for the next race.

425
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,461
If your performance is like this,
I have to reconsider.

426
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,077
I don't mind.

427
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,157
I promise after
all this chaos ends...

428
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,255
...I will focus on training.

429
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,415
If you still
consider...

430
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,495
...I'm not the right person,
then I will accept it.

431
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,200
But RJ's actions were different.

432
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,941
They did evil
and we have to do something.

433
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,394
Otherwise, it's like we're protecting
bad people and the club's reputation will be ruined.

434
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Okay.

435
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,520
You mean you're angry?
about this...

436
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,395
...because you are so
worrying about our club.

437
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,535
But are you sure about that?

438
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,244
People do not receive justice
what they deserve.

439
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,255
Including Queen
who is dead...

440
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,758
...and Papang which
drugged and trapped.

441
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,715
So the bottom line is...

442
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,255
...you love more
that woman...

443
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,110
...compared to this club which can
give you a better future.

444
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Coach.

445
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,238
I think you're better
from RJ.

446
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,938
Eventually...

447
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,648
...you use 'that' more
than your brain.

448
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,106
You are just as disappointing
like RJ.

449
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,425
How come
you become like this?

450
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,532
This is nothing more than
just doing the right thing.

451
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Okay.

452
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,387
You can be disappointed in me.

453
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,921
Hearing you say it
out loud...

454
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,347
...then I also lost
my trust in you.

455
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,874
Where do you want to go?

456
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,874
If my attitude reflects
your words...

457
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,216
...I guess I shouldn't
be here.

458
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,512
Where do you want to go?

459
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,760
This morning,
anti-narcotics police...

460
00:28:44,802 --> 00:28:47,240
...raiding a house
in Sereethai...

461
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,200
...owned by
Kiatkampol Premkit...

462
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,695
...or Pepper,
big drug dealer.

463
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,499
Police found a number of
large amount of drugs in his residence...

464
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,800
...including cocaine and narcotics
for one night's love...

465
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,463
...which is a new type of anesthetic
and widely used.

466
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,840
However, the police could not
found Pepper...

467
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
...the owner of the house.

468
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,860
The police have issued
warrant for his arrest.

469
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,992
It means...

470
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,017
...we can't do it
anything on Toy?

471
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,726
They must be friends
with the police.

472
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,508
Someone told Pepper
so that he could escape in time.

473
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:28,095
They are worried
if Pepper is captured...

474
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,813
...Pepper will call Toy.

475
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,999
Papang just told me...

476
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,135
...a person who can be a witness to Toy
cover up the Queen's corpse issue...

477
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,233
...also disappeared
from the hospital.

478
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
What?

479
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,528
We have no evidence
which leads to them.

480
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,836
Gale. We have to postpone.
fitting schedule.

481
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:01,213
MAKE A CALL?

482
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,720
Hello, Gale?

483
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Hello.

484
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,617
What is the problem?
I thought you were rushing to shoot.

485
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
The executive team wants to postpone it.

486
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,520
They said
there may be changes.

487
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,679
I also do not know.

488
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,135
Gale...

489
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,903
...I think you should talk.
on management.

490
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,793
I am also confused
with this.

491
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,235
Sure. Thank you.

492
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,499
There is a problem?

493
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,480
There isn't any.

494
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,550
Are you busy?

495
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:56,899
No.

496
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,557
Can I come in?

497
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,159
So, what are you going to do?

498
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,447
Are you going to the police?

499
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Not yet.

500
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,775
I have no proof.
I don't think it will be of much use.

501
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,215
Don't stress.
I will help you find evidence.

502
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,340
We can persuade Guy or…

503
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,000
- ...forcing RJ to…
- Hey!

504
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,002
You are not
should you practice swimming?

505
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,769
Swimming competition
next month, right?

506
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,749
That is not important.

507
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,367
Your problems are more important.

508
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,724
What is the problem?

509
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,960
Actually, I think…

510
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,956
...you should stop getting involved
in this matter.

511
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,546
I don't want to
you are wasting your time.

512
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,347
And I don't want you to throw it away
your future for this.

513
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,440
I quit the club.

514
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
What?

515
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,617
Are you crazy?

516
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:14,000
I told you so
your problems are more important.

517
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,543
I can't let you go
facing this alone.

518
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,575
- Whatever it is, I will help.
- But I don't want to.

519
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
What?

520
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,000
Actually, we don't have any
any relationship.

521
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,615
We're not even best friends.

522
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,691
I don't want to feel guilty if
you threw away your future for me.

523
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Wait.

524
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,086
What do you mean we don't have any?
any relationship?

525
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,960
How can you say that?
We…

526
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,340
I just want
revenge on Queen.

527
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,108
It was just a one-night stand, okay?

528
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:48,600
The board.

529
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,615
If something bothers you,
just say it.

530
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,617
Don't get too carried away.

531
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,320
There isn't anything.

532
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
I guess…

533
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,456
...it's easier if
you are not near me.

534
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,023
Yes, it should be better.

535
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,101
I need to be alone.

536
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,311
Can you go?

537
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,251
I said go away.

538
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,416
Didn't you hear me?

539
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,693
Are you serious?

540
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,668
Go.

541
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,733
Okay.

542
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,760
I have done it
according to your words.

543
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,081
I have ordered
Athens moves away.

544
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,947
Are you sure?

545
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:39,415
If you don't believe,
you should wait and find out.

546
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,032
Only that
that's all I can say.

547
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:44,669
Good, if Athens
no longer near you...

548
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,195
...i will send a video
about that night to the police.

549
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,811
And you definitely can
take down RJ.

550
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,811
Who are you?

551
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,066
Why do you have access?
to Queen's account?

552
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,120
And why do you have the clip?

553
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,200
Why did you upload the photo?
to trap me?

554
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,809
Who am I?

555
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,863
I am Queen.

556
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,920
Just think of all this chaos
can be ended,

557
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,360
problem i help you
or not, depends on me.

558
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,295
Watch your behavior.

559
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,445
And I will help you
get through this problem.

560
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,106
Don't tell anyone,
especially the police.

561
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,572
Otherwise, I will
erase all evidence.

562
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,273
And you will have nothing
to catch them.

563
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,959
What happened to my drama shooting?
You did it?

564
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,804
You got a role in this drama,
to replace Queen...

565
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,896
...because I asked the team
to choose you.

566
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,474
If you want to break up with me...

567
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:16,231
...then you lose
this job offer. That's all.

568
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,054
So, this is what you want?

569
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,905
I told you that right now...

570
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,919
...we need to hold on tight.

571
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,418
Every time
you let go of my hand...

572
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,164
...both of us...

573
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,128
...will both be destroyed.

574
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,001
What do you want?

575
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,375
It should be me who
ask you that.

576
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:06,087
What do you want from me?

577
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,474
Why are you still
meddling in my affairs?

578
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,599
You are quite responsible
for your evil deeds.

579
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,070
You too
must be responsible.

580
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Minnie?

581
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,095
You also believe...

582
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,034
...I wouldn't know
you sent it?

583
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,925
I can kill him.

584
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:37,476
But I didn't...

585
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:40,160
...because I want to
talk to you nicely.

586
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,501
I ask people
find out your background.

587
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,914
I know you are funded by the mafia.
to open a company.

588
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,706
If I send this
to related organizations...

589
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,713
...you want to know...

590
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,711
...between you and me...

591
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,177
...who among us
which will fall first.

592
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:10,605
You have to stop
do your thing.

593
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,842
So we don't need to
relate.

594
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:16,797
Unlucky!

595
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:20,565
Just a stoned and silly girl
fall from the building...

596
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:24,183
...why are you digging
this information continues?

597
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,895
The woman is
the most important person in my life.

598
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,106
What did I do wrong?

599
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,461
I even
don't want him to die.

600
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:33,575
What is the truth
what do you want from me?

601
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,815
What do I want?

602
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,760
You sold drugs to RJ
and lie to the police...

603
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,731
...about Queen
and that's cruel enough.

604
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,901
I guess
our thoughts are not aligned.

605
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,749
What should I do
with this woman?

606
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
How?

607
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,217
I asked
for the last time...

608
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,434
...do you want...

609
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,214
...stop this or not.

610
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:22,362
Minnie.

611
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Okay.

612
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,534
I will stop.

613
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,095
Are you done?

614
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Minnie.

615
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,354
And you have to stay away from my boyfriend.

616
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,438
Who is your lover?

617
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,379
He considers you his girlfriend?

618
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:54,681
After all your evil deeds
to him and his friends.

619
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,972
I have straightened it out
my problem with him.

620
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,762
It's not difficult...

621
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,775
...make up with
a woman.

622
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Come on.

623
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,568
Minnie?

624
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,041
How are you?

625
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
Minnie?

626
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,403
CHIVAS

627
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,896
CLASS WILL BEGIN.

628
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,226
OKAY, CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
I WILL PICK YOU UP.

629
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,548
Where is Papang?

630
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,345
He doesn't want to wake up early.

631
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,385
Toy asked me to be his girlfriend.

632
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,418
Oh yeah? That's good.

633
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,680
You?

634
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,475
Are you mad at me?

635
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,108
You think I'm mad at you?

636
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:23,276
Hey.

637
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,757
Don't worry.

638
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:28,945
It's good that he's dating you.

639
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,880
He is perfect for you.

640
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:34,761
I hope your relationship lasts.
