1
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,480
Lately
I didn't see you.

2
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,120
Well, you're busy.

3
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,880
Me too.

4
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Busy doing what?

5
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,610
Get along with
your new friends?

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Queen?

7
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,470
Just say it
What do you think?

8
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,787
I just wanted to know...

9
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:04,616
...why do you have to
spending too much money?

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,023
Where did you get the money from?

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,280
You buy a lot
high-end products.

12
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,580
Not to mention your luxurious lifestyle
on social media.

13
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Why?

14
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,740
You think you're the only one
who has a better lifestyle?

15
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:20,380
You don't see
how many followers do i have?

16
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,540
I uploaded one photo and
I make hundreds of thousands.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,975
Excuse me.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,463
You can fool others
about this but I don't.

19
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,945
There are no online influencers
can make that much money...

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,521
...unless involved in
something illegal.

21
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,990
I want you to be honest.

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,668
What have you been up to lately?

23
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,235
What I do
none of your business.

24
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,338
Because I'm worried about you.

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,899
Better worry
yourself.

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,589
You say
I did something illegal.

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
What a hypocrite.

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,593
You think I don't know?

29
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,394
About the funds you use
to open a company.

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,520
The funds come from
international mafia.

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,868
You pretend to be humble.

32
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,747
Because of you
don't want to be investigated, right?

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,840
Our positions are both the same.

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,806
We fight hard
to reach this point.

35
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,883
I won't judge you.

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,178
And you can't judge me.

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,857
We both should
living our lives separately.

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Okay.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,589
I don't mind that.

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,299
Please return my car...

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,820
...if you think so
we may not meet again.

42
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,480
The car you use
is mine.

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
No.

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,509
Let's think of it as...

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,902
...a gift to silence me
about you.

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,455
When we were in high school...

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
...I always wonder.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,140
If the Queen family
very rich...

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,500
...why does he use
cheap phones?

50
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,260
Why doesn't he wear it?
expensive clothes?

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,928
One day, he said...

52
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,860
...his parents wanted to teach him
about frugal living.

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,119
Who am I to question
my friend's life?

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,700
When we started college...

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,340
...I saw Queen
buy luxury goods.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,535
He manipulated me
to believe that...

57
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,100
...his parents allowed him
spend more money.

58
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,252
Well...

59
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,615
...if you know him well enough...

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,175
...then you know...

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,900
...he will explain anything
to support his actions.

62
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,683
Do you know?
the turning point for him to become rich?

63
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,792
Because he's dating someone.

64
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,170
And you may know him.

65
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Pepper?

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Correct.

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,701
Her name is Pepper
and he is a drug dealer.

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,290
And your boyfriend is
his business partner.

69
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,230
Hey, you can't
rambling like that.

70
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,935
Think about my words carefully.

71
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,681
Queen's life seems to be improving
after knowing him.

72
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,214
And Queen introduces
Pepper your girlfriend.

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,721
After that...

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,760
...your boyfriend starts
various types of business...

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,498
...including restaurant franchises...

76
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,288
...workshops and aesthetic businesses.

77
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,190
It's strange too.

78
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,944
Your boyfriend was born into a famous family
but he is not very skilled in business.

79
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,964
You should know
about it.

80
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,933
The business was never a huge success,
none.

81
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,678
Ever since he met Pepper...

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,558
...he succeeded in everything
that he invested in.

83
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,781
Your boyfriend might be involved
in money laundering.

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,587
If you know a lot
about this...

85
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,574
...Why did you
not going to the police?

86
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,960
I have no proof.

87
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:22,583
Well, right?

88
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:24,740
Who are you to dare?
talk in detail about this?

89
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,864
But Queen has.

90
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Hello?

91
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:48,966
Hey.

92
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,480
If I die...

93
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:53,999
...meaning someone killed me.

94
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
What?

95
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,062
Are you drunk? Where are you?

96
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,071
I'm serious.

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,440
I keep the evidence
someone's cruel actions.

98
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,009
And they sent me
threatening message.

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,181
Wait.

100
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:10,780
Who are you trying to blackmail?

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,386
I don't understand.

102
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,020
Why are you still
live your life like this?

103
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:16,642
Queen?

104
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,949
I call you
to tell you.

105
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,270
If I don't die...

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,781
...then ignore me.

107
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,827
ONE NIGHT STAND CLUB
APRIL FOOLS DAY PARTY

108
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,194
I can't find him
when I got there.

109
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,962
But I met you.

110
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,495
Queen said
someone tried to kill him.

111
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,879
And he died.

112
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,743
My question is...

113
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,687
...Queen tries...

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,771
...blackmailing who?

115
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
So?

116
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,909
Why do you think
that person is my boyfriend?

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,505
Not many people are guilty
who was involved with Queen.

118
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,735
I'm wasting my time
listening to your silly stories.

119
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,760
You don't know anything.

120
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,960
What you just said...

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,975
...is an assumption
your own fault.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,203
None of them are true.

123
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,235
In that case
you have to prove it.

124
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,215
Why is your boyfriend manipulating you?
to convince the police...

125
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,711
...that you are with him
that night?

126
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,535
Its name is Chivas.

127
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,420
He is the owner of CFB company.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,415
He doesn't stand out,
not famous.

129
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,008
We don't know
if he is a candidate for someone.

130
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,495
He has known Queen for a long time.

131
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
And now…

132
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,008
...he's bothering your girlfriend.

133
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,664
I don't care
her relationship with Queen.

134
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,739
I won't let it happen
just get away with it.

135
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,471
- Can you calm down?
- How can I calm down?

136
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:19,800
He's bothering my girlfriend.

137
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,305
Aren't we
Having enough trouble?

138
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Excuse me.

139
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,159
I'm not angry or anything.

140
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,300
But you have to end the problem
with Queen first.

141
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,740
Then I will
help you...

142
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,597
...take care of it.

143
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Okay?

144
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,260
You've made a deal
with the police?

145
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,780
I gave him what he asked for,
still waiting for the answer.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,980
Just give it to him.

147
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,828
For this to end.

148
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,580
Don't worry too much
about money.

149
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,740
I'm most worried about RJ.

150
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:02,140
I am not sure
can he take care of Papang.

151
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,972
Ten,

152
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,640
nine, eight,

153
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,398
seven, six,

154
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,105
five, four,

155
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
three, two,

156
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,521
another.

157
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,920
I've been gone for a long time.

158
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,170
I hope
you still remember me.

159
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,927
I died just a few days ago...

160
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,119
...and my friend
looks so happy.

161
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,615
As I expected.

162
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,717
But I was shocked too quickly.

163
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,730
If you are in the mood,
you can't pick the right time.

164
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
You are right
in this case, Makham.

165
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,175
More predictable
than the drama plot.

166
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,166
Lift.

167
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Three, four,

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
five, six

169
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,996
seven eight

170
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,456
nine, ten. And ten more.

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,800
nine, eight,

172
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,132
seven, six,

173
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,353
five, four,

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,800
three, two, one.

175
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Continue.

176
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,003
What are you doing here?

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,675
Nothing. Just hanging out.
and waiting for friends.

178
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,045
Students may not use
this swimming pool.

179
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,994
Swimmers only
who can use this pool.

180
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,743
I'm not here
to use the swimming pool.

181
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,149
I'm just hanging out
and waiting for friends.

182
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,640
I want you to be honest.

183
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,635
You don't have
any shame at all?

184
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,516
Your parents pay for your studies,
not for you to pay attention to men.

185
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,102
Go,
My team can't concentrate.

186
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,640
Hey, Coach?

187
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,000
As a student
international program...

188
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,719
...I pay expensive school fees
for swimming pool maintenance...

189
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,895
...that I can't use
and maybe your salary too.

190
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
I don't think I'm guilty
hanging out by the pool.

191
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,132
- Hey.
- Uh…

192
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,052
There is a problem?

193
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,580
Get back to practice.

194
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,520
- I mean…
- No problem.

195
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,987
I can hang out
at another place.

196
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,141
Call me when you're done.

197
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:19,860
Return.

198
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,213
Good.

199
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Hello?

200
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,210
Papang, where are you?

201
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Campus.

202
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,474
Do you have class today?

203
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,632
There isn't any.
But I need to talk to Athens.

204
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,615
You guys...

205
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,900
...talking about her IG post
The recent Queen, right?

206
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,333
You called me
to talk about this?

207
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
No.

208
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,306
Where?

209
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,160
What Queen
ever talked...

210
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,045
...about Toy with you?

211
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,520
You mean?

212
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,480
I know Queen
talking about me behind my back.

213
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,447
I want to know
about that, what about Toy?

214
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,338
Actually,
Queen talked about it but...

215
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,895
...I didn't pay attention.

216
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,420
What did he say? I…

217
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Gale?

218
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,435
You are okay.

219
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Toys?

220
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Gale?

221
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,610
Are you still talking to me?

222
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
Toys?

223
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,661
What are you doing here?

224
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Why?

225
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,660
I can't
visit your house?

226
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,730
Sure it is allowed.
But you didn't tell me.

227
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,940
Is it necessary?

228
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,384
When you go out
meet the man...

229
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,516
...you never
tell me first.

230
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:12,107
What do you mean?

231
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Where is my mother?

232
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,560
Moms!

233
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,220
Your mother is not here.

234
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,980
Last night your mother was drunk,
he called to borrow 400,000 from me.

235
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,380
I guess
he is at the casino right now.

236
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,780
Gale?

237
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,275
Gale?
Can you hear me?

238
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Gale?

239
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,532
PAPAN

240
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,480
Tell me...

241
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,998
...What are you
and the man is talking about?

242
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,860
- You told someone to follow me?
- I care about you.

243
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,172
Hard to believe
you do that.

244
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Care?

245
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,297
What do you care?

246
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,480
You are afraid
your secret will be revealed?

247
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,380
Shut up!

248
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,775
I wasn't with you that night.

249
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Stop rambling!

250
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,767
I don't remember anything.

251
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,479
But I'm sure I don't
with you that night.

252
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:14,820
- I told you to be quiet!
- Because I'm with him.

253
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
You lie.

254
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,040
Toy, what are you doing?
to Queen?

255
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,900
- Tell me what you are hiding.
- Shut up!

256
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,580
Why don't you do it?
according to my words?

257
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Why is that?

258
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,980
Why are you doing this?

259
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:51,936
PAPAN

260
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,256
PAPAN

261
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,293
Rest for 10 minutes.

262
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,744
Come on.

263
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,680
Come on, come on.

264
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,295
I need to talk to Gale.
This is urgent.

265
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,782
I will call you
after it finishes.

266
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,373
OKAY.

267
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,592
Does it hurt?

268
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,220
I don't want to do it.

269
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,020
When I see you hurt...

270
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,500
...I feel sad.

271
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,853
Do you know
how much I love you.

272
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,420
I can't stay silent
and do nothing...

273
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,100
...when I see you
hanging out with other men.

274
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,191
Gale...

275
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,620
What is he doing?

276
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:58,820
He poisons your mind
With what?

277
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:04,694
Gale.

278
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,620
We've been dating
for two years.

279
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,786
You need to talk
straight to me.

280
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,521
In a situation like this...

281
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,831
...we need to trust each other...

282
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,907
...and hold each other
hands tightly.

283
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,060
If not,
our story is over.

284
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,420
Gale.

285
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:39,020
Nothing is
love you like me.

286
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,419
Hear.

287
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,726
I'm so mad at you...

288
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,620
...and I even
doesn't make you bleed.

289
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,260
We have to promise...

290
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,420
...we will trust each other.

291
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,282
We will not hurt
someone else.

292
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay?

293
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,640
Where?
Why are you here?

294
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,614
Where's Gale?

295
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,230
He is not feeling well
so he took a nap.

296
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,095
You can't
meet him today.

297
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,140
- I have to meet him.
- I told you he was resting.

298
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,720
Move!

299
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Gale?

300
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Gale?

301
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,255
Who hurt you?

302
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,300
You are okay?

303
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,335
You hurt my friend?
You bastard!

304
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:54,295
- Come on!
- None of your business!

305
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,455
Go away from here!

306
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,055
No! You go!

307
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,040
You bastard!
You hurt him!

308
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,501
I told you to go away!

309
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:03,709
Come on!

310
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Stop!

311
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:26,683
Toys!

312
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,720
Toy, I…

313
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:28,861
Forgive me.

314
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,020
What are you doing?

315
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Sick.

316
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Here!

317
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,540
- Let me go!
- You want that?

318
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,980
Toys?

319
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,501
Toys?

320
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:41,608
Toys?

321
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,642
- Toys?
- You want that?

322
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:45,540
Toys...

323
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,120
...let him go.

324
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,559
Or I'll stab you!

325
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:53,741
You think I won't do it?

326
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:00,020
Call the police.

327
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,820
Call the police! Quickly!

328
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,500
Gale!

329
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,072
Okay! Just me.

330
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:13,180
Toy, go away.

331
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:16,460
Hello?

332
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,030
There is a man who tries
physically harming women.

333
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,100
No.
He tried to kill.

334
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:22,534
Toys!

335
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,133
Okay!

336
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,043
You should go to sleep
with one eye open.

337
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:30,613
Correct.

338
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,260
The address is…

339
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,060
Sorry. He misunderstood.

340
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:49,140
Yes.

341
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,868
He is here with me.
I will invite him.

342
00:21:58,725 --> 00:21:59,725
Hey!

343
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:02,420
RJ throws a party at his place.

344
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,300
He wants me to invite you.

345
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,260
He needs to talk to you.

346
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:11,338
Can I refuse?

347
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,336
What's wrong with you?

348
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:15,737
I don't want to go.

349
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,625
I'm tired.
I need a break.

350
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:19,580
Stop being stupid
like this.

351
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,900
You know it clearly
we have to stay together.

352
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,100
I don't want to go. I don't want to.
close to all of you.

353
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,340
You bastard!

354
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,260
Hey!

355
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,140
Why did you attack him?

356
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:40,380
If he doesn't want to hang out...

357
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,220
...why are you forcing him?

358
00:22:58,613 --> 00:22:59,580
Peanut, wait.

359
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,420
I need to talk to you.

360
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:12,561
WARNING: DRUG USE
SERIOUS IMPACT ON NERVES AND BRAIN

361
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:24,340
Hey!

362
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:26,340
I think Peanut
will mess it up.

363
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,820
Are you feeling better?

364
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,740
I feel better,
how about you?

365
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,399
I am alright.

366
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:56,654
He beat you like that
and you're still okay?

367
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,418
Why did you
not filing a claim?

368
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,465
And then after that?

369
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I'm about to shoot a drama.

370
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,940
It's bad enough
I was involved with the Queen incident.

371
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,282
If people knew about this...

372
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,978
...what will I do?

373
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Oh.

374
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,085
Queen used to speak
about Toy.

375
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,980
He says
Toy often hurts women.

376
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:27,820
I didn't pay attention.

377
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,860
I can't believe it's true.

378
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,980
I think if that's true...

379
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,380
...people like you won't
humble yourself to date her.

380
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,608
How many times?
he did this to you?

381
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,495
Several times.

382
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,880
When he's angry...

383
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,172
...he can't
control his anger.

384
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,980
But it doesn't happen very often.

385
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Hey...

386
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,255
He can't
do this to you...

387
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,860
...even once.

388
00:25:00,305 --> 00:25:01,975
Why did you let him?
do this to you?

389
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,442
You love him that much?

390
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,740
You don't love
yourself at all?

391
00:25:10,061 --> 00:25:11,153
I only…

392
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,793
When he's good...

393
00:25:16,469 --> 00:25:18,900
...no one has ever
be nice to me like he is.

394
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,742
You don't understand.

395
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,954
One day, later...

396
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,700
...Toy will destroy
live your life to the fullest.

397
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,540
You have to be aware
that he is not a good man.

398
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,655
RJ told me everything...

399
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,243
...about his actions
on Papang that night.

400
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:41,420
I know he's lying.

401
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,580
So you have to be honest with me.

402
00:25:49,524 --> 00:25:50,620
I don't know.

403
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,380
How could it be
you don't know?

404
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:55,700
RJ said you were there too.

405
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Come on.

406
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:03,396
What's wrong with you?
You look tense.

407
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,266
Are you afraid of something?

408
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,380
Okay.

409
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
Let's make it like this.

410
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,052
Listen to me.

411
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:16,100
If you don't want to
got into trouble...

412
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,520
...you have to be honest with me.

413
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,262
If something happens,
I will help you. Okay?

414
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
RJ has
new type of drug.

415
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,820
And he forced me
save it.

416
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,230
I thought he was just
having fun.

417
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,260
I don't know
he would do something so cruel.

418
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Huh?

419
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,229
Drugs?

420
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,315
What drugs?

421
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,020
What does RJ do?

422
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,920
Hey!

423
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,128
This is my glass.

424
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,400
You can't drink
tonight.

425
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,107
RJ told you to drive, right?

426
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:22,619
Give it to me.

427
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Give.

428
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Fast.

429
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,494
You're so slow!

430
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
Wow!

431
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:01,780
- Are you lonely?
- Are you alone?

432
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:04,304
- Do you want to dance?
- Come and dance with me.

433
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:25,420
Did you drug Papang?

434
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,460
I told you I don't know
RJ would do that!

435
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,580
And you were with him at that time.

436
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,895
What do you want me to do?

437
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,860
My parents work
for his family RJ.

438
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,975
I can go to school here
because his father paid.

439
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
I have to obey his words.

440
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,015
If he tells you to die...

441
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,740
...you must die
as he said?

442
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,180
I didn't do anything
on Papang.

443
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,590
I just deliver
them to the hotel.

444
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,060
I don't even know
what is Queen and RJ's plan.

445
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,349
Wait... Wait.

446
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Queen?

447
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
What's this?

448
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,903
Queen has something to do with it
with this?

449
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,420
Tell me!
Queen has something to do with this?

450
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,423
ATHENS

451
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Hello?

452
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
The board.

453
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,018
Peanut told me everything.

454
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
What?

455
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,860
RJ is lying, right?

456
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Well…

457
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:52,900
They drug you.

458
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,620
So that you
unconscious and...

459
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,191
...don't remember what happened.

460
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Hey...

461
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
...he's already asleep.

462
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,581
You guys have to help me.

463
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:31,525
What are you waiting for?
Stand!

464
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Darling?

465
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Darling?

466
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Let's go.

467
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,400
Where to?

468
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,570
I will invite you
to an exciting place.

469
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,976
Don't worry.

470
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,600
- To the back, no cameras.
- Where are we going?

471
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,800
- Damn! It's so heavy.
- The car!

472
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,547
Open the door.

473
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Come on.

474
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Watch out for the head.

475
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:43,861
Friends.

476
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,342
My head hurts.

477
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,188
Can I go?

478
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,476
What the hell?
Who's driving?

479
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,860
Just you.
You can return it tomorrow.

480
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,660
What? We've been drinking.
Only you don't drink.

481
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,730
What if we
meet the police?

482
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,500
What do we agree on?

483
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,340
I told you your role
in this case, right?

484
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,820
Get in the car.

485
00:32:16,093 --> 00:32:17,180
I told you to come in!

486
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:02,660
Hey.

487
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,186
What is it?

488
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,500
I know the truth.

489
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,700
RJ drugged me that night.

490
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,672
What did you say?

491
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,540
Papang is on his way here.

492
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:43,860
You should apologize to him.

493
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,900
It's up to him what he is
want to forgive you.

494
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,780
And you have to go
to the police with me tomorrow.

495
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,220
Huh?!

496
00:33:51,677 --> 00:33:52,935
Go to the police?

497
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:53,940
Correct!

498
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,495
You have to say
what is really true about them.

499
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,573
- I don't want to go!
- Hey!

500
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:02,420
What the hell!

501
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:04,020
Peanuts!

502
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:15,580
Watch out!

503
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,900
Peanuts!

504
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:32,980
Peanuts!

505
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,500
Peanuts!

506
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:42,480
At the moment...

507
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,500
...new type of drug
has been widely used...

508
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:46,900
...in the nightclub
around Bangkok.

509
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,683
The type is the same as
ketamine drug.

510
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,400
Affects the nerves.

511
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,200
It is in liquid form.

512
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,661
Clear and odorless.

513
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,603
The person who was drugged...

514
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,815
...will get drunk and fall asleep.

515
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,455
They won't realize.

516
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,460
Often times, they forget what
happened while they were under anesthesia.

517
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:07,011
This drug is better known as...

518
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,340
...one night love potion.

519
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
This is a danger
in a new form.

520
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,815
Parents need to pay attention
children carefully...

521
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,540
...so that it doesn't happen
become a victim.

522
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,264
However, the head of the eradication team
drugs said that...

523
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:21,296
...their team...

524
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,075
...has collected witnesses
and evidence...

525
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,996
...to catch
big drug dealers.

526
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,176
The team believes that...

527
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,891
...they are the cause of this drug
widely used.

528
00:35:32,658 --> 00:35:33,832
MINNIE

529
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:36,300
Hello?

530
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,380
You have proof, right?

531
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Okay.

532
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:03,500
Pepper?

533
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,380
Correct.

534
00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:09,140
Pepper is a drug dealer.

535
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,871
Your boyfriend is his business partner.

536
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:18,420
Hello, Gale.

537
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,420
You watch football
with Toy?

538
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,860
No, I talked to him.
about business.

539
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,460
I know the truth.

540
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,100
RJ drugged me that night.

541
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,738
RJ

542
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,877
Why do you keep calling me?

543
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,469
I've taken care of Papang.

544
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,420
He doesn't remember anything
that happened.

545
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,460
He believed everything I said.

546
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,340
Now you have to
do your part.

547
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:46,160
CHIVAS = I HAVE PROOF
TO CONFIRM MY THEORY.

548
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:46,971
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?

549
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Smile.

550
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Drink it.

551
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Hey, Honey!

552
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,665
Why didn't you say
do you want to have fun?

553
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,780
You damn woman!

554
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,183
You will definitely go to jail!

555
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,224
You too.

556
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,166
What the hell, you bastard?

557
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,380
Hey!

558
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,780
How?

559
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,460
When you're here...

560
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,140
...can you remember anything?

561
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,660
Wait.

562
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,310
What happened?

563
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,474
What is being done
that jerk to you?

564
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,380
Let's get straight to the point.

565
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
You said you had evidence.

566
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,020
Hello, Gale.

567
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,257
You are a girl
that Pepper is dating.

568
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:20,100
Correct.

569
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,420
This is Minnie.

570
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,700
I rent it
to approach Pepper.

571
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:32,600
MRI
ADVANCED WOUND CARE CENTER

572
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Athens.

573
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:41,948
How is Peanut?

574
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:45,207
He is stable
but still unconscious.

575
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,120
Her parents
on the way here.

576
00:40:47,783 --> 00:40:50,223
So he said
the truth, right?

577
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,340
About them drugging me?

578
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:57,420
What happened that night
more than just you being drugged.

579
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,561
What do you mean?

580
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,380
Peanut told me everything.

581
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,620
I want you to hear it from him.

582
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,255
Suddenly, he…

583
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,900
...to be like this.

584
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,940
They didn't take you
to RJ's house as he said.

585
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,420
They take you to the hotel.

586
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,140
The same place where
Queen lived before she died.

587
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,660
And Queen
take part in this matter.

588
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:53,231
Come here and help me.

589
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:06,860
Fast.

590
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:08,687
Queen has arrived.
