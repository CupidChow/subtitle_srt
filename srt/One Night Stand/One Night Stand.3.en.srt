1
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,280
Are you sure about this?

2
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,880
It was just a one night stand.

3
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,055
The body of a young woman
found in a park.

4
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,200
It looks like he fell
from the bridge.

5
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,040
Police officer
has confirmed...

6
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,240
...that the deceased was
Katariya Kijneung.

7
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
Better known as Queen.

8
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,935
He is an influencer on the internet
with over a million followers.

9
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Police officers still
not confirmed yet...

10
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,000
...cause of death unknown
it was suicide or not.

11
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,760
Everyone is questioning this...

12
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,960
...and comment
about this on social media.

13
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,608
To be honest...

14
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,443
...I don't believe people like that.
Queen will commit suicide.

15
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,575
Even if it is true…

16
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,844
...he wouldn't do it like this.

17
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
People like Queen...

18
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,055
...definitely won't let him end
on a terrifying stage like this.

19
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,459
You are right.

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,059
We checked the footage from CCTV...

21
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,704
...and saw that Queen
don't jump off the bridge.

22
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,961
But his body was moved there.

23
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,900
Who is the perpetrator?

24
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,383
We are still investigating it.

25
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,084
Now we are looking for a car that
driven by Queen from the nightclub.

26
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,773
We don't know where.

27
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,581
We checked the license plate.

28
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,320
And it turns out the car is yours.

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Correct.

30
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,188
I lent him my car.

31
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,104
You can check the GPS
if you want.

32
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,023
What is your relationship with him?

33
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,160
This is too difficult.

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,921
It's not that hard.

35
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:17,375
No need to rush
and focus.

36
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,016
Let's focus on this, come on.

37
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,735
You have to change
This decimal becomes a number.

38
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,720
Then multiply by
ten on both sides.

39
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,742
Then you need to multiply it
in brackets.

40
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,287
Are you listening?

41
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,120
Yes, but I don't understand.
I can't do it.

42
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:37,800
This is too difficult.
I don't want to study anymore.

43
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,530
Come on, focus on this.

44
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:42,880
You have to study hard
for high school entrance exams.

45
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
If you don't want to...

46
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,836
...you won't go to school
either way is good. Do you want that?

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,679
I want to learn. But…

48
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,519
I don't understand.
Why should I study hard?

49
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,375
I don't think I'll wear it.

50
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:01,720
Don't think too much about it.
Just study for the entrance exam.

51
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,298
Why?

52
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,177
It's easy for you to say that.
You are smart.

53
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,906
Not like me, I'm stupid.

54
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,000
- Here, you deserve it.
- Sick!

55
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,800
Of course it hurts.

56
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:16,320
Hey, you can't
say like this.

57
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
If you feel stupid...

58
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,625
...then in this world
no one is smart.

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,249
I'm serious.

60
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,441
If you focus on something...

61
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,095
...you can definitely achieve it.

62
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:28,273
Trust me on this.

63
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,539
Remember the time
your bright future, okay?

64
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:38,800
Okay.

65
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Hey.

66
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,340
Do you remember me?

67
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Who are you?

68
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,012
I told you last night.

69
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,300
You don't remember?

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,139
I already guessed.

71
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
You were acting strange last night.

72
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,520
As if not fully conscious.

73
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,885
And you don't remember
whatever today.

74
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,072
That is why
you lied to the police.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,430
Who are you really?

76
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,604
Why are you here?

77
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,528
- Do you know Queen?
- Of course I know.

78
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,787
I know him well.
Because Queen…

79
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,755
...is the most important woman
in my life.

80
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,215
What do you mean?

81
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,320
You think Queen
really going to commit suicide?

82
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,499
Who knows.

83
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,255
But you are his friend.

84
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,358
You should know
her life is quite beautiful.

85
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,422
No one knows
what Queen is hiding.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,160
Why don't you come in...

87
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,133
...and listen to people
talk about it?

88
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,092
Queen must have lied to us all
with his perfect life.

89
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,000
He told everyone
if he was born into a rich family...

90
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,495
...and his family lives
abroad...

91
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,458
...so he has to stay
with her celebrity aunt.

92
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:09,040
What is the truth?

93
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:13,030
In the end, no one knows
who he really is.

94
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,735
A person who can lie
well...

95
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,352
...is actually Queen.

96
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,760
Better than you?

97
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:23,567
You lied to the police
if your boyfriend picks you up.

98
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
But you are with me.

99
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,394
I'm not with you.

100
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:28,750
I'm with my boyfriend.

101
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,921
He came to pick me up
1 am.

102
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,828
I think you are with me
until 4 am.

103
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Liar.

104
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Liar?

105
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,403
Who do you mean? Me?

106
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,554
I have to go,
the ceremony will begin soon.

107
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,240
What's this?

108
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,084
It's like a mystery movie.

109
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,480
The question is who
save Queen's phone.

110
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,204
What do you see?

111
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:50,531
You keep staring at your phone
since getting in the car.

112
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:53,800
You really think
is this a good idea?

113
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,575
You don't want to know...

114
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,320
...why Queen
upload on his IG?

115
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,200
The spirit, of course.

116
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,480
Or Queen isn't dead yet.

117
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:09,001
I'm kidding, just kidding.

118
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm not serious.

119
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,240
Someone must have gotten into his account
and upload it.

120
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,952
Who is the perpetrator?

121
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,438
Who knows.
And no one knows.

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,320
No one knows
who did what...

123
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:24,393
...on online channels.

124
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,186
You don't need to pay attention
people's words or you will be stressed.

125
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,336
Sir, please stop here!

126
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
There is a problem?

127
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
I just wanted to know...

128
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,375
...how did I end up
in this dumpster last night.

129
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,040
What time is it usually?
Is this noodle stall closed?

130
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,975
Of course I remember.

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,240
I walked there
trying to wake you up.

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,360
But you shouted at me.

133
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,015
You told me to go
and said you need to sleep.

134
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,628
I'm mad at you.

135
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,720
- So I left you there.
- What?

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Ma'am.

137
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:33,895
Whatever happens...

138
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,295
...shouldn't let a girl
lying there unconscious all alone.

139
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,510
What do you want me to do?

140
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,120
At least you can
call the police.

141
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,615
I apologize for that.

142
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,555
I do not mean.
I must be totally drunk.

143
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,440
So my words are mean to you.

144
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,840
He can't do that…

145
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,480
Never mind, I'm fine anyway.

146
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,142
Forgive me.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,160
Well, you're right.

148
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
I was wrong.

149
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,400
I shouldn't have
leave you like that.

150
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,360
But, I'm so upset.

151
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,110
That's okay, but…

152
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,240
...do you remember...

153
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,061
...how did I get here?

154
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
I closed the shop that night.

155
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,975
Then there is the car
rush here.

156
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
It's so noisy.

157
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,520
Are you drunk?
Do you want to go to hell soon?

158
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:33,711
That car brought me here?

159
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,586
I think so…

160
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,411
...because I see you
as the car drove away.

161
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,160
I didn't see you before.

162
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,760
Do you remember?
what is the car like?

163
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,110
Or what is the driver like?

164
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,952
The car is small.

165
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,844
I think it's black.

166
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,280
Well, I didn't really care.

167
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,062
The car was going very fast.

168
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,117
Is that your friend's car?
Or do you hire someone?

169
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,367
You had a fight with them?
They just left you.

170
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,440
I don't really remember.

171
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,816
Sorry for asking so many questions,
I just need to ask one more time.

172
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,070
What time did that happen?

173
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,280
I think it was around 4 o'clock, because...

174
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,742
...I closed my shop
around that time every day.

175
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Hey.

176
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,916
Do you want me to deliver?

177
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,057
I can help you remember...

178
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,668
...our story and...

179
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,297
...last night's incident.

180
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,461
No need. I didn't forget.

181
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,414
My boyfriend will pick me up.

182
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,135
Last night I checked.

183
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,095
I didn't call the car
anywhere to pick me up.

184
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,934
I don't know whose car that is.

185
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:07,115
I don't know anyone
who have environmentally friendly cars.

186
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,735
But it seems...

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,070
...you can confirm
your existence, right?

188
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
I do not think so.

189
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,335
According to him, he saw me at 4 o'clock.

190
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,891
Where was I before?

191
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,416
4 am?

192
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,537
4 am?

193
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,080
Well, you…

194
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,508
...go, it'll be late soon.

195
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,080
Okay.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,639
Here.

197
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,753
Save this.

198
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,969
I just want to repay him
for answering my question.

199
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,142
I can't finish it all.

200
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,438
How about we find a place
to spend this?

201
00:13:56,688 --> 00:14:00,120
I take 1 and you too.

202
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,520
Sure, fine.

203
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,840
Well, I…

204
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
See you later.

205
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,280
I guess…

206
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,320
I was just about to tell you this.

207
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,240
I understand...

208
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,061
...what are you facing right now...

209
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,349
...very difficult, but...

210
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,005
...doesn't mean you have to...

211
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,673
...going through it alone.

212
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:36,110
Why don't you find a friend...

213
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,320
...to accompany you...

214
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
...and go through this with you?

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,560
Who is that friend?

216
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,080
My friend is there
in other parts of the world.

217
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,934
And I don't think I
have anyone here.

218
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Take it easy.

219
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,600
No need to rush,
you will remember something.

220
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,840
No. I mean…

221
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:23,360
When I was drunk and passed out,
my memory never came back.

222
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,300
Well, right? I've told you many times.
so as not to drink too much.

223
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:30,040
And you never
listen to me.

224
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,840
Actually, it started since
you hang out with Queen.

225
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,160
Come on.

226
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,470
If you don't want me to hang out with you
Queen, who else should I hang out with?

227
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:40,655
You've moved
to other parts of the world.

228
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,030
Nobody wants
hang out with me on campus.

229
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,640
I only have Queen.

230
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,240
Well, I'm sorry.

231
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,560
But everything will be okay.

232
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:56,360
I really hope so.

233
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,640
Come on, don't stress.

234
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's change the subject.

235
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
What's the news?

236
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,305
What will
what did you do with Athens?

237
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,395
What do you mean?

238
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:09,320
I have to be honest with you.

239
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,336
You haven't agreed yet
dating him...

240
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,124
...Because of you
respect Queen, right?

241
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,080
Now it's like this.

242
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,172
Won't you
dating him?

243
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:19,999
Come on!

244
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,640
This is not the right time
to think about this.

245
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,920
There is no reason for you to be sad.

246
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,250
I don't like him like that.

247
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:35,196
That is only…

248
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:36,579
One night stand?

249
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,227
The board.

250
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:42,800
We can lie
whatever we want.

251
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,734
But you can't
lying to your own heart.

252
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Hello, sir.

253
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:16,600
Have you done it?
check his room?

254
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,840
Still not yet.

255
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,640
I'll have some coffee first.

256
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,070
I'm so tired.

257
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
Good.

258
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,393
You have spoken
with the residents here?

259
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Hey!

260
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
You have to work,
not daydreaming.

261
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:55,828
Excuse me.

262
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:59,877
The hotel staff said they
seen Queen here a few times.

263
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:01,625
But he himself does not
ever booked a room.

264
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:03,344
Then, who makes the reservation?

265
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,000
This room is rented monthly.

266
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,200
The hotel is checking its contract
to find out who the tenant is.

267
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,000
The employees don't remember much.

268
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,480
The security guard also didn't pay attention...

269
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:17,671
...who is here
with Queen that night.

270
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,002
Well, then…

271
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,760
...you should check the CCTV.

272
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,560
The hotel said...

273
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,425
...the entire data system
reset.

274
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:30,160
All recordings were deleted.

275
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:32,505
Pack?

276
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
What is it?

277
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Excuse me.

278
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,840
We found evidence
beside this bed.

279
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,344
Now we know why
they booked this hotel room.

280
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,664
That's why there is no
CCTV footage for review.

281
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,560
I need to audition again?

282
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,280
I've auditioned for this role.

283
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,520
The director wants to see
your acting talent even further.

284
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:06,149
It's hard to judge from the clip.

285
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:09,472
Oh yeah? It's not because of you.
Want Queen yet?

286
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:11,240
So you auditioned me
just small talk?

287
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm just kidding.
I will audition again.

288
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,480
But this is too sudden.

289
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,520
You want me to go in the afternoon
but you just said that at noon.

290
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,789
I apologize for that.

291
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:27,080
We really have to pick the cast
to talk to sponsors.

292
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
Can't be late.

293
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:32,520
Come, you will definitely be our first choice.

294
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,840
Okay, see you later.

295
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:39,078
Please keep it a secret,
I don't want to be in the news.

296
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,080
Sorry, I'm late,
the traffic is jammed.

297
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:50,000
You said as if we
take a different route.

298
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,421
Forget it.

299
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:56,840
I apologize
we need to meet here.

300
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,175
I don't want to
visit the police station.

301
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,794
I don't want to meet reporters.

302
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,840
But you have to hurry.

303
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,977
I have a meeting in the afternoon.

304
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,440
Papang isn't here?

305
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,440
What did you say?

306
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,800
I need to talk
with both of you.

307
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,930
So I call you guys
both of them came here at the same time.

308
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,960
Sorry for being late.

309
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,481
Why don't we meet?
in the office but here?

310
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:25,575
Gale doesn't want to be there
reporters who saw it.

311
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,200
Wow! What a famous actress!

312
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,280
You should thank me.
Queen has become a hot topic.

313
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,680
If a reporter asks you questions and
you said something stupid...

314
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:38,961
...you will be very embarrassed.

315
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,594
Thank you for remembering me.

316
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:45,834
Let's get started.

317
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,159
Wait a moment.

318
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,200
Can I order some food?

319
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:54,243
Just coffee, okay?

320
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,009
Queen uses drugs?

321
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,696
We see evidence of use
drugs in last place...

322
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,594
...which Queen visited
before his death.

323
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,942
We also found
amphetamines in his body.

324
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,296
Seeing the amount of drugs in his body,
implies that...

325
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,203
...Queen uses drugs
just before he died.

326
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:19,160
Hair check
show that...

327
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:21,920
...Queen has used
drugs for quite a long time.

328
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,691
He only has
one relative and that was her aunt.

329
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,080
After asking him...

330
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,838
...he doesn't know much
about his nephew.

331
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,320
You two are his best friends.

332
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:32,867
Do you know about this?

333
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,560
You know about this, Gale?

334
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:39,016
Why are you asking me?

335
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,656
Shouldn't it be
I'm the one asking you this?

336
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,273
You already know him
before me.

337
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:44,891
But you often go out with him.

338
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:47,320
Sorry for asking you guys this.

339
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,566
But I want you two...

340
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,339
...to trust me
and tell me the truth.

341
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
This is very important.

342
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:58,547
Do you two use
drugs with Queen that night?

343
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
No.

344
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:04,040
I just found out now
he uses drugs.

345
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,112
And I told you I
with my boyfriend at his place.

346
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,720
I don't really remember
where am i...

347
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,080
...before I'm in the trash.

348
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,760
But I'm sure I don't
using drugs with him.

349
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,975
When I went out with him...

350
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,216
...I never saw him
using drugs, even once.

351
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,828
And I always tell him
I don't like drug addicts.

352
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:31,120
I just like going out for a drink.

353
00:22:31,477 --> 00:22:33,745
It doesn't mean I like it
using drugs, right?

354
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,840
In that case, okay...

355
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,883
...do you know...

356
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:42,560
...if Queen had another friend
or know someone?

357
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,800
I mean…

358
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:47,880
...people who do
like this with him.

359
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,172
Something like this?
For example what?

360
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,869
It's about drugs.

361
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,840
You are okay?

362
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,538
Apart from the two of us...

363
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:04,600
...I don't think he has any close friends.

364
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,883
Right, Gale?

365
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,360
What about men?

366
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:10,822
Is he dating someone?

367
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:14,680
She has a crush on a guy named Athens.

368
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,946
But he definitely doesn't use it
drugs because he is an athlete.

369
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,373
You know him very well.

370
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:23,160
Well, he's an athlete.

371
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,200
They did a drug test
before he competes.

372
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:27,120
How could he
using drugs?

373
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,720
I only know about Athens.

374
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
I'm not sure if he is
dating someone else.

375
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:39,371
It could be but I don't know.

376
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,240
He doesn't speak
a lot about men.

377
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:43,398
He talks more
about the man with Gale.

378
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,160
Lately he seems
serious about Athens.

379
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,117
So he stopped talking.
with another man...

380
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,240
...as far as I know.

381
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,960
Oh yeah, there was a guy…

382
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,200
I…

383
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,420
Not me…

384
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:03,758
...I'm all mixed up.

385
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:06,164
What is it?
If you know something, tell him.

386
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:08,322
I don't know anything.

387
00:24:08,398 --> 00:24:09,520
Take it easy.

388
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:12,078
Can you guys
thinking about someone...

389
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,320
...who might be with Queen...

390
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:15,946
...before he died?

391
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:21,267
I will tell you
if you think of something.

392
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:24,804
Excuse me, I need to audition for my role.

393
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,600
I have to go too.

394
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,280
Please solve this case quickly.

395
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,375
I wonder what
what actually happened.

396
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:39,696
Do you remember...

397
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,219
...where are you...

398
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:42,352
...at 1-4 am?

399
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:45,577
Are you still suspicious of me?

400
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,040
Just think about it.

401
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:50,440
Queen and I just had a fight.

402
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,680
Then we use
drugs together.

403
00:24:52,705 --> 00:24:54,339
After that, I killed him.

404
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,800
You think it's possible.

405
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:59,781
If this was a soap opera,
this is so confusing to me...

406
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,086
...aren't you confused?

407
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:29,730
You can test this...

408
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,625
...if you still think of me
using drugs with Queen.

409
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,359
You can take this too,
just in case.

410
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,343
Good afternoon.

411
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,280
I will go to my class.

412
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you need a ride?

413
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,880
No, I will audition.

414
00:26:12,228 --> 00:26:13,240
Gale.

415
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:16,122
How do you think Queen died?

416
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:20,107
Actually, he committed suicide?

417
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,328
People like him wouldn't do that.

418
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,400
At least, we think the same...

419
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:34,117
...if our friend doesn't commit suicide.

420
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Where?

421
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
There is a problem?

422
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
There isn't any.

423
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:42,803
PAPANG KILLS QUEEN

424
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,370
Papang kills Queen.

425
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:45,960
Don't believe me yet.

426
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,131
I can get mixed up.

427
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,760
It's past April Fool's Day.

428
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,120
But we can lie every day.

429
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,040
Right?

430
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,680
#EveryDayAprilFools

431
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,040
What? Papang killed Queen?

432
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,440
- Are you serious?
- Look! Blood!

433
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,840
What happened?

434
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,560
Geez!

435
00:28:17,758 --> 00:28:20,617
Papang kills Queen.

436
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:22,334
PAPANG KILLS QUEEN

437
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:23,480
This is amazing.

438
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
Wait…

439
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,805
That may be true.

440
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,120
Papang, what do you think?

441
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,320
Is this true?

442
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,281
There are journalists who
ask him about this?

443
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,080
Who is Papang?

444
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:43,200
Please tell me
the background.

445
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,160
That's enough.
We don't know the truth.

446
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,080
Who wants it
be a detective here?

447
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,080
Who is silent
in this chaos? Police.

448
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:57,040
Maybe they got high together and
Papang accidentally killed Queen?

449
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:33,790
Thank you for coming.

450
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,695
Sorry for wasting your time.

451
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,600
I'll let you know soon.

452
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,120
Thank You.

453
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Mew.

454
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,200
How was the audition? She was great.

455
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:49,320
He's great for this role.

456
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:50,520
But he is less charming.

457
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,175
To find a replacement for Queen...

458
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,357
...i need someone
which is more charming than this.

459
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,080
How many are there?
internet influencer in Thailand?

460
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:01,618
Call them for an audition, I
want to see more of them. Okay?

461
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,240
Pack?

462
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,320
Yes?

463
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,078
I can buy
one of your cigarettes?

464
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,240
No need to buy.
Just one cigarette.

465
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:50,800
Hello?

466
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,920
Hello, I'm Gib from Siam Entertain.

467
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,344
Do you have time?

468
00:30:57,527 --> 00:30:58,487
Yes?

469
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,134
Did you see the upload?
last on Queen's IG?

470
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,600
So what happened?

471
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,292
Can you tell me about this?

472
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,040
Enough for now, I still have things to do.

473
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:15,078
PAPANG KILLS QUEEN

474
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,000
We are investigating...

475
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,042
...developments in the account
social media of the deceased...

476
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,160
...after he died.

477
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,680
The upload was not created
via mobile phone, but via computer.

478
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:37,040
We check the IP address.

479
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,095
And found that it
from an internet cafe.

480
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,560
The first one found
around Saphan Khwai.

481
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:43,589
The second one was found
in Rangsit area.

482
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,732
The third and final...

483
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:47,680
...made last night,
around Minburi.

484
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,560
Why did they visit
many places?

485
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,560
What about the phone?
Any traces?

486
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,805
There isn't any.
His phone has been dead since the accident.

487
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,548
We couldn't find it.

488
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,360
Hey!

489
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,500
This is not your job.

490
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,535
If you have
lots of free time...

491
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,836
...you have to focus on your work
and do better.

492
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,080
I think I've aged a lot this year.

493
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,491
Yes, right?

494
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,400
I do not think so.

495
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,955
I think you look
beautiful for your age.

496
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,266
A little facial injection
will be perfect.

497
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:31,800
Your mouth is indeed sweet.

498
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,039
I will float
because of your praise.

499
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,400
Gale is ready.

500
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,455
Why are you taking so long?
getting ready?

501
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,188
Toy has been waiting for a long time.

502
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:43,080
It doesn't matter.
I can wait.

503
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,258
It's better this way, I have
opportunity to hang out with you.

504
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,625
Come on. I don't want to.
late for the ceremony.

505
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,143
Wait.

506
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,008
You better not
attend his funeral.

507
00:32:56,336 --> 00:32:58,215
Didn't you just go yesterday?
attend his funeral?

508
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,855
You don't have to
go every day.

509
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,735
You don't know if
reporters were waiting there.

510
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,359
Mom doesn't want you
get in the news.

511
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,328
Mother...

512
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,938
...my friend died
and you only care about that?

513
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:10,468
Exactly right!

514
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:11,881
You have to care.

515
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,015
You are an actress.

516
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,633
You can't get involved
in a scandal like this.

517
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,360
It doesn't matter.

518
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,256
Let him go.

519
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:22,886
I can take care of it.

520
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,289
Don't worry.

521
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Okay.

522
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,000
Thank You.

523
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,805
If you are not there...

524
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:34,586
...Gale has no one
to be relied upon.

525
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,154
You are a handsome young man...

526
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,836
...and behave well.

527
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:42,240
Please take care of my daughter.

528
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,547
- Of course.
- Thank You.

529
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,502
Let's go.

530
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:32,282
Anything on your mind?

531
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,678
There isn't any.

532
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,840
Gale?

533
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:44,321
I know lately
we often disagree...

534
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,901
...and something happened to Queen.

535
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,372
I want you to know that...

536
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,281
...I love you.

537
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,984
Whatever happens...

538
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,172
...we will get through this together.

539
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,814
In terms of what?

540
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,360
We will get through it together?

541
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,440
In all respects.

542
00:35:10,805 --> 00:35:13,040
Let's go.
I don't want to be late.

543
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,046
How was your audition?

544
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,582
Goes well.

545
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,265
But I'm not sure if I
will get this role.

546
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,024
You should
tell me first...

547
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,780
...if you audition
with this company.

548
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,312
Why is that?

549
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,019
I know the owner of the company.

550
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,440
He is my relative and
My father often helps him.

551
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:45,938
I can talk to him...

552
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,641
...and asked him to
consider you again.

553
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,370
I won't keep quiet
do something.

554
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:55,472
I mean, you're pretty good already.

555
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:56,750
But sometimes…

556
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,280
Forget it.

557
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:02,727
If you don't mind too much,
please talk to him.

558
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,513
Hey, look at this.

559
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,575
Is this Queen's house?

560
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
Ugh...

561
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:17,448
People upload them on the internet.

562
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,672
It's old and broken.

563
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,680
He told everyone
people if he is rich.

564
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,711
He lied to us?

565
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,977
Wow?!

566
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,484
Can people make things up this far?

567
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,874
- The house is very old.
- Correct.

568
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,360
Congratulations on passing the exam.

569
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,680
Clever.

570
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:44,189
I told you you could do it.

571
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,520
If it wasn't for you...

572
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,280
...I won't make it.

573
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:51,200
So?

574
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,615
Where do you want to take me?
to celebrate it?

575
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,859
I'm ready.

576
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,480
I…

577
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,589
I got a scholarship
for schools in Australia.

578
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,468
And I have to take
more English classes.

579
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,040
When are you leaving?

580
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
Well...

581
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,200
...I think this month.

582
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,078
Come on.

583
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,941
Is everything okay?

584
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,040
Who knows.

585
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,720
Why…

586
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,044
Why does everyone have to go?

587
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,575
Why does it always happen to me?

588
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,533
I'm always left behind
in the same place.

589
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,640
Come on.

590
00:37:55,094 --> 00:37:57,069
Who said I
will leave you?

591
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,932
Smile for me.

592
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,120
We can still stay in touch
no matter how far we are.

593
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,783
Are you sure?

594
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,827
Of course.

595
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:11,383
We are so far apart, you think?
can we stay the same?

596
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Certainly can.

597
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,680
I'm scared when you leave
to your new school...

598
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:20,656
...and you meet your new friends,
in a new environment...

599
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:25,040
...you can forget
all about me.

600
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,129
My aunt is not at home.

601
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:34,242
Do you want to hang out here?

602
00:38:34,406 --> 00:38:36,276
Who said I'm not at home?

603
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:37,760
Huh?

604
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Aunt?

605
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,555
You said you would
go to the funeral.

606
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,844
I'm not feeling well
so i didn't go.

607
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Oh...

608
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:50,295
...you think
I'm not at home...

609
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,500
...and you plan
bring a man home?

610
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:54,727
Aunt!

611
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,120
Aunt Kaew?

612
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,480
You know we've been close for a long time.

613
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:03,776
We are like brothers and sisters.

614
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:06,723
I definitely don't
think of it that way.

615
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:10,227
I don't believe it
not a single word you say.

616
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,935
What siblings?

617
00:39:12,554 --> 00:39:14,406
You are not blood related.

618
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,345
Why? Why you?
looking at me like that?

619
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,575
You are naughty.

620
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,200
You are still young.

621
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,775
And you already want to date.

622
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,906
If you get pregnant, I'm finished.

623
00:39:31,938 --> 00:39:33,736
You should have an abortion...

624
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,410
...or I should be the one
raising your baby.

625
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Who's he?

626
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,484
Who do you mean?

627
00:40:48,063 --> 00:40:49,761
Don't pretend you don't know.

628
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,664
I mean that man.

629
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,544
Who's he?

630
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:55,760
Why is he here?

631
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,037
He said he was a friend.

632
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,880
Why?

633
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,960
You still dare to ask?

634
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,560
That night he…

635
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,760
What happened that night?

636
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,880
What about Queen's IG?

637
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,226
Usually people believe
did he upload it himself?

638
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,960
He is dead.

639
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:30,935
That is not true,
there must be someone who messed it up.

640
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,146
Not important
it's real or not.

641
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,961
This is exciting, right?

642
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,720
If it's fun, then it's real to me.

643
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,040
You believe Papang
kill Queen?

644
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,840
Of course, this is very exciting.

645
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,943
Are you crazy?
How could this be true?

646
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,863
You are not a murderer.

647
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,631
Then who is
do this to me?

648
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,711
What do they want from me?
Saying all this nonsense?

649
00:41:58,736 --> 00:42:00,200
I am not sure...

650
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,440
...am I still trapped?
on April Fool's Day...

651
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,720
...including Queen and Gale.

652
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,920
In the last few days...

653
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,094
...I'm having a hard time sorting out
which is true or false.

654
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,800
What seems real...

655
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,520
...turns out to be fake.

656
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,720
But the fake one...

657
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,520
...it looks so real.

658
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:36,280
I apologize
come like this.

659
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,520
But you didn't reply to my message.

660
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,238
I've blocked you for a long time.

661
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,638
I'm worried about you.

662
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,807
How are you?

663
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,810
I'm not okay.

664
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,547
I'm not okay.
