00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,948
So happy.

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,058
So you have to smile.

That's it, Gale.
You can change clothes.

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,120
I think this dress
too tight for you.

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,848
I can change it.

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,113
Can I measure you?

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,214
I ordered this dress
to be sewn to Queen size.

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,136
I can change it for you
on time.

25
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,080
It doesn't matter.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm also planning to diet.

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,000
- Which one is my next outfit?
- Oh.

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,741
This is the school uniform.

I must

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,504

You have to see it
as an example.

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,908
His scores were the highest in every test.

45
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,660
He is a student
which also works.

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,649
He can't go to school every day
like all of you.

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,395
Nonetheless,
He focused hard on studying for his test.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,479
You guys have
other responsibilities it seems?

49
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,837
You don't have and you can't
make a perfect score it seems.

00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520

Do you want to fail?

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,660
Focus on school.

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,820
Why?

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,640

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,017

69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,437
Can you focus more in class?

70
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,830
You don't want to graduate
with your friends?

71
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,767

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,323

Damn it! Who do you think you are?

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,495
The score is slightly higher
from all of us.

75
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
Does he need to be praised that highly?

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,080
The teacher is crazy
to exemplary students.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
Damn, I want to ask something.

78
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,735
She's an actress, so that's why
make him an angel?

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,975
Not human like us?

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,455
He is more special
from us, see?

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,600
Her hair even
not following the rules.

82
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,030
There may be fewer absences
from us.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,200
I want to know...

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,440
...How to
get high score...

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,791
...did he get it?
because of his brain.

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,492
I heard the teacher...

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,041
...showing him the previous test.

88
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,984
Since when was he here?

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Who knows.

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,391
Can you guys stand up?
with better posture?

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,179
You call this good?

92
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,511
Mom told you guys
about this.

93
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:23,215
Because Mom wants you guys
improve yourself...

94
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,771
...to be a person
better like Kewalin.

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,138
Mom doesn't want you to badmouth
behind it like that.

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,638
You guys act like that.

97
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,038
That's why your life
can't be as good as him.

98
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,480
Mom will reduce your score.

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,500
And I will report your behavior.
to your parents.

If you still
complain about us to the teacher...

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,752
...you will be punished
worse than this.

113

Slowly.

118

I'm here to help you.

119
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,527
I am not one of them.

Do you want to reply to them?

128
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,049
What do you mean?

129
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,862
It's not hard to understand.

130
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,261
If you want to repay them...

131
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,158

You know why they
do this to you?

138
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,335
Not because of you
better than them.

139
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,366
They did that...

140
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,100
...because they see you
weaker than them.

141
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,161
What should I do?

142
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,007

Are you okay?

189
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,147
You just stand still.

190
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
I…

191
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,237
...seeing this school uniform
and remembered Queen.

192
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:42,981
We have been friends since high school.

193
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
Let's change clothes.

194
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,953
There is an update...

195
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:03,502
...from the drama
the most anticipated...

196
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,815
...the title is &quot;The Miracle of the Heart&quot;.

197
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,804
This drama was famous 10 years ago.

198
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,135
This is a remake version.

199
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,250
Today is
the process of fitting the clothes.

200
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,880
The main actress of this drama is...

201
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,859
...Gale-Kewalin.

202
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,234
She is an actress
which is known to everyone.

203
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,114
We will interview him
in a few minutes.

204
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,384
I'm excited because it's been a long time
not playing a role in the drama.

205
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,520
I am happy...

206
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,038
...because acting is my passion.

207
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,080
I will work hard
for this drama...

208
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,790
...to satisfy everyone.

209
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,880
How do you feel
replace...

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,360
...your friend who died?

211
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,200
I feel like I have to
do your best.

212
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,720
Actually,
Queen told me...

213
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,160
...he really wants to...

214
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,308
...get this role.

215
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,920
It's a shame in the end...

216
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,239
...Queen did not get
chance.

217
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,375
You don't feel like you're stealing
This role is from your friend, right?

218
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,221
Not at all.

219
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,208
On the contrary, I think...

220
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,895
...the more Queen wants
get this role...

221
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,397
...the more I have to focus
do your best.

222
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,417
And I believe...

223
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,760
...Queen will support me too.

224
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,200
May I ask you something?
about the case?

225
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,168
What's the progress now?

226
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,520
About the case...

227
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,400
...I want to
you followed him from the police.

228
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,708
May I
not commenting on this?

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,112
What is this role?
hard to act?

230
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,880
It's quite difficult.

231
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,641
The story is intense with
many aspects of drama.

232
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,397
I will try my best.

233
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,915
You don't believe me
at all?

234
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,089
It is not like that.

235
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,263
Besides Peanut's words
and he disappeared...

236
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,618
...you don't have
another proof, right?

237
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:17,349
You have to find it.

238
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:19,416
If not,
the evidence will not appear.

239
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,161
I think you need to know
about my job.

240
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,240
I'm the investigating officer.

241
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,295
My job is
interrogate witnesses...

242
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,975
...and file a lawsuit.

243
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,800
I have no power
to dig up evidence.

244
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,015
The person who takes care of this case
not me...

245
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,471
...but my boss.

246
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,252
What if I could
found evidence for you?

247
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,545
What evidence?

248
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:50,916
I am not sure.

249
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:53,866
But I guess
I will get it.

250
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,348
Excuse me...

251
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,065
...if you can't give me
more detailed information I guess…

252
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,261
I chatted with Queen
via IG private message.

253
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,317
He says
he has everything...

254
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:11,306
...including videos...

255
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,685
...and the chat that can
pointing to the guilty person.

256
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,800
But I have to
follow his orders...

257
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,882
...so he will
give me the proof.

258
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,426
Wait.

259
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,949
You say
you chat with Queen?

260
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Well...

261
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,960
...a person who can
access his IG.

262
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Huh?

263
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:42,816
He canceled
all the messages he sent.

264
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,708
So the evidence is lost.

265
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,741
I HAVE DONE AS YOU SAID.
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD ATHENS TO STAY AWAY.

266
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,040
Stay away from Athens?

267
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,790
This is the negotiation?

268
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,215
I don't know...

269
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,738
...if I do right.

270
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,333
He threatened me to
don't tell anyone.

271
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,735
He said if I
tell anyone...

272
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,886
...he will delete
all the evidence.

273
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,949
Instead of playing
with crazy people...

274
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,995
...i think it's better
track this person.

275
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
Of course
I will do that.

276
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,575
I just need
waiting for him to send me proof.

277
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:33,189
I hope he does.

278
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,422
I want you to practice
for his swimming competition.

279
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,982
You really want to
throw away your future?

280
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,719
I told you so
and I've decided.

281
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,879
About the three of them...

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,875
...I sent a report
to the committee for investigation.

283
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,911
If this upsets you...

284
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,585
...I'll take care of it.

285
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,415
Get back to practice.

286
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:29,085
When are you
will send me proof?

287
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:41,493
The coach said he had
send a report to the committee...

288
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,787
...to investigate
the three of them.

289
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,839
I have asked you
so as not to interfere.

290
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,320
I don't interfere.

291
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,056
I just wanted to let you know that
My club is taking action on this.

292
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,518
It's useless.

293
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,175
The police can't
do anything to them.

294
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,183
You think
can the club do something?

295
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:01,453
What's wrong with you?

296
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:04,339
Be honest,
what did i do wrong?

297
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:05,775
Tell me
if I do something wrong.

298
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,911
I don't know
if you act like this.

299
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,170
- Do you want to sleep with me again?
- Huh?

300
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,575
I told you we don't have any
any relationship other than sex.

301
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,655
If you want to make love,
just tell me.

302
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,009
We can do it if you are free.
Just say it.

303
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:35,137
I don't want to go to class,
lazy.

304
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,016
You often skip school.
You have to come in.

305
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:42,896
Come on.

306
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,560
- Do you want to talk?
- No.

307
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,799
I think your relationship
with Athens going smoothly…

308
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,640
I have my own reasons.

309
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,600
Gale?

310
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,759
I'm waiting in the canteen.

311
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,535
You shouldn't have come here.

312
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,788
People like to talk, if
they see you here, they can…

313
00:22:58,058 --> 00:22:59,317
I know.

314
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Excuse me.

315
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,240
Toy knows that
Minnie works for me.

316
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,732
And he hurt Minnie.

317
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,891
Is it true?

318
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,346
How is it going?

319
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:15,065
Full of bruises.

320
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,324
But he's safe now.

321
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,163
I'm more worried about you.

322
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,266
Toy said you got back with him?

323
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Correct.

324
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,145
Why?

325
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Gale?

326
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,498
Did he hurt you?

327
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,015
He forced you?
You can tell me.

328
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,880
If you need my help,
tell me.

329
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,655
If you want to leave this country
for a moment, tell me.

330
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,120
I can
ensure your safety.

331
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,078
He definitely can't hurt you.

332
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,259
Thank You.

333
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,680
This is my choice.

334
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,192
Why, Gale?

335
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,902
I know it sounds selfish.

336
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,760
But only Toy...

337
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,987
...the one that can
grant my wish.

338
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,040
I can't lose him.

339
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
At least, for now.

340
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,575
What do you want?
Tell me.

341
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,453
What do you want?

342
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
More important than
your own safety.

343
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,640
You know his behavior very well.

344
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,737
- He is a monster and he hurt you…
- I've made my decision.

345
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,036
Please respect that.

346
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,135
Toy will pick me up soon.

347
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,792
Go before he sees you.

348
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Gale?

349
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,241
What is
what are you doing here, Toy?

350
00:24:58,454 --> 00:24:59,862
I came to pick up Gale.

351
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:01,940
Didn't Gale say...

352
00:25:02,364 --> 00:25:04,055
...we're together again?

353
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,545
That is not true.

354
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,470
Gale.

355
00:25:13,384 --> 00:25:15,486
Gale, what happened?

356
00:25:17,304 --> 00:25:18,399
I have to go.

357
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:21,166
I have a contract signing meeting
for my drama.

358
00:25:23,904 --> 00:25:25,073
Are you crazy?

359
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:27,664
Me too
have my own reasons.

360
00:25:27,744 --> 00:25:28,744
What reason?

361
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:32,450
Let's go.
You have to sign a contract, right?

362
00:25:59,704 --> 00:26:02,144
How can I be sure?
after sending proof...

363
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,370
...you won't come back
in Athens again?

364
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,239
I should have stayed longer
because there is business.

365
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:37,661
I can't yet
back to Thailand.

366
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,083
And you must not get involved
in other matters.

367
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,237
The problem of your evil deeds,

368
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:44,119
I will give you
lessons when I get back.

369
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,585
What a stupid kid.

370
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:02,664
Hey,
There's a party at Thong Lo tonight.

371
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:05,295
Want to go?
I think I can get a ticket.

372
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:12,831
No. I'm too tired.

373
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:19,436
We don't need to go there.

374
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:21,746
We can buy beer
and hang out at my place.

375
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:39,324
Are you busy tonight?

376
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,664
Hi darling.

377
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,340
Why did you call me here?

378
00:28:06,624 --> 00:28:09,984
I just want to set the record straight
all the problems with you.

379
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:14,584
Would you like a drink?

380
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:21,599
1 bottle of beer.

381
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:06,790
KAEW: HOLIDAY AND
RUN AWAY FROM ALL PROBLEMS

382
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:49,184
So?

383
00:30:49,704 --> 00:30:50,904
What is it?

384
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:55,459
Let's take a selfie.

385
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,211
I WILL UPLOAD
THIS PHOTO IS ON MY IG.

386
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:09,711
ATHENS WILL SURELY FORGET ME.

387
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,244
Where did you send it?

388
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:15,448
No,
just uploaded it on my IG.

389
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:24,354
I just want
this will end soon.

390
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:26,128
I'm sick of this.

391
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,483
I want to ask you.

392
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:32,267
That night the Queen herself
fell off the balcony, seriously?

393
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:36,575
Let's make it like this.

394
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,890
That night
Queen stands on the balcony...

395
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,904
...alone for so long.

396
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,537
If he doesn't fall on his own...

397
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,657
...who pushed him?

398
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:51,504
Darling.

399
00:31:52,504 --> 00:31:53,840
Forgive me.

400
00:31:53,864 --> 00:31:56,419
I do not mean
to be like this.

401
00:31:56,584 --> 00:32:00,064
I told you so
I drugged you because...

402
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:02,479
...that was Queen's plan.

403
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:08,264
He threatened me if...

404
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:10,581
...I didn't follow his orders...

405
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:13,059
...he would
reveal my secret.

406
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:15,046
What secret?

407
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:20,347
If you like men?

408
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,184
If that's the problem,
everyone knows!

409
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:28,224
Everyone on campus
know about this.

410
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:31,050
Only you are sure
no one knows about this.

411
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:36,279
You pretend to tease me.

412
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:39,504
I hang out with you
and stay at your place...

413
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:41,731
...because I know
you won't do anything.

414
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:43,624
In the end, you use
to spread rumors...

415
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:47,040
...if we sleep together so that you
no need to reveal your secrets.

416
00:32:48,304 --> 00:32:51,224
This is a secret that
try to hide it?

417
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:55,180
You made Queen manipulate you
do evil because of this?

418
00:33:01,285 --> 00:33:03,807
UNKNOWN CALLER

419
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:06,064
Hello?

420
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:09,309
Hello, it's me, Chivas.

421
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,675
I'm taking Gale to your place.

422
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,410
How do you know my number?

423
00:33:14,704 --> 00:33:17,590
Gale gave it to me.
Are you in your apartment?

424
00:33:17,944 --> 00:33:19,789
There is something important
what I want to tell you.

425
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,624
No,
but I'll be home soon.

426
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:27,066
What if we meet?
in your apartment?

427
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:28,904
Good.

428
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:45,639
I will give you
1 last chance.

429
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:48,072
Do the right thing...

430
00:33:48,424 --> 00:33:50,672
...before you don't get it
that chance again.

431
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:12,038
There is a problem?
Did something happen to Gale?

432
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,026
This isn't about Gale.

433
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:15,777
It's about Queen.

434
00:34:24,144 --> 00:34:25,628
What are you doing here?

435
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:28,585
I called him here.

436
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:31,520
There is something important
which he should know too.

437
00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:39,904
Wait.

438
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:43,875
You have no problem
with him, right?

439
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,680
Wait, RJ is…?

440
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,348
From where
you got all this?

441
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,481
Drawers in the Queen's bedroom.

442
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:25,984
It means...

443
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:29,280
...Queen keeps all the secrets
people around him?

444
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:30,424
Correct.

445
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:32,728
To blackmail them.

446
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,785
It contains information
about Pepper.

447
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:46,555
Must be information about him
selling drugs with Toy.

448
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,573
I don't know
can it be related to Toy.

449
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,370
I'll find out.

450
00:35:52,264 --> 00:35:54,034
I want to know
about something.

451
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:57,048
Queen keeps all the secrets
people around him.

452
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,860
Including you two.

453
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:05,909
Someone's secret
can't be found here.

454
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:08,864
Gale.

455
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,126
You mean...

456
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:16,769
...Queen blackmails everyone...

457
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,269
...but he doesn't have any
Gale's secret?

458
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:21,131
Strange.

459
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,331
Correct.

460
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:25,173
Someone took this.

461
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:26,538
Who?

462
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:30,386
There is no secret
about Toys too.

463
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,185
This is also strange.

464
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,691
I'm pretty sure when Queen died,
Toy visits her aunt's house.

465
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:39,169
He could threaten her
or give him money.

466
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:41,725
And he took his USB
and Gale.

467
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,251
It means…

468
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:49,191
Toy can protect Gale
by hiding the information.

469
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:52,729
- Or he could…
- Trying to use the secret...

470
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,386
...to threaten him
so that he would come back to her.

471
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:03,611
SCENARIO

472
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:17,725
Let's have some wine.

473
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,407
To celebrate your new drama.

474
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:46,091
Gale.

475
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:50,374
I know I did something bad.

476
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:53,198
Does not matter
if you mind.

477
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:58,882
But I promise...

478
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:00,942
...I will improve myself.

479
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,519
From now on...

480
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:05,486
...I will stop hanging out
with Pepper.

481
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:10,002
I will try to be a person
which is better for you.

482
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:13,243
Please give me a chance.

483
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:16,011
Can you promise me...

484
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:19,437
...you won't leave me?

485
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:21,089
Please, okay?

486
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:24,688
I really love you.

487
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:42,731
Are you ready?

488
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:48,651
No, I changed my mind.

489
00:38:49,651 --> 00:38:51,091
Huh? Why is that?

490
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:54,292
We've talked about this
and I will start first.

491
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,331
What are you afraid of?

492
00:38:56,077 --> 00:38:58,226
What if he
report it to the teacher?

493
00:38:58,251 --> 00:39:00,611
What if he
upload it on social media?

494
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:03,171
What if he
ruin my reputation?

495
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:05,091
What can I do?
I…

496
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:06,411
I can't do it.

497
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:07,451
Hey.

498
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:10,040
If we can make
they are afraid of us...

499
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,772
...they won't report to the teacher
or others.

500
00:39:17,931 --> 00:39:19,214
I want to ask something.

501
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:21,178
What do you want?

502
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:24,336
You want to be a victim
throughout your life...

503
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:27,640
...or you also want to
become a predator?

504
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:35,531
Okay.

505
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,402
We reply to them.

506
00:39:58,149 --> 00:39:59,158
Of course.

507
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:03,176
I promise
I will not run away from you.

508
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:05,877
I will be here with you...

509
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,879
...waiting to see your life
burn in hell.

510
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:11,622
I will be by your side.

511
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:14,102
When you're not paying attention...

512
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:16,156
...I am...

513
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:18,522
...which will
ruin your life.

514
00:40:26,931 --> 00:40:29,392
They know
the problem of covered corpses?

515
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:30,821
Correct.

516
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,026
They know it themselves.

517
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:34,738
But they don't know
the whole story.

518
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,484
You didn't tell them
about this, right?

519
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,921
No.

520
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:43,611
Good, don't tell them.
about the details of the investigation...

521
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,746
...until we are sure
what happened.

522
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:47,771
Okay sir.
