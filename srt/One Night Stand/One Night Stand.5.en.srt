1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
What did you say?

2
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,843
That RJ?

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,280
Correct.

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,720
I think he knows something.

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,440
He was near me all night.

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,296
He texted me in the morning,
but delete it.

7
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,839
I don't know why he did that.

8
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:09,946
You should ask him.

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,840
You need to ask him
and find out.

10
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,628
Why are you wasting your time?
and talk to me?

11
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:18,183
Should I get in touch?
with someone like him?

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,464
You know I hate him.

13
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:24,040
Hey, do you have any other options?

14
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,080
Or do you want to forget like this?

15
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:41,542
PAPAN

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,616
Are you sure we can do this?

17
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,362
You really need to
calm yourself down.

18
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:02,078
I will say this
for the last time...

19
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:04,480
...if you and I don't talk,
no one will know.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,705
From what I hear
recently...

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,495
...Papang needs to do
urine test for drugs.

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,581
And the officer asked about that
and the Queen incident.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,280
Unlucky.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Damn it!

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,591
I'm the only one who will
got into big trouble, right?

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,280
- I told you to be quiet!
- Hey!

27
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:28,520
What happened?

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,040
What is it?

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,284
Hey, why does RJ look gloomy?

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,160
When will you all
stop acting like this?

31
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:46,280
You guys are all grown up now.

32
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,854
But you guys act like
junior high school kids are annoying.

33
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,440
What's wrong with you?
I didn't do anything.

34
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,953
I saw it earlier
you will punch him.

35
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:56,080
So? You can't stand it?

36
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:58,040
You have to interfere in this matter?

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,960
You have to act like a hero?

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,800
- You think you're great?
- So what?

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,440
Stop! That's enough!

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,975
- He started it.
- It's enough.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,034
Athens, you must
warm up for exercise.

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,761
And you...

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,280
...must go and never come back again
until you stop acting silly.

44
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,000
You need to rest for 3 days.

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,312
What, Coach?

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,518
I told you he started it,
I didn't do anything.

47
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,573
You're the one who started being aggressive towards him.

48
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:27,580
Also...

49
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:30,761
...Athens is the main swimmer,
he will compete next month.

50
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:32,612
You're just a substitute.

51
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:34,760
You're late and...

52
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:38,080
...absent, you are not disciplined at all.

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,840
Now you are suspended for 7 days.

54
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,640
- Coach?
- If you act like this again...

55
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:43,003
...you will definitely be expelled.

56
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,362
Don't stand still, go!

57
00:04:04,688 --> 00:04:05,874
Go away from here.

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,288
Damn it!

59
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:50,666
PAPAN

60
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,580
Yes dear?

61
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,400
You keep calling me.

62
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:10,995
Can't wait to talk to me?

63
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,415
What's wrong with you?

64
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,409
I called you many times,
why don't you answer it?

65
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,682
Calm down, don't be mad at me.
or you will age quickly.

66
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,320
I am busy.

67
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,940
Why did you call me?

68
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,604
Do you miss me?

69
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,241
What message did you send me?
the morning after that night?

70
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,324
Why did you delete it?

71
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,446
Morning?

72
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,550
What morning?

73
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,800
On the day the Queen died.

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,135
You sent me a message
but you canceled it.

75
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,112
What's in it?

76
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:43,472
Aren't you a little
slow in this regard?

77
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,627
Why did you cancel?
send the message?

78
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
I…

79
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,645
I have to protect myself.

80
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,481
Who would have thought Queen would die.

81
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,031
And also, the police are interrogating you.

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Wait.

83
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,440
So…

84
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,620
Is it about Queen's death?

85
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:01,084
You have to tell me everything.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,880
You know what
happened that night, right?

87
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,600
Was I with you that night?
Did I do something?

88
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,917
Why can't I remember anything?

89
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,995
Take it easy, ask one by one,
I can't follow it.

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I…

91
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,401
My day is bad.

92
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,307
Do you want to go out?

93
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,346
No, I don't want to go.
everywhere.

94
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,415
You need to tell me
what happened that night.

95
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,491
No.

96
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:29,667
If you really need to know,
we meet tonight.

97
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,920
We're out.

98
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:34,139
I will tell you
everyone, okay?

99
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,201
OFFICERS QUESTION ABOUT DRUGS
BECOMING THE CAUSE OF QUEEN'S DEATH.

100
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:03,675
FRIEND TESTED POSITIVE
USING DRUGS.

101
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Hello, Gale.

102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,569
You watch football with Toy?

103
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,081
He didn't tell me.

104
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:16,800
No, I talked to him about business.

105
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,320
See you later.

106
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,571
Stop screaming.

107
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,328
You have to take care of your part.

108
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:35,660
And I'll take care of my part.

109
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,503
I won't help you.

110
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,503
If you drag me into trouble...

111
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:41,839
...I will definitely repay you.

112
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,035
Take care of it quickly.

113
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,832
I have to go.

114
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
Toys?

115
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,160
Gale?

116
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,783
When did you come in?

117
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:00,370
I just came,
I met Pepper on my way out.

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,417
You have eaten?

119
00:08:03,823 --> 00:08:05,050
Want to order food?

120
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Where are my clothes?

121
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,888
What?

122
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:13,831
The clothes I wore that night.

123
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,073
Where?
Why don't I see it?

124
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,221
I took it to the dry cleaners.

125
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,182
Why?

126
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,720
Nothing, I was just asking.

127
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,920
Oh yes.

128
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:29,880
I talked to someone...

129
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:31,996
...to talk to the soap opera producer.

130
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:34,622
They will talk to the team about you.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,732
We will know the result
in a few days.

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,362
But they promise you will get
role to replace Queen for sure.

133
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:43,841
You're not happy?

134
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Toys.

135
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,638
Can you stop?
hanging out with Pepper?

136
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,112
What did you say?

137
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,789
At least, not right now.

138
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,706
Gale, Pepper and I are business partners.

139
00:08:58,731 --> 00:08:59,731
I know.

140
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:02,760
Someone like you can
do business with anyone.

141
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,526
You don't need to
be near Pepper.

142
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:05,920
Why?

143
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,479
Why don't you like him?

144
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,359
I've arrived. Where are you?

145
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Good.

146
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,680
He was already in the parking lot, about to get in.

147
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,830
He was late because of his girlfriend.
late to pick him up.

148
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:25,838
Queen is serious about him?

149
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:29,221
He is not dating anyone
for serious relationship.

150
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,021
You are right on this point.

151
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:38,560
Hello.

152
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,960
Am I too late?

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,960
I'll introduce him first.

154
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,386
This is Pepper.

155
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,200
Pepper, this is Gale, my best friend.

156
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:52,613
And this is Toy, his girlfriend.

157
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:55,960
Hello, Gale and Toy.

158
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,377
I can already mention you
as my friends?

159
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:04,560
What if we
having fun after this?

160
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
What's that?

161
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,160
We will see.

162
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,839
He has something good
and want you to try it.

163
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,105
Forget it.

164
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
Sorry, I…

165
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:26,073
...worried that Pepper will
bring trouble to us.

166
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,463
Gale, didn't I tell you...

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,200
...you don't need to
worrying about anything?

168
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,019
Nothing can hurt us.

169
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,480
It will be over soon.

170
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,960
You have to get ready
enjoy filming a soap opera.

171
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,280
Don't worry.

172
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:02,604
What do you want?

173
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,938
SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE

174
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Queen.

175
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Hey!

176
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,656
I am so glad...

177
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,822
...you still remember me.

178
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,462
Of course I remember.

179
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,772
I do not expect
you will come back.

180
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,034
I'm home.
Here I am before your eyes.

181
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,600
You have to meet someone?

182
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:25,120
No.

183
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,878
Even if I have to meet
someone I can cancel it.

184
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:30,280
Your mouth is so sweet.

185
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:32,320
Want to have dinner?

186
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,675
And you have to treat me to a meal
night to welcome me home.

187
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:39,791
I'm kidding, I will
treat you to dinner.

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Okay.

189
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Wow!

190
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:48,760
Can I drive it?

191
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,280
Please, yes, yes.

192
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,960
Yes, yes.

193
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,040
Of course.

194
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,720
Queen, slow down.

195
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,596
- There's no need to rush.
- It's more fun if it's faster.

196
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
- Wow!
- Hey!

197
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,667
Slowly.

198
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:12,200
- Look ahead!
- Okay.

199
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,200
Wow!

200
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,960
Hard to believe...

201
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:25,760
Mr Chivas will be
new millionaires in this country.

202
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,880
If I don't see it with my eyes
my own head, I wouldn't believe it.

203
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,120
What millionaire?

204
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:33,417
I just got lucky...

205
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:36,160
...an investor opens
parent company for me to run.

206
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:39,520
And this place is my bonus.

207
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:42,112
I'm still the same person.

208
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,511
But you...

209
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,400
What do you call yourself?

210
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:48,802
Queen?

211
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Correct.

212
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,000
And you have to call me Queen.

213
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Okay.

214
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,760
Wait.

215
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:02,737
Are you trying to get me drunk?

216
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:06,822
What do you mean?

217
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,440
I saw your photo on IG...

218
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:11,575
...and you can drink.

219
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,640
You can't judge me
from social media.

220
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,748
What about your aunt?

221
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:21,989
Why do you ask about it?

222
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,746
You don't live with me anymore?

223
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:26,699
Ouch.

224
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,652
I'm sick of him.

225
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,000
I want to rent a nice apartment.

226
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,480
Great idea.

227
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:38,641
Apartments nearby
your campus is not that expensive.

228
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,182
Can I stay with you?

229
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,197
I'm just kidding.

230
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:55,240
If I stay here,
your boyfriend will be jealous of me.

231
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,640
I do not have a lover.

232
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Are you serious?

233
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:02,335
Yes.

234
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,200
I don't believe you.
You're sure to attract women.

235
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:08,320
Not really, I just…

236
00:15:09,362 --> 00:15:11,610
- I'm still single.
- I know.

237
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,040
How about you?

238
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:16,960
Do you have a boyfriend?

239
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,456
Why didn't you answer me?
You just stare at me.

240
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,141
If I don't consider you
like my own brother...

241
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:39,000
...I must have kissed you.

242
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,720
Excuse me.

243
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:00,665
Hello, sir?

244
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:03,275
Now?

245
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,770
Ok, fine.

246
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,761
I'll see you in 5 minutes.

247
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
See you later.

248
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:20,080
Sorry, but…

249
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,781
...my business partner...

250
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,200
...flew from Singapore and he
will go to China next.

251
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,081
He wanted to meet me at the airport,
I have to go see him now.

252
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:30,640
Oh I see.

253
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll go now.

254
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,649
How do you get home?

255
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:39,640
I can find my way home.

256
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,386
I can call a male friend
to pick me up.

257
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:47,035
Come on, I was just kidding.

258
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,381
I can call a taxi.

259
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,520
Queen, wait a minute.

260
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,279
You can use my car.

261
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,600
Oh yes?

262
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:06,394
Certainly can.

263
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,801
Don't worry, I have
another car from my company.

264
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,198
You can use my car.

265
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:13,362
Just for a walk.

266
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,400
- Does it need to be returned immediately?
- No.

267
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:23,120
You can bring it back when you die.

268
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,680
But you can't speed
like the other day, okay?

269
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:28,705
Okay.

270
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:45,482
Aunt?

271
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,597
You have the key to the drawer
next to his bed?

272
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,135
What key?

273
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Who knows.

274
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,102
What about the body?

275
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,979
What will you do?
with the body?

276
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:58,964
The final ceremony will be held tomorrow.

277
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,838
As soon as the body arrived,
then a cremation ceremony was held.

278
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,121
Aunt?

279
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,120
Can I ask you something?

280
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,995
Have you ever thought about wanting to
uphold justice for your nephew?

281
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,720
What justice?

282
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,917
What justice is needed
I stand up for him?

283
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,920
He pretends
be like an angel...

284
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,280
...even though in fact he
is a bad person.

285
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,801
He chose to live
life without peace.

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,880
He deserved to die like that.

287
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,763
Do you know...

288
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,285
...he was born to be my burden?

289
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,840
His parents abandoned him
so that I can grow up.

290
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,960
Has he ever felt
thank you for that?

291
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:37,800
Has he ever
pay me back?

292
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:39,243
Never.

293
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,034
He continues to cause problems.

294
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,323
He keeps making a mess over and over again.

295
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,440
Even when he's dead...

296
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,229
...he left me trouble
more to sort out.

297
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:49,800
What do you mean?

298
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,232
Go.

299
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:55,917
You shouldn't have come back here.

300
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:57,400
Wait.

301
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,147
What someone said
something to you?

302
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,097
That's enough for today.

303
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,864
Come on.

304
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,760
Come on, quickly.

305
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,556
Your time record
not good today, Athens.

306
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,415
Forgive me.

307
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:06,880
I…

308
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:08,360
I must be too tired.

309
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:12,080
Tired?
Or is something bothering you?

310
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
There isn't any.

311
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:17,880
That's good.

312
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,995
I heard Papang tested positive
using drugs.

313
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:26,775
Is it true?

314
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,920
I am not sure.

315
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,776
I saw on the news that the police found
traces of drug use on his body.

316
00:22:31,987 --> 00:22:34,433
This is too suspicious is he...

317
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,479
...with Queen
because he is dead.

318
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:39,834
But that has nothing to do with it.
with you, right?

319
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:43,480
Athens...

320
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:46,006
...I was just talking
with association...

321
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:48,295
...they will send
swimmers to compete in...

322
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,823
...World Junior Championships in Japan.

323
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,320
I will nominate you, what are you?
qualified for that match.

324
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,215
If you could represent Thailand...

325
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,276
...you will join
with the national team.

326
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Okay.

327
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:05,760
It means you have to focus
on your goal.

328
00:23:06,214 --> 00:23:08,144
It's not that difficult,
you can do it.

329
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,920
If something bothers you...

330
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,761
...or whoever made you
lost focus...

331
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:16,400
...aiming at your life goals
and get rid of everything.

332
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,080
Okay, Coach.

333
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,640
You all too.

334
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,761
- Okay.
- Focus on practice.

335
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:23,761
If there is a problem,
come to me, okay?

336
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,705
Take a rest and sleep.

337
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:29,917
That's enough for today.

338
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,520
- Thank You.
- Yes.

339
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,320
Darling.

340
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,080
How are you? I thought you were
won't come. Let's dance.

341
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,932
Why? It's still morning.
and you're drunk?

342
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,640
What's wrong with that?

343
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,480
Who knows what will happen tomorrow.

344
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:28,600
For example Queen.

345
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:30,744
Suddenly, he just died.

346
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,433
So we have to
have fun together.

347
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:35,549
Come on.

348
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:36,401
Let's drink.

349
00:24:36,426 --> 00:24:38,898
No, I don't want to drink tonight.

350
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:44,040
Why is that?
You're here.

351
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,440
- Come on, have a drink.
- I don't want to drink tonight.

352
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,960
Come on.

353
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:59,118
Come on, RJ. Just once.

354
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:01,320
Can I just talk once?
with you without upsetting me?

355
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:05,722
Darling.

356
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,937
Why don't you drink?

357
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Peanuts.

358
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,230
Hey, Peanut.

359
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:38,785
Huh?

360
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,200
Are you okay?
What is it?

361
00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:43,800
It doesn't matter.

362
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,320
Wait, if you need my help...

363
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,831
...you can tell me.

364
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,245
Come on, just a little.

365
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,360
No way! Never mind!

366
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:14,401
- Ouch!
- Don't waste my time.

367
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,760
Can we talk about that night?

368
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,455
Should I talk to the police...

369
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,073
...so they can immediately
talk to you?

370
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:26,640
Come on dear.

371
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:30,863
We look for a quiet place to chat.

372
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Okay?

373
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
Let's go.

374
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,501
It means you have to focus on your goals.

375
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:52,761
It's not that difficult,
you can do it.

376
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,695
If something bothers you...

377
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,768
...or anyone
makes you lose focus...

378
00:26:57,793 --> 00:27:01,215
...aiming at your life goals
and get rid of everything.

379
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,464
You say...

380
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:11,360
...you don't remember anything, do you?

381
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:13,375
Right. Otherwise,
I won't ask you.

382
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,375
But you know
You're really drunk, aren't you?

383
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,960
Yeah, I know. You don't have to.
reminds me of that.

384
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,800
So...

385
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:21,885
...what really happened that night?

386
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,003
I was with you that night, right?

387
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,880
Correct.

388
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:28,215
When the nightclub closes...

389
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,925
...you hang out with us.

390
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:31,680
We?

391
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Come on, including me...

392
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,823
...and my friends
from the swimming club.

393
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,495
Are we related?
with Queen's death?

394
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,842
Are you crazy?

395
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
There isn't any!

396
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Absolutely nothing!

397
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,640
Why should you
acting suspicious?

398
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,040
Why did you delete your message?

399
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,720
If that night we
really together...

400
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:02,828
...why didn't you tell me
police if we are together?

401
00:28:02,854 --> 00:28:04,683
So you can confirm my location.

402
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:08,840
If it were that easy to say...

403
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,107
...I must have told you.

404
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:16,360
Actually, what happened to us
shouldn't be a big deal...

405
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,136
...if Queen doesn't die.

406
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,901
What do you mean?

407
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,300
You know I love you, right?

408
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:28,040
And how I spoil you.

409
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,135
You keep drinking, I don't know why.

410
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,003
And you said you needed something
which is stronger than alcohol.

411
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,001
You have something
which is harder than this?

412
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,988
You want to have fun
then I bought it for you.

413
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,080
What do you mean?

414
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,360
Well...

415
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,160
...drugs.

416
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,880
I know, but I mean…

417
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,293
...I?

418
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,042
I ask you
buy me drugs?

419
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,667
You're confused, right?

420
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,612
I am also confused.

421
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,641
I just know you missed it that night.

422
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,440
And that night?

423
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:09,210
Where do we go after that?

424
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:11,317
My place, of course.

425
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:15,985
When the nightclub closes...

426
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,847
...you said you wanted to hang out.

427
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,416
So I invite you to my place.

428
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:22,052
Guy and Peanut came along too.

429
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,578
Actually, I want to spend
time alone with you.

430
00:29:24,603 --> 00:29:28,456
But you said it was better
if they come with us.

431
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:28,200
Darling?

432
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,007
- Huh?
- You are okay?

433
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,987
I did that? Really?

434
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
Yes

435
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,581
I told you you were drunk.

436
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:39,870
And you're out of control.

437
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
No, I mean…

438
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,015
...a person like me does something like that?

439
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,027
It sounds impossible...

440
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:49,480
...I asked you for drugs.

441
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,760
Then I hung out with you.

442
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:54,695
It sounds very unlikely.

443
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,520
If this sounds unreal,
then what sounds real to you?

444
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,558
About me said
you killed Queen?

445
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:01,480
Do you want to believe that?

446
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,680
Well, it's up to you.

447
00:31:05,237 --> 00:31:08,480
Why did I wake up?
in the trash?

448
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:12,240
Rubbish bin?

449
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,720
You said I was with you that night.

450
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:17,698
Why did I wake up?
in the trash?

451
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,634
Why not at your place?

452
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,455
Well, as morning approaches...

453
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,080
...you said you wanted to go home.

454
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,839
So I called a taxi for you.

455
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,087
I don't know what
what happened after that.

456
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,640
Darling?

457
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,760
I can confirm
your whereabouts to the police...

458
00:31:37,073 --> 00:31:39,720
...that you are with me
when Queen died.

459
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,335
I need to ask you one thing.

460
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:46,182
Can you not
tell the police...

461
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,878
...if you get drugs from me?

462
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:49,960
If I get arrested for drugs...

463
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:52,090
...I can't join the competition anymore.

464
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:55,695
Can you tell them?
did you get drugs from someone else?

465
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,273
Please.

466
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,000
Athens?

467
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:07,065
What are you doing here?

468
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
Correct.

469
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:18,418
I don't know why I need to be here.

470
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,280
Did you hear everything?

471
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,648
If you don't understand,
why are you here?

472
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:31,300
If you want to know what happened
why didn't you come from the start?

473
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:34,160
Okay?

474
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,398
So you can
hear it clearly.

475
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,144
RJ
CALL

476
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,377
Why do you keep calling me?

477
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,127
I've taken care of Papang.

478
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,120
He doesn't remember anything
that happened.

479
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,240
He believed everything I said.

480
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:17,823
Now you have to
do your part.

481
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,459
If you come here for
see RJ, he's not here.

482
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,240
The coach suspended him,
so he's not here.

483
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,400
No.
I came to see you.

484
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,962
Do you believe?
what RJ said the other day?

485
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,597
About me?

486
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,840
Whether I believe it or not,
it doesn't matter to you, right?

487
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,347
Did RJ confirm?
your whereabouts to the police?

488
00:35:53,831 --> 00:35:54,960
Not yet.

489
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,360
I think it's good.

490
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,680
So they won't
ask you about Queen.

491
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,720
I don't remember
what happened that night.

492
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,440
But I'm sure
I didn't kill him.

493
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,400
And I don't do it
as RJ said.

494
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,075
That is not me.

495
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:21,240
I don't want to live my life like that
that other people accused me of.

496
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:22,967
In fact,
I'm not like that.

497
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:26,453
I don't want to live
my life is like this again.

498
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,192
I don't know...

499
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,870
...if my presence here...

500
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,000
...and try
explain this to you...

501
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:37,290
...it's good for me.

502
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,250
But I don't want to
you misunderstood me again.

503
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:58,600
I trust you.

504
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,104
What are your next plans?

505
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,400
Who knows.

506
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,616
One thing is for sure...

507
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,956
...I wonder what
actually happened that night.

508
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,303
I think I know...

509
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:42,096
...how to help you.

510
00:37:55,112 --> 00:37:56,040
Aunt Kaew?

511
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,165
I will take you to stay
somewhere else temporarily.

512
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,440
- For safety reasons.
- What?

513
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:04,020
Just pack the essentials.

514
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,878
I will bring
Queen's essentials too.

515
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,417
Queen borrowed my clothes.

516
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,284
I came here to
take my stuff back.

517
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,015
Have you ever been here?

518
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:42,424
No.
This is my first time.

519
00:38:43,503 --> 00:38:45,560
I've known him since high school.

520
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,920
But he never said
his residence.

521
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:49,855
He just said...

522
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,268
...his parents have
business abroad.

523
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,520
His father woke him up
home for him.

524
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:56,348
And he asked
her aunt lives with her.

525
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,299
It's all lies.

526
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,210
He could tell if she was telling the truth.
to you if he is not rich...

527
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,956
...then you don't want to
hang out with him.

528
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,160
This is what hurts me the most.

529
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,660
It's not a matter of lying to me.

530
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,792
But the problem...

531
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,964
...nothing is true
in our friendship.

532
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,841
How about you?

533
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:30,080
You already know him
since a long time ago, right?

534
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,761
I'm not sure what jati is
the person I know...

535
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,747
...is the real him.

536
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,040
But her name is not Queen.

537
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,520
And I called him
with his real name.

538
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,403
I know Queen isn't her real name.

539
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,440
What is his real name?

540
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,075
It doesn't matter now.

541
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,895
He didn't say because he didn't want to.
you know that side of him.

542
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,276
Like me.

543
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,167
I didn't get a chance
get to know Queen.

544
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,480
I disappeared from his life for a long time.

545
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,680
When I come back...

546
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,020
...he's dead.

547
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,852
I know you suspect me.

548
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,167
But I didn't kill him.

549
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,120
I?

550
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,000
Suspecting you?

551
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,472
I just know
you cover your boyfriend.

552
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,480
You mean?

553
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,035
You know it clearly.

554
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,003
Your boyfriend asks you to lie to him
police if you are with him.

555
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,642
Can you accept?
the reality?

556
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,520
When you are with me...

557
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,526
...what is your boyfriend doing?

558
00:40:49,526 --> 00:40:50,560
Wait.

559
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,761
You don't want your clothes anymore?

560
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,825
No, I have to
give it to Queen.

561
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,680
Hey!

562
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,803
Did you see that drawer key?

563
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,160
- What?
- Key.

564
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:08,769
When you search this room,
do you see any keys?

565
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
There isn't any.

566
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Aunt?

567
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,753
I'm worried about you.

568
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,760
If you really mean it
worrying me...

569
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,558
...don't bother me.

570
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,730
I'm going to get in trouble
if you are near me.

571
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,241
You have to move on with your life.

572
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,792
I will not go
everywhere.

573
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Aunt!

574
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,480
What did you find?
Tell me.

575
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,647
About what?

576
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,058
Everything.

577
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,560
Especially about my boyfriend.

578
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,200
Why do you suspect him?

579
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,182
What do you think he did?

580
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,960
Well, then...

581
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:17,925
...we need to have a long talk.

582
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,456
I don't have any free time.
