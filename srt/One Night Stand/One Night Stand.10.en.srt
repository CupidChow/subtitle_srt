1
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,173
SKIPPING CLASS TODAY?
WANT TO HANG OUT TONIGHT?

2
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
How?

3
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:13,384
Do you want to jump again?

4
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,174
You are crazy?

5
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:18,515
I never wanted to
suicide, never.

6
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:20,718
Just feeling tired.

7
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:22,023
Don't want to meet anyone.

8
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,942
I see RJ
and he keeps looking for you.

9
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:28,142
I know. It sucks.

10
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:29,182
Look.

11
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,342
He likes to send me his photos
bare chested.

12
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:36,877
If he wants to make love,
then he should use his money...

13
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:38,895
...instead of doing this
to others.

14
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:42,210
What is so funny?

15
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,821
I laughed at RJ.

16
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:50,000
You want to know the secret?

17
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:51,384
What secret?

18
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:57,678
He is gay.

19
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:58,862
What?

20
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:02,701
- Are you serious?
- Correct.

21
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,011
Who am I?

22
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:08,047
I am not Makham,
I'm not rambling.

23
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:10,536
If I knew
someone's secret...

24
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:12,980
...then it must be true.

25
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,120
Why is he trying to approach me?

26
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:20,156
He is still confused
with himself.

27
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:23,370
One must
pass through this phase.

28
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:27,768
Don't be mad at him, okay?

29
00:02:35,662 --> 00:02:37,500
What?
You don't believe me?

30
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,319
It is not like that.

31
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:43,393
Just confused
how do you know the secret.

32
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:48,192
My special talent.

33
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,679
Queen is not
gossip loving type.

34
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,117
If that's the case...

35
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:00,714
...then he can't
be my friend.

36
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,462
But he knows
the secret of many people.

37
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:05,737
Hard to believe...

38
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:08,348
...he keeps his secret
like this.

39
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:12,517
I told you so
someone like Queen...

40
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,500
...shouldn't be friends
with anyone.

41
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:24,074
I don't know why he did this.

42
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:27,533
For fun
or does it satisfy him?

43
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,091
Queen didn't do it
to find excitement.

44
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:33,850
He keeps this information
for later use.

45
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,662
If so,
I have to keep my secret.

46
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:52,154
What should we do?
with the others?

47
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:55,874
Should we return it?
to the owner?

48
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,534
Maybe we can
watch it first.

49
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,980
We can find
something useful.

50
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:06,228
You better not.

51
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:08,680
This is a secret.

52
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,781
We should
not violate it.

53
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:12,924
How?

54
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:16,116
We'll talk about it later.

55
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,640
I'm more worried
Gale's safety.

56
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,632
Of course, Toy.

57
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:32,511
I will be here with you.

58
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,821
I will not run away from you.

59
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:37,210
I will stay here,
by your side.

60
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:41,808
I will wait to see
your life burns in hell.

61
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:44,498
I will be by your side.

62
00:04:44,982 --> 00:04:46,641
When you're not paying attention...

63
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,072
...I am...

64
00:04:48,342 --> 00:04:49,919
...which will
ruin your life.

65
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,174
What do you mean?

66
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,400
It's not that complicated.

67
00:04:57,622 --> 00:04:59,360
You don't let me go.

68
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:02,120
You can't expect
everything will be the same.

69
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:13,782
Okay.

70
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:15,882
When the time comes...

71
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:18,661
...you will understand...

72
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:22,582
...if you and I
inseparable.

73
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:26,790
Yes, I am a monster.

74
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:28,714
I'm a bad man.

75
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:30,642
How about you?

76
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,991
You think
you are better than me?

77
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:36,876
So I need to thank you
to Queen?

78
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:41,622
Because it makes me
see your true self.

79
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:43,672
You are just…

80
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,243
Watch your attitude.

81
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,364
You have to accept...

82
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:00,942
...that your life and my life...

83
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,902
...already tightly bound.

84
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,846
If my life is ruined,
so is your life.

85
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,582
I told you...

86
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:16,585
...From now on
nothing will be the same.

87
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:22,098
I won't let you be the only one
the person who destroyed me.

88
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:29,085
RJ

89
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,650
Hello? What do you want?

90
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:50,088
I've had enough of this.

91
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:52,001
Enough? Enough with what?

92
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:55,182
I will be honest
to the police.

93
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,426
What's wrong with you?

94
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:02,232
You still don't understand.

95
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:05,022
Everything is out of control.

96
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:07,489
I can't either
contact Guy.

97
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:11,037
And I don't know if Peanut
say something to the police.

98
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,062
Unlucky.

99
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:14,643
You said your parents
help hide him.

100
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:20,658
That's what I know but who
who knows the truth.

101
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:22,302
Unlucky!

102
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,748
Listen to me.

103
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:27,132
I don't care...

104
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:29,542
...their words
to the police.

105
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,400
But you have to keep your mouth shut.
You understand?

106
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:37,991
Give me money.

107
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:39,364
What did you say?

108
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,094
I will hide
at another place.

109
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:42,891
And I need money.

110
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:45,942
How many?

111
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:48,782
3 million.

112
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,237
You bastard!

113
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,197
Give me money
and I will live somewhere else.

114
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,955
And there is nothing
who can track me.

115
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,262
If not,
I will confess to the police.

116
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:00,342
I am tired
live like this.

117
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:03,114
I need the money tomorrow, okay?

118
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:19,862
Excuse me.

119
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,567
You came here alone
or...

120
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:24,208
...waiting for someone?

121
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:42,902
1 bottle of beer.

122
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,022
Why?

123
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,230
You will say
if this is not you?

124
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,222
Are you following me?

125
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:23,850
Don't say things like that.

126
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:26,295
I'm just curious.

127
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:30,089
I heard a lot of people
talking about you. And...

128
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:33,069
...they can only talk
but did nothing.

129
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:35,982
If I want to find out about
something, I need to know what the problem is.

130
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:40,770
Do you want my story to spread?

131
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Are you unemployed?

132
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:45,837
Why?

133
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:47,862
What I do
none of your business.

134
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:50,855
I like this one.

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,647
I think you should
tell everyone this.

136
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,695
- I have to upload this on my IG.
- Give it to me.

137
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,404
WIPE

138
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,933
EMPTY FOLDER

139
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:14,422
Have you deleted everything?

140
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,935
You want to delete it
How many times?

141
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,685
I have a copy.

142
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:23,402
Hey, Queen!

143
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:31,560
I don't think I need to
show it to many people.

144
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,422
I just show it
to your father.

145
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:34,462
Queen.

146
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:35,982
Why?

147
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:38,625
You don't accept who you are?

148
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:45,462
RJ.

149
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:48,525
I know it's hard and...

150
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,377
...need time...

151
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:53,212
...while your father
conservative.

152
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:57,262
Actually,
your sexuality and...

153
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,589
...are you going to tell me?
everyone is up to you.

154
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,453
It's not your fault.

155
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,462
What's the point of doing that?

156
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:07,606
Who knows I…

157
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:09,662
...need your help.

158
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:11,177
About what?

159
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:13,019
What do you want me to do?

160
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,333
Everything I command.

161
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,128
I can give you 1 million.

162
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,964
Okay. Tomorrow, yeah.

163
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,949
Hey.

164
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,933
How long
do i have to pay you?

165
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,625
Until you are ready
to release Gale.

166
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:34,498
When I told Gale
your secret...

167
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:36,752
...he will definitely leave you.

168
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,182
Do not forget...

169
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:42,734
...Gale agrees to go on a date with you
because of your good reputation.

170
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,419
If he knew...

171
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:47,168
...nobles like you...

172
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:49,976
...failed in everything
and even sell drugs...

173
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,429
...he will definitely leave you.

174
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,542
Come on, don't be stingy.

175
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:04,263
Your Business with Pepper
going well, right?

176
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:08,942
Don't forget me who
introducing you two.

177
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,222
Just think of it as your way
thank me.

178
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:17,064
You will blackmail me
until I have nothing left?

179
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:20,748
Just think, between...

180
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,527
...give me money,

181
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,368
and lost Gale...

182
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,533
...which is worse?

183
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:34,018
How much is Gale worth to you?

184
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,402
Gale, I don't know.
if I'm still alive tomorrow.

185
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:22,542
If something happens to me...

186
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:24,788
...I want to give you something.

187
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,444
Your own secret.

188
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:29,866
Stored in the desk drawer
in my bedroom.

189
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,047
There is a key on the table.

190
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,694
Oh. There's a secret, Toy, too.

191
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:36,517
You can watch it.

192
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,984
It can be useful for your life.

193
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,013
Gale doesn't answer his phone.

194
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:09,982
I tried calling his mother.

195
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:11,830
He says
Gale with Toy.

196
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,484
Wait!
Where are you going?

197
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:21,495
I have to meet him.
I need to talk to him.

198
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:24,631
What is the point
meet him now?

199
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,157
Toy will be even angrier
if I see you.

200
00:15:27,182 --> 00:15:28,928
Gale could be in big trouble.

201
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,893
I will save him
from him.

202
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,678
How to?

203
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,033
Why don't men think about it?

204
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:37,302
You think
you can punch Toy...

205
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:39,542
...and Gale will
free from it?

206
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:44,464
I guess he's right.

207
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:48,806
If Toy really
holding Gale's secret...

208
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,172
...nothing can
save him.

209
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,302
Let's make it like this.

210
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:03,314
I know
you're worried about Gale.

211
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:05,102
But wait until
I talked to him.

212
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:09,375
At least, I can hear from him.
about the real problem.

213
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:13,303
Will he talk to you?

214
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:16,060
You call him and he
not answering his phone.

215
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:18,794
I will meet him
tomorrow at school.

216
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:21,004
Then I can
ask him.

217
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:24,185
I think you should
go home now.

218
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:29,319
Never mind, maybe the circumstances
not as bad as you think.

219
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:35,457
You know... when Queen
said he had a problem...

220
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:38,225
...I thought so too
nothing will happen.

221
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,832
Eventually...

222
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,685
...I can't
save him.

223
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,093
What do you think?

224
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:53,928
Gale's Secret
which is kept by Queen?

225
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:55,446
Anything.

226
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:58,024
How do I know?

227
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:02,237
You said that sometimes Queen can talk too much
and tells RJ his secret.

228
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:06,239
Maybe Queen let it slip
and said something about Gale.

229
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,222
Well...

230
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:17,835
Queen talks about people's secrets
from time to time.

231
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,382
Some are true, and some are not.
I can't remember everything.

232
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:23,203
Do you remember anything?

233
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:25,622
Well...

234
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:29,237
Gale's mother is addicted to gambling,
very serious.

235
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:31,031
They live in a big house.

236
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,607
But his mother
struggling with debt.

237
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:37,062
Gale has to find a job
in the entertainment business...

238
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,928
...to pay off his mother's debt.

239
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:44,982
It's probably no secret...

240
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:47,422
...which can be used Toy
towards Gale.

241
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:48,462
Yes, right?

242
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:51,582
Or…

243
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:54,609
...about the incident
in the first year?

244
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:55,742
What's that?

245
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,658
I can't tell you this.

246
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,477
And I won't tell you.

247
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,127
Let Gale do it
tell you about it.

248
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:30,462
What is it?

249
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:33,942
Why?

250
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:35,714
You look tense.

251
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,649
Your disaster comes sooner
than you think?

252
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:40,547
Up to you.

253
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,563
As long as you are with me...

254
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:45,299
...that's the most important thing.

255
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:47,728
You're the one who messed up
my drama job offer?

256
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:50,826
You got a role in this drama,
to replace Queen...

257
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,739
...because I asked the team
to choose you.

258
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,265
If you want to break up with me...

259
00:19:57,942 --> 00:20:00,435
...then you lose
this job offer. That's all.

260
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,549
So, this is what you want?

261
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:05,837
I told you...

262
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:07,437
...we need to hold on tight...

263
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,330
...in difficult times like these.

264
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:12,913
Every time
you let go of my hand...

265
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,182
...both of us
will be destroyed together.

266
00:20:27,698 --> 00:20:29,329
Let it disintegrate.

267
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:30,742
What did you say?

268
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:33,806
I don't care
what are you going to do.

269
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:37,846
Tell them to fire me
from this drama, i don't care.

270
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:41,077
If you think someone like me
can't live without you...

271
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:43,114
...I have to tell you
if you are wrong.

272
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:47,857
Are you sure about that?

273
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:49,142
Of course.

274
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:52,477
I'm sure we're over.

275
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,609
If you break up with me...

276
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:58,024
...not just your drama...

277
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,205
...but I will definitely
ruin your life.

278
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:03,593
No.

279
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,962
I can't say
I will be the one to destroy it.

280
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,850
Queen did it.

281
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:13,491
He did not destroy
fully.

282
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:16,663
Eventually...

283
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:20,167
...you did it yourself.

284
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:25,513
- What do you mean?
- Why?

285
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:29,040
Don't tell me you don't remember...

286
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,884
...embarrassing thing
what you do.

287
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:43,493
I take this
from Queen's place.

288
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,752
It seems like all this time
he kept this.

289
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:12,262
Give it to me.

290
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,102
Look?

291
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:21,138
I actually
can ruin your life.

292
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:01,502
Hey, what's this?

293
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,542
Gale.

294
00:23:14,422 --> 00:23:17,321
Did you sleep very well?

295
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,089
What are you doing?

296
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:55,323
I told you...

297
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:58,984
...after this,
nothing will be the same again.

298
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,477
I will not remain silent...

299
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:05,558
...and let you be
the only person who hurt me.

300
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:12,277
Where is the USB?

301
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,877
In your safe?

302
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:17,031
Tell me the combination number?

303
00:24:18,785 --> 00:24:20,178
What if I don't want to?

304
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:22,288
What will you do?

305
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:24,910
You dare
do something to me?

306
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:34,018
You want to tell me
or not?

307
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:00,803
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

308
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:02,343
All 8, right?

309
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,904
You have to do that?

310
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,382
Correct.

311
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,757
Chivas asks us to keep it
until we know what to do.

312
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:20,982
This means we need
responsible for it.

313
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,593
I told you to keep it
at my place and you forbid me.

314
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:26,116
No.
You can check it out.

315
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,538
You don't want to know?

316
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:31,607
- No.
- Even just a little?

317
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:36,685
But inside
There's a secret, Coach Kwang.

318
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:39,587
You don't want to know
what's the secret?

319
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:43,672
Not at all.

320
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:49,252
Queen is dead and we
don't act like Queen.

321
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,719
You are a hypocrite.

322
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:57,835
Huh?

323
00:25:58,582 --> 00:26:01,261
I will give you a chance
to say it.

324
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:04,262
Look at yourself,
you force your nature.

325
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:06,182
I can tell you don't
say what you want.

326
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:08,739
Oh yeah? You think?
am I that kind of person?

327
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:13,493
I think you just
describe yourself.

328
00:26:18,302 --> 00:26:19,302
What?

329
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:20,692
Hey!

330
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:23,024
Wait!

331
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:26,473
Where are you going?
We need to talk.

332
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,187
What do you mean by that?

333
00:26:34,142 --> 00:26:35,178
What do you want?

334
00:26:35,382 --> 00:26:37,038
That's who you are.

335
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,862
You didn't say
What do you think.

336
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:41,742
You are a hypocrite and your actions
different from your thoughts.

337
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:44,117
What? I'm sincere.

338
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:45,837
I'm easy to read.

339
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:46,862
Oh yes?

340
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,815
Can you swear...

341
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:50,822
...reason
you want to stay away from me...

342
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:53,311
...that I am just
your one night stand is true?

343
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:58,422
If you can't
say it...

344
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:00,993
...stop convincing me
if you are easy to read.

345
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,262
Hey!

346
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:06,822
Hey?

347
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:09,726
Hey...

348
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:11,272
- What should we do?
- Enough.

349
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:14,065
The elevator is stuck.
Don't just press the button.

350
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:15,665
Step back.

351
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:26,919
Say
what is the combination number!

352
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:29,587
I don't want to say.

353
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:35,342
Gale?

354
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:40,201
It's enough.

355
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:41,502
Gale...

356
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:46,382
Okay.

357
00:27:46,662 --> 00:27:47,662
Okay.

358
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:49,431
I'll tell you.

359
00:28:04,822 --> 00:28:06,194
OPEN

360
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:38,702
The technician is fixing it
the damage within 10 minutes.

361
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:40,602
Thank You.

362
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,761
Just like that? That's not enough.

363
00:28:48,942 --> 00:28:51,117
You should sleep with him,
then record and share with me.

364
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:54,710
I will rise from my grave
and be your witness.

365
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:02,702
Be honest with me,
you lied to me, right?

366
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,100
You don't have anything, do you?

367
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:21,495
Trust me now?

368
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:24,096
This is just an example.

369
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:26,105
I have more than this.

370
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:28,277
I already have...

371
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:30,212
...what happened that night.

372
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:35,237
Can you
not playing around now?

373
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:36,917
My friend is having trouble.

374
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,754
If you have something,
then send it to me.

375
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:46,518
I have to make sure Athens
really get away from you.

376
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,102
Wait.

377
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,835
You were just chatting
with Queen?

378
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,502
Yeah. I know that…

379
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:02,397
I know
that's not the real Queen.

380
00:30:02,422 --> 00:30:04,957
But he said
he had proof that night.

381
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:08,112
He will send it to me
if I follow his orders.

382
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,877
What does he want you to do?

383
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:11,640
What is the order?

384
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:14,241
He told me
away from you.

385
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,328
I know
This sounds stupid but…

386
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:23,906
...I really don't know
what to do.

387
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,964
How can you be sure?
he has proof...

388
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:29,564
He sent something
but he deleted it.

389
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,652
I'm sure he does.

390
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:33,750
What else is this?

391
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:36,004
What kind of ridiculous joke is this?

392
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:53,348
I investigate my secret
which is kept by Queen.

393
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:56,652
I wonder what he wants
reveal what secret.

394
00:30:57,651 --> 00:31:00,480
It's nothing really.

395
00:31:00,582 --> 00:31:03,437
Just a photo of me drunk
and wearing minimal clothing.

396
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,302
Everyone has seen this.

397
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:06,942
I'm a bit disappointed.

398
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:08,794
I think it's more than this.

399
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,455
You know better than Queen.

400
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:13,739
You know my secret
more than Queen.

401
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,058
Actually...

402
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,781
...you said I didn't say
according to my heart's desire...

403
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,482
...and I think that's true.

404
00:31:29,142 --> 00:31:31,964
I never followed my heart,
never even once.

405
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:36,105
I lied to myself
I'm great at many things.

406
00:31:36,422 --> 00:31:37,637
Actually it is...

407
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,312
...I am a coward
and losers.

408
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:43,142
That is not true.

409
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:46,006
I never thought
I deserve you.

410
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,702
The closer we get...

411
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,381
...the more I feel…

412
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:53,182
...I don't deserve it
a good man like you.

413
00:31:53,222 --> 00:31:55,024
And someone like you...

414
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:57,948
...shouldn't date
people like me.

415
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:02,142
This is it…

416
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:04,552
...my secret.

417
00:32:05,822 --> 00:32:06,822
How?

418
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:10,022
When you hear me
said it yourself...

419
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:12,877
...sad, isn't it?

420
00:32:13,062 --> 00:32:15,541
Sounds like a loser.

421
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:21,462
You want to know...

422
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:24,724
...my kept secret
by Queen?

423
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:33,302
This.

424
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:35,759
This photo.

425
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:40,535
I used to be just...

426
00:32:40,822 --> 00:32:43,381
...fat kid...

427
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:45,390
...the ugly one.

428
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,757
I don't look handsome
or cute at all.

429
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:49,241
It's so ugly, look at this.

430
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:52,742
Just that?

431
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:57,343
You think
it doesn't matter, right?

432
00:32:58,302 --> 00:33:01,707
But I was devastated
Actually.

433
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:04,477
Just think,
someone like Queen...

434
00:33:04,502 --> 00:33:08,236
...trying to dig up my shame
to expose me.

435
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,160
And only this
that he could find.

436
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:14,910
Meaning of my life
very boring.

437
00:33:15,182 --> 00:33:18,125
There's nothing special about me,
so boring.

438
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:20,859
But my life is simple.

439
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,982
To be honest...

440
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:29,557
...it doesn't matter if you...

441
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:32,578
...facing some things
the horrible...

442
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:34,888
...whatever happens...

443
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:37,053
...your grades haven't changed...

444
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:39,643
...at least, in my eyes.

445
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:43,069
And I'm very ordinary...

446
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:44,821
...nothing special.

447
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:46,730
I used to be fat.

448
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:54,062
Do you know?

449
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:56,205
Actually...

450
00:33:56,542 --> 00:34:00,033
...it's not even me
in the video.

451
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:06,183
I'm too lazy
to deny it.

452
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:08,680
If I say something, anyway
people think of me as a liar.

453
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:09,822
So I…

454
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:12,522
...just admit it.

455
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:16,662
That didn't happen either
on RJ.

456
00:34:20,582 --> 00:34:24,022
As I said,
so i...

457
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:27,578
...act as if...

458
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:30,535
...I don't care
other people's thoughts.

459
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:34,386
But deep down,
you care, right?

460
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,342
The board...

461
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:48,828
...you don't need to
prove anything.

462
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,410
You just need to know
who are you...

463
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:54,531
...and how valuable you are.

464
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:57,187
Just that.

465
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:00,145
Do you know?

466
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:14,795
Hey.

467
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:16,262
How?

468
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:18,564
- Okay.
- Okay.

469
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,302
Gale?

470
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:32,582
Gale?

471
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,029
I have to go.

472
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:41,312
Can you clear it?
this tub first?

473
00:35:41,462 --> 00:35:42,701
Untie me, now.

474
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:44,765
Someone is coming
and save you.

475
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:46,082
I have to go.

476
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:47,622
Gale.

477
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:50,480
You know everything
what i do...

478
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:52,522
...is because
I love you.

479
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:54,531
I really love you.

480
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:56,551
Please don't leave me.

481
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,622
Gale.

482
00:35:57,702 --> 00:35:58,702
Gale.

483
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:00,222
Gale.

484
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:04,462
Gale.

485
00:36:18,382 --> 00:36:19,382
Gale?

486
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:24,184
Can I come in?

487
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:39,408
Are you okay?

488
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:41,049
I'm really worried about you.

489
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:43,683
I don't know
where to go.

490
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:47,957
If I go home, my mother will force me
reconcile with Toy.

491
00:36:48,062 --> 00:36:50,902
If I meet Papang,
Toy will see me there.

492
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,080
I don't want to
he got into trouble.

493
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:55,591
I know
we just met.

494
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:57,846
- But I…
- It doesn't matter.

495
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,799
You can stay here.

496
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,053
I promise...

497
00:37:03,062 --> 00:37:04,654
...will protect you.

498
00:37:18,382 --> 00:37:19,382
Isn't it...

499
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:23,560
...i don't like you
but you don't have to force yourself.

500
00:37:25,302 --> 00:37:27,310
I want to be free from him.

501
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,272
You can help me, right?

502
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:53,462
How are you?

503
00:37:54,662 --> 00:37:56,038
Gale replied to my message.

504
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:59,129
He told me not to worry,
he is with Chivas now.

505
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:03,426
What is the relationship between the two of them?

506
00:38:03,702 --> 00:38:06,484
What is their relationship?
as we thought?

507
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:08,752
I also do not know.

508
00:38:08,942 --> 00:38:12,600
But it's good that he finally
could break up with Toy.

509
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:16,283
How about you?

510
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:21,852
Are you still waiting for proof?
from that fake Queen?

511
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:25,330
I do not think so.
I can't wait any longer.

512
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:30,622
Okay?

513
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:34,899
Let's talk about myself
in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

514
00:38:49,382 --> 00:38:50,702
Why did you do that?

515
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:53,091
You don't want any proof, do you?

516
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,448
SWIPE UP
SO THAT THE MESSAGE IS NOT SEEN

517
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:10,156
I've been here for a long time
waiting for you to jump.

518
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:11,852
Why still not?

519
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:13,938
Why did you change your mind?

520
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:16,997
How did you get in here?

521
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:19,910
Where is Athens?

522
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:21,997
You don't see
he's not here?

523
00:39:22,062 --> 00:39:23,942
Tell me where he is!

524
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:28,102
Otherwise, I will broadcast it live.
did you use drugs here?

525
00:39:28,142 --> 00:39:32,437
Your stupid fans
will see your true self...

526
00:39:32,462 --> 00:39:35,100
...the rotten one.

527
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,118
Please.

528
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,210
Just do it!

529
00:39:42,982 --> 00:39:44,598
Please expose me.

530
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:47,946
And I will
expose you again.

531
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:50,446
And you will
see who really is...

532
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,984
...who will have no place
in society.

533
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:01,736
It's a good thing Athens isn't here.

534
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:06,982
At least, he knows not to
humble yourself like this.

535
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,346
One day, later...

536
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:14,971
...I'll show you what he's supposed to be
not being around someone like you.

537
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:21,417
He just said...

538
00:40:22,022 --> 00:40:24,855
...he likes Papang.

539
00:40:27,382 --> 00:40:28,750
What did you say?

540
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:33,638
A woman like her?

541
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:38,125
Not true.

542
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:40,301
Impossible.

543
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:45,468
Just admit it.

544
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:50,669
No matter how hard you try,
he still doesn't want you.

545
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:54,609
He never saw you.

546
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:59,765
But I guess...

547
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:02,924
...he's rejecting me now.

548
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,915
But I guess I can steal it.

549
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:09,944
When the time comes...

550
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,895
...I will make sure
if he loves and adores me.

551
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:17,489
And I will break her heart
like he broke my heart.

552
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:20,904
He won't be able to
sleep or eat.

553
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:23,805
How?

554
00:41:24,822 --> 00:41:26,439
I will do that.

555
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:28,426
Just wait.

556
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:31,662
Damn woman!

557
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:35,335
Crazy bitch!
What a psychopath!

558
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:37,702
Go to hell! Come on!

559
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:40,382
Jump! Do it!

560
00:41:47,542 --> 00:41:48,542
Huh?

561
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:51,741
Why did you
don't just push me?

562
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:54,932
You say
you want me dead.

563
00:41:57,862 --> 00:41:59,620
You don't dare to push me?

564
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:01,477
Just push me!

565
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:03,214
Come on, just do it!
