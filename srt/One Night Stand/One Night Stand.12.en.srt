1
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,960
Death investigation report...

2
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,760
...Miss Katariya Kijnueng or Queen...

3
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,270
...a celebrity
famous 21 years old.

4
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,007
Cause of death...

5
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,160
...is falling from a tall building.

6
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:08,639
MURDERER?

7
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:13,000
The autopsy report found
proof of resistance before death.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,558
The deceased was physically tortured
before dying.

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,011
It happened that night...

10
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,060
...at 00.00 on April 1st...

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,695
...or April Fools.

12
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:28,096
ONE NIGHT STAND CLUB
APRIL FOOLS DAY PARTY

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,135
People see it as a party
which is ridiculous and irresponsible...

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,840
...that night...

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,336
...including alcohol, sex and drugs...

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,406
...not to mention the activities
dangerous intimacy.

17
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:08,932
Queen…

18
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,672
Queen!

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,478
There isn't anything.

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,320
The night ended with
Queen's death.

21
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,373
Mysterious death.

22
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,666
His body looked suspicious.

23
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,668
Queen's Reputation...

24
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,720
...make people
criticize his death.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,180
They wonder
What really happened.

26
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,795
We worked quietly regardless
from people's opinions...

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,766
...until we found
more instructions.

28
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,440
KATARIYA KIJNUENG MURDER CASE
COVERING THE BODY

29
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,306
MURDERER?

30
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,120
crime scene

31
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,757
The room where Queen uses
drugs before he died...

32
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,295
...rented monthly.

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,869
The tenant is
Mr. Pratipat Sakultewa or Toy.

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,335
PRATIPAT SAKULTEWA
Information from the drug eradication team...

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,975
...said he was involved
with drug dealers.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,496
Chances are he shared
his drugs to Queen.

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,840
Hotel security guards and hotel employees
admitted that the body was moved.

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,617
And Toy ordered them.

39
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,199
He is a nephew
deputy director general of police.

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,109
He is the one who
what you're talking about.

41
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:41,688
You don't recognize
his family name?

42
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,520
We all know it clearly.

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,250
But why does that have anything to do with it?
with the case?

44
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Of course there is.

45
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,584
Actually, there are many.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,754
- But, sir...
- Let's make it like this.

47
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,167
I need all the officers
who handled this case...

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,274
...to work carefully
clearly and honestly.

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,711
Don't care about
names of the people involved.

50
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,960
I don't care
who is he in a relationship with.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,391
If he does something bad,
he must be punished.

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,437
You can be bigger
from anyone in this country...

53
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,555
...but everyone should
obey the law in this country.

54
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,575
We have to draw a conclusion...

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,952
...what happened
in the room that night.

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,800
What or who is the cause?
Queen fell from the balcony?

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,818
Look for evidence and information
be as useful as you can.

58
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:33,695
More importantly...

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,360
...development of this case
must be kept secret.

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,440
We may need to address
the interests of invisible people.

61
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,046
Working with
careful and efficient...

62
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:46,211
...will lead to
discovery of the guilty person.

63
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,555
The discovery of clues has
done with care...

64
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,680
...because we don't want to
Toy became alert.

65
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,531
He could have used the connections
his family to intervene.

66
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,640
We need to find information
from the individual in depth.

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Watch out!

68
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,510
MAINTENANCE BUILDING

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,040
- Does not matter?
- There isn't any.

70
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,955
I was just talking
with your parents.

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,486
They are very worried about you.

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,840
How much longer will you continue
make them sad like this?

73
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,312
Don't worry.

74
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,484
Your parents will tell everyone
their people take care of you secretly.

75
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,309
I can assure you that...

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,523
...nothing is
can find you.

77
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
Peanuts.

78
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,430
For your own safety...

79
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,672
...I think you should
tell me the truth.

80
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:34,787
WE CAN HAVE BEER AT MY PLACE.

81
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
Thank you for deciding
to be honest.

82
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,188
You did the right thing.

83
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,883
Although some of
your actions are wrong...

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,560
...you work together
with the investigation team...

85
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,680
...your sentence could be lighter.

86
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,000
Until the case is closed...

87
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,520
...the officers will protect you
from afar for your safety.

88
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,360
If not necessary...

89
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,360
...don't contact RJ.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,680
And you can't tell him
you talk to me.

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
Okay?

92
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,400
Guy and Peanut are at the scene...

93
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,216
...and they are willing to tell the truth.

94
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,680
They and the hotel staff
said the same thing that...

95
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,484
...Toy on duty
move the body.

96
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,953
Do you know what happened?
to Queen in that room?

97
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,080
They don't know
what happened to him.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,851
What is he doing there?

99
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,334
Who cares?

100
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,135
Come here and take this.

101
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,320
There's still some left.

102
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Come on.

103
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,984
I have to throw up first.

104
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Hey!

105
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,358
Are you serious?

106
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:50,271
Are you going to sleep like that?

107
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,631
Are you awake?

108
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,667
Is there any left?

109
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:01,728
This.

110
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:07,160
Who is that? Look.

111
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,335
What are you doing?

112
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
What the hell?

113
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
What is it?

114
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,794
What's wrong with you?

115
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,350
Where is Queen?

116
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
Queen?

117
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,310
Where is he?

118
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:35,563
Why?

119
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,359
He fell from the balcony and died.

120
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,075
You don't know?

121
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,549
That's bullshit.

122
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,863
Queen died before...

123
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
...Guy and Peanut know
what happened.

124
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:49,836
Sleeping on the bed
all the time.

125
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,709
Therefore...

126
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:55,571
...a person who can give
answer what happened...

127
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,087
...is just RJ.

128
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:00,862
UNKNOWN CALL

129
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,520
Hi, RJ. I'm an Oil Officer.

130
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,023
I need to talk to you
about Queen's case.

131
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
When you're ready, call me.

132
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,520
Please hurry...

133
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,600
...so that we can find
the way out for your problems.

134
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,117
GALE

135
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,040
It's morning.

136
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,609
Why is this student still sleeping?

137
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,055
How about you, Teacher?

138
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,562
No teaching classes today?

139
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,325
I don't want to work today.

140
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,265
I want to be here all day.

141
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:30,560
Me too.

142
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,400
I…

143
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,270
...love you, sir.

144
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,736
You love me?

145
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,111
Of course.

146
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,375
Let me hear you...

147
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,412
...say it with
out loud again.

148
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,297
Hey.

149
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,093
I tried earlier
find out the contents.

150
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:20,446
And I can't
duplicate the file.

151
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:23,485
Queen must have done something.

152
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,973
I guess it happened to you too, right?

153
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:29,840
Correct.

154
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,211
At least, Toy can't make
copy and share your clips.

155
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:37,846
So…

156
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,160
...have you watched it yet?

157
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:43,360
Not yet.

158
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,547
And I don't want to watch it.

159
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,098
Whatever your secret is...

160
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:01,080
...you don't need to worry.

161
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,242
You are safe now.

162
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:11,726
RJ

163
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,689
You don't want to pay me, huh?

164
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:31,469
RJ

165
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:39,640
Damn, I should have
don't trust you.

166
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:57,360
I will give you
1 last chance.

167
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,113
Do the right thing...

168
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,180
...before you don't get it
that chance again.

169
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,381
Congratulations to my beloved friend.

170
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:17,414
You just started dating
different man a few days ago.

171
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,855
And you upload a photo
with a new guy today.

172
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,283
Is your score high enough?
to buy an apartment?

173
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,444
Our suspicions were correct...

174
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,969
...if the person who uploaded it
on IG Queen is your trainer.

175
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,320
You don't believe me?

176
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:42,647
It is not like that.

177
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:45,102
But I see that it doesn't make sense.

178
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,440
The photo I just uploaded on my story
only for Coach Kwang.

179
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,520
- Yes?
- Correct.

180
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,320
Why did you show it to him?

181
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,292
Well, I have
suspected him from the start...

182
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,560
...if Coach Kwang
enter IG Queen.

183
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,993
Why is that?

184
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,047
He likes you.

185
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,720
You don't know anything
about your coach?

186
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,297
I want to know who
the perpetrator, shameful.

187
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:26,815
Using the deceased's social media
to expose people like this...

188
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,844
...who raised you?

189
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,615
Don't do this again.

190
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,280
Queen is destroyed because of you.

191
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:43,361
RJ.

192
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
What do you want?

193
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,815
I told you so
don't come here...

194
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,797
...to the administrator
investigate your case.

195
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,120
Coach...

196
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,750
...you want the administrators
investigate me? Really?

197
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,375
You are not afraid...

198
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,422
...am I telling the truth?

199
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,647
RJ.

200
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
We have agreed.

201
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,175
I remain silent
and follow Toy's movements.

202
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,061
I didn't say
anything about you.

203
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:14,440
When Athens said
he will leave the club...

204
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,655
...you're going to report me?

205
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,127
Is that what you want?

206
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
You want it so much
Athens, right?

207
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,234
You can't speak
to me like that.

208
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:28,400
Why?

209
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,624
Is it hard to hear the truth?

210
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,586
MARCH 31

211
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,714
- Athens.
- Yes?

212
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,647
Happy birthday. This is from me.

213
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,819
- Wow!
- Do you like it?

214
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,540
I see you don't have a watch.
good, so I gave one.

215
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,055
Isn't this too expensive?

216
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,922
Not really.

217
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,516
Just think of it as a gift
for setting an incredible record.

218
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,959
Thank You.

219
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
What?

220
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,816
Don't be jealous.

221
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,914
If you want a gift, then
be a great swimmer like him.

222
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:41,873
You will celebrate
where is your birthday?

223
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:45,040
I want to treat you to dinner
for your birthday. Come on, Everyone.

224
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,320
We will celebrate his birthday later.

225
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:48,695
You may choose.

226
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,789
We have to postpone it.

227
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:54,720
We've already booked a table at the club
&quot;One Night Stand&quot;, Athens is also invited.

228
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,095
But it's up to you, Athens.

229
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,836
If you want to have dinner with the coach
then we can have fun without you.

230
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,070
Hey, you're gonna drag him
to your disgusting lifestyle?

231
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,855
They forced you, right?

232
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,960
If you don't want to go,
then no need.

233
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,555
No, I want to go.

234
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:17,255
But I promise...

235
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,240
...I won't drink much
and go home early to rest...

236
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,578
...so I can be ready
for tomorrow's practice.

237
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,255
I just want to have fun
with friends...

238
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,800
...on my birthday.

239
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:28,935
Smart kids.

240
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:31,230
Tell him you don't
want to hang out with me...

241
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,844
...but you hope
meet women.

242
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:35,461
What do you mean?

243
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Well...

244
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,615
Queen.
He will come there tonight.

245
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,805
I don't know what they will do
go somewhere else after that.

246
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,625
No. You're making it up.

247
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,797
Just tell him.

248
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,160
It is not like that.

249
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,760
Why are you two
always getting ready at my house?

250
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,250
Why don't you guys go?
to another place?

251
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,080
It's more comfortable this way.

252
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,555
Your house is big and
we can record some videos.

253
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,975
Papang Apartment is too small.
We could crash.

254
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
You're exaggerating.

255
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm just a normal person. Okay?

256
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,594
How can I have it?
a big palace like Princess Gale?

257
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,039
Why don't we go to your house?

258
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,672
Right. I never
go to your house.

259
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,760
My aunt doesn't really like guests.

260
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,688
He was afraid that people would steal.
from his house.

261
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,234
FUCKING WOMAN

262
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,758
Get in the car.
I have to answer this.

263
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,156
Hello?

264
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,742
Where are you taking Athens?

265
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,719
Wow, you figured it out so fast.
You're like a dog...

266
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:58,200
...who licks canned fish.

267
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,125
Just licking but not feeling.

268
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,389
When will you leave my Athens?

269
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,520
What?

270
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,520
Yours?

271
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,008
I've taken care of it
since he was young.

272
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:12,398
And I'm the one who pushes
him to grow.

273
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,242
People like you can only
drag him to hell.

274
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:17,399
Hmm... You are indeed a liar.

275
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:20,880
You act like you are
good coach who pushed him.

276
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:22,440
Just be honest...

277
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:24,524
...you want him to approach you, right?

278
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,640
- Damn woman!
- What?

279
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:29,312
What are you going to do to me?

280
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,398
Okay.

281
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:35,798
I will tell him to come
come here for morning exercise...

282
00:22:35,823 --> 00:22:37,447
...so he'll come home early.

283
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,920
And he can't socialize
with you later.

284
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,528
You know very well when it comes to training...

285
00:22:43,766 --> 00:22:46,141
...Athens will obey
whatever I say.

286
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,760
Wow! Show off your strength.

287
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,047
Please.

288
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:54,593
If that's what you do...

289
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,313
...then I will expose you.

290
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,720
What do you mean?

291
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:01,249
You chose the wrong enemy.

292
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,180
You think I don't know...

293
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,188
...what's your secret?

294
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,760
I know you use your position to
get extra money from parents.

295
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:14,243
That's why people like RJ
can act pretentious in the club.

296
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:17,334
What do you mean?

297
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,704
You can't slander me.

298
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,280
I have proof.

299
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,000
Please.

300
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,680
If you try
keep me away from Athens...

301
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:30,180
...I will share
the proof is on my social media.

302
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,477
And you won't be able to
facing anyone.

303
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
How about it, Coach?

304
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:45,515
Who called you?

305
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:47,975
That bastard Coach Kwang.

306
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,615
Old man monopolist.

307
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,424
When he knew I was going out
with Athens tonight...

308
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,703
...he couldn't hold back his anger.

309
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,227
Are you still having problems with him?

310
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,827
I never humble myself
quarrel with him.

311
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:01,875
He is the one who always
trying to stop me.

312
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,255
When I met Athens
in the pool...

313
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,080
...he keeps pushing me away
as if I were an animal.

314
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:07,734
He doesn't even have a swimming pool.

315
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:10,320
Athens is not his girlfriend either.

316
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,080
Hey, you!

317
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,535
Don't you want to join in?

318
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
What?

319
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,680
Usually when I complain about
someone, you join in.

320
00:24:20,828 --> 00:24:22,160
Why are you so quiet today?

321
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,255
You've been ranting all along
about him like that.

322
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,789
Who can
match you with that?

323
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,880
- Can we go now?
- Okay.

324
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,866
That's enough.

325
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,168
I will make Athens
be my girlfriend tonight.

326
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:37,959
I want to see him angry.

327
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,273
What do you want from me?

328
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,209
I want to get out of here.

329
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:46,397
And I need money.

330
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:48,850
I asked Toy
but he didn't give it to me.

331
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,313
So instead
I ask of you.

332
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:52,500
If you want to see me silent...

333
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
...give me 2 million.

334
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,000
Are you crazy?

335
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:59,255
Where can I get it from?
earn money?

336
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,705
But you have money.

337
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:04,734
My father has given you
years of money...

338
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,156
...and that should be enough.

339
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,359
What if I
refuse to give you?

340
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,920
It's not difficult, I just tell you
which is true for everyone...

341
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,812
...if you are there too
in the room that night...

342
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,000
...the night the Queen died.

343
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,120
Oh I see.

344
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:24,495
That's why you're holding on
Queen's cellphone...

345
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,312
...and use
her IG account as her.

346
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,000
What do you mean?

347
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,895
We heard it all.

348
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,775
And you RJ, what's wrong with you?

349
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,775
I order you
do the right thing...

350
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,523
...and you don't even
listening to me at all?

351
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,920
If you knew he was in the room that night,
why didn't you tell the police?

352
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,000
If I get into trouble,
who will take care of me?

353
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,800
Easy for you to say.

354
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,495
- You didn't do anything.
- Hey!

355
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,695
You ask for this and that?

356
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:50,538
I will call the police
right now.

357
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:52,641
- They will interrogate everyone.
- Coach!

358
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,328
Coach! Stop!

359
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,756
You have to say
which is actually to the police.

360
00:25:55,781 --> 00:25:57,803
Otherwise, your secret is out.
hidden by Queen...

361
00:25:57,828 --> 00:25:59,000
...I will reveal.

362
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:02,829
PAPAN

363
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,560
- Hello?
- Hello.

364
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,375
You should interrogate Coach Kwang.

365
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,335
That night he was also in that room.

366
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,170
- Are you sure?
- I'm certain.

367
00:26:16,195 --> 00:26:17,814
RJ can confirm this.

368
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,975
Hey? RJ ran away.

369
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,229
RJ!

370
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,769
RJ!

371
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,000
Hey!

372
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
Stop!

373
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:32,870
You have to listen to me!

374
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:33,895
Stop running away!

375
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,560
And you have to say
which is actually to the police.

376
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,273
You want a situation
get worse than this?

377
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,305
I don't want to go to the police!

378
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,866
Ouch! RJ!

379
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,672
You bastard!

380
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,520
Thank you very much.

381
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,469
I will call him to
make a statement tomorrow.

382
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,158
RJ Problems...

383
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:52,440
...I will look for it.

384
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,175
If you are suspicious
I killed Queen...

385
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,524
...I didn't do it.

386
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,756
Save your words for the police.

387
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Oh yes.

388
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,153
I don't think anyone will
upload anything after this.

389
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,720
People try
report the account.

390
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
The account should be blocked immediately.

391
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:24,081
So Queen will go
From now on.

392
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,680
It feels weird.

393
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,760
Queen is dead.

394
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:30,632
He couldn't feel anything.

395
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,227
If he really is
can feel something...

396
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,480
...I don't think he will be happy...

397
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,400
...because someone is pretending
be him and do like this.

398
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,174
Who knows.

399
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,295
Queen said the most
scary for him is...

400
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,816
...people forgot about him.

401
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,095
Maybe he's happier...

402
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,711
...when people pretend to be him.

403
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,895
I think the most important thing is...

404
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,960
...you are free from this.

405
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,281
Good, right?

406
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,655
Thank You
has accompanied me home.

407
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,258
Actually, it's not necessary.

408
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,397
It doesn't matter.

409
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,040
In that case...

410
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,950
...that's it.

411
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,480
The board…

412
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,320
Eeh… you want to…

413
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:21,156
...I'm leaving now?

414
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,414
I need to be alone tonight.

415
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,622
You will be lonely
if you are alone.

416
00:28:30,164 --> 00:28:32,360
Don't be like that and go home.

417
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:34,480
Okay.

418
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,636
See you tomorrow.

419
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,120
Wait.

420
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Gale.

421
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,480
I don't know if I
can live until tomorrow.

422
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,667
If something happens to me...

423
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,875
...I have to return
something to you.

424
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,438
That's your own secret.

425
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,589
I save it
in the drawer in my bedroom.

426
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,200
There is a key on the table.

427
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,823
Oh yes.

428
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
There's a secret to Toy too.

429
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,680
You can check it out.
It might be useful for your life.

430
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,058
What do you mean?

431
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:06,642
What secret?

432
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:14,040
Pack?
Do you have a phone charger?

433
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:16,821
It's here. Just use it.

434
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,984
I'M IN ROOM 703.

435
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,933
Queen, I've arrived.

436
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,840
Queen.

437
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Gale.

438
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,760
Hey!

439
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,840
You are okay?

440
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,898
I just had a dream.

441
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,360
What are you doing
before I wake up?

442
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,339
I just thought if I
have to wake you up.

443
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,880
You slept for more than 10 hours.

444
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,618
You must be tired.

445
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,194
What Toy tried
barge in here?

446
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,440
I blocked his number and I don't know
if he tries to call another one.

447
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,685
- Did he come here to see you?
- Gale.

448
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,086
Take it easy.

449
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,440
He didn't try to break in.

450
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,360
And he didn't try to call you.

451
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,920
Okay?

452
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,640
You are safe here.

453
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:34,625
Let's make it like this.

454
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:36,386
Take a shower.

455
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,440
I prepared food for you.

456
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,160
I'll wait downstairs.

457
00:33:03,016 --> 00:33:04,840
I don't know where Gale is.

458
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,255
He is not with me.
And he didn't come to see me. Okay?

459
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,417
Where is he?

460
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,867
He didn't come home.

461
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,575
It's none of your business where he is.

462
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,797
One thing is for sure is
he's better off without you.

463
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,345
Do you know what your friend did to me?

464
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,160
He tied me up all night.

465
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,040
My bonds have just been untied.

466
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,015
Your friend indeed
damn woman!

467
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,320
Not a fucking woman
but he is an angel.

468
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,960
If I were him,
I have killed you.

469
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,680
Come on, Gale's not with me. Okay?

470
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,453
He's with Chivas, right?

471
00:33:37,531 --> 00:33:39,040
He's with her, right?

472
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,040
What if it's true?
What will you do?

473
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,520
Unlucky!

474
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:55,807
What is the problem?

475
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,016
What's bothering you so early in the morning?

476
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,268
Toy couldn't let go.

477
00:34:01,445 --> 00:34:04,833
Never mind, Gale is with Chivas now.

478
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,322
Toy can't do anything.

479
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,440
I hope so.

480
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,160
Gale, I'm coming.
meet you today.

481
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,040
Are you still thinking about Toy?

482
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,054
Just a little.

483
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,960
He's not that type of person
who give up easily.

484
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:37,480
I can't predict
the next step.

485
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
That's enough.

486
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,768
There's nothing I need to be afraid of.

487
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:46,520
The reason you lost
appetite for breakfast...

488
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,305
...is me, right?

489
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,646
You think...

490
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,800
...you should
don't sleep with me.

491
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,744
Why...

492
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,943
...you think so?

493
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:05,411
Who knows.

494
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,880
From my experience
and your expression...

495
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,920
...more inclined towards that.

496
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,800
I made you
feel sorry, right?

497
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,680
I only…

498
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,080
...not familiar
with this feeling.

499
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Because…

500
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
...this is the first time...

501
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,240
...i slept with someone
without having any relationship.

502
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
I understand.

503
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
Are you...

504
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:42,612
...angry with me?

505
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,280
You look upset.

506
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:48,477
Why do you think that?

507
00:35:49,421 --> 00:35:50,421
Well...

508
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,120
...your behavior suggests so.

509
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,281
TOY

510
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:09,305
Toy called.

511
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,018
Don't worry.

512
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,117
I told you you were safe here.

513
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,320
I informed the building management
Toys are not allowed to enter.

514
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:28,800
Don't go out if you don't have to.

515
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,126
I will start shooting the drama
in 2 weeks.

516
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,560
And I don't want to skip school.

517
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,095
Let's make it like this.

518
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,440
I will hire a bodyguard
to protect you.

519
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,320
I will urge the police
to catch Toy faster.

520
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,552
Thank You.

521
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:50,000
But I've had enough
trouble you by being here.

522
00:36:50,025 --> 00:36:51,157
Not at all.

523
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,695
I just do
what I have to do.

524
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:01,560
What?

525
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:04,840
Finally you came
to talk to me.

526
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,166
It is not like that.

527
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,024
I came to warn you.

528
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,672
Officers interrogate more
much about the Queen case.

529
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,898
I guess rather than hurt Gale...

530
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,760
...you better ask your father
to help you get through this.

531
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,711
Or you can flee this country.

532
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Of course.

533
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,840
Someone like me
definitely won't be jailed.

534
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,775
But Gale has to come with me.

535
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
Excuse me.

536
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,344
I'm the one taking care of him now.

537
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Oh yes?

538
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,078
What if I
tell you the secret?

539
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Maybe you're the one who will
bring it back to me.

540
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,295
Today we have
developments regarding death...

541
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,680
...Miss Katariya Kijnueng or Queen.

542
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,353
Lieutenant Colonel Kacha Suebkiat...

543
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,375
...who handled this case
giving an interview will...

544
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,960
...hold a press conference
about developments...

545
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:13,769
...this case, keep following.

546
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,160
We found interesting clues and...

547
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:21,652
...it is a virtue
new from the government.

548
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:24,760
That is the policy for
develop infrastructure...

549
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:30,425
...a big project that requires
investment of 300 billion baht.

550
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,603
Today, we will talk
with a team of government consultants.

551
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,960
Her name is
Mr. Phat Dejpaisarn.

552
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:40,850
He is better known as Prof. Phat.

553
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:43,240
- Hello, Professor.
- Hello.

554
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:47,640
It's an honor to be able to
interview you today.

555
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,480
I feel a little strange.

556
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:51,985
I don't feel like
interviewing a politician...

557
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,655
...but I spoke to
a celebrity because...

558
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,440
...you have
many young fans.

559
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,867
So, you are a
politician or celebrity?

560
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:05,525
I'm a politician but...

561
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:09,560
...with some fans.

562
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,135
I want you to see it like this,
I can feel that...

563
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,240
...younger generation
more enthusiastic in politics.

564
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,680
This is a very good sign.

565
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,640
They want to hear
if the government...

566
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,492
...have a new project for them.

567
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,321
This is also important.

568
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,400
Okay.

569
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:31,455
Before discussing further
about the project...

570
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,120
...can I ask you something
secretly?

571
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,200
Secretly?

572
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,120
About the cabinet reshuffle rumors...

573
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,960
...and you will be appointed as
Deputy Minister, is that true?

574
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,960
I need to ask
this rumor to you.

575
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:48,896
Where did you hear that?

576
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,255
I can say, please wait
to see the progress.

577
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,305
I think next week we will
take a closer look at this rumor.

578
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:57,800
Good.

579
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,160
If I say something
first, then…

580
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:12,560
Queen...

581
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
...you have to keep this a secret.

582
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,280
Sure, don't worry.

583
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,240
You can't even
tell Papang.

584
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:23,960
Why?

585
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,400
You don't believe me?

586
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,000
What do I actually get if I
tell people about this?

587
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,996
We are friends.

588
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,078
You can trust me.

589
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,539
Whatever mistakes you make
for me to protect you.

590
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,811
You have to promise me...

591
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:46,680
...you will not betray me.

592
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,677
If I betray you...

593
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,520
...you can kill me.
