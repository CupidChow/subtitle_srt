1
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,016
See you later, Aunt Kaew.

2
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,061
This.

3
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Toys.

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,349
Are you mad at me or what?

5
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,344
When I pick you up
at the nightclub...

6
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,812
...I saw the man
dance with you.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,079
You are not related
with him behind me, right?

8
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,508
Are you crazy?

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,909
Why is he here?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,766
He said he knew Queen.

11
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,501
What did you say?

12
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,860
Why are you jealous?

13
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:26,880
I just danced with him, that's all.

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,121
Yes, I'm done.

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,228
Meet me at my apartment.

16
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,757
You can go now.

17
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,248
Okay.

18
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,632
See you later.

19
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,880
Who's that?

20
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,195
Pepper.

21
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,673
He just came back from Hong Kong.

22
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,975
We will hang out
and watch football.

23
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,249
- At a time like this? You want to…
- Why?

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
There isn't any.

25
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
So?

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,128
Will you take me home?
or should i call a taxi?

27
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,667
What's waiting at home?
Why do you want to go home?

28
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:28,018
You just said Pepper
will hang out at your house.

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,893
That's not the point.

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,749
You can be there too.

31
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Why?

32
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,604
Does my friend disgust you?

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,722
Do you have a plan?

34
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,651
That's why you want to go home.

35
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:47,382
It is not like that.

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,858
You can stay at my apartment.

37
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,965
Where are your friends?

38
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Ouch...

39
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,498
Let's go home now.

40
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,205
Let me go.

41
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,987
You better let him go.

42
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,174
None of your business.

43
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,670
This is my girlfriend.

44
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,500
I came for
pick up my girlfriend.

45
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Come on.

46
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,135
6 MONTHS AGO
Have you finished your English assignment?

47
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
- I don't want to do it.
- What?

48
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,728
- What should I do? You're a nerd.
- You're going to get in trouble.

49
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,556
Do you think he's the culprit?

50
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,542
Is it true?

51
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,705
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

52
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,815
I watched the video over and over again.

53
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,282
I'm sure it's him.

54
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
What video?

55
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,424
Not important.

56
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,615
- I want to know, show me.
- Can't.

57
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,180
- Come on, show me.
- Can't.

58
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,827
- You don't need to see it.
- No need.

59
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,123
- Show me even a little.
- Can't.

60
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,148
Hey.

61
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,792
Can I sit here?

62
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:17,735
Are you guys talking about me?

63
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,951
What do you mean…

64
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,720
...my sex video?

65
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,600
Do you want to watch it?

66
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,800
I… Papang...

67
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,360
Sorry, don't get me wrong.

68
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,680
Do not take it wrong?

69
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,782
So earlier you guys
not talking about me?

70
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:49,381
Here.

71
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Watch it!

72
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,375
I said watch the video!

73
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
Why you do not want?

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,719
Previously you were dying
want to watch it.

75
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,312
Did you see something?

76
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,091
Next time if you
have a question...

77
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,059
...ask me directly,
instead of talking about me like this.

78
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,680
I feel sorry
to him because of the video.

79
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,276
But when you look at his behavior...

80
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:23,532
...he deserved it.

81
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:52,105
Tragic death...

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,080
...a new student...

83
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:58,680
...who jumped from a building,
to run away from shame...

84
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,462
...as a result of the video being leaked
with men all over the internet.

85
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,080
You want a title like that?

86
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,280
I didn't plan on jumping.

87
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,032
That's good.

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,564
My name is Queen.

89
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,673
I know.

90
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,469
Everyone knows your name.

91
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,515
I just want to introduce
myself officially.

92
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,219
We will be classmates.

93
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Hey!

94
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,938
Can I be alone?

95
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,611
In this situation...

96
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,066
...are you sure about that?

97
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,352
If you are here for
give a beautiful speech like...

98
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,229
...You didn't do it
any mistake...

99
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:45,485
...Don't worry...

100
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,200
...your friends support you&quot;...

101
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,720
...just keep it...

102
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,040
...because I
don't want to hear it.

103
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:56,157
I don't want anyone to pity me
or try to understand me.

104
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:00,695
I don't mind with
everything that happened to me.

105
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,440
I'm happy, okay?

106
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,220
I just want to ask...

107
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,915
...do you want to go
with me tonight.

108
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,787
If you want
having fun together...

109
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,141
...let me know on IG.

110
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:33,800
Very funny.

111
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,488
- The man couldn't wait to enter my room.
- Correct.

112
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,368
I saw that.

113
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Hey.

114
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,209
I will always...

115
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:53,860
...to be your friend,
you know that, right?

116
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,880
Of course I know.

117
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,718
You can't betray me, okay?

118
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,280
Hey, someone like me...

119
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,095
...will never betray a friend.

120
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Okay?

121
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,079
If I betray...

122
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,298
...I will face fate
bad all my life.

123
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Okay.

124
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,633
- Okay? Struck by lightning.
- Okay.

125
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,680
- Now I have goosebumps.
- Why is that?

126
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,280
Can I hug you?

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is it?

128
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,832
What do you think?

129
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,160
Thank You.

130
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,669
I was thinking about Queen.

131
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,219
At least eat a little.

132
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
Eat something even if you're stressed.

133
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,520
Now.

134
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:21,041
No need. I'm a big girl,
I can eat by myself.

135
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,588
At least there are many
delicious food in this world.

136
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:38,326
I'm glad you saw it.
like that, eat it.

137
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,920
You will come back
to school tomorrow?

138
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,861
You've been absent for a long time...

139
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,915
...since the incident that happened to Queen.

140
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,920
So what?

141
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,249
I have to go in...

142
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,320
...and listen
people are talking about me.

143
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,000
I have to be the target
people who accuse me...

144
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,720
...kill my own friend?

145
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,693
Why do you care about them...

146
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
...if that's not true?

147
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,615
It's easy for you to say that.

148
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,001
People don't accuse you
kill your own friend.

149
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Why?

150
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,641
You think I did it?

151
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
No!

152
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,539
To be honest...

153
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:25,602
...you are not like yourself.

154
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,672
Usually, you are indifferent to
what people think about you.

155
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,840
You always feel shameless.

156
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:35,352
The board...

157
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,800
...I know it's hard.

158
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,360
But you can't keep going
hiding like this.

159
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,066
The problem is...

160
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,440
...i don't remember
my actions that night.

161
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,640
I don't remember at all.

162
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,320
The problem is not about
those who question you.

163
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,073
You are the problem.
You doubt yourself.

164
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,040
I don't know
What do you think.

165
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,019
But I think...

166
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,367
...no matter what the thought is
people about you...

167
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,392
...whatever happens you
have to believe in yourself.

168
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,008
Trust in your true self.

169
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:31,311
Let go.

170
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:34,212
Let me go!

171
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
Let go!

172
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,295
We have checked
CCTV carefully.

173
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,476
And Gale was telling the truth.

174
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,080
Her boyfriend picked her up when
the nightclub will be closed.

175
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:48,037
But we didn't see Queen
and Papang left the place.

176
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,409
How many exits are there?
at that nightclub?

177
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
No.

178
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,724
Usually there is only one
entrance and exit.

179
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
But regular visitors are sure to...

180
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
...there is a secret door at the back.

181
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,615
They use it
to run away from the officers.

182
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,935
People who
using drugs...

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,880
...also run through this exit.

184
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,916
Of course there is no CCTV there.

185
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,506
As I expected.

186
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,476
Excuse me, Sir.

187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,520
The results from the lab are out.

188
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,320
We found drugs
in Papang urine.

189
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:31,577
Where?

190
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:34,440
How are you?

191
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,683
Are you feeling better?

192
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:44,400
I told you so
whatever happens...

193
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,598
...you have to believe
on yourself.

194
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,906
It's not that I don't want to.

195
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,600
I want to scream
to the world to know...

196
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,185
...I'm not a cruel person
who killed his own friend.

197
00:15:57,592 --> 00:15:59,400
But can not.

198
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,800
I don't even know
what happened that night.

199
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,800
I guess…

200
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,160
...if going through this alone is difficult...

201
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,975
...I think you should...

202
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,529
...find someone
who will go through this with you.

203
00:16:29,502 --> 00:16:31,167
Don't worry about me.

204
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,160
I will get through this...

205
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,793
...as usual.

206
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,200
Well, I tried too hard...

207
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
...again, right?

208
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,315
Forget it. Okay.

209
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,040
Go back to your room,
I will go too.

210
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:05,944
Bye.

211
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,960
Did you say goodbye to Athens?

212
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
How was your date with Athens?

213
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,215
Are you feeling better?

214
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,498
What do you mean?

215
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,272
Come on, you don't want to
open up to Athens?

216
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:03,873
He has been trying for a long time
dating you.

217
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,615
Well, I'm tired.

218
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,108
We'll talk later.
I go to sleep first.

219
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,800
Sleeping again? Come on!

220
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,032
Are you Papang?

221
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,840
Athens?

222
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,374
Sorry. I'm stuck in traffic.

223
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
I…

224
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,372
You are okay?
You look very confused.

225
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:02,895
Do I look different?
with my photo?

226
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
No.

227
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,080
You are the same as your profile picture.

228
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,320
- But you look different.
- What?

229
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:14,835
You look cuter
directly.

230
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,508
We won't ask...

231
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:27,061
...about our personal stories
today, agree?

232
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,720
We can't ask
about our school...

233
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,105
...field of study...

234
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,080
...our family, our home,
something like this.

235
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:35,951
We can't ask
questions like this.

236
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,000
I understand.

237
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:42,800
What's your favorite food?

238
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:45,400
Can I ask this, right?

239
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,280
Well…

240
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,000
I think it's okay.

241
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,529
So you don't
let me see the photos...

242
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:12,920
...the person you're dating?

243
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,490
No need. He's a normal guy.

244
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,560
- Have you slept with him?
- Are you crazy? Not yet!

245
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,498
Huh? Why is that?

246
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:24,401
Don't tell me you're serious about this guy?

247
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,800
No.

248
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,905
You can't expect anything from
the guy i met from online gaming.

249
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,560
I hang out with him
because I need stuff.

250
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,160
That is true.

251
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:39,427
I think &quot;Queen of One Night Love&quot;
will step down from his throne.

252
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,240
Hey, that guy.

253
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Which one?

254
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:53,866
Don't pretend.

255
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:56,709
You can see
the coolest guy from here.

256
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,884
What's wrong with you?

257
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,362
There isn't any.

258
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:12,775
Does he go to school here?

259
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,522
Why don't I
ever seen it?

260
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:15,840
Correct.

261
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:18,270
He just moved here.

262
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:21,600
He is also in the same faculty as us.

263
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,880
I invited you here.

264
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,680
Because I want to
ask you...

265
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,239
...if I could date him.

266
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:33,440
Why are you asking me?

267
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,535
- I just met him.
- Hey.

268
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,959
I ask you to
don't mess with him.

269
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Can?

270
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:42,760
Of course.

271
00:21:52,693 --> 00:21:53,600
Come on.

272
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,521
We will be late and
Princess Gale will complain.

273
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,520
I really like it.

274
00:21:58,545 --> 00:21:59,865
I know.

275
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:02,240
I didn't sleep
with everyone, okay?

276
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,251
What is your relationship with Athens?

277
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:08,281
I can explain this.

278
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,975
What can you do?
like this to me?

279
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,735
I told you so
I'm serious about him.

280
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,067
I want him.

281
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:20,733
But you are still in touch
with him behind me.

282
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,303
You traitor!

283
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,882
You could have slapped me earlier...

284
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:32,745
...because I was careless.

285
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:35,547
But you won't have it
that chance again.

286
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:38,800
I will reveal
who you really are.

287
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,219
What? How do you do it?
reveal me?

288
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,596
Many.

289
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,056
I know everything about you.

290
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:55,592
You can tell if you are very
rotten and have nothing to lose.

291
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,290
But I will make you more
rotten than before. Just wait.

292
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,584
OIL OFFICER

293
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:11,873
Hello?

294
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,928
Can you meet me tomorrow?

295
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:15,920
There is a problem?

296
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,795
What were they talking about for so long?
Do you know?

297
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,764
Who knows.

298
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,120
Hey.
What really happened?

299
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,451
About what?

300
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,446
About Queen, tell me.

301
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,865
I wonder what happened.

302
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:09,487
Who killed Queen?

303
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,474
How can Queen upload
on his IG if he's dead?

304
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:18,170
None of your business.

305
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:20,806
Stop it.

306
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,591
The match has started
almost 15 minutes.

307
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:26,959
Why did you take so long?

308
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:30,045
We talked about work.

309
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Oh yes?

310
00:24:31,522 --> 00:24:33,400
Are you two business partners?

311
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:35,680
That's good.

312
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:38,320
What kind of business?

313
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:40,819
Import products.

314
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:43,295
How long
are you dating her?

315
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,000
About 2 weeks.

316
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,040
That's why you ask so many questions.

317
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,061
Let's make it like this.

318
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,842
No need to talk anymore.

319
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:05,482
WARNING: DRUG USE
SERIOUS IMPACT ON NERVES AND BRAIN

320
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,716
Where do you want to go?

321
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,901
I want to order some liquor.

322
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,099
Stay here.

323
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,399
I will ask him to do it.

324
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,126
What are you waiting for?

325
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:26,373
Get Gale a drink, come on.

326
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,720
That's not true, you're lying.

327
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,410
No way, never.

328
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:59,521
But the laboratory results
already confirmed.

329
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:08,303
TEST RESULT: POSITIVE

330
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:10,983
You guys set me up.

331
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,889
What do we do that for?

332
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,727
Who knows.

333
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,316
I think you want
looking for a scapegoat.

334
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,348
Nothing is
do that to you.

335
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,513
I'm just doing my job.

336
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,716
I don't do drugs.

337
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:28,826
I never
using drugs.

338
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:31,440
If I'm not sure about this...

339
00:26:31,865 --> 00:26:34,662
...why did I give you my urine?
You didn't even ask for it.

340
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,320
But you said you don't remember anything...

341
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,280
...about that night.

342
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:43,412
How are you sure?
with your actions?

343
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,760
The board...

344
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:55,912
...I have to be honest with you.

345
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,093
I don't know
do you know something...

346
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,467
...from that night.

347
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,294
If you're honest with me...

348
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:08,435
...I can help you
with his drug test.

349
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:13,670
It means...

350
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:17,080
...when I say
I don't remember anything...

351
00:27:18,092 --> 00:27:19,420
...you don't believe me, do you?

352
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:23,979
Okay.

353
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:27,084
If you think I'm a murderer...

354
00:27:27,404 --> 00:27:28,960
...then arrest me.

355
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,040
Come on, please.

356
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,295
Where have you been?

357
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,852
Why didn't you come home last night?

358
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,888
And you just got home?

359
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:02,474
Mom called you
and you didn't answer it.

360
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,840
- Mother.
- Hey!

361
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,520
Did your mother raise you?
become like this?

362
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,886
Do you want to be like your friend?

363
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,881
You could end up dead like him.

364
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,240
You think you can survive in business
entertainment if you act like this?

365
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,598
Or…

366
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,303
...you want to play a role
such adult films?

367
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:25,440
I stayed at Toy's apartment.

368
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,037
He threw a party and
he wants me to come there.

369
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:33,326
Mom is still drunk now?
Did you hear what I said at all?

370
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,482
Why don't you
answer your phone?

371
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,902
Mother was relieved to hear
you with Toy.

372
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,040
You have eaten?

373
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,680
Nim prepares breakfast
since early morning.

374
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,175
If you are hungry...

375
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,337
...you can ask for it
to heat it up.

376
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,696
Mother's Mood
changed very quickly.

377
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:58,136
What does it mean?

378
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:00,175
Earlier, my mother shouted at me,
calling me a bitch...

379
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,240
...and don't want to
hear my explanation.

380
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,815
When Mom found out I was with Toy...

381
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,535
...I was with him all night...

382
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,545
...and you don't mind?

383
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,280
Mother trusts Toy.

384
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,600
At least, he can take care of you.

385
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,520
Because mother is desperate
want him to be my mother's son-in-law.

386
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,360
- Because he's rich, right?
- Correct.

387
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,880
Mom doesn't want you to make
mistakes like Mom.

388
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:30,680
Gale…

389
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,680
...you have to marry Toy.

390
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,600
Even if you can't
surviving in the entertainment business...

391
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,600
...at least you can
married to Toy.

392
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,948
You don't have to struggle.

393
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,933
Mother said it as if
she is so perfect.

394
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,334
He also has his flaws.

395
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,339
Well, nothing is perfect.

396
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,375
Everyone has flaws.

397
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,092
You have to put up with it
minor flaws, come on!

398
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,553
Mom can't wait if you
meet someone like your father.

399
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,646
He is poor.

400
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,442
He's a loser.

401
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,037
He can't even
take care of his own family.

402
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,618
Keep it in mind...

403
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,096
...how lucky you are...

404
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,006
...Toy decides
to date you.

405
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,040
Hey! Mom isn't finished talking yet.

406
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,375
Why are you in such a hurry to get out of here?

407
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:29,489
Huh?

408
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,889
Are you mad at me or what?

409
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:53,006
When I picked you up at the nightclub...

410
00:30:55,045 --> 00:30:56,498
...I saw you dancing with him.

411
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,678
You are not related to him
behind me, right?

412
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,288
NEW NUMBER

413
00:31:20,303 --> 00:31:21,320
Hello?

414
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,255
Gale, it's me Mod.

415
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,295
From the TV show.

416
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
Hey. Are you...

417
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:31,600
...have time to give
interview for my show?

418
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,240
Sorry. I'm busy.

419
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,841
If you can't come...

420
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,215
...Can you
tell me a little?

421
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,535
So I have a source
to be shared at the event.

422
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,360
You are involved in the news
which is currently viral.

423
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,695
Everyone wants to know...

424
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,436
...what is the truth
happened to Queen.

425
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,600
I told the police
I don't know anything.

426
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:54,710
I'm not with him
all night.

427
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:56,535
My boyfriend picked me up.

428
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,137
I heard some gossip...

429
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:01,135
...which may involve drug use.

430
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,575
And your friend, Papang...

431
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,760
...tested positive
using drugs.

432
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:08,025
Is it true?

433
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,403
I told you I don't know
anything about this.

434
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,920
What people do
that night was none of my business...

435
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,240
...You understand?

436
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:27,857
CHIVAX TXV (CHIVAS)
SEND A FRIEND REQUEST

437
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,720
What is it?

438
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,497
I know you're trying
contact me.

439
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,790
I want to talk to you...

440
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,725
...about that night.

441
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Oh yes?

442
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
Let's make it like this.

443
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,592
I am hungry.
What's your favorite food?

444
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,108
I don't want to
go eat with you.

445
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,840
Then why do you want to?
meet me?

446
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,255
I just said...

447
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,215
...i want to talk to you
about that night.

448
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,045
Excuse me...

449
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:28,240
...I'm not your secret lover,
to meet in a secret place.

450
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,040
Let's make it like this.

451
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,388
We get into the car.

452
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,129
If you don't want to
choosing a restaurant...

453
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:35,513
...then I'll just choose.

454
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,105
Do I need
open the door for you?

455
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,288
Please.

456
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,015
There are only the two of us.

457
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,920
You can ask anything.

458
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Please.

459
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,361
Who are you?

460
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,545
I didn't expect to hear
this question first.

461
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,885
I told you that night.

462
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,272
If I am Queen's acquaintance.

463
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,980
You mean...

464
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,160
...you and Queen…

465
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:23,498
Why?

466
00:34:23,709 --> 00:34:26,095
You feel bad
already in love last night with...

467
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,482
...your friend's acquaintance?

468
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,426
Honestly, it's not nice to hear.

469
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,037
I didn't think we would
losing control like that.

470
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,881
It finally happened.

471
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,605
I don't know what you want from me.

472
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:45,175
But you have to stop.

473
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,040
I don't want any trouble
with my boyfriend.

474
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,727
What?

475
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,967
I thought you already
having problems with your boyfriend.

476
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,163
What do you mean?

477
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
Wait.

478
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,014
You don't remember anything
what happened that night?

479
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,265
Nothing happened that night.

480
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:04,440
My boyfriend picked me up at a nightclub.

481
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Correct.

482
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,840
He picked you up.

483
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,654
But you didn't come home with him.

484
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,855
Toys!

485
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,695
Come here!

486
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,520
Let me go!

487
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,352
- Let me go!
- Here!

488
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,811
You said you wanted to have fun
with your friends...

489
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:26,520
...but you want
making out with another man.

490
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Why?

491
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,467
You are not satisfied just
have me as your girlfriend?

492
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:31,803
That's why you're flirtatious!

493
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,264
You can't
said that to me.

494
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Toys!

495
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,931
I very much…

496
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Here!

497
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,460
Are you thinking about cheating?

498
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,390
And you slapped me?

499
00:35:55,115 --> 00:35:56,040
Let go.

500
00:35:57,475 --> 00:35:58,928
I told you to let him go.

501
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,701
None of your business.
I'm talking to my girlfriend.

502
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:13,033
If no one ever said
to you so as not to hurt women...

503
00:36:13,058 --> 00:36:14,490
...I will teach you.

504
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,400
Do you want to file a lawsuit?

505
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,205
About your boyfriend who
hurt you physically?

506
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
No.

507
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,654
Where do you live?

508
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,982
I can take you home.

509
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,756
I don't want to go home.

510
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,720
You can invite me
anywhere as long as you don't go home.

511
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,279
Then I
invite you to my place.

512
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,960
You spend
there's a lot of liquor at my place.

513
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,037
I also drink with you.

514
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,707
When you start getting drunk...

515
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:29,775
...you talk about
your life story to me.

516
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:31,800
Then the two of us…

517
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,264
You tell me things
this is strange to the police?

518
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Which one?

519
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,136
About your boyfriend
who hurt you or...

520
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,600
...we sleep together.

521
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,640
Excuse me.

522
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,390
I don't tell
this to the police.

523
00:37:45,537 --> 00:37:47,592
I was raised to be
a real man.

524
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:51,764
There's no point if I tell you.
everyone about our deeds.

525
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,560
You better tell me
them about this.

526
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,998
Take it as an opportunity
that I give you.

527
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,837
What opportunity?

528
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,913
Chance...

529
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,440
...so that you do the right thing.

530
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:08,796
You should tell the police
if you lie.

531
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,623
I have to go. There is nothing
which one more thing needs to be discussed.

532
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:17,991
Your words are not true at all.

533
00:38:18,092 --> 00:38:20,815
Even if you tell this story
to the police or anyone else...

534
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,295
...i will never
admit it happened.

535
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,309
And my boyfriend will protect me.

536
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,720
You don't worry
can i record us that night?

537
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,960
Too bad...

538
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:46,653
...I'm not that bad of a person.

539
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,911
What I have is...

540
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,360
...CCTV footage of my apartment.

541
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,421
You left my apartment
before they found Queen's body.

542
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,755
What do you think?

543
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,793
Should I send
this video to the police?

544
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,360
Don't.

545
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,215
If you are in doubt
I killed Queen...

546
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,622
...I didn't do it.

547
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,317
Why did you lie to the police?

548
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:32,082
Because I don't remember
what happened that night.

549
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Queen…

550
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:37,020
...is the most important person
in my life.

551
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,340
I need to know what's going on
to him and I don't care...

552
00:39:42,793 --> 00:39:44,639
...if I have to
hurt anyone.

553
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,351
Even you.

554
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
What?

555
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,795
Can I go home now?

556
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,857
No need to go to jail or bail?

557
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,797
I spoke to my boss...

558
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,840
...because I don't want to
destroy your future.

559
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:36,592
He agreed with me.

560
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,360
You never
have a bad track record.

561
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:42,690
I still need
tell you that...

562
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,480
...the result is correct.

563
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,986
I didn't set you up.

564
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,889
And I never
consider you as a murderer.

565
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,177
I just wanted to know...

566
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,642
...What really happened
at that nightclub.

567
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:06,840
Hey, honey.

568
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,240
There is a problem?

569
00:41:08,478 --> 00:41:09,345
You can talk to me.

570
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,446
It's none of your business, and you
should stop asking me.

571
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,400
If you don't want to
dance with me, go away.

572
00:41:14,577 --> 00:41:16,615
Tonight I'm here to
to have fun, not to talk.

573
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,283
Okay?

574
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,518
If you want to have fun...

575
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,064
...I'm ready to enjoy the night
with you, all night long.

576
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:25,680
So aggressive!

577
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,760
Another.

578
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,474
Honey, are you awake?
I need to talk to you.

579
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:51,260
