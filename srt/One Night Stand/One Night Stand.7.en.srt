1
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,157
Since I know
Queen gets involved with Pepper...

2
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,204
...I am in frequent contact
with my police friend.

3
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,709
And it looks like they
have allies among the police.

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,535
When the police plan
catch them...

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,285
...they always managed to get away with it.

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,807
Do you think it's a coincidence?

7
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,215
I don't know if your boyfriend gives
great help in this regard.

8
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,974
And Minnie...

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,070
...knowing that Pepper really
a drug dealer.

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,135
It's hard for me to make it
trust me enough...

11
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,974
...to invite me to his place.

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,144
When I went to his place,
then it's done.

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,153
I know he's hiding...

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,176
...drugs on every corner.

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,131
I have photos and evidence,
everything.

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,270
Minnie asked Pepper
about what really happened...

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,680
...that night.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,000
Peanut says
the truth, right?

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,875
There is no reason for him
to lie.

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
But…

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
I don't believe it
Queen will do something like that.

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,560
Not care
how bad we fight...

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,037
...we are still friends.

24
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:21,880
I…

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,335
Wake up and accept the reality!

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,644
Queen never thought of you
as a friend.

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,014
In fact, he never
consider anyone as his friend.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,158
You have to stop.

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,219
I think we should stop.
do this.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,735
I can't
fooling yourself.

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,925
I never
like you like that.

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,611
Never?

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,108
With me?

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,282
Who am I?

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,579
I am Queen.

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,177
You think you can refuse me
just like this?

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,680
I like someone else.

38
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Who?

39
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,785
Can you tell me?

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,674
Is he as I thought?

41
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,017
She's a lowly woman!

42
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,409
How come Papang?
better than me?

43
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,800
You don't know
how cheap he is.

44
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,260
Most of the men on campus
sleep with him.

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Queen?

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,308
Why do you say that?

47
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,148
Papang is your friend, right?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,944
You have seen
the leaked video?

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,540
Do you want to watch it?
I will send it to you.

50
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,649
I want to ask you something.

51
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,279
Have you ever felt disgusted?
on yourself?

52
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,339
Because you made me
feel disgusted.

53
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,616
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP,
I WILL DEFINITELY KILL YOU.

54
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Hello?

55
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Hey...

56
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
...if I die...

57
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,718
...meaning someone killed me.

58
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
What?

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,785
Are you drunk? Where are you?

60
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,617
Queen

61
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Queen?

62
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
What is it?

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
There isn't any.

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
I just need
you become a witness.

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Because this concerns me...

66
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,194
...and this bitch.

67
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:42,055
ONE NIGHT STAND CLUB
APRIL FOOLS DAY PARTY

68
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:49,960
You have to clean up Papang
tonight.

69
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Give it to me.

70
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,386
Give!

71
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Fast.

72
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,400
You're so slow!

73
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,517
Excuse me, I have to search you.

74
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,800
Sorry, the number you are calling is not available.
cannot be contacted at this time.

75
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,445
WARNING: DRUG USE
SERIOUS IMPACT ON NERVES AND BRAIN

76
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,058
Come on, satisfy him.

77
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:01,721
Don't forget to record everything.

78
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Wait.

79
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,532
It's still not too late,
where are you rushing to?

80
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,880
- Can I have some more?
- Don't waste my time.

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,349
Do not forget...

82
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,040
...if you don't do it
as I said...

83
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,869
...then there will be consequences.

84
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,629
But I guess...

85
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,896
...you have to stay here
to party.

86
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,695
Isn't Athens
just rejected you?

87
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,084
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?
from here?

88
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,491
What's this?

89
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,746
Where's Gale?

90
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,560
Come on in.

91
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Gale?

92
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,087
Gale?

93
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,258
Where is he?

94
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,520
Lower your voice.

95
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,316
Did you bring the stuff?

96
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,253
Tell me where my boyfriend is!
Right now!

97
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,083
I asked
did you bring that stuff?

98
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,520
Let me think about it.

99
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
I left Gale at…

100
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,080
Where? In…

101
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,600
&quot;One Night Stand&quot; Club.

102
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,740
But I'm not sure
if he's still there.

103
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,424
Hurry, the club is about to close.

104
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,807
I don't know how my life is
to be like this.

105
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,295
I feel worthless...

106
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,250
...and useless
for everyone.

107
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,407
If you think...

108
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,796
...dating him and your life
become contradictory...

109
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,641
...then you have to step back.

110
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,910
You say it as if
all this is very easy.

111
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,313
Of course.

112
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,144
Because I am
strangers in your life.

113
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,575
Easier to judge
other people's lives...

114
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,284
...rather than judging
our own lives.

115
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,916
The problem is...

116
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,193
...when I feel
useless...

117
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,142
...he is…

118
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,868
...the only thing
precious in my life.

119
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,595
And I will
lost everything...

120
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,770
...if I lose him.

121
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,722
This is not true.

122
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,200
He was just trying
manipulate you.

123
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,410
He wants to make you believe
that you don't live without him.

124
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,145
No matter how bad
he hurt you physically...

125
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,000
...or you may finally realize
that away from him...

126
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,519
...will improve your life...

127
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,927
...eventually
you can't do it.

128
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,647
You are so cruel.

129
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,616
As you said...

130
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,020
...we are strangers.

131
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,755
How can I hope
will you trust me?

132
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,588
Who said that?

133
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,717
I understand you very well...

134
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,228
...That is why
I told you so.

135
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,510
Actually,
my life is no better than yours.

136
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,901
There was a woman...

137
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,293
...that I can't get rid of
from my life...

138
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,920
...no matter how much he
hurt my feelings.

139
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,436
Nonetheless,
I can't forget it.

140
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,939
And I don't know
if i could.

141
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Like...

142
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,077
...a drug addict.

143
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,468
You are right.

144
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,670
What is Queen?

145
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,842
The woman you were talking about?

146
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,921
She's Queen, right?

147
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,423
I see you
trying to contact him...

148
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,723
...since I've been with you
at the nightclub...

149
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,360
...until now.

150
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,077
If true...

151
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,939
...I can assure you...

152
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,107
...Queen doesn't deserve you...

153
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,857
...to cry over.

154
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,080
Well…

155
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,503
He just hurt my feelings.

156
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,753
But your boyfriend…

157
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,707
...hurt you physically.

158
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,458
Tonight...

159
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,410
...are we going to sleep together?

160
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,880
I don't think so.

161
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,836
not be forced
if you don't want to.

162
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,455
What if I want to?

163
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,816
I want to hurt him too.

164
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Excuse me.

165
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Hello?

166
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,632
Are you going to bed yet?

167
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,191
Not yet.

168
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,033
Can you come pick me up?

169
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,660
Take me home.

170
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,875
Today can't.

171
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,174
I'm with someone.

172
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,895
Not true.
You? With someone?

173
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Hello?

174
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Hey.

175
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,080
Are you sure?

176
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,163
It was just a one night stand.

177
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,880
Here, record it.

178
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,640
- What?
- Record it for me!

179
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,680
Hey, don't show our faces.

180
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,086
Of course, I will blur
all of you.

181
00:18:12,520 --> 00:19:17,097
WARNING: INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR,
PARENTS MUST PROVIDE ADVICE

182
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,338
Stop, stop!

183
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:24,095
Give it to me.

184
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,915
Why?

185
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,318
- Stop!
- I only…

186
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,970
Queen, your friend is cheating on me.

187
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,106
- You deserve it.
- What did you say?

188
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,980
Huh?!
You've done a lot of harm to him.

189
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,840
Sorry, I…

190
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,464
I can't do it.

191
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,554
You can sleep here.

192
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,292
No need to rush home.

193
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,243
Forgive me.

194
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:05,458
QUEEN

195
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Queen?

196
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,959
Hello?

197
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Gale?

198
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,164
Forgive me.

199
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,709
I shouldn't have said that
so to you.

200
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,022
Please don't be mad at me.

201
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,320
Okay. Don't worry.

202
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,784
It doesn't matter.

203
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,250
Can you come see me?

204
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
What?

205
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,107
I can't stand it anymore.

206
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,391
Queen?

207
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,280
What's wrong with you?

208
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,985
I'm worried about you.

209
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,923
I just want to disappear.

210
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,936
Queen, calm yourself.

211
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,910
Where are you?

212
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,145
Share your location
and I will go there.

213
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,891
Share your location, okay?

214
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:45,326
SHARED LOCATION

215
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,724
Gale is on his way to meet me.
You can come meet me here.

216
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:03,880
If you play with me again,
I will definitely kill you.

217
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,944
Can I have him?

218
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,417
I can't
fooling myself.

219
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,604
I don't like you
like that.

220
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,600
Someone like me won't
betray a friend.

221
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,475
You disgust me.

222
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,977
Me or you
too cheap?

223
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,207
I'm with someone else.

224
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,400
Gale, you don't need to come.

225
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Okay.

226
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,383
I'll take care of it.

227
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,440
- I'M IN ROOM 703.
- Tomorrow.

228
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,930
I'll take care of it tomorrow morning.

229
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Queen!

230
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
- Gale!
- Toy!

231
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
Toys!

232
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,369
Queen!
He fell from the building. He…

233
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,591
Gale?

234
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Gale?

235
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Gale?

236
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,829
Gale?

237
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,810
Everything is fine?

238
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,191
My boyfriend is drunk.

239
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:39,556
What's this?

240
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:43,157
Do you know who I am?

241
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Good.

242
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,591
What are you doing?

243
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,896
What the hell?

244
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,891
What happened?

245
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,031
What's wrong with you?

246
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,771
Where is Queen?

247
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Queen?

248
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
Where is he?

249
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
What is it?

250
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,132
I saw him on the balcony earlier.

251
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,720
Huh? When did he leave?

252
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,434
There was no one on the balcony.

253
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,224
He's not leaving.

254
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,742
He fell from the balcony
and now he's dead.

255
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,161
You guys don't realize?

256
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,520
What the hell!

257
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,429
Dead? You're kidding, aren't you?

258
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
You think this is funny?

259
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Yes.

260
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,727
Hey! That's enough!

261
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,332
What are you doing?

262
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,600
I'll call the police!

263
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,240
Are you stupid?

264
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,255
There was nothing on the balcony.

265
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,674
What do you expect to see?

266
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,097
The corpse.

267
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,400
I'll take care of this.

268
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,817
- Take care of what?
- Do you want to take care of it?

269
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,640
Why us
not calling the police?

270
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,192
You idiot! We're going to be in
big trouble if you call the police!

271
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,280
Damn! What a bad night!

272
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,992
I should have
who said so.

273
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,599
You all dragged me down
into this mess.

274
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,150
I warn you
you all are here.

275
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,560
If you are stupid enough
can be found out...

276
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,061
...and said that
buy drugs from me...

277
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,235
...i will kill
you all in jail.

278
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,595
How can you guys
didn't know he fell?

279
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,640
You are sure there is none
who pushed it?

280
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,739
Of course!
What's the point of doing that?

281
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,940
Besides all of you...

282
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,356
...is anyone coming here?

283
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,800
I asked whether there is or not?!

284
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,300
Nothing, just us.

285
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,327
You have to listen to me
fine.

286
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,175
I will take care of everything.

287
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,125
If one of you
got me into trouble...

288
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,174
...your story is over.

289
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,875
Okay,
what do you want me to do?

290
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,626
When does Papang fall asleep?

291
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,906
I think since he was at the nightclub.

292
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,533
He doesn't even know she's here.

293
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
That's good.

294
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,281
So no one ever
set foot here.

295
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,327
What about CCTV cameras?

296
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:51,335
I told you so
I will take care of everything.

297
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,252
You three...

298
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,331
...must bring
Papang get out of here.

299
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,611
You have to do whatever
so that he doesn't remember your actions.

300
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,130
If you don't want to
There is a problem...

301
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,211
...then you have to
delete everything.

302
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,394
And have to keep your mouth shut.

303
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,815
Okay sir.

304
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Wait.

305
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,435
If we take him home...

306
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,516
...the security guard will see us.

307
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,140
I don't know
if there is a camera.

308
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,471
Then, how?

309
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,478
Just drive,
I'll take care of it.

310
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,800
Hey!

311
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,542
Are you drunk?
Are you in a hurry to go to hell?

312
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
Queen?

313
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Queen?

314
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
- Queen?
- Gale.

315
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
- Queen?
- Everything is fine.

316
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,201
- Everything will be fine.
- Queen!

317
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,616
- Everything will be fine.
- Queen!

318
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,780
It doesn't matter.

319
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Look?

320
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,444
It doesn't matter.

321
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,965
Are you okay?

322
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,346
Are you okay?

323
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,473
My two friends were thinking that night
change their lives...

324
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,142
...including me.

325
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,069
Actually no.

326
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,916
It's not night
that changes lives.

327
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,648
But the night that made me realize...

328
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,492
...the way we spend
our life in the past...

329
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,557
...and how deep it is
could drag us down.

330
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,619
Between the three of us...

331
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,213
...I am the winner.

332
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,964
Don't worry about me.

333
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,314
I know the hotel owner.

334
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,722
He deleted his camera files.

335
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,237
Surely nothing can
refers to us.

336
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,424
I've taken care of everything.

337
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,440
Why did you
move his body?

338
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,016
What do you want me to do?

339
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,987
You expect me to stay silent?

340
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,963
If I don't
do anything...

341
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,444
...that's the end of our history together.

342
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,413
You can destroy
evidence.

343
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,640
And make sure
there is no one around.

344
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,938
But you shouldn't
move his body.

345
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,836
If you don't
move his body...

346
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,255
...then the case will be closed
as suicide...

347
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,286
...or he's really drunk
and fell from the building himself.

348
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,480
Things get complicated...

349
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,351
...Because of you
move his body.

350
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,086
You made a mistake,
big mistake.

351
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,509
Shut up!

352
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,147
I do my best.

353
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,824
Why didn't anyone think of that?
Queen's car that night?

354
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:03,975
The car is parked there.

355
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,740
Eventually
the police will track him down.

356
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,571
Who can
thinking clearly at that time?

357
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,416
This is because of Toy.

358
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,931
He will drag
we all go to hell.

359
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,227
He is stupid
and want to take action.

360
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,788
PAPAN

361
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,560
I go first.

362
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,299
I'll walk you out.

363
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:44,493
I don't know...

364
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,071
...are you going to
trust my words.

365
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,714
But it's true.

366
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,418
So I don't
cheating on my girlfriend.

367
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Correct.

368
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,669
You're not cheating on her.

369
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,860
I have to apologize to you...

370
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,366
...because it makes you believe
like that.

371
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,530
I can't believe you won't remember
what happened that night.

372
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,598
So I bluffed you...

373
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,424
...hoping you're lying to me
to protect your girlfriend.

374
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,437
Forgive me.

375
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,029
I didn't do it
any errors.

376
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,972
I didn't do anything wrong,
none.

377
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,532
What should we do?

378
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,941
The board is certain
will report to the police.

379
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,642
Damn, my life is going to be ruined.

380
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,454
Why are you laughing?

381
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,312
Your life and my life...

382
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,606
...has been completely destroyed
since that night.

383
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,120
Why are you stressed?

384
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,786
Let's have some fun.

385
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,120
Excuse me.

386
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:25,753
The number you are calling
cannot be contacted at this time.

387
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,160
Please leave a voice message
after this.

388
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Gale...

389
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,953
...this is my fault.

390
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,686
I do not mean...

391
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,859
...make everything
get worse.

392
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,760
Where are you?

393
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,668
Please give me a chance.

394
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,292
I love you.

395
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,600
Excuse me.

396
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,080
The number you are calling
cannot be contacted at this time.

397
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,760
Please leave a voice message
after this.

398
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Gale...

399
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,240
...I told you...

400
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,175
...if at this time...

401
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,346
...we must hold on tight.

402
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Where are you?

403
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,607
Please contact me.

404
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,702
How long will you keep me
frustrated like this?

405
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,875
GALE

406
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,680
Gale.

407
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:58,353
- Hello.
- I know everything.

408
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,680
What?

409
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,251
About what?

410
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,520
All your evil deeds.

411
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,147
Gale, where are you?

412
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,928
We need to talk…

413
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Unlucky!

414
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Huh?

415
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,102
You took me to my room?

416
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,384
I'm glad you're still conscious.

417
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,887
If I'm bad, you must be
already in trouble.

418
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:56,801
Hey.

419
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,449
What do you think?

420
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,198
Can you tell me?

421
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,696
What's next
I have to do it.

422
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,651
Do you have a plan?

423
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,500
Who knows.

424
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,307
All I know is they will
pay for his actions.

425
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,668
Don't worry.

426
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,062
I will help you
in this case.

427
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,793
You should sleep tonight.

428
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,981
We will fight together.

429
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,840
Okay?

430
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,904
I don't agree to date you...

431
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,434
...because of Queen.

432
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,544
Queen likes you.

433
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,954
And I always believed that...

434
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,479
...Queen is my friend.

435
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
It means...

436
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,718
...you like me too, right?

437
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,980
I'm so stupid.
