1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,439
This drama is based on a true story.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:10,080
The plot was adjusted for entertainment purposes only.

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,679
We have no intention to offend any careers,

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,480
encourage immoral sexual values,

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,519
or create a pessimistic disposition of a gender or a group of people.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,800
We would like to apologize in advance for any misunderstandings.

7
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,530
(Presents)

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,399
Today, I'm going to teach you how to be forensic scientists.

9
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,679
Don't be scared.

10
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,119
Kwan.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,560
This is Deputy Director Kornkit.

12
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,799
I'm thinking of inviting Time to dinner. Would you like to join us?

13
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,120
Weren't you bored waiting for hours?

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,599
I've waited for you for years.

15
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,599
A few more hours wouldn't hurt.

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,049
We've been talking for three days.

17
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,409
Why don't we meet up tonight?

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,049
I need to see how big they are in person.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,079
How long do you plan to live like this?

20
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,640
I've been asking myself

21
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,480
how long I plan to live like this as well.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,879
Is it time for me to finally stop, Aoy and Chod?

23
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,079
What's up?

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,760
What happened to your car?

25
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,599
It's not your problem.

26
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,719
Hey.

27
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,959
You're changing the atmosphere.

28
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,040
You haven't changed one bit.

29
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,840
You put yourself at risk of STDs

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,319
by sleeping around.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,280
How is it any of your business?

32
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,840
I wouldn't get involved

33
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,090
if you weren't doing it in front of our school.

34
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,680
Think about our mother.

35
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,599
Don't ruin her image.

36
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,039
All right, Mr. Kit,

37
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,879
aka Mr. Polite Boy.

38
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,479
I will be more careful next time.

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,090
But right now, it's time for you to go home, take a shower,

40
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,919
and drink your bedtime milk

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,199
so I can finish my business

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,639
and go home too.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,680
Praew, you can come up now.

44
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,879
He's gone.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Who was that?

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,479
I don't know. Some crazy person, I guess.

47
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,759
Don't mind him.

48
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,400
Did he see me?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't think so.

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,719
But so what

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
if he did?

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,719
You don't need to care.

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,479
I should go before someone else spots us.

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,360
Praew.

55
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,400
I still want to talk to you.

56
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,400
Can't you stay a little longer?

57
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,639
No, I think I should go.

58
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,360
We'll talk next time.

59
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,159
Wait, can I have your contact info?

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
It will give us a chance to talk

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,730
and get to know each other better.

62
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,360
I'll see you next time then.

63
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,730
That is, if there's a next time, Mac.

64
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,610
Take this!

65
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,839
Hey!

66
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,879
Mr. Kit, are you okay?

67
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,610
What are you doing here at this hour?

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you.

69
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,399
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,360
I came to pick up something.

71
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,560
What are you doing here alone?

72
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,759
Mr. Kit.

73
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,800
You are bleeding.

74
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,680
Do you want to go to the hospital? You might need stitches.

75
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,800
Ouch. That stings.

76
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,399
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,920
I'll be fine.

78
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,959
Just please clean the wound for me.

79
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,439
Don't touch it.

80
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,319
It's not my fault if it gets infected.

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,319
Do I need to cut off my head if the wound gets infected?

82
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,839
Yes, they'll chop off your head.

83
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,800
We need to clean it well to prevent that from happening.

84
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,839
Ouch. That hurts.

85
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,680
You're doing it on purpose.

86
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,519
Hang in there.

87
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,759
All done.

88
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,600
Thank you.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,120
By the way, what were you doing here at this hour?

90
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm on night duty today.

91
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,959
Do female teachers go on night duty?

92
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,480
Yes, it's the rules.

93
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
Usually, two female teachers get paired up together.

94
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,360
But the other female teacher is sick today,

95
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,839
so I'm on my own.

96
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,040
Even if there were two of you,

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
I still think it's dangerous for female teachers

98
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
to be on night duty.

99
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,399
I'll discuss this matter in the board meeting.

100
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,920
We need to change the rules.

101
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,800
The school's safety is important,

102
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
but our teachers' safety is the priority.

103
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,639
I'd be very grateful.

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,160
I filed a complaint to the board before,

105
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,600
but it backfired.

106
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,279
They called me rebellious.

107
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,480
They said if others could do it, so could I.

108
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,480
That's strange. It is an unreasonable rule.

109
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,639
They should have heard you out.

110
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,360
It's the director.

111
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,519
She never once listens to what I say.

112
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
I didn't mean to offend your mother.

114
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,279
It's okay. I understand.

115
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,450
You were abroad for a long time.

116
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,039
You probably haven't dealt with the old-fashioned elders

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
who believe they're always in the right

118
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,639
just because they're older.

119
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,480
Whenever they see a young person do something differently,

120
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,840
they immediately judge that person

121
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,360
as stubborn and rebellious.

122
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,000
And we can't explain ourselves

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,399
because they see it as us talking back to them.

124
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,519
For instance, some rules clearly violate our personal rights,

125
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,960
but we can't say anything because the elders agree to it.

126
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,919
Wow.

127
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,679
You have a lot to say.

128
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,480
Don't hesitate to let me know if you need the board

129
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,000
to do certain things differently.

130
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,559
And let's talk with logic.

131
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,399
You want me to come to you?

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,330
I'll send you an email instead

133
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,639
to avoid any problems with Director.

134
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,720
You must have been feeling uncomfortable

135
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,090
during your time here.

136
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,639
Darn it, Kwan. You could have told me you were on duty alone tonight.

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,279
I would have come sooner.

138
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Who is it?

139
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,000
Do you need to answer that?

140
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,159
If you do, I will give you some privacy.

141
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,799
That's all right. It's just Time.

142
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,200
Aren't you going to answer him?

143
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,720
No, I don't want to talk to him right now.

144
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,120
Why not?

145
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,080
I thought you guys were dating.

146
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,480
No, we are not. We are just friends.

147
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,720
Since you brought it up,

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,519
please tell your friend to stop trying

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,679
for me.

150
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,960
I've run out of ways to tell him that I will never feel the same way.

151
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,799
He just doesn't get it.

152
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,120
Why don't you give him a chance?

153
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't have anything against him.

154
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,799
I'm just not looking for a serious boyfriend.

155
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
I don't believe in love.

156
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,120
I hate commitment.

157
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,559
That's new.

158
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,080
Did you have a bad relationship in the past?

159
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,080
Is that why you feel this way?

160
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,759
I guess so.

161
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
I enjoy being single.

162
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,480
I can go wherever and do whatever I want

163
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,159
without having anyone nag me.

164
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,360
It seems to me like you hate being controlled

165
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,039
both at work and in a relationship.

166
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,799
I guess you are right.

167
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,799
I never realized that before.

168
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
Can I ask you something?

169
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,519
Take your time to really think about it.

170
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,000
Do you not believe in love? Or...

171
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,799
have you simply not found the one yet?

172
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,120
Who knows,

173
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,639
you might change your mind

174
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,360
when you meet the right man.

175
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,759
I'm not surprised that you are Time's friend.

176
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,960
He said the exact same thing.

177
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,799
Really?

178
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,200
So...

179
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,720
what's your answer

180
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,440
to my question?

181
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,279
Do you not believe in love? Or...

182
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,399
have you simply not found the one yet?

183
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,799
At first, I thought I didn't believe in love.

184
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,879
But now I think

185
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,279
something's about to change.

186
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,279
Ouch.

187
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,120
Darn it, Time.

188
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,480
(Director)

189
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,279
(Director)

190
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,080
You are a mature adult. I'm sure you are aware

191
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,600
that every place has its rules.

192
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
You can't do whatever you want,

193
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,320
requesting changes to the rules

194
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,320
to suit your personal preferences.

195
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Director.

196
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,120
What are you talking about?

197
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,399
Your night duty.

198
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,159
Didn't we already talk about this?

199
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,080
Did you think complaining to the new deputy director

200
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,600
would change anything?

201
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,879
- Director, I didn't-- - It's all right.

202
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,799
We'll address this matter again in the board meeting.

203
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,159
However, I cannot guarantee the outcome.

204
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,519
I'm going to give you

205
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,279
a warning.

206
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,039
I know you don't enjoy being on night duty.

207
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,399
However,

208
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,759
it doesn't mean you can invite anyone to accompany you.

209
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,039
You know it's inappropriate for a man and a woman

210
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,759
to be alone at night.

211
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,679
Could it be that women these days are so liberal

212
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,799
that they don't care about these customs anymore?

213
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,559
But you are a teacher.

214
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,840
Being a teacher is a noble and dignified profession.

215
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,480
Sorry to interrupt, Director.

216
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,720
What are you talking about?

217
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,890
Who did this? Who sent you these photos?

218
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,559
You don't need to know.

219
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,410
Just know that they are well-intentioned.

220
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,559
I adore you as if you were my own family.

221
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,279
That's why I'm advising you to reserve yourself.

222
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,279
Director, Mr. Kit and I were just talking.

223
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,279
There was nothing more than that.

224
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,240
The photos speak for themselves.

225
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,759
No one would believe your excuse.

226
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,079
But luckily,

227
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,920
the person who sent these photos said no one else knew about it.

228
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,359
So do me a favor and don't go around

229
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,480
telling everyone about that night.

230
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,359
Also,

231
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,079
Kornkit already has a suitable lady waiting to marry him.

232
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,440
I just thought you should know

233
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,720
in case you haven't heard.

234
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,359
Director.

235
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,960
Our conversation is over.

236
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,079
You should get back to class. Your students are waiting for you.

237
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,920
By the way, the main objective

238
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,240
of your 12th graders is to excel in the entrance exams for universities.

239
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,119
So please don't jeopardize their chances for a good education

240
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,200
with silly games.

241
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
You may leave.

242
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,410
(Director)

243
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,680
Ms. Kwan.

244
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,319
I heard you've been summoned.

245
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,680
What happened?

246
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,519
Go inside and ask Director yourself.

247
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,000
(Director)

248
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,200
Mr. Kit.

249
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,599
Do me a favor and leave me alone.

250
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,559
I'm sick of being criticized when I haven't done anything wrong.

251
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,279
Ms. Kwan, wait.

252
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,799
Time.

253
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,759
Did you not hear me?

254
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,039
Why did you elbow me?

255
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,279
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

256
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,079
What's wrong?

257
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,410
Why the long face?

258
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,039
Did you fight with someone?

259
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,890
A friend.

260
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,839
A friend?

261
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,519
I didn't know you had other friends besides me and Ms. Kwan.

262
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,759
It's none of your concern.

263
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,410
But that scumbag is a horrible friend.

264
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,519
I'm thinking about

265
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,319
unfriending him.

266
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,039
He's a traitor, trying to steal the woman I like.

267
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,279
I see.

268
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,890
I was wondering

269
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,920
who sent photos of me and Ms. Kwan to Director.

270
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,720
It was you.

271
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,240
What photos? I don't know what you are talking about.

272
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,519
Since when did you become a backstabber, Time?

273
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,680
Hold on, Kit. Say that again.

274
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,559
Who's the backstabber here?

275
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:19,559
You're basically describing yourself so I suggest you keep quiet.

276
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,559
What are you staring at?

277
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,240
What's your problem?

278
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,000
Do you want a piece of me?

279
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,119
- So? - I wasn't staring at you.

280
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,039
I was waiting for your questions.

281
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,410
Ask me whatever you want to know.

282
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,279
I'll tell you the truth.

283
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,759
You will realize that it's all in your head.

284
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,599
It's all in my head?

285
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,079
It's all in my head?

286
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,200
Answer me then.

287
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,880
Why were you alone with Kwan all night?

288
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,279
I ran into Ms. Kwan. She was on duty

289
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,039
when I came to get something,

290
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,599
so we started talking.

291
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,200
Why didn't Kwan pick up my call?

292
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,559
She said it was too late for a call.

293
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,759
It was too late

294
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,039
to talk to me?

295
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,599
But she talked to you all night.

296
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,960
Do you think I'm that stupid to believe your lies?

297
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,759
That's what she said. What do you want me to say?

298
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,960
Say the truth.

299
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,720
- It's the truth. - Liar.

300
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,880
It's your personality.

301
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,359
You never listen to anyone.

302
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,240
No wonder Ms. Kwan...

303
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,319
What?

304
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,279
I dare you to finish that sentence.

305
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,359
Get off me.

306
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,759
Ms. Kwan asked me to tell you to leave her alone.

307
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,839
Kit!

308
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,839
(Kwan)

309
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,559
Scumbag!

310
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,039
You.

311
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
Kwan.

312
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,920
Is everything all right?

313
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
What's the matter with you?

314
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,559
Kit started it.

315
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,279
I'm not talking to him.

316
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,839
I'm talking to you. What's the matter with you?

317
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,319
What are you talking about?

318
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,680
At first, I couldn't figure out who sent those photos to Director.

319
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,720
But then I saw these sticky notes

320
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,079
with this handwriting.

321
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,119
It's my handwriting.

322
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,440
What about it?

323
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,519
Stop playing dumb!

324
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,440
The handwriting on the envelope sent to Director matches with yours.

325
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,279
Kwan, I can explain.

326
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,240
Stop. Leave me alone.

327
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,799
I don't want to hear it.

328
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,680
I came to look at the backstabbing friend

329
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,400
in the eye.

330
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,799
I don't want to be friends anymore, Time.

331
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,720
Kwan, I did what I did because I love you.

332
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,960
Shut up! And don't follow me!

333
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,960
By the way, you once asked me

334
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,079
if I rejected you because I didn't believe in love

335
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,119
or because you weren't the one.

336
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,680
Listen to me carefully.

337
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,319
It's clear to me now that it's the latter.

338
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,240
I've found the person who makes me want to believe in love.

339
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,039
And that person is not you.

340
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,640
(#LookingForAHookupNow)

341
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,720
(Got betrayed by a friend #OneNightStand)

342
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,359
Shoot.

343
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,759
So it really was a one-night stand?

344
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:32,880
Kwan!

345
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:46,880
Mac...

346
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,960
Mac... Mac...

347
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,240
Stop moaning your boyfriend's name! You're turning me off!

348
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,400
You're turned off, huh? Get out then!

349
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,920
You suck!

350
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,960
I suck? Go back to your boyfriend then!

351
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,039
What kind of woman are you? So annoying!

352
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,960
You jerk!

353
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,319
Mac, you said you wanted my contact.

354
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,119
Come and get it yourself.

355
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,680
I'm waiting at you-know-where.

356
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,079
You only have one hour.

357
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,039
I just found out my son's a thug

358
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,000
who enjoys fistfights.

359
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,319
What are you talking about? Nothing happened.

360
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,680
The evidence on your face makes it obvious.

361
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,799
I was just having fun with Time

362
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,359
and underestimated my own strength.

363
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,960
Do you think I'm stupid enough to believe you about everything?

364
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,200
Mom, I'm sorry.

365
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,240
What is it?

366
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,599
An auspicious date for you and Ploy, my friend's daughter's wedding.

367
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,920
I arranged a meeting for you two,

368
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,240
but you ran away to be with Kwan all night.

369
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,839
What wedding, Mom?

370
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,440
I haven't even met her.

371
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,960
And February 18 is

372
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,319
just a few months away.

373
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,839
I do think it's too soon as well.

374
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,039
But you're always giving me headaches

375
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,319
despite having been back for less than a month.

376
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,400
So I thought you should just hurry up and get married

377
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,400
instead of blindly bringing Kwan home

378
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,920
as my daughter-in-law.

379
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,480
Come on, Mom.

380
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,119
Get ready.

381
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,680
I'll arrange a meeting with Ploy as soon as possible.

382
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,279
Hurry up and get to know each other

383
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,640
because we can't call this wedding off.

384
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,519
We have all come to an agreement.

385
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,960
(Kwan)

386
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,880
We're more than a one-night stand now.

387
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,799
Thank you for giving me a chance, Praew.

388
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,519
Don't get ahead of yourself.

389
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,960
I didn't give you a chance.

390
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,799
I just want someone I can talk to when I'm bored.

391
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,079
You said your friend betrayed you. What happened?

392
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,960
They secretly took photos of me and sent them to my boss.

393
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,599
Aw.

394
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,039
What kind of horrible friend would do such a thing to you?

395
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,799
You can tell me. I'll deal with them.

396
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,519
And if it's a guy, I'm going to punch him in the face.

397
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,279
What if it's a woman?

398
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,599
Well, is she beautiful?

399
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,000
If she is, I'm going to flirt with her, then break her heart.

400
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,480
She won't be able to eat or sleep for three months.

401
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,799
You really are a weirdo.

402
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,960
You feel like smiling now, don't you?

403
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,839
Did you feel better?

404
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,960
From now on, if you feel irritated or bored,

405
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,440
feel free to text me.

406
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:20,039
Or I can come see you.

407
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,920
I'll be on standby 24 hours a day so you can feel better.

408
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,400
Thank you.

409
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,360
Time, why did you follow me and since when?

410
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,679
I'm worried about you, Kwan. I'm scared you might be in danger.

411
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,289
And how did you find out where I went?

412
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, I followed you from your house.

413
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,480
And I saw you...

414
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,079
go in there.

415
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,400
You've gone too far.

416
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,480
You're meddling in my private life! It's too much!

417
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,920
Kwan, I'm sorry. I really am.

418
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,960
Kwan.

419
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,599
Time!

420
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,329
Can you just leave me alone?

421
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm begging you! Get out of my life!

422
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,519
- Kwan! - Hey.

423
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,199
- Time! - Kwan!

424
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,880
- Kwan! - Time!

425
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,079
Please don't kick me out of your life!

426
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,440
I'm sorry!

427
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,960
I wouldn't be able to live...

428
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,599
I really wouldn't be able to live without you.

429
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,719
I'm willing

430
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,329
to do anything for you, Kwan.

431
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:43,079
I'm only asking you

432
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,840
not to leave me.

433
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,809
All right. You're that worried about me?

434
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,809
You really want to be in my life?

435
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,809
Then drive me around

436
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,519
while I'm sleeping around. Happy?

437
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,519
I'm sorry.

438
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,239
I'm really sorry.

439
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,199
I have two things to announce to you today.

440
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,809
Mid-term exams are coming up soon.

441
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,840
I'd like all of you to study hard.

442
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,840
Those who have received their exam schedule,

443
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,769
you should wisely organize your time

444
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,809
so that you have enough time to study.

445
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,840
As for the second matter,

446
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,119
our school does not condone

447
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,809
violence or fights.

448
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,559
If any of you witness...

449
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,809
- Is it true? - Yes.

450
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:11,360
- Who? - I don't know.

451
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,119
- The other day? - Are you sure?

452
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,559
That fight...

453
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,809
- Oh. - Hey!

454
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,400
One-week suspension, ma'am?

455
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,159
That's right. Do you have a problem with that?

456
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,159
No, ma'am.

457
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,559
What about you, Time?

458
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,039
I don't either, ma'am.

459
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,559
That's good to hear.

460
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,809
And remember,

461
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,639
there are no exceptions

462
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,769
regarding the rules and regulations at our school.

463
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,239
Rule-breakers must be

464
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,559
equally punished.

465
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,639
The punishment must be harsher when they're faculty members

466
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,159
so the students won't take a leaf out of their books.

467
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,809
Do you understand?

468
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,880
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

469
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,769
And I'm begging you, don't do that again.

470
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,960
Is it proper? A fistfight over a woman at the school?

471
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,440
The suspension is only a minimal punishment.

472
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Spend the week you've been given to rethink your actions.

473
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,639
You're free to leave now.

474
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,840
Wait.

475
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,119
Sit down.

476
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,119
I've punished both of you as the school director.

477
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,809
But now, I'm going to punish you as your mother.

478
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,000
What's gotten into you? A fight over a woman?

479
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,599
A silly woman! How could you two get into a conflict over her?

480
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,400
You've been friends for ten years or so.

481
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,289
How can you fight over a woman?

482
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,519
Talk it out among yourselves immediately!

483
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,519
Give me your hands.

484
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:10,239
Are you sure?

485
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,809
Agh, Mom!

486
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,199
Don't do it again if it hurts.

487
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,599
It has to be twice for you.

488
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,679
Ouch!

489
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,079
Time,

490
00:39:58,809 --> 00:39:59,960
I'm sorry.

491
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,960
What for?

492
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,199
For being rude to you and getting into a fight with you.

493
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,329
I'm sorry.

494
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,360
Mom was right.

495
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,809
We've been friends for ten years or so.

496
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,239
Let's not fight over such a petty thing.

497
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,679
It might be a petty thing to you.

498
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,719
But to me,

499
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,920
Kwan is the most important person in my life.

500
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,289
If you're not serious,

501
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,679
then don't fool around.

502
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,519
All right.

503
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,289
If you're going to accuse me of having feelings for Kwan,

504
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,920
I'll have feelings for her then.

505
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,000
I'll flirt with her then.

506
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,400
Just don't accuse me of backstabbing you again.

507
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,000
If you think you can win her over,

508
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,599
then be my guest.

509
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,039
But I'm warning you.

510
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,289
It won't be as easy as you think pursuing Kwan.

511
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,159
And it's not as nice as what you see.

512
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,329
I want you to be mentally prepared.

513
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,289
I hope you're up for it.

514
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:20,559
Kwan?

515
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:38,289
(Kit Kwan Time)

516
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:50,440
Today, I'm here to teach you how to test your blood type.

517
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,119
All right. Take out your textbooks.

518
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:05,519
- Aw. - What are you two up to?

519
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,840
I heard Time and the deputy director

520
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,360
got suspended for a week.

521
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,360
It's fitting. The students might follow them

522
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
if they weren't punished.

523
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,440
By the way, who do you think Kwan's going to choose?

524
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:50,679
Of course, it has to be the deputy director.

525
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,719
He's obviously better.

526
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,920
I feel sorry for Time.

527
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,769
He's been pursuing her for a while.

528
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:01,519
But I feel more sorry for the deputy director.

529
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,079
There are plenty of decent women,

530
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,119
but he decided to go after Kwan?

531
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,440
Huh?

532
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,679
Okay. We should go.

533
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,719
(Vote for: Kornkit, Time)

534
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,679
You can pick me up in an hour.

535
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,400
I'll park out front and wait for you here.

536
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,480
I told you. I did it because I was worried about you.

537
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:58,400
Suit yourself.

538
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:03,800
Your regular room's ready.

539
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,400
- Here you go. - Thank you.

540
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,440
You're here.

541
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,159
Didn't you drive over tonight?

542
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,000
I have a driver.

543
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,519
A driver?

544
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,639
Who? A friend?

545
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,519
That's right. They said they were worried about my safety

546
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,800
and scared I might be assaulted.

547
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:09,760
Strange.

548
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,920
It's a guy friend, isn't it?

549
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,000
Yes, a guy friend.

550
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:19,239
A friend or a boyfriend?

551
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,719
What kind of boyfriend

552
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,039
would drive his girlfriend to a one-night stand?

553
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,599
He's really a friend.

554
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,199
Your friend that's waiting outside

555
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,199
has feelings for you, doesn't he?

556
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:03,719
How did you know?

557
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,639
Well, let's call it a guy's sense.

558
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,679
Then can you give me advice

559
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,239
on what I should do to convince him to stop pestering me?

560
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:19,360
Hm...

561
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:23,880
You should...

562
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,159
go out with me.

563
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,199
So he'll stop pestering you.

564
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,239
Are you sure you really want to do that?

565
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,440
We barely get to spend time together.

566
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:39,440
We only meet during one-night stands.

567
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,599
Things might not be as good as you think.

568
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,840
Whether it's good or bad,

569
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,000
we have to give it a try first.

570
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,800
Don't hurry to brush me off just yet.

571
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,679
Let me go out first,

572
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,559
then you can leave.

573
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,599
I don't want my friend to see you.

574
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:15,119
Sure.

575
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:35,800
Kit.

576
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,519
Eat as much as you want, Ploy.

577
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,840
These are all Kit's favorites.

578
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,599
Remember the taste once you've tried it.

579
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:56,639
You might have to look after what he eats after the wedding.

580
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:57,960
No problem, ma'am.

581
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,760
- Is she here? - There she is.

582
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:10,159
- Hello, Ms. Kwan! - Hello, Ms. Kwan!

583
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:12,599
You ambushed me? Why didn't you warn me?

584
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:16,039
But it's okay. I'm always beautiful. I won't embarrass myself.

585
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,039
So, what's today's topic?

586
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:24,159
A speed Q&A. You can only answer once, okay?

587
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,119
And you can't hesitate. One answer only.

588
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:29,239
Okay. I'm ready. Bring it on.

589
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,000
- The mountains or the sea? - The mountains?

590
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,639
Watching a movie or reading?

591
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,159
Watching a movie.

592
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:36,679
Orange juice or coffee?

593
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,679
Orange juice. It's the drink of a heroine.

594
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:44,079
Monogamy or promiscuity.

595
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,679
Of course, it's monogamy.

596
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:48,119
Mr. Time or Mr. Kit?

597
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:50,880
- So? - Who is it?

598
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,079
- Can you tell us? - Mr. Time!

599
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:55,159
- Mr. Time! Mr. Time! - Mr. Kit! Mr. Kit!

600
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:56,400
Who's your answer?

601
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,119
Of course, it's Mr. Kit.

602
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,920
It's decided! Ms. Kwan has chosen Mr. Kit!

603
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,159
Some people can only be sexual outlets

604
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,800
but can never truly be in someone's heart.

605
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,519
I know I'm competing against no one

606
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,639
except the fear in your heart.

607
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,719
You probably think you can defeat me.

608
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,679
Let me tell you something.

609
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,519
I haven't surrendered to you yet.

610
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,679
So can you tell me now what you meant

611
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:56,480
when you said you're happy I have one-night stands?

612
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,039
It means you haven't chosen Kit.

613
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,840
Mom, if you want me to get married,

614
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,400
I'm happy to do that for you.

615
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,360
But my bride can only be Kwan.

616
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Let's take a break. Let's go to eat.

617
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,519
It's easy-peasy today.

618
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,559
The smile is all an act.

619
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,840
But I feel like crying on the inside.

620
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,400
I've never gotten hurt this badly by a woman before.

621
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,760
Today, I'm here to test you...

622
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:26,119
Today, I'm here to teach you how to test your blood type.

623
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:27,239
Again.

624
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,480
Take this!

625
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,639
Hey!

626
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,599
Mr. Kit?

627
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,679
Are you okay?

628
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,239
It shattered.

629
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,679
All over my feet.

630
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,079
- Did it cut you? - No, I'm not hurt or anything.
