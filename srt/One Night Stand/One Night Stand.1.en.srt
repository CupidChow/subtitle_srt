00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:51,428
" One day ago "

190 baht.

6
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:55,784
Hello. Good morning everyone

7
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:58,828
I woke up early today because I had a morning class

8
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:00,955
Are you awake yet?

9
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,751
" Good morning P'Queen "

10
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:06,294
Good morning

11
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:10,465
"p'Queen, what time did you wake up?

12
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:12,342
At 3.

13
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,595
Just kidding! Who wakes up at three in the morning?

14
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,971
I woke up at six.

15
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:24,020
the morning so that they are beautiful quickly But if anyone wants to know how to get up in

16
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:28,566
please like and share, I will share my skills with you.

17
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:32,152
But now I want to study first

18
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:35,615
I hope today is a good day for everyone. Bye.

19
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,646
I just want to have my own freedom.

20
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,024
Live the life that I want.

21
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:14,195
I just want to be an ordinary girl.

22
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,574
Why?

23
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:22,078
Can't I love someone with all my heart?

24
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:45,268
P', can you stop and don't send my video to the director?

25
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,062
I'll get a new one and send it within an hour.

26
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:51,274
Why? What's wrong with this video?

27
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:57,447
I think I ended up being a bit of a waste. I want to try acting with emotion.

28
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,657
I think it fits the character more

29
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,035
Please let me take one last shot and send it to you?

30
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:06,998
You acted really well. The director really compliments you

31
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:09,626
-But I...
Don't worry

32
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:13,630
Let the director decide who he chooses, I'll tell you

33
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,808
Are you here?

34
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:31,773
Smile.

35
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:40,823
Thank you very much
I really like you, P'Queen.

36
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:45,328
I can pass the entrance exam here because I want to study'at the same school as you

37
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,164
am very happy to be your senior sister

38
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:52,627
If you happen to be passing by,don't forget to say hello.-- Then I'll go first.

39
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,504
-Bye-Bye.

40
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,591
It's time for class. Let's go

41
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:00,510
Where's Papa eng

42
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,661
Hello?
- Where are you? It's eight o'clock

43
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,498
Can I skip today?

44
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,959
Crazy! You said you were coming?

45
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,796
Yes, but now no. I want to sleep

46
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:40,008
You have missed this class many times.

47
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,471
Professor still threatens you, right? If you don't pass another class he will kick you out of school

48
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:47,265
Do you want to study for one more semester?

49
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,394
Don't complain. Come here quickly

50
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:54,814
Gale and I will be waiting for you under the building.

51
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:25,511
Did you sleep well last night?

52
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,889
-I'll take you back - Let go!

53
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:31,142
Just touching you, why are you overreacting?

54
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:34,562
You've gone further, haven't you?
-Hey!

55
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:43,780
I give up. Sorry, why are you angry? It's just a joke.

56
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,628
Bee.
Where are you going in such a hurry?

57
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,255
Let's talk first.

58
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:03,383
Bee.

59
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:06,677
Oh what more could you want?!

60
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:10,056
Fine, if you scold me like that, I feel overwhelmed too

61
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:14,519
Where are you going tonight? One Night Stand hosts a Happy Fool Night Party

62
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:15,311
- Are you going? - No.

63
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,731
- You're not going?
- None of your business!

64
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,650
What you're doing to me is following like a shitty dog! It's annoying!

65
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:24,112
Hey that's outrageous.

66
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:28,616
Seriously, what are you so sick of even though we were..?

67
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:34,872
Were what?

68
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:36,290
Speak up.

69
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,543
You will say you own me, right?

70
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:41,587
Like how you speak about me behind my back

71
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,756
Do you dare say it to my face now?

72
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:46,926
But don't think that I care.

73
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:50,388
You love to play and tell everyone that you are always with me

74
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,813
Don't expect me to date someone like you

75
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,107
Because if I had to date someone who I had sex with, I would've dated everyone in college!

76
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,077
He slept with the whole university

77
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,955
Dubbed the Goddess of One Night Stand

78
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:18,499
Not by luck.

79
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,507
Are you gossiping about me?

80
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,053
- You want to die?
- Papa eng!

81
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:35,433
Papa eng! You are l crazy?!

82
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,518
Get off me! - I'm not crazy!

83
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,396
Let me see if Ip pissed off anyone in your head.

84
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:45,318
But I didn't see anything when I looked here, or I slept with your parents?

85
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,110
Crazy!

86
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,112
Bee, calm down.
-Go!

87
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,572
Could you stop meddling in my business?!

88
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:57,038
Hey I'm curious, is your life so worthless if you don't gossip about other people?

89
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:03,586
When did I gossip about you?

90
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:08,674
Why? You're saying you weren't talking about me?

91
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:14,347
You really think that I don't know you're the one who created this nickname for me?

92
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,350
To be honest, you gossip about me many times now.

93
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:26,484
Let's just say that if you're I ying, I hope whoever you have sex with, you never [censored word ] for the rest of your life

94
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:29,111
Don't forget you [censored word ]

95
00:11:29,112 --> 00:11:33,157
Nobody wants anything to do with you! - Papa eng!
- What?! You think I'm afraid of you?

96
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:36,494
Do you want to know before I got this nickname,what was my nickname?!

97
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:37,370
Papa eng.

98
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:42,333
Papa eng,stop it.

99
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:44,710
Come on.

100
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:47,838
What?!

101
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:20,372
Are you stupid or crazy or are you unconscious? Keep adding more so those idiots will gossip about you.

102
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:24,960
on +
Just keep gossiping, I'm not begging them for anything

103
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:35,053
Ugh, I thought that RJ was annoying, then those bitches deserve a slap.

104
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,516
But you can attack him without blowing up.

105
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:44,187
Plan ahead instead of blowing yourself up over something stupid like this.

106
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:49,901
But your business is up to you. You gave yourself to RJ.

107
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,864
Are you blaming me?

108
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,950
Not blaming just telling the truth.

109
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:01,663
What could anyone do if you knew how to control yourself and not sleep around with everyone?

110
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,623
You reap the consequences of your actions

111
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:08,628
Gale, why don't you worry about yourself first?

112
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:14,009
Now I think you think you're fantasizing that you're so high and untouchable

113
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,306
Are you lying to others or yourself?
Honestly,who are you lying to?

114
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,433
What do you mean?

115
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:28,231
Tonight on April Fool's Day, I made a VIP
reservat ion at the One Night Stand bar.

116
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:32,277
Let's go to the shopping mall to dress up and go out together.

117
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,322
Tonight? It's only March 31st.

118
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,324
After tonight will be tomorrow.

119
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,621
Why? You're stuck? You're talking like you're not going to go.

120
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:43,205
Well, Toy just got back from Paris and he said he'd come over to my house tonight.

121
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,711
I told Toy that you were going with me.

122
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:56,510
Queen, you know if I could pass tonight? I'm still hung over.

123
00:13:56,511 --> 00:14:00,764
Also, RJ will definitely be going tonight, I don't want to see him.

124
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:01,932
No. Can't.

125
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,143
Hello,what do-you think about VIP One Night Stand?

126
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:09,064
It was easy to make an appointment even if it was me?

127
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:16,488
I don't know. You can ditch me anytime but not today.

128
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:22,536
if you're planning to go again?
Well it's sudden

129
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:26,623
But tonight there is a plan

130
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:37,759
Mer played two nights in a row and you can't stand it.

131
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,020
Athens

132
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:50,397
Queen

133
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,193
Happy birthday.

134
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:57,487
Is it your birthday?

135
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,826
You're asking a ridiculous question I just wished him a happy birthday

136
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,663
Thank you very much Queen.

137
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,123
Where will you celebrate?

138
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:14,671
Tonight, " One Night Stand Bar " will host April Fool's Day, are you going to the party?

139
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:17,465
Me, Gale, Papa eng are going

140
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:25,932
I should probably go because RJ invited me.

141
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:29,227
And some of the club people said they would celebrate a birthday too.

142
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:32,647
Really? Then see you later.

143
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:46,661
That's why I have to go to the party tonight.

144
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,289
You guys have to help me.

145
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:19,861
Welcome to Princess Gae wal in's Palace

146
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:24,240
- Papa eng, are you surprised?
Is that funny?

147
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,118
What? I'm just laughing at myself.

148
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,789
Princess,please

149
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,103
Did you audition for the Korean drama remake?

150
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,979
Asking me?

151
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,942
Yeah, you are the only star here.

152
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,948
I still don't know. But at first I didn't want.
to audition.
It doesn't seem like much.

153
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,117
But his team insisted I audition.

154
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:14,124
Waiting to see my friend Gae we lin's work

155
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,422
Did you tell Toy?

156
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:24,634
The audition results will be announced tonight?

157
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:29,055
Hello, did you tell Toy?

158
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,349
Yeah.

159
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,394
Can I take him there?

160
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,524
How will it be fun bringing your boyfriend?

161
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,319
I'm just asking.
Geez

162
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:52,036
May be for someone like you, just keep having sex and you'll be satisfied.

163
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:56,833
I don't want to argue. Try on clothes. I want to wash my face first.

164
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:21,107
So hurry up and try it.
See who can be faster.

165
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,277
Then let me try this. -Hmm.

166
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,243
- You don't have to be very fit, coach's not here
-Okay.

167
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,631
So? Tonight

168
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:30,260
are you still expecting Papa eng? - It's so insulting

169
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,720
Just wait and see.

170
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:35,223
Let her drink 4-5 glasses

171
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:38,309
Curses will turn into moans

172
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:49,090
Hey you want to come with us?

173
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,812
Maybe not. I should go back to my room first.

174
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:55,398
It's not because you're going to ditch us again, right?

175
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,568
You haven't been with me since you joined the club

176
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:02,113
No way. I'll go back and pack my things first

177
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:18,255
What's wrong?

178
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:20,173
Nothing.

179
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:22,884
Be there

180
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:25,720
Today is your birthday, right?

181
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:28,890
Wait a minute and I'll find something fun for you.

182
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,767
Well yeah, you guys go first

183
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:40,343
bye

184
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,111
Ah Toy, why are you here?

185
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,156
Gale didn't tell you she's going with us?

186
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
She did.

187
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:30,454
But today I have an appointment with Gale's
mother. So I brought something and stopped by

188
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:35,959
Then let me borrow her for today,okay

189
00:21:36,043 --> 00:21:39,880
I hope this doesn't cause problems in your relationship

190
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:42,215
Why do you say that? I do not mind.

191
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:47,471
Gale, have fun with your friends

192
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,850
Let's go now. I sn't the show at 9? I can't wait to go

193
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:59,483
I can't go against it. Excuse me. I thought we'd be together today.

194
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,446
Then I'll come with you?

195
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,908
Sorry

196
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:10,327
No boyfriend tonight.

197
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:15,957
Okay, I'll pick you up at 1:00 in the morning.

198
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:17,709
But where are you guys going? So, I'll go to the right place.

199
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:22,172
You can wait for a phone call to let you know

200
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,967
Today I don't know how many places we will visit and what time we will finish.

201
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:28,470
If you are really impatient, you can sleep first.

202
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,264
In fact, there are people who take care of her today, so don't worry.

203
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,268
So where are you going?

204
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,896
Don't be pushy

205
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,444
Okay, then remember to call me

206
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,989
Come on.
I'm going.

207
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:04,548
Are you guys ready?
Ready

208
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:07,425
Let's party

209
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:48,925
Hey

210
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:53,555
RJ is coming, why isn't Athens here yet?

211
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,025
Gale.

212
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:08,194
If you want to play on your phone, just stay at home then.

213
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,487
You don't have to be nosy

214
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:18,663
Let's make tonight even more fun. Let's go on another mission.

215
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:20,749
This again?
-Yes

216
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:26,296
have my things and tonight I will make Athens my boyfriend.

217
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:32,761
Think quickly, what are you going to do?

218
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:35,847
Let's start with Miss Gale

219
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,936
I'll go home at one o'clock.

220
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:51,821
Not like that. Hey, think something creative. Rethink.

221
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:57,994
Papa eng, I guess your mission is.

222
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:04,376
Tonight I'm not going to get drunk at the bar, I'm going to be sober

223
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,381
And no men.
No, I'm tired.

224
00:25:10,257 --> 00:25:15,762
You know what's funny about that? I don't believe you can do it.

225
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:25,230
A h, I'll wait and see.
Then you Gale, after midnight, how about it?

226
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,695
If you can't figure it out

227
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:33,488
I want you

228
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:40,912
you have to have a one night stand with someone tonight

229
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:43,456
Are you crazy? You know I've never done anything like this

230
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,668
Oh, I know you've never done this before, so I hope you give it a try

231
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,421
Let's release the excitement for one night

232
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,926
Make yourself happy and forget about tomorrow, okay?

233
00:25:55,845 --> 00:26:00,849
No, I'm not going to do a one night stand. Okay?

234
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,644
Do you believe that?

235
00:26:56,697 --> 00:27:03,953
Hey, what's up with you and Queen?
- I don't know and we're still talking.

236
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,455
You got her, yet?

237
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:11,044
Oh you, do you want her tonight? I'll arrange it for you too

238
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:15,673
You guys too,let me know if you're looking for someone,and I'll arrange for you

239
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:19,385
Let's toast!

240
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,054
Very excited.

241
00:27:25,684 --> 00:27:26,976
Wait for me

242
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,480
Good

243
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,655
Athens

244
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,993
Come over here

245
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,769
I don't think he needs you

246
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:14,399
What kind of person is really handsome Look at Queen

247
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:19,529
- Let's talk about this level.
Shut up!

248
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:25,994
Happy birthday.

249
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,420
Oh this is so intense Queen.

250
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:39,966
Well, I know

251
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,011
you can't drink too much because you're worried about class.

252
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:45,513
But if you don't drink, it's no fun.

253
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:54,439
Please?

254
00:28:58,402 --> 00:28:59,319
Come on.

255
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,036
Okay

256
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:09,787
Cheers.

257
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:21,466
Queen is very serious about Athens, you know that, right?

258
00:29:21,717 --> 00:29:25,470
-Yes Whether it's serious or not

259
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:28,514
men are not something that can be shared with friends

260
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:33,770
What do you mean?

261
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,942
So you think I'm going to steal my friend's man?

262
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:43,279
How can you think of something so low? What do you think about me?

263
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:54,290
Papa eng, what have you made here?

264
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:03,675
You are a student but you act uneducated Beautiful face with the habits of a beast

265
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,970
I know her well because we go to the same school

266
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:12,308
Because she slept with all the guys in college.

267
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:15,937
What's wrong with you?

268
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:18,272
Nothing.

269
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:31,202
How was this morning?

270
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,004
Bee, where are you going? - Want to puke!

271
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:42,964
I saw your face and I wanted to vomit!

272
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:53,933
Play hard to get all you want. Wait until 2am.

273
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,229
Gale

274
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:13,244
You think you're so beautiful? Snobby bitch.

275
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:53,860
But your business is up to you.
You gave yourself to RJ.

276
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,947
Are you going to blame me for this?

277
00:31:58,157 --> 00:32:00,867
Not blaming just telling the truth

278
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:05,622
What could anyone do if you knew how to control yourself and not sleep around with everyone?

279
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,874
You reap the consequences of your actions.

280
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,887
Hello Toy?
What are you doing? Why don't you answer the phone?

281
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,770
- Where are you?
Where do you want me to go?

282
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:30,813
Giri friend left me to stay home alone, where can I go?

283
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:36,486
-Toy Then, did you have fun?

284
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:41,157
So what if I'm drunk?
Are you drunk?

285
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,953
You can still hang out with friends and leave me alone

286
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:47,622
Where are you? I'll catch up with you.

287
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:52,669
How can you come?
Don't drive here when you are very drunk.

288
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,006
Never mind that. Just tell me where you are!

289
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:01,010
- What are you going to do if I don't tell you?
What did you say?

290
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:03,471
Stop pretending to be the master of my life!

291
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:24,177
Nong Gale,thanks for the audition,next time there will definitely be a chance

Gosh, Gale. Shouldn't you worry about yourself first?

298
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:24,195
Now I think you think you're fantasizing about how high and untouchable you are

299
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:29,992
Honestly, who are you lying to? Are you lying to others or yourself?

300
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:05,570
What are you photographing?

301
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:09,115
I took a picture of you by accident.

302
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:14,537
- But my face is ugly.
- It's cute

303

What's up Queen?

What are we going to do?

309
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:08,526

What did you do last night?

320
00:42:23,657 --> 00:42:25,908
A surprising thing happened

321
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:28,702
