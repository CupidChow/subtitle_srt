1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,050
Do you know who the Monkey is?

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,440

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,580
I don’t know.

4
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,340
I don’t know.

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,010
I don’t know.

6
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,020
I don’t know...

7
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,300
I don’t know anything.

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,490
I can’t do anything…

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,590
This is Guard Kang’s daughter.

10
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,200
Guard Kang that you have been looking for all along.

11
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,530
Guard Kang?

12
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,130
He was also known as the Tiger of the Southern Mountain.

13
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,170
Do you not remember?

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,580
Tiger of the Southern Mountain.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,690
Yes, the Tiger of the Southern Mountain.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,100
The Tiger of the Southern Mountain. You remember, yes?

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,090
I have to tell the Tiger of the Southern Mountain.

18
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,990
Tell him what?

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,720
The Monkey…

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,110
The Monkey did it.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,130
The Monkey killed him.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,400
Whom did the Monkey kill?

23
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,410
The Monkey! The Monkey will kill me!

24
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,510
He will kill us all. Kill us all!

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,800
We all die!

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
We all die! We all die.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
 He will kill us all. He will kill us all.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,160
 He will kill us all.

29
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,540
 The Monkey will kill us all.

30
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,940
We all die!

31
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,920
We all die!

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,510
 We all die!

33
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,200
 The Monkey will kill us all.

34
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,740
Chief Royal Secretary.

35
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,480
Have you waited long?

36
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,790
Not at all.

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,630
Forgive me. I was careless.

38
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,470
Let us talk in my room.

39
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,810
The Monkey... The Monkey will kill us all...

40
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,170
Mistress Jo.

41
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,400
Calm down. Tell us one thing at a time.

42
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,220
Yes.

43
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,500
You sent my father an anonymous letter.

44
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,380
Why did you tell him to investigate Interpreter Jang?

45
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,780
Why did you ask me to investigate the dead Interpreter Jang?

46
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,190
Guard Kang.

47
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,300
Please save me.

48
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,030
I think Judge Lee killed Jang.

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,990
- Judge Lee? 
 - Judge Lee?

50
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,180
Do you mean the judge of the Capital Bureau, Lee Shi Heum?

51
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,430
Yes.

52
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,840
Jang summoned Judge Lee to Giringak in secret to threaten him.

53
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,500
If he did not give him the right to sell red ginseng to Tsing Empire,

54
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,140
he would tell the Chief State Minister.

55
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,140
That is why Judge Lee killed Jang.

56
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,100
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,970
Why did he threaten him?

58
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,370
You must be mistaken—

59
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,650
I heard it.

60
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,590
A rat ate what Jang brought to Judge Lee and died.

61
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,070
A rat died?

62
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,270
A rat died?

63
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,250
That is why he killed him.

64
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,480
To rid of the evidence. That is why he burned the house down.

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,820
What was it that the rat ate and died from?

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,450
I do not know.

67
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Jang said he did not realize it was poison. But...

68
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,310
he said he bought it to use at the temple.

69
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,340
At Mangwolsa Temple.

70
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,130
Judge Lee knows that I overheard this.

71
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,590
He will try to kill me next.

72
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,760
Guard Kang, please save me.

73
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,350
Is that Judge Lee...

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,760
the Monkey?

75
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,830
The Monkey...

76
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,690
The Monkey...

77
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,540
The Monkey... The Monkey...

78
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,670
The Monkey will kill...

79
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,120
The Monkey will kill us all.

80
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,290
Who is...

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,770
Judge Lee?

82
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,290
So, what brings you here

83
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,690
at this hour?

84
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,710
Sim Heon died, and we could not find out whom he works for.

85
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,180
But it is a relief that we discovered Chief State Minister's letter.

86
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,740
But there is one thing...

87
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,450
suspicious about this.

88
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,000
The letter that Kang Ro Seo distributed.

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,020
There was a seal script of the monkey on it.

90
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,500
And this is what was written there.

91
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,970
"I write here the evidence that my father left behind,

92
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,790
 I write here the evidence that my father left behind,

93
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,840
- so the criminal 
 -  so the criminal

94
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,630
- will know 
 - will know

95
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,250
- his own crime." 
 -  his own crime.

96
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,440
If that is truly what Kang Ho Yeon left behind,

97
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,240
it must be related to the Chief State Minister.

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,750
But...

99
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,810
there is no correlation at all.

100
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,560
For that,

101
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,380
would it not be faster to arrest Kang Ro Seo and ask her?

102
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,060
I believe...

103
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,260
you would know where she is.

104
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,360
I suppose...

105
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,310
if you knew that, you would have arrested her already.

106
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,280
Soon, the Prohibition Bureau

107
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,090
will be on guard to capture Kang Ro Seo and her gang. Then,

108
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,110
you can ask her yourself about the symbol.

109
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,750
I shall give you that opportunity first.

110
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,910
 What is the meaning of this?

111
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,590
 Chief Royal Secretary asked the soldiers to repair the rampart,

112
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,340
 so the soldiers could not be dispatched right away.

113
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,730
 Oh, but his hand...

114
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,780
 His right hand had six fingers.

115
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,100
 Everything is pointing at Chief Royal Secretary.

116
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,750
Maiden.

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,770
Where are you coming from?

118
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,090
I found out who it was

119
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
that killed my father.

120
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,310
What do you mean?

121
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,820
The Monkey.

122
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,180
The Monkey...

123
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,930
was Chief Royal Secretary.

124
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,160
The Chief Royal Secretary

125
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,030
was the man who killed my father.

126
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,420

127
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,700
A monkey with many tricks.

128
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,370
That's you.

129
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,010
- What is... 
 - You were born as a government slave,

130
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,740
but will you die as one?

131
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,490
You are a smart one,

132
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,710
so you must understand what I mean.

133
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,680

If you have defiled your body voluntarily, kill yourself!

134
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,980
 This man raped me.

135
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,900

Grand Prince Neungsan was looking for me.

136
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,620
You must go back for today.

137
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,340
Monkey.

138
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,010
I was fond of you as you had many skills.

139
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,110
Do not forget this for the rest of your life.

140
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,510
That you are not a human, but a monkey!

141
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,680
Go home.

142
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,280
 Grand Prince Neungsan schemed treason?

143
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,520
 This is...

144
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,730
 the letter that Grand Prince Neungsan sent to Right State Minister.

145
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,740
 Take them!

146
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,790
Father!

147
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,240
Mother!

148
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,030
Mother!

149
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,040
Aigoo!

150
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,880
 A monkey with many tricks.

151
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,810
 That's you.

152
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,060
If you see here,

153
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,610
Father has recorded a list of what Interpreter Lee

154
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,320
brought from Tsing Empire.

155
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,020
A rat died from eating something that Interpreter Jang brought from Tsing Empire.

156
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,170
Is that right?

157
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,210
They seem like typical medicine and herbs,

158
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,840
but the poison that killed Crown Prince Sunghyun must be among them.

159
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,640
 He was afraid that would be exposed,

160
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,950
 which was why he framed Interpreter Jang as a thief and killed him.

161
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,580
 Then he killed my father.

162
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,930
 He tried to kill Mistress Jo as well.

163
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,150
Chief State Minister and the Training Commander are wrongly accused at the moment.

164
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,270
The problem is Chief Royal Secretary is the Crown Prince's uncle.

165
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,990
If Chief Royal Secretary poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun,

166
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,010
it means the current crown prince rose to his position through treason.

167
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,630
So he could be dethroned.

168
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,840
Then what can we do?

169
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,690
First, I must report this to His Majesty as soon as possible.

170
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,860
His Majesty would want to resolve this matter discreetly.

171
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,840
I understand.

172
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,200
Would you be all right with it?

173
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,460
What do you mean?

174
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,770
Resolving this discreetly

175
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,280
would mean that the reason behind your father's death

176
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,400
will not be investigated officially.

177
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,430
Would you be all right with that?

178
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,540
It's fine.

179
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,140
Heaven knows, and the earth knows it.

180
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,990
And we know.

181
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,450
That is enough for me.

182
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,740
Before I report this to His Majesty,

183
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,110
I came here to tell Your Highness.

184
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,550
Forgive me, Your Highness.

185
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,980
Can you not let this go?

186
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,090
Say that Chief State Minister and the Training Commander did it

187
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,980
and leave it at that?

188
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,790
- Your Highness... 
 - You said you thought of me as your friend.

189
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,850
Let this one go.

190
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,320
I am asking you as your friend.

191
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,680
Could it be...

192
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,320
that you knew?

193
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,910
Let it go.

194
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,140
This is not a question but a command.

195
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,560
- Your Highness. 
 - You said so yourself.

196
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,380
If you do not learn, you do not progress.

197
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,430
And if you do not progress, there is no end.

198
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,300
 If you do not learn, you do not progress.

199
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,570
 And if you do not progress, there is no end.

200
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,930
 How could the torment end?

201
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,700
You were wrong.

202
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,510
Some truths only cause pain by knowing.

203
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,720
You are much better off not knowing some truths.

204
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,240
Some things are better off left covered up and ignored.

205
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,250
 In this world,

206
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,930
 there are such endings.

207
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,580
 Things that are endless and undecipherable

208
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,050
 but you must try to cover up and pretend not to know.

209
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,000
Covered up and ignored?

210
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,420
The people who should not become criminals have become criminals,

211
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,940
- and people who should not have died have died! 
 - That is how...

212
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,280
the one who should not have become the Crown Prince has become one.

213
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,060
Do you want me and my mother to be dethroned

214
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,950
and receive the death sentence by poison?

215
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,210
His Majesty would not do that.

216
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,620
If you reveal this, you will die as well.

217
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,950
You and the Maiden will both die.

218
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,610
Your Highness.

219
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,290
Commander Nam.

220
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,070
You are...

221
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,000
under arrest for hiding the ringleader Kang Ro Seo while knowing her crimes.

222
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,820
What are you doing outside?

223
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,900
Arrest Commander Nam.

224
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,340
-  Arrest Kang Ro Seo! 
 - Yes, sir!

225
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,750
Open this door!

226
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,880
Open this door!

227
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,920
Open this door!

228
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,690
Leave us.

229
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,030
There is no use causing a raucous.

230
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,510
No one crosses this path.

231
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,470
What do you plan to do with me?

232
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,680
As long as you stay quiet,

233
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,550
nothing will happen to you.

234
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,380
You killed my father.

235
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,140
Why did you kill my father?

236
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,580
Why did you!

237
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,370
Your father, Crown Prince Sunghyun, and I...

238
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,800
were friends with the same dream.

239
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,070
We wanted to create a new Joseon where one would live their dream

240
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,190
without limitation of their status.

241
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,710
For that,

242
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,510
we had to take the terrible power from the officials.

243
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,840

The Capital Defense Military,

244
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,380
the King's Guards, the Capital Garrison Command

245
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,910
and the Royal Guards are all under their command.

246
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,310
How can one call this the King's country?

247
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,020
We cannot win by facing them head-on.

248
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,960
There is a plan that I have thought of.

249
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,500
A plan?

250
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,180
It is prohibition.

251
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,540
It is a law that is justified but cannot be abided.

252
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,130
We can use the alcohol ban as an excuse

253
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,300
to create a foundation for the King's private military.

254
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,020
Ten, no...

255
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,580
five years will be enough.

256
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,050
Covering their eyes

257
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,110
and expanding our powers in secret...

258
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,490
But prohibition is put in place temporarily only when there is a bad harvest.

259
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,230
How could we ban alcohol for ten years?

260
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,370
You are right, Guard Kang.

261
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,260
A justice earned by a ban.

262
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,790
How long could it last?

263
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,710
- But Your Highness— 
 - Too much greed can cause one's own death.

264
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,750
A monkey trying to catch the reflection of the moon on the water

265
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,200
falls into the pond and drowns.

266
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,310
What we accomplish

267
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,750
must be the moon upon the sky.

268
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,760
We must not become monkeys that chase false dreams.

269
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,460
Is that not right?

270
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,900
Crown Prince Sunghyun believed we could achieve it fair and square.

271
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,660
What else could I do?

272
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,010
If the horse does not follow your lead, you must change the horse.

273
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,180
Just to put the alcohol ban in place, you poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun

274
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,220
and killed my father?

275
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,520
I did not want

276
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,020
to kill your Father.

277
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,300
Ho Yeon.

278
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,260
Forget the past

279
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,800
and join forces with me.

280
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,580
If you and I join forces,

281
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,050
we can change Joseon. Is that not so?

282
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,940
 The one who refused my extended hand.

283
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,800
Your father was the one who betrayed me first.

284
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,830
Look around you now.

285
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,650
Who was right in the end?

286
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,590
I created His Majesty's military through the alcohol ban,

287
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,720
got rid of the rotten subjects,

288
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,150
and built the power that allows me to enter anyone's place for inspection.

289
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,650
This was all for this country, Joseon.

290
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,520
I accomplished those things through my sacrifice.

291
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,770
It disgusts me.

292
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,870
No matter how you put it,

293
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,270
your deeds were treason and murder.

294
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,500
Commander Nam is on his way to report this all to His Majesty.

295
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,100
Soon, you shall pay for your sins.

296
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,400
Commander Nam...

297
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,590
must be arrested at the Interrogation Bureau by now.

298
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,360
Why do you...

299
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,270
Did you think this could be evidence?

300
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,980
No!

301
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,860
No!

302
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,610
No!

303
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,740
No!

304
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,700
It is all over.

305
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,010
Forget the past and live on.

306
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,650
Your eyes right now

307
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,640
resemble your father's.

308
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,400
The reason I let you live

309
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,870
is my last consideration for Ho Yeon.

310
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,220
So I hope you live quietly.

311
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,520
That way, Commander Nam will stay alive as well.

312
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,840
Your Highness.

313
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,340
You are bleeding.

314
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,630
I told you to stay put.

315
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,520
It is all over.

316
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,890
It was concluded that Chief State Minister paid to kill your father, so why...

317
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,380
Why would you intend on putting yourself in danger?

318
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,730
Was it Your Highness?

319
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,430
Did Your Highness...

320
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,180
know about this?

321
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,320
Young Tenant...

322
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,850
Did you do this to him?

323
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,560
Let me leave.

324
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,180
I must find him.

325
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,910
- You cannot. 
 - Let go of me!

326
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,000
If you leave here,

327
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,100
Nam Young will die.

328
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,290
How...

329
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,250
How could you do this?

330
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,570
I will have someone bring medicine for your wound.

331
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,440
I am looking after the Maiden, so do not worry.

332
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,800
As long as you are willing to stay quiet, everyone will be safe.

333
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,950
Do you truly believe that?

334
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,660
Chief Royal Secretary will not let anyone who knows his deeds stay alive.

335
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,100
I shall not let that happen.

336
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,910
This is the only way to keep you and the Maiden alive.

337
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,070
Commander Nam got arrested?

338
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,880
Yes.

339
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,810
You know the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers?

340
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,560
That Kang Ro Seo who kidnapped you.

341
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,670
Commander Nam was living with that alcohol smuggler.

342
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:48,890
You almost got married to that despicable man.

343
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,090
Goodness, it gives me the chills!

344
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,820
What happened to Kang Ro Seo?

345
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,070
I do not know.

346
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,360
She suddenly disappeared.

347
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,910
- Disappear? 
 - Yes.

348
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,180
How...

349
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,200
I cannot believe Commander Nam is jailed in the Interrogation Bureau.

350
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,790
Then...

351
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,810
what shall we do with this?

352
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,040

353
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,700

354
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,100
If anything happens to me, deliver this to His Majesty.

355
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,900
But it cannot go through the Secretary Bureau.

356
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,850
Please deliver it to His Majesty directly.

357
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,880

358
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,520
How do we get this directly to His Majesty?

359
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,710
How can we meet His Majesty without going through the Secretary Bureau?

360
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,140
It is all right.

361
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,030
Then, what shall we do now?

362
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,440
You said you saw them drag her into the palace, right?

363
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,890
If she is somewhere in the palace, food will certainly be served to her.

364
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,730
Guard the kitchen

365
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,590
and see if some food is sneaked out discreetly.

366
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,150
And me?

367
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,910
What should I do?

368
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,580
Aigoo.

369
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,330
What happens to something that goes in? It must come out.

370
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,150
Choon Gae, be on the lookout around the lavatory.

371
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,580
Understood.

372
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,070
So we're here.

373
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,800
But how do we get into the Main Palace?

374
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,780
There could not be a way to enter discreetly.

375
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,520
We would lose our heads before we could.

376
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,840
Right.

377
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,230
Where am I?

378
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,000
They all look the same...

379
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,400
Aigoo!

380
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,570
- You...
- You...

381
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,060
Are you not Commander Nam's servant?

382
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,780
T-the thing is...

383
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,330
Goodness.

384
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,860
It seems Commander Nam planned this.

385
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,930
Without a doubt, a man with a plan.

386
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,680
Right. Take us to the Main Palace.

387
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,690
Pardon?

388
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,240
Let us go.

389
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,410
If you keep refusing food, you will harm yourself.

390
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,010
Have a little bit, at least.

391
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,940
I do not want to eat.

392
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,490
Just one spoonful. Please.

393
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,460
Please go away.

394
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,630
I shall leave it here. Have some if you change your mind.

395
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,660
Whether I starve to death or not,

396
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,610
do not come here.

397
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,380
I shall live like the dead, as you wish.

398
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,300
Is it really there?

399
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,600
Yes. They said they kept serving food here that is untouched.

400
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,580
The Crown Prince?

401
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,520
Is it true that Commander Nam is jailed at the Interrogation Bureau?

402
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,810
He was hiding Kang Ro Seo, the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers, at his house.

403
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,550
I feared he might try to escape,

404
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,300
so I arrested him before alerting Your Majesty.

405
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,630
Please forgive me.

406
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,890
Let Commander Nam go

407
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,260
and drop the charges against Guard Kang's daughter.

408
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,390
I will...

409
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,880
lift the prohibition.

410
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,440
Your Majesty.

411
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,330
The fruits of our labor have just begun to ripen.

412
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,440
Why do you try to harvest them already?

413
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,270
Please reconsider.

414
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,740
Twenty-nine years ago,

415
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,440
you brought me the letter proving that Grand Prince Neungsan had plotted treason.

416
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,610
I knew it was Chief State Minister’s doing.

417
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,910
Also...

418
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,530
that you copied Grand Prince Neungsan’s handwriting to write that letter.

419
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,150
We were able to quickly settle down

420
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,660
the complaints after the coup by sacrificing Grand Prince Neungsan,

421
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,060
so there is no doubt that you are my loyal subject.

422
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,320
But…

423
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,600
as for the letter you brought as evidence that Chief State Minister killed Sunghyun…

424
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,780
Whom is that supposed to sacrifice?

425
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,890
Did you think you could cover up the truth

426
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,480
if you locked up Commander Nam?

427
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,390

428
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,650
Written here...

429
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,050
is all of your crimes.

430
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,920
Take that sword and end your own life.

431
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,920
That is...

432
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,600
the only thing you can do for the Crown Prince.

433
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,580
Even after all the love and affection, it only takes...

434
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,870
a moment to discard a person.

435
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,150
Wh-What?

436
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,540
For Your Majesty, I have barked on command,

437
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,020
bit on a command,

438
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,610
and got my hands dirty willingly.

439
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,890
Will Your Majesty...

440
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,710
also discard me now?

441
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,630
Call the physician...

442
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,310
I will not be hurt again. So...

443
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,790
that is why I am discarding Your Majesty first.

444
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,010
You…

445
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,020
Now, no one...

446
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,690
can discard me any longer, Your Majesty.

447
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,460
- Your Majesty. 
 - Your Highness.

448
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,170
Your Majesty!

449
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,920
His Majesty has collapsed.

450
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,250
You did your best,

451
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,630
but it was all for nothing.

452
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,200
The Crown Prince shall oversee the matters of the state in His Majesty's place.

453
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Will you forget everything in the past

454
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,010
and become the Crown Prince's loyal subject?

455
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,350
The subject who will become scissors and cut off all the shadows.

456
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:54,360
I believe I already answered that question.

457
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,220
Listen to me, Commander Nam.

458
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,400
Do you think that in this day and age in Joseon,

459
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,380
could you have...

460
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,940
won first place in the state exam, appointed as an inspector,

461
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,200
and become the Crown Prince’s tutor without me?

462
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,320
You would have stayed in a low position and eventually returned to your hometown.

463
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,040
Even after practicing asceticism for 1,000 years,

464
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,710
a snake becomes a dragon only if it obtains a cintamani.

465
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,470
And if it does not, it remains a serpent.

466
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,350
Give up on Kang Ro Seo.

467
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,030
Leave the matter with her father in the past. Then...

468
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,360
I shall...

469
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,980
give you the cintamani.

470
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,780
Take that cintamani, turn the people into criminals,

471
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,210
and rid of the opponent by framing them with false accusations.

472
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,260
Is that what you are saying?

473
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,180
How could we bring forth change without any sacrifice?

474
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,400
A new bud blossoms only after cutting off the rotted branches of a sick tree.

475
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,180
Is that why...

476
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,700
you killed Crown Prince Sunghyun and Guard Kang?

477
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,700
There is no evidence

478
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,750
- or witness on those matters. 
 - No.

479
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,510
I am the witness.

480
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,950
I saw you kill Guard Kang with my own two eyes, Chief Royal Secretary.

481
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,750
The Monkey…

482
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,230
Was that you, Chief Royal Secretary?

483
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,170
Even to the end,

484
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,260
you will not let it go.

485
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,770
Is that it?

486
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,730
If I were to become a pair of scissors for His Highness the Crown Prince,

487
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,150
I would cut you off from him first.

488
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,440
I wanted to give you a chance.

489
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,570
His Highness would be extremely disappointed.

490
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,980
You...

491
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,740
always keep me waiting.

492
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,240
After you left Giringak,

493
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,290
I waited for you every day.

494
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,530
Wondering how tall you have grown,

495
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,550
how manly you have become.

496
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,240
Wondering...

497
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,110
if you would come to take me away.

498
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,310
Waiting for you with those thoughts

499
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,840
was the only joy

500
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,410
of living as a gisaeng.

501
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,470
If...

502
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,700
you hadn’t returned at all,

503
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,470
this wouldn’t have happened.

504
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,410
I would have lived my whole life waiting.

505
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,710
 The Monkey.

506
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,850
 Monkey. The Monkey.

507
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,800
 Father?

508
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,810
 Who’s your father?

509
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,080
 I can’t tell you.

510
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,390
He’s an amazing person.

511
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,230
He works at the palace and lives in a really big house.

512
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,140
Does he not know that you're here right now?

513
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,350
He doesn’t even know that I was born.

514
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,000
But I have proof.

515
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,310
Before Mother died,

516
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,730
she engraved it on my body.

517
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,700
If I show him that,

518
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,090
she said he would know immediately that I’m his son.

519
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,740
Then you can go show him now.

520
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,340
Later.

521
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,100
After I’m successful.

522
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,890
I’ll tell him once I’m successful.

523
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,430
That I’m his son.

524
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,820
 Even insignificant wildflowers look like a painting if you look at them this way.

525
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,650
 Even in a stuffy room,

526
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,290
 there are things you can do happily like this.

527
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,320
 It's pretty.

528
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,200
 It looks like the shadow is wavering under the moonlight.

529
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,440
♫  Somewhere a place I cannot reach  ♫

530
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,450
♫  I keep waiting for you where you are  ♫

531
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,300
♫  Oh, someday  ♫

532
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:14,400
♫  I'm gonna find out where you are, no matter how many days pass  ♫

533
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,770
♫  The moment when I will see you again  ♫

534
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:30,700
♫  Deep in my heart,  I long desperately for you   ♫

535
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:36,600
♫  My love, will you return to me?  ♫

536
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,090
The royal seal

537
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,870
will be moved to the Eastern Palace.

538
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,720
What do you mean?

539
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,630
You must kill Nam Young?

540
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,080
You said you would let him live.

541
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,160
What else can I do?

542
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,240
He said he would rather die than work for Your Highness.

543
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,060
Did he truly...

544
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,020
say that?

545
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,050
Did you say he was the first friend you have made?

546
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:31,550
But that friend abandoned you.

547
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,620
So you must let him go.

548
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,170
Everyone can live if you discard just one person, Commander Nam.

549
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,860
What about Maiden Ro Seo?

550
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,300
If you hurt her, I will not stay put.

551
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,770
That girl...

552
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,030
will be safe as long as she does not leave Yeonhwadang.

553
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,420
She has finally settled down.

554
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,250
So do not tell her about Commander Nam.

555
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,800
I plan to appoint new officials.

556
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,240
Please allow it.

557
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,890
 Your Highness, Princess Consort is—

558
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,050
I never allowed you to enter.

559
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,490
What are you doing right now?

560
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,830
Can you not tell?

561
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,850
I’m drinking.

562
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:51,910
What are you doing?

563
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,700
I think I need to drink before I can say what I want to say.

564
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,870
What?

565
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:05,170
Is the person inside Yeonhwadang truly Maiden Ro Seo?

566
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,670
How did you find that out...

567
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:20,280
Did you also command the matter regarding Commander Nam?

568
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,030
This does not concern you.

569
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,650
You must go back.

570
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,660
Fine.

571
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,030
Stay here like that.

572
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:38,060
I will go get Maiden Ro Seo out of there.

573
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,210
Do you know how I became the Crown Prince?

574
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,750
My uncle...

575
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,360
No, I…

576
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,720
I earned my position by killing my own brother.

577
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,600
What do you mean?

578
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,840
I became the Crown Prince

579
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,900
through treason.

580
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,830
They tried to uncover it,

581
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,160
so I arrested Commander Nam

582
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,050
and locked up Maiden Ro Seo.

583
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,330
If I did not, you, me,

584
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:26,580
and even my mother, Gyeongbin...

585
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,080
would not be able to save our lives.

586
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,150
- Your Highness— 
 - That was why.

587
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,780
That is why Commander Nam will die.

588
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,770
Nam Young must die so everyone else can live.

589
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,510
So you...

590
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:45,290
must not do anything and return to your quarters.

591
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:55,350
- D-did you just slap me? 
 - Yes.

592
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,310
I think you are drunk and out of your mind.

593
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,910
Are you in your right mind now?

594
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,750
What?

595
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,260
You look like you are about to die,

596
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,240
and you keep saying things that you do not mean.

597
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,010
You actually want to save him.

598
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,520
You cannot even save the person you hold dear as a crown prince.

599
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,080
What is the point of protecting such a position?

600
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,890
If you are so good-looking, you must live up to your looks.

601
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,210
You mean...

602
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,050
you do not care if you are removed from your position?

603
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,200
Your Highness,

604
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,680
my father is the Minister of Defense.

605
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,740
I have no regrets about the Princess Consort position at all.

606
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,390
- But—  
 - And regarding Royal Consort Gyeongbin…

607
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:03,580
there is someone who could help with the matter.

608
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,840
Your Highness.

609
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,480
I must speak with him privately.

610
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,970
- Leave us. 
  - Yes, Your Highness.

611
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,620
You said you would rather die

612
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,400
than work for me. Is it true?

613
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,960
If you change your mind now, I shall not send you away.

614
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,700
Please...

615
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,760
protect the Maiden.

616
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,200
Will you promise me?

617
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,500
- Until the very end, you— 
 - Someday,

618
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,870
when the chance comes for you to right your wrong, do not let it go.

619
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:59,840
If you lose the right time, this wrongdoing

620
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:06,020
will pester your heart for the rest of Your Highness’s life.

621
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,560
This is...

622
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,370
the last scolding I give to Your Highness

623
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,590
as your tutor.

624
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,220
Are you the only one so righteous?

625
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:26,130
If you think this is the end, you are mistaken.

626
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,840
Your Highness…

627
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,780
If you let your forked tongue loose,

628
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,940
it could shorten your life. Remember...

629
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,980
my words.

630
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,450
- Take him away! 
 -  Yes, Your Highness!

631
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,400
There was no one in the house?

632
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,990
No. It seemed she had left in a hurry.

633
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,500
 Your Highness,

634
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,740
 His Highness the Crown Prince and the Princess Consort are here.

635
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,490
You may go.

636
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,990
 Remember...

637
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,350
 my words.

638
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,300
Are you all right?

639
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,450
- Am I too late? 
 - No.

640
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,160
You’re just on time.

641
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,230
What is it?

642
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,470
That is… At Yeonhwadang…

643
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,400
What brings you here, Royal Chief Secretary?

644
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,500
What are you doing here?

645
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,480
As you can see, I am drinking tea.

646
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,990
Where did you hide her?

647
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,790
Hide who?

648
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:52,090
I guess someone must have stayed here.

649
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:55,820
Someone who should not be inside the palace.

650
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,730
Geum! Choon Gae!

651
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,950
My Lady.

652
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,260
My Lady, are you all right?

653
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,270
Do you remember the way out of the palace?

654
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,760
Your Highness.

655
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,950
 Catch her!

656
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,840
 Stop her!

657
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,550
Hurry and go. Nam Young will be waiting for you.

658
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,970
All right.

659
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,660
Your Highness.

660
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,390
Please take care of yourself.

661
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,450
Do not worry about me.

662
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,710
My Lady, hurry.

663
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,870
- Hurry! Hurry!
 - My Lady!

664
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,900
Stop!

665
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,010
If any of you passes by me,

666
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,550
I shall regard it as treason and slay you.

667
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,190
Your Highness!

668
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,890
What is the meaning of this?

669
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,760
The same goes for you, Uncle.

670
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,140
Do not move from where you are.

671
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,830
Chief Royal Secretary!

672
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,460
Commander Nam ran away while being transported.

673
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,230
Is this also your doing, Your Highness?

674
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:21,410
I was born with this face,

675
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:25,350
so I thought I should live up to it.

676
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,700
Young Tenant!

677
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,770
Maiden.

678
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,020
Maiden, are you all right?

679
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,590
Are you not hurt?

680
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,220
And you, are you not hurt?

681
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,230
I’m all right.

682
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,370
What is this?

683
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,240
Did you hurt yourself?

684
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,700
It’s nothing. I’m all right.

685
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:19,220
- Everything is all right now. 
 - It's not all right with me.

686
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,320
How could you not take care of yourself?

687
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,860
Are you not hurt anywhere else?

688
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:32,430
Just hold onto me like this.

689
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,660
My Lady.

690
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,290
We prepared a boat. You must go now.

691
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:50,220
- We should get going. 
 - No.

692
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,730
Our destination is already set.

693
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,540
Topple the alcohol ban?

694
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,190
How would that be possible?

695
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:17,780
Even though Sim Heon is dead, I hear alcohol is circulating inside the capital.

696
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:23,010
It means someone is smuggling alcohol in Sim Heon’s place.

697
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,940
And?

698
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,680
The money earned from smuggling alcohol would be used to maintain the Prohibition Bureau.

699
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,150
Cutting the branches while the roots are intact. What is the use of that?

700
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,580
What root are you talking about?

701
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,680
The distillery.

702
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,390
The distillery where that alcohol is made.

703
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:47,820
If we cannot bring that man down,

704
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,690
we must ruin what he has.

705
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,270
The alcohol ban.

706
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,020
The Prohibition Bureau.

707
00:58:55,020 --> 00:59:00,620
I will make sure he witnesses all those things crumble to the ground.

708
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,530
As expected,

709
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:14,550
I was right for recognizing you for what you are.

710
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:17,310
I will gladly help with that.

711
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,790
I want to see it as well.

712
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:28,810
That man’s creations shattering.

713
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,280
But is it okay for the commander to hold a gun?

714
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,750
I’m not an official anymore.

715
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,410
I was fired.

716
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,610

717
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:01,350
 The Crown Prince’s wedding will take place soon.

718
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:03,690
 The biggest sales of all sales.

719
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,680
 No one will suspect a thing even if we order

720
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,990
 more than double the usual amount of alcohol.

721
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,280
 We will smuggle that alcohol into Hanyang.

722
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,830
 Meaning countless merchants will gather to the newly dug underground tunnel.

723
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,970

All at the same time.

724
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,970
 Exactly.

725
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:28,920
 The Office of Inspector General will take care of that.

726
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,120

727
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,770
Welcome.

728
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,440
Welcome.

729
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,800
Hurry and get up here.

730
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,670
Hurry up.

731
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,530
We don’t have all night.

732
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:44,500
Don’t hesitate and come up here.

733
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,550
 Then, only the minimum number of people will be at the distillery to guard it.

734
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,740

It will become easier to get inside.

735
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,280
 It will not be as easy as you think.

736
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,280
 You will have to be properly prepared.

737
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,710
Whoa. They made this here?

738
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,120
What are you lot doing here?

739
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,000
One second.

740
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:13,640
 Don’t worry.

741
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,510
 I will take care of everything with my people.

742
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,460
K-Kang Ro Seo?

743
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,820
Oh, that one was a misfire. I’m not used to this thing.

744
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:42,670
This is why the literati won’t do.

745
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,260
I told you I was fired.

746
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,130
You lot!

747
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,590
Don’t move!

748
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,900
I didn’t realize it would be so big.

749
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,060
This is a trap!

750
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,680
Woon Sim, that wench tricked us!

751
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,030
Let's move.

752
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,600
Wait!

753
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,550
Huh?

754
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,380
You…

755
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:43,040
You…

756
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:46,820
Gye Ssang Mok?

757
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,180
- What’s this? 
 - Brother!

758
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,540
Ro Seo!

759
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,910
Ro Seo!

760
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:01,880
Do you have any idea how worried I was for you?

761
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,960
I am glad you’re safe.

762
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,140
I am so glad!

763
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,540
Let me see you.

764
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,270
My Lady.

765
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,900
Boss Gye.

766
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,430
My Lady.

767
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:17,180
♫  I won't say it  ♫

768
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,580
♫  Just seeing you  ♫

769
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:25,460
- I’m just happy to see her. 
 - I’m also happy to see you.

770
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,340
Ruining a good atmosphere.

771
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,370
Young Master Nam!

772
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:32,110
Young Master Nam! Come! Come here!

773
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:34,230
Young Master Nam! Come here!

774
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:36,310
Young Master Nam!

775
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:40,660
Young Master Nam! Do you have any idea how much I missed you?

776
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,040
Aigoo, it’s been so long!

777
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,840
Please.

778
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,600
How dare you block my path?

779
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,930
Move aside this instant!

780
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,330
Do you mean to kill me now?

781
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,740
- Go ahead and try. 
 - Kill you?

782
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,580
I am trying to protect Your Highness.

783
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:22,950
Those two are our opponents who threaten Your Highness and Royal Consort Gyeongbin.

784
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:28,230
I shall gather all the men of the Prohibition Bureau to wipe out Nam Young, Kang Ro Seo, and their gang.

785
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:31,610
Your Highness, stay put here and...

786
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:35,670
quietly watch those two die out.

787
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:37,680
Uncle!

788
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,650
My Lady.

789
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:50,830
What do you plan to do now?

790
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,410
We must prepare for war.

791
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,960
War?

792
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,170
We confiscated the enemy’s goods,

793
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,890
and now the real fight begins.

794
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,970

795
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:22,870
♫  Fly up to the higher ground  ♫

796
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,610
♫  Fly across that clear blue sky  ♫

797
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:32,600
♫  With you in my arms  ♫

798
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,720
♫  I wanna shooting for love  ♫

799
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,130

800
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:41,730
 What is the alcohol ban anyway?

801
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:45,270
 Is that something so important that the people must lose their lives over it?

802
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:50,140
 A scholar's arrow protects people, not harm them.

803
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:53,110
 I will steal Your Highness's heart.

804
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,790
 Just you wait.

805
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:57,240
 You will not even realize when I do so.

806
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,010
 What are you hoping to gain with this?

807
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,400
 The same thing as you.

808
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,780
 Freedom.

809
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:06,060
 I shall find another place to live and leave as soon as poissible.

810
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:10,470
 Let us end our bad relationship here.

811
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,550
 Poor Young Tenant.

812
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,990
 Your future does not look so bright.
