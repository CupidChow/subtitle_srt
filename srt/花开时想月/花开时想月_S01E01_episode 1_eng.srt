1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,670

2
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,560
Please taste it.

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,760
I can't believe he pays this much money for alcohol.

4
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,100
He's out of his mind.

5
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,120
That's why we're making tons of money.

6
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,470
Hey.

7
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,940
Of course, I'm out of my mind.

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,900
We've been under prohibition for more than ten years.

9
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,120

10
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,670

11
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,050
Go to the servants' quarters and eat before you go.

12
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,060
Yes, ma'am.

13
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,450
I hear she's a noble.

14
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,230
So what if she is?

15
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,780
It seems there is no difference between us servants and a lady working as a day laborer.

16
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,760
Gosh, the fertilizer stench.

17
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,890
You said you'd pay me 20 poon* if I find your ring.
(Equivalent to pennies)

18
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,320
You cannot change your mind later.

19
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,220
I'll pay you 20 poon if you find it,

20
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,230
but I cannot give you a penny if you do not find it.

21
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,110
That's why I'm saying I'll have to find it.

22
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,870
How can she find a ring that you lost last autumn?

23
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,880
She won't be able to find it. That's why I told her I'd pay her 20 poon.

24
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,790
Do you think I'm crazy? To pay her that much?

25
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,630
They say a noble is just full of crap if they don't have any money!

26
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,460
That's what this is!

27
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,920
Gosh, the stench! The poop stench!

28
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,410
Gosh, where is this poop stench coming from?

29
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,390
Aigoo! Don't come closer!

30
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,200
Give it to me. That 20 poon.

31
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,220
You're short five poon.

32
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,260
That's all I have, my lady.

33
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,670
I'm telling the truth.

34
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,640
Then...

35
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,050
you should pay me with something else.

36
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,570
Aigoo...

37
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,300
Try digging the ground and see if you could find 20 poon.

38
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
 Thank you for the food.

39
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,360
You'll be taking your exam in humanities. Why did you bring your arrow and arrow?

40
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,690
So cumbersome.

41
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,770
There are tons of bandits during this time of poverty.

42
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,450
The bandits aren't the problem right now.

43
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,790
They say Hanyang* is a place where they even steal your undergarments if you say you're from the countryside.
(Capital city, modern-day Seoul)

44
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,590
Why do you think they say you get your nose cut off even with your eyes wide open?

45
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,540
If you glare your eyes open, you will never get your nose cut off.

46
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,270
My goodness. I'm just saying that's what I hear.

47
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,590
Oh? Young Master!

48
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,900
We're here!

49
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,710
It's Hanyang! Hanyang!

50
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,290
Aigoo, what a sight to behold!

51
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,940
What a sight!

52
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,560
It's Hanyang! Hanyang!

53
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,890
It's Hanyang! Hanyang!

54
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,040
Whoa...

55
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,500
Close your mouth.

56
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,260
Must you let others know that we're from the countryside?

57
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,030
I've only heard that Hanyang is a big city.

58
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm totally dazzled by it now that I see it in person.

59
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,560
Come on now. Let us pass. It's a narrow path.

60
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,540
Young Master.

61
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,830
Since we're here, how about some Mapo seolleongtang?

62
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,700
Sure. Why not.

63
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,000
- Choon Gae!
- Yes? What's wrong?

64
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,870
What's wrong with your knapsack?

65
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,360
My money!

66
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,850
They took all my travel money!

67
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,310
My gosh...

68
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:44,420
 Let us pass. It's a narrow path.

69
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,400
- It's a pickpocket.
- Pickpocket...

70
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,330
Gosh, this is nuts!

71
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,850
I'll go this way!

72
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,950
Aigoo...

73
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,910
It's quite hefty.

74
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,240
All right. Let's see...

75
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,150
What's this?

76
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,010
You punks...

77
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,430
Hey, run!

78
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,810
You guys!

79
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,770
Do you know what this money is for?

80
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,060
Will you guys be accountable if the Young Master fails the exam?

81
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,660
My Young Master ranked first in Chungcheong Province!

82
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Oh, here it is.

83
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Huh? Young Master!

84
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,200
Young Master! Over here!

85
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,040
Move!

86
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,730
Move, move!

87
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,900
Over here!

88
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,480
Young Master!

89
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,800
Run!

90
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, my God!

91
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,910
Move!

92
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,290
- You missed.
- I didn't miss him.

93
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,280
A scholar's arrow is meant to protect people, not to hurt them.

94
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,890
I think you hurt him a little.

95
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,170
Oh, my. Wow...

96
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,440
Aigoo. You brought that tiger figurine to Hanyang?

97
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,840
Well, I just happened to bring it somehow.

98
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,540
You still don't have a hard time falling asleep without that, do you?

99
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,070
What are you saying...

100
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,220
That's from such a long time ago!

101
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,670
Eh? Don't you remember?

102
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:04,260
- You were saying that tiger saved you and allâ€“
- I don't remember it at all.

103
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,380
How dare you sneak away...

104
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,760
Bigger, bigger!

105
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,500
Hot!

106
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,600
Buy some rice!

107
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,500
Buy some barley!

108
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,130
Buy some rice!

109
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,060
Buy some beans!

110
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,140
Here. I have barley, too.

111
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,970
Buy some rice!

112
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,100
Buy some beans!

113
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,220
You're a new face around here...

114
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,830
Who gave you permission to sell your goods here?

115
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,160
This is the first time I hear that I need permission to be a street vendor.

116
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,490
This Chilpae market may look like a big mess

117
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,670
but there is a semblance of order because we manage this place.

118
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,200
- If you set up to sell, it'll cost you a half nyang.
- A half nyang?

119
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,790
That's highway robbery.

120
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,290
This... why do you have this over yourself?

121
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,880
What are you doing?

122
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,740
Don't you know that you'll be taken to the Investigation Bureau if you taunt a noblewoman?

123
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,260
Oh, my...

124
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,650
Oh, you were a young lady from a noble family?

125
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,900
Gosh, I had no idea...

126
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,650
But you still can't go home in one piece if you don't pay

127
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,810
for your spot even if you're nobility.

128
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,970
If you can't go home in one piece...

129
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,670
What do you think would happen, huh?

130
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,410
This, this. This right here...

131
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,870
You... what the...

132
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,800
Let go of this. You won't? You won't, huh?

133
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,030
Let go of this. Come on. You won't?

134
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,470
Let go!

135
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,390
Are you okay, Hyungnim?

136
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,120
If you don't want your nose cut, keep your eyes open wide.

137
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,480
Yes, sir.

138
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,860
Aigoo!

139
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,070
They're already cutting someone's nose off while eyes are wide open over there.

140
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,950
What is the matter with this city Hanyang...

141
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,300
with pickpockets and ruffians...

142
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,480
Choon Gae, hurry up and bring an officer.

143
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,870
Okay!

144
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,820
You lowly peasants...

145
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,820
I guess you expected to be treated as nobility while sitting on a market street selling.

146
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,100
This is how we keep order around here.

147
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,990
Let go of this!

148
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,000
What?

149
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,420
Let go...

150
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,270
Let go of this. Come on!

151
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,090
Let go!

152
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,180
Let go...

153
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,280
Let go of that hand!

154
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,560
Let go.

155
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,530
He says to let go! Let go! Let go!

156
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,620
Let go! Let go of this!

157
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,770
Let go!

158
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,460
She let go.

159
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,030
Why are you creating such a ruckus in broad daylight in front of all these people?

160
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,030
What's he saying?

161
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,910
We're making a fair trade here.

162
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,020
A half nyang to set up to sell.

163
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,760
Is it that hard? Huh?

164
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,990
Geez, it's not even a half nyang...

165
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,630
Geez!

166
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,620
Let's go.

167
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,220
What are you doing?

168
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,190
There are only two ways to handle it when a woman is mocked.

169
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,610
Either you hang your head or cut someone else's head.

170
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,770
I'm choosing the latter.

171
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,120
A scholar's arrow is not meant to hurt people.

172
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,240
Geez, that scared me.

173
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,270
Now, now, all right, all right...

174
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,240
I'm being very easy on you, my lady.

175
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,370
Let's go.

176
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,900
Where do you think you're going?

177
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,580
Give me that pouch.

178
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,160
What a hassle he's being...

179
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,290
Do you even know what I had to do to earn this money?

180
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,200
Hey! Give me back my money!

181
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,040
What in the world!

182
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,700
Let go of me. Come on...

183
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,870
- Let go!
- Give it back!

184
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,110
What are you doing? Let go of that!

185
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,780
Both of you, let go of me!

186
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,600
How could a woman be so ferocious?

187
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,260
Everyone is watching us. Are you not embarrassed?

188
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,410
What are you doing? Take the pouch from him!

189
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,680
What are you doing? Get her off of me!

190
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,120
Don't pull, no, no...

191
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,270
No, no, no, no...

192
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,690
No, no, no...

193
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,420
Don't pull, don't pull...

194
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,270
H-h-hyungnim...

195
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,630
Hyungnim!

196
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,880
What?

197
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,760
Hyungnim, your hair...

198
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,370
What?

199
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,410
What about my hair?

200
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,990
My hair...

201
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,480
While you're at it,

202
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,320
take this, too!

203
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,500
It took so much for me to grow this hair...

204
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,070
No!

205
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,120

(Ministry of Health and Welfare)

206
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,230
Follow me quietly.

207
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,400
Act natural.

208
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,690
Act natural...

209
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,520
My gosh!

210
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,010
Whom did you fight with this time?

211
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo...

212
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,560
How many times is this?

213
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,640
The whole world looks down on me.

214
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,990
I do get into fights if I get pissed off.

215
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,410
How could I hold it all in?

216
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,710
You have no money or connections.

217
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,050
What else could you do besides holding it in?

218
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,490
That's how you bet beat up while involved in a fight.

219
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,560
There are tons of patients like that here in Hyeminseo.

220
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,060
Cocky punks who were beaten to a pulp.

221
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,050
Get beaten to death or die from frustration. Same difference.

222
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,180
 A scholar's arrow is not meant to hurt people.

223
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,030
They say you end up hating the one stopping the fight rather than the one you're fighting.

224
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,000
Huh?

225
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,200
It's nothing.

226
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,320
I'll wash these clean and bring them back.

227
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,250
My Lady, how much longer will you live doing other people's laundry?

228
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,830
Hurry up and get married even as someone's second wife.

229
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,610
Who would take a woman like me, who has no weaving or sewing skills?

230
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,630
Then will you support your older brother for the rest of your life and die?

231
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,410
 The sky is dark

232
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,640
 and the earth is yellow.

233
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,300
 The universe is...

234
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,100
 The sky is dark

235
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,510
 and the earth is yellow.

236
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,950
 The sky is dark

237
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,720
 and the earth is yellow.

238
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,120
 The universe is vast and rough.

239
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,630
Brother, I'm home!

240
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,800
 While you're at it, take this, too.

241
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,720
 Give back my money!

242
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,820
Aigoo!

243
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,600
Gosh...

244
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,970
Oh, my world. My goodness...

245
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,070
How could there be such a ferocious woman?

246
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,380
How...

247
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,317
How couldâ€“

248
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,460
Receive His Majesty!

249
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,560
Sit!

250
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,990
 Depending on which level I rank in this examination,

251
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,110
 it will decide whether I can become a cabinet member or remain a mere civil servant down the road.

252
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,350
 I must rank in top three.

253
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,180
 Attention!

254
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,840

255
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,600
 The prohibition has been in place for almost ten years.

256
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,210
 But the people will not stop selling alcohol and drinking.

257
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,490
 How can I stop the sales of alcohol?

258
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,650
 Discuss the strategy to do so.

259
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,520
 The four pillars of a nation are Yeh, Eui, Yum, Chi.

260
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,730
 Reverence, loyalty, integrity, shame.

261
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,550
 If one of these qualities fails, the nation is in decline.

262
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,450
 If two of these qualities fail, the nation is in crisis.

263
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,970
 If all four fail, the nation has fallen.

264
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,780
Geez!

265
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,720
Gosh...

266
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,360
That...

267
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,780
Gosh, thanksâ€“

268
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,370
Young Hoon.

269
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,390
The examination is taking place in the palace as we speak.

270
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,630
Since I see you here in school, I guess you failed again.

271
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,930
Well...

272
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,670
But then why have I not seen you around lately?

273
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,840
Did you give up on the state examination already?

274
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,360
Come on now. No wonder you continue to fail the examination.

275
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,770
I have already finished preparing for the next exam.

276
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,470
Finished preparing?

277
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,640
 Oh, yeah!

278
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,050
 Yes!

279
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,290
 Okay, let's go!

280
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,630
Darn it!

281
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,230
Hae Soo, wait!

282
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,050
- Wait.
- No...

283
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,350
Wait a minute!

284
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,030
Hear me out.

285
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,690
Rich guys buy off an archer, broker, even an exam proctor.

286
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,850
How could we possibly pass just because we memorize our books?

287
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,290
The problem is money.

288
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,750
With 50 nyang, they will even switch our answer sheets.

289
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,170
But...

290
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,660
But still, this is wrong.

291
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,040
You must pass the examination as soon as possible

292
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,500
so you can have a wife and marry off your younger sister.

293
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,360
Do you not pity your sister who works all day long?

294
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,210
 Without conviction, there is no justification.

295
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,820
 If done in doubt, there is no merit.

296
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,760
 Do not leave any vagueness or doubt concerning prohibition

297
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,470
 and lead the people on the righteous path with a strict rule of law.

298
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,120

They are measures submitted by the top three examiners with the highest scores in Humanities.

299
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,960

300
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,090
The first place Jo Ji Soo.

301
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,030

Isn't he your grandson, Left State Minister?

302
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,190

Thanks be to your graciousness, Your Majesty.

303
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,530
The second and third places are your grandsons, Right State Minister.

304
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,940
They say the children of prestigious families are different from birth.

305
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:25,850
So many intellectuals are coming out of your families, Chief and Left State Ministers.

306
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,990

Do you not think so, Chief Royal Secretary?

307
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,760

308
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,040

These are military men who passed the military service examination.

309
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,550
How could a person always win first place?

310
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,830
Sangwonsi, Jinsasi, Hyangsi, Huisi*.
(Different types of examinations)

311
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,660
You won first place in all of them.

312
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,640
It's okay to place fourth at least once. Humanly speaking.

313
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,510
Did I complain?

314
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,400
Go ahead and eat.

315
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,860
Well, in my opinion...

316
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,200
whether it's the first place or not, except for you,

317
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,310
all the rest of them have surnames Yeon, Jo, or Han.

318
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:20,390
Amidst of them, you ranked in fourth place so proudly!

319
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,220
Isn't that a great thing? Don't you think?

320
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,660
Right.

321
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,920
I got it. I'm fine. So enough.

322
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,120
- Go ahead and eat.
- Okay.

323
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,820
But you know!

324
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,600
Although you were in fourth place, no law says that you can't be a cabinet member.

325
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:43,440
They all say people who rank below third place won't hold any power.

326
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,110
But I'm sure people who say such a thing aren't even close to being in fourth place!

327
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,910
Fourth place, fourth place, fourth place!

328
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,130
Could you stop saying "fourth place"?

329
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,890
I said I'm fine!

330
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,200
I said...

331
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,500
I said...

332
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,390
I'm fine. All right?

333
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,940
Well...

334
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,100
- it just upsets me, you know.
- I know...

335
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,880
If only Nam family had some influence...

336
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,910
our Young Master would've won first placeâ€“

337
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,780
Fine.

338
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,320
You can blame me.

339
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,170
But do not blame my father or the family.

340
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:26,250
How much land did the family sell in order to support my state examination?

341
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,590
Yes.

342
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,950
I misspoke.

343
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,230
Let's just eat.

344
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,380
- It will get cold.
- Yes.

345
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,100
First place in Humanities!

346
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,420
Surname Jo, Ji Soo!

347
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,830
Second place!

348
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,640
Surname Yeon, Choong Sun!

349
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,920
Third place!

350
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,730
Surname Yeon, Chae Gyo!

351
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,410
The fourth-place!

352
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,790
Surname Nam, Young!

353
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,880
Accept a drink from His Majesty!

354
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,460
 Am I the only one who thinks this is strange?

355
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,960
Why do you not drink it?

356
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,400
I cannot drink this, Your Majesty.

357
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,150
Are you saying you will deny the drink I gave you?

358
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,650
Please forgive me for saying this, but...

359
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,790
the examination is not over yet, is it not?

360
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,050
What did you say?

361
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,930
The examination is not over?

362
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,050
Tell me the reason you thought that.

363
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,700
If your answer is not reasonable, I will punish you for profanity.

364
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,630
Yesterday's examination was about strengthening the prohibition.

365
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,250
However, if I were to drink today,

366
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,740
I would be disloyal to you by displaying actions that are different from my words.

367
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,840
Your Majesty, in order to test my loyalty to you,

368
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,250
is it not why you offered a drink?

369
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,150
By filling up the royal court with all the Jo and Yeon family members,

370
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,550
they mean to squeeze my throat.

371
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,960

372
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,770
Is it not what you expected already?

373
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,220
You have dug up a levee.

374
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,990
I plead you to wait for the frogs to jump in by themselves.

375
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,310
Truly...

376
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:10,220
if your words are ahead of your actions,

377
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,400
that is the same as submitting lies only to pass the examination.

378
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,820
 We deserve to die!

379
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,760
 We deserve to die!

380
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,980
Left State Minister.

381
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,840
How should I punish those who wrote down deceitful strategies?

382
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,010
Would you like to tell me, Chief State Minister?

383
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,750
What are your thoughts, Chief Royal Secretary?

384
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,920
In my opinion, I believe only one person in this state examination

385
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,010
deserves to wear an Eosahwa.*
(A paper flower given by the king who passes the exam)

386
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,460
What you say is correct, Chief Royal Secretary.

387
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,850
Take away the passage of the exam by those whose glasses are empty.

388
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,080
Announce the new first-place winner.

389
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,340
He is the only one who passes the state examination.

390
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,820
Your grace is boundless, Your Majesty!

391
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,590
 Your grace is boundless, Your Majesty!

392
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,840
First place in Humanities!

393
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,930
Surname Nam, Young!

394
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,120
"Finally, I gained...

395
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,240
a subject who knows what my will is!"

396
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,820
Bull's eye!

397
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,400
Bull's eye!

398
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,390
What kind of crazy nut refused to drink a drink from the king?

399
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,260
He looked perfectly fine.

400
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,670
He is very handsome, too...

401
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,860
Handsome?

402
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,840
Yes. Oh, my...

403
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,500
He was a crazy guy. A crazy nut.

404
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,980
No matter how handsome he may be,

405
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,770
no way would he compare to your good looks, Crown Prince?

406
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,930
And?

407
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,900
So, the King threw away all the alcohol that was left over at Saonseo.*
(Office in charge of alcoholic beverages used in the royal court)

408
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,680
- Is that what you are saying?
- Yes, Your Highness.

409
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,560
Without even a drop left, they poured everything down...

410
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,900
Royal Consort Gyeongbin.

411
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,140
What brings you out all the way here, Mother?

412
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,800
I heard that you were not feeling well from a cold.

413
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,830
I thought you were bedridden, not able to come for morning greetings.

414
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,680
You seem...

415
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,380
extremely healthy, Crown Prince.

416
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,420
That makes me sad, Mother.

417
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,900
I was concerned that I might pass on my cold to you, Mother.

418
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,660
Yet you do not know my filial heart.

419
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:14,310
Gosh, why do you not care for the heart of your mother, who bore you after carrying you

420
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,800
for ten months in my womb?

421
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,020
Here.

422
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,640
Since you got to see my face,

423
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,210
are you happy now?

424
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,200
Huh? Wait...

425
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,980
Crown-Crown Prince?

426
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,070
I'm not done speaking.

427
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,170
Crown Prince! Crown-Crown Prince!

428
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,760
Geez, that punk...

429
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,940
Crown Prince...

430
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,960
Your Highness...

431
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,380
Get ready.

432
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,450
You truly cannot go this time.

433
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,510
They found out that you left the palace last time

434
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,610
and they slashed my two months' pay. It's only been about a month.

435
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm doing everything I can to purchase a house inside the capital.

436
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,950
Do you not have pity on me?

437
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,600
Who do you think could build a pillar in that house of yours?

438
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,840

439
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,500
You have a 100-nyang debt?

440
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,100
If I had 50 nyang, he said he'd made sure I pass the Byeolsi*.
(Type of exam)

441
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,270
I deserve to die, Ro Seo!

442
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:36,060
With 100 nyang, we could purchase this house we are renting.

443
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,490
Even if we took out the deposit in this house, it wouldn't be 100 nyang!

444
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,520
I will take care of this somehow. Somehow.

445
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
How?

446
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,010
It says just the interest is 20 nyang a month.

447
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,370
If you don't pay the interest, they said they'd cut off your finger one at a time.

448
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,740
Without your fingers, I guess you can't take the state examination.

449
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,300
Gosh, I really wasn't going to do it, but...

450
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,910

he kept saying I had potential and that I just needed to try a bit more.

451
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,830
Who is Gye Sang Mok?

452
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,370
He's at a gambling house in Nambu...

453
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,440
Where are you going? Ro Seo!

454
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,730
Ro Seo!

455
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:13,550
If we can't die, we must at least beg him to let us live!

456
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,970
Move out of the way!

457
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,160
He took first place in the state examination!

458
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,450
He's not even married. He's still unmarried!

459
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,510
He took first place in the state examination!

460
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,280
How much did you spend on this procession?

461
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,080
The money isn't the problem here.

462
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,770
The king failed all the grandsons from all those aristocrats

463
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,740
and placed you in the winning spot, Young Master.

464
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,580
We should at least do this much so they don't call us country bumpkins.

465
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,290
You just sit comfortably on this beautiful horse, Young Master.

466
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:04,510
It's a valuable horse that cost 80 nyang for the deposit.

467
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,350
Eighty nyang? This horse?

468
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,960
Aigoo, don't you worry.

469
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,190
As long as I return the horse, I will get the money right back.

470
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,140
He's the first place!

471
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,210
A 20-year-old bachelor placed first in the state examination!

472
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,480
He says the first place in the state exam is unmarried.

473
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,120
I wondered what kind of first place. It looks like he's got a winning face!

474
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,560
Choon Gae, let's take it easy and just go.

475
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,100
He took first place in the state examination!

476
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,840
Darn it...

477
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,370
Is Gye Sang Mok in?

478
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,320
- Who are you?
- Just answer me.

479
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,770
Is Gye Sang Mok in or not?

480
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,650
- Here he is.
- How many times...

481
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,090
How many times must I tell you?

482
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,630
It's not 'Ssang Mo.'

483
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,890
Sang, Sang...

484
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,220
You a**hole!

485
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,880
Hey.

486
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,840
Open your mouth.

487
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,170
I pulled out teeth from jerks who call me "Ssang Mok."

488
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:31,040
Without teeth,

489
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,800
Ssa, Sa...

490
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,240
Ssa... you can't say that.

491
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,210
Upper teeth? Or lower teeth?

492
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,410
You'd better watch your back.

493
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:42,310
Next time I see you, I'll make sure your head and body separate.

494
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,120
Hyungnim!

495
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,320
Hyungnim!

496
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,000
Hyungnim!

497
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,920
It's time to go and collect.

498
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,060
Wow! You got lucky.

499
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,960
You almost got all your front teeth pulled out.

500
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,220
Get lost!

501
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,970
Get lost.

502
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,940
Hyungnim, what will you do about your hair?

503
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,410
Shut up.

504
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,070
That despicable noble girl. Just wait until I see her again.

505
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,140
I'll yank all her hair out.

506
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,360
Let's go.

507
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
- Let's earn 100 nyang!
- Let's go!

508
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,650
Earn 100 nyang?

509
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,030
Is the moonlight daisy blooming?

510
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,770
The full moon is up as well.

511
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,500
Bury the flower, and just pour the moon for me.

512
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,820
Is the moonlight daisy blooming?

513
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,550
The full moon is up as well.

514
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,060
Bury the flower, and just pour the moon for me.

515
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,460
 - Wow, wow...
- Hey!

516
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,610
 Let me have more of that!

517
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,060
 You can't do that...

518
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,070
That will take forever.

519
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,250
Just pour the entire jarful.

520
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,390
 - Yes, sir! 
- Pour it.

521
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,490
All right!

522
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,250
Hey, hey, hey.

523
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,490
Look at that. What the...

524
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,270
Do it right!

525
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,980
Don't you want to go home?

526
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,140
Let's go!

527
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,780
Hey, come on!

528
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,960
Cheongju? Takju?

529
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,900
Soju?

530
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,300
Twenty poon.

531
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,770
Twenty poon for a glass of cheongju?

532
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,790
What highway robbery. I'll return all this.

533
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,570
What?

534
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,180
I'll buy...

535
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,250
that drink.

536
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,500
Take it.

537
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,390
Get me a bottle for me.

538
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,150
Yes, yes, of course.

539
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,430
Please wait just a moment.

540
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,810
Thank you.

541
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,750
No need to thank me.

542
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,150
Have some.

543
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,660
Gosh, this is an alcoholic drink?

544
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,400
Goodness, it smells like a rag.

545
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,450
You must know the taste of a drink.

546
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:24,160
All the alcoholic drinks in Hanyang became this cheap stuff a long time ago.

547
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:30,090
It's 20 poon for a glass. How can you say it's cheap?

548
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,110
Please enjoy.

549
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,660
The value of an object is determined by the circumstances around it.

550
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,340
With a changed circumstance, a person

551
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,820
could become suddenly valuable.

552
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,720
Or suddenly become lowly.

553
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,300
I'm telling you Gyeongbin poisoned him!

554
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,780
The poison was discovered in Lady Um's residence. The case was closed.

555
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,810
No, no.

556
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,770
Think about it.

557
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,650
A newly appointed young concubine.

558
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,570
Why would she poison a crown prince? For what benefit?

559
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,550
The story does not make sense.

560
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,000
How about the Right State Minister?

561
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,920
Everyone knows that Crown Prince Sunghyun and the Right State Minister had bad blood.

562
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,820
Look. Look at you. Think about it!

563
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,740
Who benefitted most when Crown Prince Sunghyun died?

564
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,090
It's Royal Consort Gyeongbin.

565
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,880
She became the mother of a crown prince when she was a lowly maid.

566
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,070
She made her older brother the chief royal secretary.

567
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,350
The young concubine who was a thorn on her side...

568
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,150
Now, when it comes to things like this,

569
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,000
the person who benefitted the most is the culprit.

570
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,190
Yeah...

571
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,100
The culprit.

572
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,630
Poor deceased Crown Prince Sunghyun...

573
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,670
I heard he loved his younger brother so much.

574
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,790
How could he have known that his younger brother would take over his position?

575
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,750
You just never know...

576
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,310
All right. Come over here and pour me a drink.

577
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,760
Let go of this!

578
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,120
How dare you hold a woman's hand!

579
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,190
You're just a girl in an illegal distillery. How dare you refuse?

580
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,400
Hey, come hereâ€“

581
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,670
If you mix your drinks, your mind will be in danger.

582
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,420
And if you make up false stories,

583
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,200
your life will be in danger.

584
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,620
How dare youâ€“

585
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,400
Look, are you all right?

586
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,880
If you want to drink, you should drink nicely.

587
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,590
Why do you hit a man?

588
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,860
How can I get drunk nicely when it tastes like this?

589
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,310
You want me to punch you, too?

590
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,620
What a crazy nut.

591
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,820
Look.

592
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,040
Are you all right?

593
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,780
Yes... Who are you...

594
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,300
Sir!

595
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,870
Aigoo...

596
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,980
A traveler!

597
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,760
It's a traveler!

598
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,830
It's a traveler!

599
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,200
It's a traveler!

600
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,880
 Let's go! A traveler!

601
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,310
This won't be good...

602
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,740
 Let's run!

603
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,110
This way!

604
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,510
Go out this way!

605
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,420
Hurry up!

606
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,960
This way! Leave this way!

607
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,000
 Open up!

608
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,510
 We'll break it down if you don't open it now!

609
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,660
Break it down.

610
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,580
D*** it!

611
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,870
- A traveler is here.
 - What?

612
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,180
Run with the money bag!

613
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,420
Run!

614
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,680
Hurry up!

615
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,940
Hurry up and come out!

616
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,920
Hurry!

617
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,710
Get them!

618
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,580
Run!

619
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,550
Run toward lots of people when you're running away.

620
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,740
First place in the state examination!

621
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,530
An unmarried young man

622
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,670
placed first in the state examination!

623
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,820
Stop right there!

624
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,030
Oh, no!

625
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,920
What in the world is going on there?

626
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,780
Aigoo, Young Master!

627
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,410
There will be huge trouble.

628
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,790
Choon Gae, tell people to step away!

629
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:40,860
Step aside!

630
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,120
Step aside! It's dangerous! Move!

631
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,260
Move, hurry!

632
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,840
Move!

633
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,610
Move! It's dangerous!

634
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,770
Wh-wh-what?

635
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,300
Get down. Let me borrow your horse.

636
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,280
Come now. What in the world are you up to!

637
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,450
I will repay you double later.

638
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,190
Look how insolent you are!

639
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:30,990
Did you just hit me?

640
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,400
How dare you jump into a procession and try to steal a horse?

641
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,720
You arrogant punk.

642
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,310
You... you... come here, you...

643
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,180
How dare you!

644
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,270
Geez!

645
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,960
- Step back!
- Did he use his foot?

646
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,740
Did you just kick me?

647
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,190
I have no time to argue with you.

648
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,130
Get down while I'm being nice.

649
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,790
Look over here! Here is a horse thief!

650
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,540
Over here! A horse thief is here!

651
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,230
A horse thief! Over here! Here!

652
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,250
Hey, first place.

653
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,200
Arrogant bastard.

654
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,160
Know that you're the culprit in what happened today.

655
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,180
- Ha!
- Oh? No!

656
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,060
No!

657
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,790
No, my 80 nyang!

658
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,480
Look over here! A horse thief!

659
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,290
Hurry over! Come!

660
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,820
- Chase him!
- Over here! This way!

661
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,460
A horse thief over there!

662
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,720
Hurry, hurry!

663
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,700
Hurry!

664
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,180
Young Master!

665
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,950
- Young Master!
- Hey, Choon Gae...

666
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,320
The horse thief!

667
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,300
Eosahwa... the horse thief...

668
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,520
Gosh...

669
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,540
Maiden, I see that you keep getting tangled in unpleasant incidents.

670
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,000
I don't know if you get tangled in it or are causing it.

671
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,640
Let go of this.

672
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,700
By chance, are you on the same side as that horse thief?

673
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,000
Answer me.

674
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,790
Depending on your answer, we can head over to a government office.

675
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,950
I said, let go of me!

676
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:38,090
Unlike your appearance, it seems you're a noble.

677
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,370
Should you not watch out how you behave?

678
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:42,970
If you do not guard your body and hang around bad friends,

679
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,730
you will dirty your body!

680
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,080
Dirty?

681
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:51,400
Did you just say I am dirty?

682
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,820
I didn't mean you're dirty. You could get something dirtyâ€“

683
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,690
That's right! I am dirty!

684
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,310
I even touch poop for a few coins.

685
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,080
Noble? Behavior?

686
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,600
Do those things feed me?

687
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,460
If I behave, does it pay off my 100 nyang debt automatically?

688
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,090
- What I mean isâ€“
- If a person starves for three days,

689
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:10,090
there is nothing you won't do for a bowl of rice.

690
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,510
When cornered, even a mouse could bite a tiger.

691
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,630
- You mean, a cat...
- If you were born well and lived in luxury,

692
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,150
do not meddle in someone else business.

693
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,990
Hey...

694
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,910
Are you going to let her leave like that?

695
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,420
Never mind.

696
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,450
What good would come of getting involved with such a ferocious and wicked woman?

697
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,090
Brother.

698
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,870
Ro Seo...

699
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,010
My gosh...

700
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,820
What happened here?

701
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,920
If I don't pay 20 nyang of interest every month,

702
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,550
they will do this to us every day.

703
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:27,610
Where would I get 20 nyang out of nowhere?

704
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:38,570
Did he go underground or fly to the sky?

705
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,390
Where did that d*** horse thief go that

706
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:44,220
we can't find him anywhere all day?

707
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:50,860
A person cannot go underground nor go up into the sky.

708
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,550
Golden ornament suited for a higher-ranking official.

709
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:04,300
He surely must be from an extraordinarily high and mighty family.

710
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,080
If he is in Hanyang,

711
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,890
I'm sure I'll meet him again someday.

712
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:35,310
I heard that the Crown Prince did not attend the royal lecture once again.

713
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,050
He did not feel well due to a cold, so at Jinsudang*...
(Lecture hall)

714
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:42,140
Someone with a cold is shooting arrows and is playing around?

715
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,360
If a king is too young and does not know how to hide his flaws,

716
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,480
he will only be prey to the old and powerful subjects.

717
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:58,640
Crown Prince cannot even get close to measuring up to Sunghyun.

718
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,440
It is all my fault to blame.

719
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:06,790
Distinguished council members must be up in arms over failing scholars during the state exam.

720
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,210
What do you think of sending some meat and silk to console them?

721
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:15,720
How about displaying the king's solemnity at a time like this?

722
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,500
More people are secretly making alcohol and drinking it, ignoring the prohibition.

723
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:24,940
Please be even more strict on prohibition.

724
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,920
If you prohibit them in small things,

725
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,070
they will not be able to greed after big things.

726
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,070
 They say a noble is just full of crap if they don't have any money!

727
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,500
 That's what this is!

728
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,870
 I guess you expected to be treated as nobility while sitting on a market street selling.

729
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,660
 Unlike your appearance, it seems you're a noble.

730
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,930
 Should you not watch out how you behave?

731
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,540
 If you do not guard your body and hang around bad friends,

732
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,000
 you will dirty your body!

733
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,590
 If I don't pay 20 nyang of interest every month,

734
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,950
 they will do this to us every day.

735
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,250
The rice you use to make alcohol

736
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,300
must be washed 100 times.

737
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,380
A hundred times?

738
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,360
- That's right.
 - This drink will be offered to our ancestors.

739
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,560
 You must give all your devotion.

740
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,960
 Once you learn to give devotion to making alcohol,

741
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,550
 you will learn the value of a glass of wine.

742
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,520

743
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,100
Put your ear next to the jar.

744
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,750
I hear the sound of raindrops falling off the eaves.

745
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,620
The alcohol is boiling.

746
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,970
But it's not being boiled on fire.

747
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:26,570
How does it boil on its own?

748
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:33,450
In this world, some things happen naturally without being forced.

749
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:37,740
Just like how you become prettier by the day, my Ro Seo.

750
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:43,810

751
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:47,810
 When it stops making this sound, let us filter the drink.

752
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,200

753
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:38,730

754
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,890
Making alcohol wastes too much rice.

755
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:48,020
So I have ordered prohibition in order to prevent that from happening.

756
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:52,880
But that custom has not been rectified yet.

757
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,210

Therefore, we will expand the Prohibition Bureau

758
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,900
 and show strict command regarding the prohibition.

759
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:04,400

To make up for the staff needed for the crackdown will be hired

760
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,920

in order to rectify the law of the land

761
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,820

and do everything possible to straighten out our people.

762
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,090

763
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,240
You will pass if you have this tile.

764
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,690
If not, mong.

765
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:17,840
 Mong?

766
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,970
 What's mong?

767
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,640
What does "mong" mean?

768
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,480
Mondangyi*!
(A bat)

769
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,530
Catch all of them!

770
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,760
 From now on, not only for buying and selling alcohol,

771
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,730
 using alcohol for weddings and ancestral rites will be strictly prohibited.

772
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,130
 If anyone is caught making alcohol, they will be exiled to an island.

773
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,400
 If one purchases alcohol and drinks it, they will become slaves in small villages.

774
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:31,960
 If one is a scholar,

775
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,050
 your name will be deleted from the Cheongeuman* and sent to exile faraway. 
(One of the directories of Confucius scholars)

776
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,220
 If you are middle class citizens or West factions,

777
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,680
 they shall serve in the navy indefinitely.

778
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,060
 P-please come in.

779
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:20,600
Although this is a southern part of the village, it's not a bad neighborhood.

780
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,010
If you walk fast, you'll reach Yukjo Street in an hour.

781
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,490
A brother and sister live here. They're nobles.

782
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:31,130
That's a perfect fit.

783
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:34,970
Is anyone home?

784
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:39,850
So the landlord has a tenant in the back room?

785
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:40,930
Yes.

786
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,990
The landlord said he would bring over the tenant today.

787
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,460
He will get 20 nyang for us.

788
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,460
Young Master! My Lady!

789
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,950
They must not be in.

790
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,830
Well, this is the room.

791
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,180
Would you like to open the door and see?

792
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,850
Ro Seo!

793
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,870

794
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,500
My Lady.

795
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,340
The pouch...

796
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,350
Maiden?

797
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:16,520
First place?

798
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:53,490
â™«  Even when I'm all right, when a night like tonight is here  â™«

799
01:08:53,490 --> 01:09:01,640
â™«  I remember the tear you held back  â™«

800
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:09,480
â™«  Lean on my embrace, and you can rest now  â™«

801
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,300

802
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,890
 You are an inspector?

803
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:15,480
 Why does he have to be an inspector?

804
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,210
 - What is this smell?
- Step aside!

805
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:19,120
 What are you touching?

806
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,390
 What are you doing?

807
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,600
 Find another room to rent as soon as possible.

808
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,890
 Considering how handsome I am, it's not so strange.

809
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:26,880
 Steal? I did not steal!

810
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,490
 Did you see that, my lady? She hid the hairpin in her basket.

811
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:30,580
 What's wrong?

812
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,890
 It seems as though you have seen me before.

813
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:34,130
 Crack down on prohibition.

814
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:36,020
 It's perfect for you. You love prohibition.

815
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,780
 I didn't like him from the beginning. He was annoying, to begin with.

816
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,610
 My Lady, we're screwed. Let's run!

817
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,440
 Don't think about running away. I'm an inspector.

818
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,740
â™«  Even when I'm all right  â™«
