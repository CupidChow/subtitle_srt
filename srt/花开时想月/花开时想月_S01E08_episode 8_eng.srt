1
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,720

2
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,900
Police Chief?

3
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,670
The Police Chief was already taken to the Office of Inspector General.

4
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,070
The Police Chief made meticulous records related to money.

5
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,540
I thought this would make it easy...

6
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,870
to find the person who requested him to conceal the mokbingo incident.

7
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,880
But I won't even have to go through the trouble.

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,140
Now that you came on your own will.

9
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,410
It was you.

10
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,220
You killed Song Gang San and attacked the blacksmith's workshop.

11
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,300
The true owner of the mokbingo.

12
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,830
Ten years ago!

13
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,680
Were you also at...

14
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,530
Mangwolsa Temple?

15
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,140
I don't know what you heard and from whom.

16
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,220
You'll have to go with me, Inspector.

17
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,440
Grab him.

18
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,990
Move. I asked him to go together.

19
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,950
Why are you so late?

20
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,160
I almost died by a sword while stalling time.

21
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,520
Do you think it was easy calling on someone who had left office?

22
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,010
There is nowhere else to run.

23
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,380
Put down your weapons!

24
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,750
D*** it.

25
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,090
Goodness!

26
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,410
We lost them.

27
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,720
But...

28
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,990
Wait, Inspector Nam!

29
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,670
Why do they all jump over the wall instead of using the perfectly fine door?

30
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,410
What are you all doing? Find him!

31
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,640
- Hurry, go! 
 -  Yes, sir!

32
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,190
Get down from there!

33
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,580
This is half of what I promised for now.

34
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,440
A fragrant scent.

35
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,590
I shall pay you as promised.

36
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,230
A 1,000 nyang for half.

37
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,440
And I need to have a word with you.

38
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,910
What will you do now?

39
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,330
What do you mean?

40
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,080
I am asking what you will do after you deliver the remaining 50 mal.

41
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,050
I promised 100 mal of alcohol.

42
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,670
Was that not the end of it?

43
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,500
I thought that was the beginning.

44
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,310
What do you mean by beginning?

45
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,000
I said I would change your fate.

46
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,520
You aren't even taking half of the payment

47
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,250
since you involved the Park mother and son into this.

48
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,260
Would that be enough to change your fate?

49
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,460
Wow!

50
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,810
One, two...

51
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,170
Wait, they're here!

52
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,460
- Hide!
- Hurry!

53
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,980
Unni?

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
So?

55
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,390
Are you asking me to bring you more alcohol?

56
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,660
Are you afraid  at this point?

57
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm not afraid. I'm uncomfortable.

58
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,950
The fact that I must continue to lie to keep doing this work.

59
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,400
But you are also continuing to lie to yourself.

60
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,430
A lie that you want to live an ordinary life.

61
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,390
What do you mean by that?

62
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,720
I can see it.

63
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,590
Your ambition.

64
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,020

65
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,590
Where did they go?

66
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,000
Aigoo! Sir!

67
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,790
Where are they?

68
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,560
Did you lose them?

69
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,620
If we were going to lose them, we might as well have run less.

70
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,680
They definitely came this way.

71
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Geez...

72
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,740
It is just a dried-up well.

73
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,580
Hey.

74
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,590
Why did you tattletale everything to Gye Sang Mok?

75
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,630
I didn't tattletale.

76
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,710
I only told him because he asked me.

77
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,230
Miss.

78
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,220
Do you know what kind of mess we got into because of you?

79
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,110
So...

80
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,770
are you the ones who cracked Gye Sang Mok's head open?

81
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,500
You don't need to know that.

82
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,970
Hey, you. Do you know who used to provide liquor to Giringak?

83
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,600
You wench!

84
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,340
A-All this is 1,000 nyang.

85
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,330
I've never seen so much money, My Lady.

86
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,650
So this is why they say getting to Hanyang is halfway to success.

87
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,770
We'll receive 1,000 more nyang if we give them the remaining 50 mal of alcohol.

88
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,330
You and I will still get 300 nyang each even after we split.

89
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,850
Then with that money,

90
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,300
I'll change my status, buy a house, land, and if there's leftover...

91
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,000
I guess there won't be.

92
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,880
Even if nothing's leftover, that's good enough.

93
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,080
That's enough for us to live a better life.

94
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,760
Right. Enough for a better life.

95
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,280
My Lady, after we bring in the remaining alcohol, let's leave Hanyang.

96
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,500
Leave Hangyang?

97
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,050
Now that I get to change my status,

98
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,990
I want to start a new life where no one knows I was a slave.

99
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,100
If you don't have anything holding you back in Hanyang, let's leave together.

100
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,820
Geum is right.

101
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,860
Once we bring in all the alcohol,

102
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,370
I'll do anything to find the one who killed my son.

103
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,500
And it will be safer for you to leave Hanyang.

104
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,060
What is it, My Lady?

105
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,580
Is something holding you back?

106
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,330
Is it because of Inspector Nam?

107
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,850
No. What do you mean?

108
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,520
I don't have any regrets. None.

109
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,450
I tell you, I don't.

110
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,340
So?

111
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,790
I told them it was Gye Sang Mok as you instructed.

112
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,310
Good job.

113
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,710
If the Police Chief is at the Office of Inspector General and they have the ledger,

114
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,770
is this not a serious matter?

115
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
 Ten years ago!

116
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,260
 Were you also at...

117
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,890
 Mangwolsa Temple?

118
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,720
Aigoo. You're still looking at that?

119
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,530
You're not a child anymore.

120
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,590
Do you remember

121
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,080
what I said to you when I was young?

122
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,180
About a tiger rescuing me.

123
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,010
Of course, I do.

124
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,460
That's all you talked about after you came to Nampo.

125
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,860
They are spirits that will deliver your mother safely to the underworld.

126
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,390
You have no parents, and I have no children.

127
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,330
Perhaps this was meant to be.

128
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,580
Come with me to Nampo.

129
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,020
Young!

130
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:25,010

131
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,590
I don't want to!

132
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,020
I don't want to go to Nampo if Mother isn't there.

133
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,630
You always said that.

134
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,860
That Madam sent a tiger from the underworld to save you.

135
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,610
You really were good at making up interesting stories.

136
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,560
I also thought that.

137
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,230
It was my young naive heart that made up the story

138
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,880
about a tiger saving me from a group of bandits.

139
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,610
But...

140
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,480
if that really was only an imagination,

141
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,970
how did I...

142
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,720
see it?

143
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,510
What...

144
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,360
could this be?

145
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,810
My goodness.

146
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,490
I never thought I would have to worry about where to put my money.

147
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,210
All right.

148
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,380
I wished for him to achieve fame and prestige.

149
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,020
I suppose it really worked.

150
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,200

How long will you keep me here?

151
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,420

I am not related in the least

152
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,130
with that murder or mokbingo incident.

153
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,760
Of course, you are not.

154
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,950
You did not even know whether there was ice inside the mokbingo or not.

155
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,030
So I am sure you received a request from someone in return for a payment.

156
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,680

157
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,890
The Northwest Police Bureau Chief is at the Office of Inspector General right now?

158
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,630
Inspector General.

159
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,410
Explain the meaning of this.

160
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

161
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,950

We are holding him as he is suspected of a charge,

162
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,430
but he has not confessed yet.

163
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,890
What happened to the bandits who broke into the Police Chief's house?

164
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,190
Have you still not found them?

165
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,060
We ordered that the Southern Mountain be thoroughly searched,

166
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,530
but we could not find any traces.

167
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,090
Are you saying that they are still in the capital, or did they run away from the capital?

168
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,400
Well... that is...

169
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,390
If they are in their right mind,

170
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,980
would they not have run away from the capital?

171
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,480
How dare you!

172
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,730
No guards guarding the gates and walls of the capital

173
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,720

reported that they saw such bandits.

174
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,780
They must still be inside the capital.

175
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,190
Had the guards of Capital Defense Military had their eyes open properly,

176
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,960
that would be the case.

177
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,820
What did you say, Chief Royal Secretary?

178
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,480
There are almost 10,000 guards in the capital.

179
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,630
How could it be that none of them saw the bandits on the run?

180
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,510
If they fail to guard the four gates,

181
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,600
the defenses of Hanyang will be toppled.

182
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,260
Your Majesty, we must take this incident as a catalyst and reform the military system

183
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,370
to strengthen the military.

184
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,580
It is not as if foreign forces have invaded.

185
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,970
It is only two bandits.

186
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,560
Stop exaggerating, Chief Royal Secretary!

187
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,380
Enough!

188
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,880
Who here truly worries for the royal household

189
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,670
and this country?

190
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,940
I shall think carefully about Chief Royal Secretary's suggestion.

191
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,640
You are all dismissed.

192
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,150
Aigoo.

193
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,120
Take your time.

194
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,960
I beg you.

195
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,720
Aigoo. Aigoo.

196
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,540
Hurry up!

197
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,730
I say we need to wrap this up by the end of the month.

198
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,180
Don't you want to get paid?

199
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,640
Aigoo.

200
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,990
That little...

201
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,640
I know I'm getting paid to do this,

202
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,780
- but he's acting like we're slaves. 
 - Let it go.

203
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,740
It's not easy to earn one nyang in a day.

204
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,480
But listen.

205
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,070
Isn't this well construction somewhat suspicious?

206
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,630
We're going to dig a cave under the Southern Mountain.

207
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,250
Hey, you there.

208
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,090
What did you just say?

209
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,940
What about a cave?

210
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,420
Well, wh-when did I say anything about a cave?

211
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,470
That's not what I meant.

212
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,600
I meant once this well is finished,

213
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,500
the price of this land will go up.

214
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,410

215
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,240

216
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,090
What is this?

217
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,040
What are you doing in my store?

218
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,360
Gye Sang Mok, we got your letter.

219
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,770

220
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,020
- I sent this? 
 - I don't know when you had time to prepare this.

221
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,580
As expected of our Boss Gye.

222
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,440
Move aside.

223
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,750
What's this?

224
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,930
This is alcohol...

225
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,650
But it tastes good.

226
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,890
- Why? 
 - As you know,

227
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,370
the alcohol supply to Hanyang was cut off after you were injured.

228
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:42,120
Right. I was so frustrated just waiting without doing anything.

229
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,180
But I see that you've prepared alcohol like this.

230
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,380
And top-quality alcohol at that.

231
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,720
Sell it to me.

232
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,180
I'll pay 30 nyang per jar.

233
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,790
No, no, no.

234
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,260
- I'll buy it. Forty nyang. 
 - Fifty from me!

235
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,630
- I'll buy two jars.
 - What in the world!

236
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Quiet down!

237
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,580
Fifty nyang per jar.

238
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,210
-  Fifty?  
 - Pay up front.

239
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,400
I'll provide you with more.

240
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,040
And?

241
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,960

242
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,680
I did as you told me.

243
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,980
It will really get messy around here.

244
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,030

245
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,250
The inspector asked about the incident from ten years ago.

246
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,330
The incident that occurred at this temple.

247
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,130
I don't think we can let it slide.

248
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,210
I will do as you command.

249
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,870

250
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,090
Flowers and butterflies...

251
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,390
The liveliness of it resembles Maiden.

252
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,000
A trace of white sandalwood.

253
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,790
How is it?

254
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,270
Does it not smell fragrant?

255
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,580
As I have already smelled it many days and nights,

256
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,060
I can't smell it anymore.

257
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,760
"Meet at the pond in front of Sungnyemun Gate."

258
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,160

259
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,210
Since when did she feel this way?

260
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,290
Maiden is really different from other women.

261
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,410
She always surprises me.

262
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,040
Do you like her that much?

263
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,300
Make preparations.

264
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,890
Your Highness, Chief Royal Secretary asked you not to, so earnestly.

265
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,430
If you get caught sneaking out of the palace again...

266
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,980
Goodness. The golden turtle.

267
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,370
How do you like it?

268
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,610

269
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,500
Today is the day Sir Lee Chui Joong and I meet.

270
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,630
And?

271
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,590
While we meet,

272
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,970
please distract Young Master Nam and Choon Gae.

273
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,330
 Why would we do that?

274
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,580
Oh. You must not need these anymore.

275
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,930
- Never mind then. 
 - No, wait!

276
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,680
Who said we don't need them?

277
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,970
We'll distract them for you.

278
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,760
The next day is the 25th.

279
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,900
The day munitions will be stocked at the Ministry of Defense.

280
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,960
No. I don't think this is right.

281
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,450
Maiden?

282
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,400
What are you doing at the Office of Inspector General?

283
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,790
I came to see you.

284
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,680
Why else would I be here?

285
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,980
Me?

286
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,220
I...

287
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,440
I have something to tell you.

288
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,300
Something I must tell you urgently, just the two of us.

289
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,100
Just the two of us?

290
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,170
Come with me for a moment.

291
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,570
Wait...

292
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,630
Come on.

293
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,520
What are you doing?

294
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,300
Take the challenge to be the strongest man!

295
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,790
The first-place prize is a cow.

296
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,700
Hey. They have a wrestling match over there. You should join.

297
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,990
No way. I already played a lot back in my hometown.

298
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,550
Come on, just do it.

299
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,940
I really like wrestling.

300
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,440
Please just once.

301
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,130
Geez, I said I wouldn't do it.

302
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,420
Win!

303
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,880
We have our winner!

304
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,370
Don't turn around.

305
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,250
Listen to me first.

306
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,520
I have a secret that I have not told you all this time.

307
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,680
I was afraid of telling you about myself.

308
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,800
But I do not wish to hide it any longer.

309
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,620
- I do not live in Gaeseong. In fact— 
 - I do not mind.

310
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,770
Maiden Han?

311
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,990
I do not mind whatever it is.

312
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,320
Whatever your secret is, wherever you may live,

313
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,950
I am prepared to be with you.

314
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,190
I have already packed my things.

315
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,370
Please take me away before I must put my wedding makeup on. Please?

316
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,310
I think there must have been a mistake.

317
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,170
There's no name on the letter...

318
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,780
No name?

319
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,900
I know I wrote my name...

320
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,270
The 'Ae' of Ae Jin. Love*. 
('Ae' means love)

321
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,510
I wrote it down here for sure.

322
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,720
I apologize.

323
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,140
I did not come here to meet you, Maiden Han.

324
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,680
I came to see Maiden Ro Seo.

325
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,730
Maiden Kang...

326
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,080
loves Young Master Nam, does she not?

327
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,940
Young Master Nam also loves Maiden Kang.

328
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,250
They pretend not to care about each other, but they do.

329
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,980
So as long as you love me,

330
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,640
everything will work out.

331
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,720
Do not waste your precious heart.

332
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,620
Please give it to me.

333
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,600
I shall care for it devotedly.

334
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,320
Where are you taking me?

335
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,310
What do you have to say to me that you brought me all the way here?

336
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,620
Well, I...

337
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,300
I have something to tell you in private.

338
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,260
The thing is...

339
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,300
If you are going to ask me to deliver a love letter again, I refuse.

340
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,920
That isn't it.

341
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,860
That love letter wasn't even mine.

342
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,920
It wasn't...

343
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,080
yours?

344
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,780
Someone just asked me to pass it onto Jade Lad.

345
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,440
What? I already told him that it was from you.

346
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,530
Well, my goodness. It looks like I'll be scolded.

347
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,990
I apologize.

348
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,260
Tell me who the subject is properly when you give me things like that.

349
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,480
I cannot tell you who sent it.

350
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,230
That's fine. Never mind that.

351
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,710
I apologize.

352
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,790
What are you...

353
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,210
apologizing for again?

354
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,930
All of it.

355
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,160
Everything from beginning to now. I apologize.

356
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,750
Even for the things I cannot tell you why.

357
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,460
I'm sorry for all of it.

358
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,480
Maiden, why are you acting like this? As if you won't see me again.

359
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,970
Thank you.

360
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,720
I realize it now.

361
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,570
Realize what?

362
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,540
That you cannot gain someone's heart by begging.

363
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,610
Pardon?

364
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,490
No matter which direction the heart goes,

365
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,730
those who are meant to be man and wife are predestined.

366
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,260
Like yourself and Inspector Nam.

367
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,790
From now on,

368
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,170
I will gain a connection with that person before their heart.

369
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,400
So, I hope...

370
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,280
you live happily ever after with Inspector Nam.

371
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,590
You were right, Young Tenant.

372
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,470
Everything was a lie.

373
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,290
No matter what I tell you now,

374
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,320
they are all lies.

375
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,330
From the beginning to the end,

376
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:22,080
there is nothing I can tell you

377
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,070
truthfully, Young Tenant.

378
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,620
I only said that because I was angry—

379
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,110
But only one thing.

380
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,840
There is one truth that I can tell you.

381
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,300
Congratulations on your marriage.

382
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,710
I mean it.

383
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,340
I have said everything I need to, so I will get going.

384
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,040
Is something the matter?

385
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,910
Do not try to find out.

386
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,730
And do not look at me with those worried eyes.

387
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,820
It is uncomfortable.

388
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,330
Just seeing your face...

389
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,510
makes me feel uncomfortable.

390
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,620
So...

391
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,470
just stay here.

392
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,090
I will be going.

393
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,410
Maiden.

394
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,800
I beg you.

395
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,850
Just count to ten before you move.

396
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,400
Only to ten.

397
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,290
Then you can move.

398
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,350
♫  When I walked one step closer to you  ♫

399
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,600
♫  You would walk two steps away  ♫

400
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:06,130
♫  I think of how we used to be  ♫

401
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,250
♫  My heart ached too much  ♫

402
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,150
♫  So I decided not to long for you anymore  ♫

403
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:23,510
♫  Just watching you made me ache  ♫

404
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,990
♫  I still saw you at the end of a long day/i&gt; ♫

405
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:35,330
♫  And spent those days hating myself  ♫

406
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,910
 One.

407
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,310
 Two.

408
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,820
 Three.

409
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:48,630
♫  You probably won't know  ♫

410
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,850
 Four.

411
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,270
 Five.

412
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,920
 Six.

413
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,740
I don't have any good memories in Hanyang.

414
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,400
No good memories...

415
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,000
 A scholar's arrow is meant to protect people, not to hurt them.

416
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,540
♫  Just watching you made me ache  ♫

417
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,900
♫  I still saw you at the end of a long day/i&gt; ♫

418
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,960
 There should be a distinction between men and women. How could we share the same table?

419
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,570
 A ghost!

420
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,370
 You scared me... don't do that...

421
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,340
 Please don't do that...

422
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,530
 - Wait. Wait! 
 - Take it off.

423
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,530
 Wait! What are you doing?

424
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,780
 This guy is extremely malicious.

425
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,350
 Why are you walking so fast?

426
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,810
 Did you take a good look at it?

427
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,290
♫  Even if you don't understand me  ♫

428
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,790
♫  I'm somehow trying   ♫

429
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,900
 Your feet should be as wide as your shoulders.

430
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,660
 Split the strength between two arms pulling and pushing.

431
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,410
 Put your right hand under your chin.

432
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,740
 You said either hang your head or cut someone else's head when a woman is mocked.

433
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,330
♫  Even if you're not at the end of it  ♫

434
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:32,660
♫  I would always wait for you  ♫

435
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,180
♫  I pity myself again today  ♫

436
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:44,210
♫  You probably won't know that I am like this  ♫

437
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,530
 You are impatient and too brazen for your own good,

438
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,840
 so you will have many hardships in your life.

439
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,710
 So,

440
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,860
 think before you act.

441
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,090
 And walk down a righteous path.

442
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,100
Geez.

443
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,230
 Congratulations on your marriage.

444
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,210
 I mean it.

445
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,950
 Is something the matter?

446
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,620
 Do not try to find out.

447
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,590
 And do not look at me with those worried eyes.

448
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,680
 It makes me uncomfortable.

449
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,240
 Just seeing your face...

450
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,350
 makes me feel uncomfortable.

451
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,980

452
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,450
Ten carts left the point of departure

453
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,890
and ten carts arrived at the Ministry of Defense.

454
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,330
But there were 12 passes received at Sungnyemun Gate.

455
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,920
Meaning two carts disappeared along the way.

456
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,020
Two carts...

457
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,170
disappeared?

458
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,470
Only these two passes had different handwritings.

459
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,830
It must mean that someone was smuggling weapons into the capital.

460
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,210
I am not sure.

461
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,450
It may not be weapons.

462
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,300
Pardon?

463
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,180
Show this to the Training Commander.

464
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,240
We need only deliver the truth.

465
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,200
Yes,  Chief Royal Secretary.

466
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,290
A suspicious heart.

467
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,200
That heart makes the ghosts manifest in the dark.

468
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,440
Your Highness.

469
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
You woke up early and even got dressed?

470
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,270
A cooked egg will crow instead of a rooster.

471
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,740
That's enough.

472
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,660
Eol Dong, starting today, you will look into Maiden Ro Seo's family.

473
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,300
Who her father was,

474
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,380
if she has any living relatives.

475
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,390
Both maternal and paternal sides of her family.

476
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,210
Why her family?

477
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,910
I'm going to bring her into the palace.

478
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,260
Pardon?

479
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,030
To the palace?

480
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,550
- As a court lady? 
 - No.

481
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,270
If I'm going to bring her here,

482
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,080
I might as well bring her into the most valuable position.

483
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,330
Did you hear?

484
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,720
Crown Prince has a woman outside the palace.

485
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,810
What if he gets her pregnant and brings her here?

486
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:32,430
She could be pregnant already!

487
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,880
Goodness!

488
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,650
Gosh.

489
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,660
So? Which family is she from?

490
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,640
From what I heard, she is married.

491
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,180
- No way. 
 - Your Highness, you must maintain your dignity.

492
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,880
Be quiet.

493
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,580
I  can barely hear them.

494
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,900
My, it must be nice.

495
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,400
Oh, I can hear them.

496
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,370
So, which family was the woman you saw that day from?

497
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,850
She was the daughter of the Minister of Defense.

498
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,460
The Minister of Defense?

499
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,580
The Minister of Defense...

500
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:28,840
Are they not discussing marriage with that tutor at the Eastern Palace, Nam Young?

501
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,460
Ae Jin.

502
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,830
It's your favorite grilled short rib patties.

503
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,650
My. Smells amazing.

504
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,460
Here. Just one bite.

505
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,370
No, thank you.

506
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,400
Why won't you eat?

507
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,210
Is it that Mount Kumgang sickness again?

508
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,550
Aigoo. You keep asking to go to Mount Kumgang.

509
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,870
Every year without fail.

510
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,680
Come now. I told you,

511
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,750
a woman cannot go to Mount Kumgang.

512
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,350
Besides, your marriage is drawing near.

513
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,940
I do not want to get married!

514
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,020
I do not want to get married!

515
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,100
Why would you not want to be married?

516
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,670
Is it that you do not like Inspector Nam?

517
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,480
I cannot even go to Mount Kumgang because I am a woman.

518
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,010
And I cannot even marry a man that I love.

519
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,020
I do not wish to live.

520
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm going  to starve myself to death.

521
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,840
Aigoo.

522
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,610
Then how could I live?

523
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
Ae Jin. Here...

524
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,470
You could not think of Mount Kumgang if you do not eat.

525
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,740
Ae Jin.

526
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,450

527
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,480
Carts containing weapons

528
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,520
disappeared midway?

529
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,500
I looked into it, thinking they may be forged documents,

530
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,870
but the official at the Ministry of the Defense said they were legitimate.

531
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:20,610
If it isn't to strengthen the military without our knowledge,

532
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,070
what else could it be?

533
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:27,400
The Chief Royal Secretary could not have brought up the military reform for nothing.

534
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,810
He met with the Minister of Defense privately not long ago.

535
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:34,480
We must act first before they do, Father.

536
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,970

537
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,070
Minister, we must go to the Ministry of Defense immediately.

538
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,970
They are raiding the military weapon building at the Capital Defense Military.

539
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,730
What are you talking about?

540
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,940

Search thoroughly and make sure there are no weapons we missed.

541
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,330
 Understood!

542
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,060
Chief State Minister!

543
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,530
Training Commander!

544
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,250
What is the meaning of this?

545
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,690
Where did you hide away the weapons, Minister of Defense?

546
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,920
Pardon?

547
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,110
What weapons?

548
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,950
We are asking where you hid the two out of the

549
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,330
twelve weapon carts that were brought into the capital!

550
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,700
Twelve?

551
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,060
Only ten carts were brought in this time.

552
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,670
Is this not the seal that you stamped yourself?

553
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,900
This is...

554
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,360
This is the military seal, but...

555
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,930
You will have to tell the truth as to

556
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,740
what you did with the smuggled guns, Minister of Defense!

557
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,040
Your Excellency.

558
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,780
The Minister of Defense...

559
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:04,360
So he chose to crop his own wings.

560
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,600
That looks much better.

561
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,730

562
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,570
What will this prove?

563
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:31,000
You spent a lot of money building a vacation home in Yongsan.

564
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,470

So? It isn't as if I received the money.

565
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,420
Is it a problem to spend money?

566
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,190
Spending money isn't the problem. However...

567
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,150
if the money that was supposed to be spent wasn't,

568
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,710
that could be a problem.

569
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:46,510
Every roof tile at the vacation home is meticulously recorded,

570
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,280
but why did you not pay anything to the workers?

571
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,240
T-that is...

572
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,120
because I agreed to pay it to the Labor and Commodity Administration all at once.

573
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,060
Then I will have to ask an official there about the details.

574
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,230
You.

575
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:16,120
You are asking for big trouble.

576
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,820
Do you think a sword cannot cut an inspector?

577
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,870
At least then,

578
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,700
I would be able to see who is holding the sword.

579
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,730
The owner of this inn originally

580
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,810
started out as a labor administrator, providing labor to the government office.

581
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,080
It has become the largest Labor and Commodity Administration in Hanyang.

582
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,330
Going through that door means no shortage of work.

583
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:53,420
That is why everyone is lined up here like this.

584
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,730
 I'm Sim Heon.

585
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,610
We have a guest.

586
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,000
I-Inspector General.

587
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,810
Inspector Nam, what brings you here?

588
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,620
I must ask this man something about the Police Chief's vacation home construction.

589
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,460
I have already finished

590
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,940
investigating that incident.

591
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,230
You may leave.

592
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,670
It is an incident that I began investigating, so I shall complete it myself.

593
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,980
Do you have any idea how much trouble you have caused me?

594
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,380
Smuggling out the criminal while transferring him to the Ministry of Justice.

595
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,400
Listening to his words alone and arresting the Police Chief. What were you thinking?

596
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,200
- That was— 
 - Everything has order and procedures.

597
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,310
How is an inspector of the Inspector General Office supposed to inspect others' wrongdoings

598
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,950
when he cannot even follow basic policies?

599
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:31,950
But is it not an inspector's job to investigate any suspicions?

600
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,690
Come now.

601
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,560
I told you to leave.

602
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,190
Still, you came all the way here. You might as well see for yourself.

603
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,270
Here.

604
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,410
This is the record of the Police Chief's vacation home construction.

605
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,160
You pulled it out for me

606
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:55,280
as if you had prepared it.

607
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,850
Making records is what I always do.

608
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,400
I told you, I finished investigating it myself.

609
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,280
There was nothing wrong with these records.

610
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,770
Let us leave.

611
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,290
Farewell, Inspector General.

612
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,310
I shall see you again, Inspector Nam.

613
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,360
Hyung-nim.

614
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,570
What will you do now?

615
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,710
We didn't make this alcohol.

616
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:22,830
Is this all right?

617
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,540
Don't worry.

618
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,300
I have a plan.

619
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,770
Has the moonflower bloomed?

620
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,130
Only the flower? The moon is also out.

621
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,210
- When the moon is out? 
 - It calls for alcohol.

622
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,580
Geez.

623
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,700
This was meant to be.

624
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,860
Moonflower...

625
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,020
Has the moonflower bloomed?

626
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,650
Only the flower?

627
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,070
The moon is also out.

628
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,290
- When the moon is out? 
 - You die.

629
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,150
What?

630
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,740
That can't be right.

631
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,160
What was that? I said as I was told.

632
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,010
We verify with our faces.

633
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,340
Then what was the point of moonflower and all that?

634
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,090
It sounds cool.

635
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:45,390
Who's this?

636
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,970
This is Gye Sang Mok.

637
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:50,780
Oh. That Gye Sang...

638
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,940
I've been meaning to come after you.

639
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,840
How kind of you to make your way here on your own.

640
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,780
What's wrong with him? Is he crazy?

641
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,820
He did bang his head pretty hard.

642
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,500
I knew it.

643
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,300
My heart pounded every time I saw you, My Lady.

644
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:26,520
That was Gye Sang Mok's primal and animalistic instinct of smelling money.

645
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,360
What nonsense is this?

646
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,100
My Lady, sell me the alcohol.

647
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,940
All the owners of secret alcohol dens are suffering because there is no alcohol in the capital.

648
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,890
But with your alcohol,

649
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,980
you could earn a ton of money.

650
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,060
My Lady.

651
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,430
Leave this man to us and go.

652
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,260
You must sneak the alcohol.

653
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:00,610
Then, I shall leave him to you.

654
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,980
Make a copy of everything and organize them.

655
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,280
All of them?

656
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,020
You wanted to do something useless.

657
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,010
So I'm giving you something useless to do.

658
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,420
Don't complain, and just do it.

659
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,270
The Police Chief will be under house arrest,

660
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,250
so there is no need to rush on investigating him.

661
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,980
What do you mean by that?

662
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,970
House arrest?

663
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,120
 The next day is the 25th.

664
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,290
 The day munitions will be stocked at the Ministry of Defense.

665
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,870
How dare they steal the military seal

666
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:18,350
and shamelessly smuggled guns into the capital.

667
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,960
I shall grandly award the man who makes the arrest.

668
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,010
So do not let them get away.

669
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,560
 Understood!

670
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,880
My Lady, at least have a sip of this broth.

671
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,520
How long are you going to starve yourself?

672
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,330
You are really going to fall ill.

673
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,060
I would rather starve to death than get married.

674
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,870
The Ministry of Defense is a mess right now.

675
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,400
His Excellency must be deeply troubled.

676
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,900
Just how disheartened would

677
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,150
His Excellency be if you're being like this?

678
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:56,950
Why is the Minister of Defense a mess?

679
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,310
My Lady.

680
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,580
What do you need a horse for all of a sudden?

681
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,330
You are going to be in big trouble!

682
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,840
If they get caught, I'll be in trouble too.

683
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,980
Aigoo, My Lady!

684
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,610
My Lady!

685
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:32,800
Father.

686
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,220
What... Ae Jin.

687
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,910
What are you doing out here?

688
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,140
Pardon?

689
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,320
Oh... um...

690
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,370
Well... um...

691
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:57,040

692
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:09,220
Ae Jin.

693
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,160
I am quite busy.

694
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,810
Go back home.

695
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,510
Take Ae Jin home.

696
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,810
Yes, sir.

697
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,680
Father, I...

698
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,460
Father.

699
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,870
Father. Please forgive me.

700
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,240
What is going on with you?

701
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,190
Pass through.

702
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,780
Father!

703
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,480
Dear Father, you worried for me

704
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,110
and cut...

705
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:57,230
Cut the grilled short rib patties with your own hands.

706
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,570
But I did not eat it

707
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,120
and threw a tantrum, causing you anguish.

708
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:08,410
Please forgive this ungrateful daughter of yours.

709
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,790
This child...

710
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,160
Ae Jin, there is no time for this.

711
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,510
Return home.

712
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,640
Father.

713
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,900
Are you forgiving me?

714
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,770
Of course. Of course, I forgive you.

715
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,340
Is that not Lady Ae Jin?

716
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,420
Hurry and go.

717
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,910
I think something went wrong.

718
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,110
His Excellency, a cart is approaching.

719
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,390
What?

720
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,930
Oh, I feel faint!

721
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,580
It's because I didn't have those grilled short rib patties.

722
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,490
Ae Jin!

723
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:50,290
Listen! Do not miss a single cart and chase after them!

724
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,110
 - Yes, Sir! 
- Ae Jin...

725
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:53,630
Ae Jin!

726
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,770
Stop!

727
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,070
Ae Jin?

728
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,430
Goodness.

729
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,560
Hurry, hurry! Run, run!

730
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,270
Run!

731
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,650
What do you mean?

732
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,740
Return the Police Chief home?

733
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,110
The Inspector General commanded

734
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:52,970
that he be under house arrest according to procedure until His Majesty's approval.

735
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:56,410
How could we let him go after the last incident?

736
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:58,020
The Police Chief's life could be in danger.

737
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,800
Where do you think you're going?

738
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,720
You could be dismissed if you keep doing this.

739
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,820
Who's there?

740
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,320
Who is there?

741
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,580
Anyone—

742
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,070
- What is going on? 
 - I think we were found out.

743
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:20,140
The guards are searching the capital.

744
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,480
What about the lady?

745
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,890
Don't struggle and come with us.

746
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,900
Did you not say that you had questions regarding Mangwolsa Temple?

747
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,040
I also have many questions.

748
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,060
What you know...

749
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,670
and how much you know.

750
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:10,070
You will have to reveal everything.

751
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,250
Take him.

752
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,630
What are you doing? Hurry.

753
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:43,660

754
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:47,710
♫  I say, who you are, who you are  ♫

755
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:51,690
♫  The question that fills my heart  ♫

756
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:58,740
♫  You came to me after so many days have passed  ♫

757
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:07,040
♫  My meaningless day is being filled with you  ♫

758
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,210

759
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:12,760
 I think it would be better if we part ways here.

760
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,040
 You have somewhere to return to, Young Tenant.

761
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,250
 You have a road of flowers and silk ahead of you.

762
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,210
 You will come to me on your own this time.

763
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,690
 He took Lady Kang.

764
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,900
 What are we to do?

765
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,510
 They are meaningless.

766
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,770
 Roads of flowers or silk. They will not make me waver.

767
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,050
 Don't hurt Young Tenant.

768
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,440
 I won't let this go!

769
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,130
 Open this door!

770
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,110
 One.

771
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,400
 Two.

772
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,700
 Three.

773
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,360
 I'll count to ten. And to ten again.

774
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,850
 I'll always be yours.
