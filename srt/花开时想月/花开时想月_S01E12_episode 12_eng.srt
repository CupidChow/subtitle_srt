1
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,940

2
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,230
Did you really think that I would not recognize you if you were dressed like that?

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,560
They said you were dead...

4
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,970
I truly thought you were dead...

5
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,930
I was so worried about what you might do.

6
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,930
I just could not die.

7
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,390
Ouch!

8
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,280
My gosh! I thought I'd never see you again!

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,150
Geez, it really hurts.

10
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,360
Wait. Wait a minute...

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
Maiden.

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,050
Your Highness.

13
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,450
How did you two meet?

14
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,650
Young Master Nam!

15
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,380
I thought you were dead.

16
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,210
What happened?

17
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,430
Nam Young, you...

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,780
Maiden.

19
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,800
You two are both safe!

20
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,770
Wait a moment.

21
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,840
Geez.

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,090
Your Highness, I'm truly in pain.

23
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,780
- Please let me go.
- I don't want to.

24
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,420
It really hurts...

25
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,360
Finally, we meet.

26
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,550
Kneel in front of my Gang San when you get to the afterlife.

27
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,960
Do not even think about going outside the house until the Princess Consort selection.

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,170
Do you understand?

29
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,830
Yes, Father.

30
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,100
I will obey your orders.

31
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,250
Thank you.

32
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,680
But what mysterious trick did you play on her?

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,540
Before I could do anything, they had already met.

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,350
Young Master Nam, please take this with you.

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,990
Why is this...

36
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,070
Oh, it is Maiden Ro Seo's.

37
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,010
She said something about it belonging to her father.

38
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,250
Anyway, be sure to give it to her.

39
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,440
 I made this.

40
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,820
 Well made, right?

41
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,210
 My father passed away.

42
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,470
 On a windy day like today.

43
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,380
 I think it started then.

44
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,340
 How tumultuous my life became.

45
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,180
 If there indeed are ghosts,

46
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,060
 there is no way my father wouldn't have visited me.

47
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,840
 He never even visited me in my dream.

48
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,230
 I actually wanted to give this to my daughter.

49
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,780
 I'm sure she would understand.

50
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,120
 You must not come out of this space.

51
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,660
Young Tenant.

52
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,570
Young Tenant...

53
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm sorry.

54
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,080
What are you sorry about?

55
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,590
I came too late.

56
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,660
I am truly sorry.

57
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,400
It is all right.

58
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,250
You are alive.

59
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,620
You are alive...

60
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,340
and so I am fine with that.

61
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,140
Thank you...

62
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,850
for staying alive.

63
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,750
For staying alive...

64
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,040
and coming to me.

65
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,410

66
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,810
Master!

67
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,070
Master!

68
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,110
The news bulletin arrived from Hanyang.

69
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,360

70
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,480
- Oh, all right. Hand it to me.
- Yes.

71
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,280
They were behind this time. So it is a week's worth.

72
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,840
Even though we are a scholar family located in a province,

73
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,490
we should not be in the dark about what goes on in Hanyang.

74
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,010

75
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,120
What are they talking about?

76
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,430
Nam Young!

77
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,880
- Our Nam Young is dead?
- Pardon?

78
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,720
Young Master is dead?

79
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,170
No, no...

80
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,390
Wait...

81
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,590
He is alive...

82
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,480
Aigoo...

83
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,270
What is going on here?

84
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:41,170
 When Inspector Nam Young, whose corpse was discovered, appeared in the palace,

85
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,400
 everyone was in shock.

86
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,570
 What in the world...

87
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,330
 He was alive!

88
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,340
 Inspector Nam...

89
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,330
 testified that the alcohol smuggler who dug a tunnel and tried to kill him

90
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,420
 was a traveling merchants' inn owner,

91
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,640
 Sim Heon.

92
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,740
 His Majesty...

93
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,380
 became furious about the atrocious behaviors of the smugglers

94
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,340
 and promoted Inspector Nam...

95
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,670
 to Commander Inspector, a junior state officer.

96
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,140
I thought they said he was dead...

97
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,210
and now he's alive...

98
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,660
and got a promotion?

99
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,360
All right, please come in.

100
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,420
My goodness!

101
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,030
Only the nobles live in this neighborhood. So it's quiet.

102
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,970
It has a huge front yard.

103
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,160
It's difficult to find a house like this.

104
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Son, what do you think?

105
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,840
I think it's okay. What do you think, wife?

106
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,270
Yes, it is good.

107
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,680
Maiden, now you are a daughter of this family that they are ashamed of.

108
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,830
You should never show your face nor go outside.

109
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,810
That seems too harsh.

110
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,060
Too many people saw you with a gun and having a field day.

111
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,500
 We have Han Ae Jin, the daughter of the Minister of Defense!

112
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,540
That's because I heard that you were dead.

113
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,350
I know...

114
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,950
It was my fault.

115
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,930
Since you risked danger because of me,

116
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,590
I have a duty to protect you, Maiden.

117
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,090
You were here.

118
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,530
Gosh, this is your room, My Lady. It's nice.

119
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,960
Why is that there?

120
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,690
- That's just like yours...
- Shush...

121
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,090
You should not covet someone else's things.

122
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,610
- Well...
- What?

123
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,870
- What?
- Hush, hush...

124
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,700
Well, um...

125
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,210
Well...

126
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,840
Since there is a distinction between men and women, we will get going.

127
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,550
- But that's not it...
- Be quiet.

128
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,310
- I mean...
- Get out.

129
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,110
Do you intend on not telling me?

130
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,940
According to what you say, Maiden Kang's father had made it to give it to her.

131
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,060
I shall give it back to her someday.

132
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,830
However, now is not the time.

133
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,040
While I do not know why Sim Heon killed Maiden Kang's father,

134
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,280
I do not want to put her in danger again by telling her recklessly.

135
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,930
True.

136
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,030
Seeing how everything about that day was covered up

137
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,600
and killed off everyone connected to the incident,

138
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,230
it must not have been a simple murder case.

139
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,910

140
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,430
How come you have this?

141
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,740
I happened to be looking into the case.

142
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,270
Maiden Kang's father was a personal guard to my older brother, who passed away.

143
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,680
He was a personal guard to the Crown Prince?

144
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,030
 I'm sure you are aware that

145
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,090
 my older brother passed away suddenly ten years ago.

146
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,220
 While the poison death rumor was rampant,

147
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,920
 they found poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's quarters.

148
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,590
 Lady Consortship Sukwon Um confessed saying she poisoned Crown Prince

149
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,240
 and the case came to a close.

150
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,580
And Maiden's father died in about a month.

151
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,180
The personal guard to the Crown Prince was murdered during the mourning period.

152
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,920
Do you believe...

153
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,220
it is relevant to Crown Prince Sunghyun's death?

154
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,930
What else do you think it could be?

155
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,570
The reason a mere smuggler

156
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,260
would kill a personal guard to the crown prince.

157
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,520
By chance, do you remember anyone else besides Sim Heon?

158
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,610
If he was a government official, I am sure he was dressed in mourning attire

159
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,080
since it was during Hyungnim's mourning period.

160
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,840
I do not remember...

161
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,880
Please look into this incident in more detail, Your Highness.

162
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,730
I will capture Sim Heon and get his confession.

163
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,860
Everyone must be dying to see the face of a man who came back from the dead.

164
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,440
According to the rumor, they say you tore open the coffin and came out of it.

165
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,140
That is not possible.

166
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,030
Because they robbed my identity tag and clothes,

167
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,580
there was a slight misunderstanding.

168
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,150
They must have killed a man while fighting over stolen goods.

169
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,170
Never mind helping a man who is down injured,

170
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,690
they robbed you and killed another man.

171
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,350
So what happened to your evidence?

172
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,260
Did you lose everything?

173
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,250
Yes.

174
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,200
I had enclosed it with my report.

175
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,330
But they took it with the report.

176
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,500
Now that the evidence is lost,

177
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,860
I guess the only way is to capture the criminal and get him to confess.

178
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,890
It is an insignia to mobilize the military.

179
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,400
His Majesty bestows it to you, so you can mobilize the military whenever necessary.

180
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,100
If you need anything else, do not hesitate to tell me.

181
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,110
I shall help you in any way I am able.

182
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,450
Thank you, Chief Royal Secretary.

183
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,740
About that girl...

184
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,990
Do you know what happened to her?

185
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:45,240
I hear she kidnapped Minister Han's daughter and came into the capital?

186
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,390
I also...

187
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,040
heard of the news only after I came to.

188
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,030
I see.

189
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,760
For a short while, I heard you lived under the same roof.

190
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,100
You must be disheartened as well.

191
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,030
As for her father...

192
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,780
 he was practically the only man who treated me

193
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,650
  without bias, a former slave.

194
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,380
However, committing a crime is another matter.

195
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,420
As an official working for the nation,

196
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,150
you should not turn a blind eye on a criminal due to past friendship.

197
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,850
Is that not so?

198
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,400
I could not agree with you more.

199
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,870
All right then.

200
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,910
What's wrong with her?

201
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,290
Since she's stuck at home all day, she's feeling restless.

202
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,460
My Lady, come over here and have some rice cake Lady Ae Jin brought.

203
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,970
Okay.

204
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,800
How are things outside?

205
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,340
You can forget about it...

206
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,380
because she kidnapped me.

207
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,110
They say she has more than 100 men under her,

208
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,580
she kills people relentlessly,

209
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,260
my goodness...

210
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,710
there's a rumor all over the place saying she can create illusions.

211
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,340
 Stop right there!

212
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,100
 Catch her!

213
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,660
 This way.

214
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,360
 Stop!

215
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,190
 Stop right there!

216
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,460
 Get her!

217
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,950
Don't you worry.

218
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,870
When I become the Princess Consort,

219
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,930
I shall ask His Highness to take you off the wanted list.

220
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,390
Princess Consort?

221
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,040
Gosh, my father told me that

222
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,460
as long as I do not make a mistake during the selection,

223
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,850
I guess I could become the Princess Consort or something.

224
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,050
My brother would be so shocked if he found out that I'm the ringleader of smugglers.

225
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,410
But why do you think Young Master Hae Soo has not returned yet?

226
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,830
The rumor of you being the ringleader of a smuggling group is all over the place.

227
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,060
How could he return?

228
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,670
You're saying he has not returned because of me?

229
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,950
No, no...

230
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,190
Gosh, I'm just saying that's what the rumor says.

231
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,260
They say no news is good news–

232
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,940
My Lady!

233
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,220
Aren't you getting ready for the Princess Consort selection?

234
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,290
You know, the selection is approaching quickly.

235
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,400
I can't believe you're eating rice cakes.

236
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
Please just go.

237
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,390
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. Where is my head?

238
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,980
I should take care of my figure, huh?

239
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,160
Oh, I should go.

240
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,500
I shouldn't have kidnapped her...

241
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,990
If I hadn't done just that...

242
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,070
My Ro Seo is...

243
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,250
the ringleader of a smuggling group?

244
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,400
Aigoo, there is- there is no way my Ro Seo would do that.

245
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,200
These guys here are searching for Lady Kang, too.

246
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,110
You'd better not let them know you're her brother.

247
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,690
This is all...

248
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,990
Gye Ssang Mok...

249
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,630
This is all your fault.

250
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,050
My gosh.

251
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,840
- What's this bulls***?
- Don't you remember?

252
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,310
Only if you hadn't placed 100-nyang debt on us...

253
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,240
One hundred nyang debt?

254
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,020
You!

255
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,760
What the heck? What's wrong with you?

256
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,730
I was going to let you off easy...

257
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,570

This is...

258
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,630
the insignia that can mobilize the military

259
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,610
from the Ministry of Defense.

260
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,560
So-called...

261
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,420
absolute authority.

262
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,970
When my official duty is completed, I shall return it.

263
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,840
I knew this day would come.

264
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,240
But I had no idea it would be so soon.

265
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,780
You...

266
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,000
I mean, sir. I cannot believe you're a commander already.

267
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,090
Congratulations, Commander Inspector.

268
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,930
Oh, you should just address me comfortably, Chief Inspector.

269
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,720
I cannot do that...

270
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,940
sir.

271
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,030
The Office of Inspector General

272
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,610
is known for clear hierarchy, sir.

273
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,910
All right then...

274
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,820
you should move to the headquarter.

275
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,400
Officer Hwang, pack his things for him. So he can go quickly.

276
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,300
Yes, sir.

277
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,890
No. There is no place available at the headquarter yet.

278
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,290
- So I decided to stay here.
- Well...

279
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,160
If you stay in the Inspector Office,

280
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,910
it would be uneasy for us.

281
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,580
Since this is a strict order from His Majesty,

282
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,240
you may be able to move up in ranks if you capture Sim Heon.

283
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,690
How can I help you, sir?

284
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,390
First of all, gather all information on Sim Heon.

285
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,310
Ten years ago, no...

286
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,560
Starting from 20 years ago. All of it.

287
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,080
Unni!

288
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,250
Commander Nam is here.

289
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,380
I came to say thank you.

290
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,540
I have several questions for you also.

291
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,280
The first part was just for manners,

292
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,910
and the latter part is your real reason for coming.

293
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,880
I looked into Sim Heon

294
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,990
and found out he worked at Giringak as a child.

295
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,910
What was your relationship with him?

296
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,840
Well?

297
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,000
So much time has passed.

298
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,530
I personally took care of him when he was roaming the streets as a beggar.

299
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,490
But he ungratefully got caught while stealing jewelry.

300
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,130
He ran away when the mistress was about to cut off his legs.

301
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,820
According to the rumor,

302
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,160
they say he got caught while running away with you.

303
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,320
Run away.

304
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,150
Mistress says she will cut off your legs.

305
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,330
I said run away!

306
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,900
Hurry!

307
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,030
They don't call it a rumor for no reason.

308
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,040
When the story floats around like the wind,

309
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,020
the rumors become completely outrageous.

310
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,560
Where is your mistress from that time?

311
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,400
She died ten years ago.

312
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,680
Robbers broke into Giringak.

313
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,800
She was stabbed to death that night.

314
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,110
Ten years ago, huh?

315
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,140
What day...

316
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,950
was it exactly?

317
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,830
It was October 11th of...

318
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,310
Year of the Monkey.

319
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,030

320
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,330
Unni!

321
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,850
No...

322
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,960
Coincidentally...

323
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,440
so many people...

324
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,730
died that night.

325
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,970
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

326
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,490
Is that not bloodstains?

327
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,340
You must still be suspicious of me.

328
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,710
Did you already forget that I saved you, sir?

329
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,090
I do not know what you are trying to get from Maiden Kang.

330
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,390
But if that endangers her,

331
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,940
I will not idly sit back and watch.

332
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,380
A comb is in a half-moon shape.

333
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,460
It means you are asking the person to be your other half.

334
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,570
Do you intend on tying the knot with the ringleader of smugglers or something?

335
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,060
That is none of your concern.

336
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,170
Her Ladyship cannot live an ordinary noble life.

337
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,300
You know that better than anyone, Young Master.

338
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,490
You will have to give up everything.

339
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,090
Family.

340
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,380
Honor.

341
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,260
And perhaps...

342
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,070
even your life.

343
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,380
It does not matter to me.

344
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,000
I found out that...

345
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,220
I owe my life to Maiden Kang.

346
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,820
Did you look around?

347
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,840
He was not in other rooms or the storage shed.

348
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
He has to be in Giringak.

349
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,300
He vanished like a ghost in the area.

350
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,650
How could he vanish so fast when he has been shot?

351
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,250
Let us search the area further.

352
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,510
Was it you?

353
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,750
The one who saved the inspector?

354
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,350
You also involved that girl into this?

355
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,000
How much longer do you think the Elder would be in the dark?

356
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,770
You should worry about yourself first.

357
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,480
You lost all your money

358
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,720
and failed to kill that inspector.

359
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
You also failed to capture that lady.

360
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,280
Do you think Elder will give you another chance?

361
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,310
Woon Sim, you...

362
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,040
There are only two endings for a hunting dog.

363
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,080
Get eaten up after the hunt is over

364
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,210
or bite the owner, then live as a wild dog on the run.

365
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,890
You choose.

366
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,170
Kill me now and tell the Elder

367
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,070
or kill the Elder...

368
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,460
and be free.

369
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,890
Where is Woon Sim?

370
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,280
What are you doing?

371
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,860
We obliged you, you gisaeng b****.

372
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,140
How dare you deceive us?

373
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,570
What is going on?

374
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,500
Merchant Sim, it was Woon Sim.

375
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,710
This b**** purchased the distillery,

376
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,580
bought a corpse from beggars

377
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,840
and faked that inspector's death.

378
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,510
It was this b****, Woon Sim.

379
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,000
Is there...

380
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,410
anyone else who knows about that?

381
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,570
I came here directly as soon as I found out.

382
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,070
With this...

383
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,800
neither you nor the Elder will die anytime soon.

384
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120
You must be waiting for your husband.

385
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,150
What the heck? You should not say that to an unmarried woman.

386
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,580
Didn't you miss me?

387
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,390
Gosh. Hey, why would I miss you?

388
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,440
But I missed you.

389
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,510
I had no idea you'd come back as Doyenne's daughter-in-law, though.

390
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,550
I said I'm not.

391
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,910
I'm just acting. Just pretending...

392
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,930
Are you jealous?

393
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,850
Aigoo, jealous?

394
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,700
Now, you're a commoner, and I'm a slave.

395
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,470
You are way above my league.

396
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
I will forget about you.

397
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,470
Hey!

398
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,170
Why did you hit me?

399
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,680
Geez, why! Not again!

400
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,880
Young Master!

401
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,190
- You're home.
- Oh, Choon Gae.

402
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,840
- Young Tenant!
- Geez, scared me!

403
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,580
I have a great idea.

404
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,170
The way to catch Sim Heon.

405
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,840
This.

406
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,750

407
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,170
What is all this?

408
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,230
Oh, do not mind the drawing.

409
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,450

The important part is this.

410
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,780

Place a reward.

411
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,990
Reward?

412
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,720
We have money we stole from him.

413
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,800
We have tens of thousands of nyang left even after giving them out to the distillery owners.

414
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,430
We can capture him with the money we stole from him.

415
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,040
If that infamous Kang Ro Seo

416
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,050
places a reward

417
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,330
because I got stabbed,

418
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,210
what would other people think of our relationship?

419
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,170
Oh, as for that...

420
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,410
I have not thought about it.

421
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,750
Then I will think about it further.

422
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,420
Gosh...

423
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,870
Let's clean.

424
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,410
I will capture Sim Heon...

425
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,940
so would you mind...

426
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,530
just staying safe?

427
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,350
He could try to harm you again.

428
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,610
If I could, I would like to be bait.

429
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,870
I want to bite him and yank out all his hair.

430
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,440
I am holding myself back a lot.

431
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,630
In consideration of your position.

432
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,060
So did you write all this with your face?

433
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,210
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to get back to the Office of Inspector General.

434
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,220
To the Inspector General Office? So suddenly?

435
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,070
Oh, well...

436
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,590
I-I have tons of paperwork I need to review.

437
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,950
I will work through the night, so...

438
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,290
do not worry about me and go to sleep.

439
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:44,790
Wait...

440
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,010
Sir, please let me live...

441
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,230

442
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,550
 The cause of death was a deep cut through his stomach.

443
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,500
 However, Sim Heon had used a dagger.

444
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,640
 Someone else...

445
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,010
 Someone else was there?

446
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,290
 I must find him.

447
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,250
 I must find out who killed Maiden Kang's father.

448
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,920
Are you sure she looked like this?

449
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,090
Yes, Your Highness.

450
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,430
It was definitely the woman who was in the palanquin headed to the Eastern Palace.

451
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,800
She asked to stop by the Medical Service Bureau, but she suddenly ran away.

452
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,220

Medical Service Bureau...

453
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,050
Where is the residence you took her from?

454
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,560
He does not come home?

455
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,640
He seems to spend the night at the Office of Inspector General every night.

456
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,410
For some reason...

457
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,860
he seemed somewhat uncomfortable with me.

458
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,500
Uncomfortable?

459
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,150
So, how should I describe this...

460
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,960
It seems like he's hiding something from me...

461
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,700
And he seems to want to say something to me.

462
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,970
That's not a bad sign, is it not?

463
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,800
- A bad sign?
- You know...

464
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,630
it catches fire so quickly...

465
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,990
gosh, yet it is as cold as pouring water on it.

466
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,500
That's how men are, I hear.

467
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,800
Maiden Kang.

468
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,300
We cannot sit idle at times like this.

469
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,460
We must come up with a plan to captivate his heart.

470
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,910
A plan?

471
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,470
What do you think?

472
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,900
Aren't my lips too red?

473
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,880
It means you should make your mark on him with those red lips.

474
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,350
The procurement merchant who was supplying laborers for the Prohibition Bureau

475
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,390
was that man Sim Heon.

476
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,490
The Prohibition Bureau that is supposed to crack down on alcohol smugglers

477
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,050
has been receiving laborers from a smuggler all this time?

478
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,370
We would have never found out if Commander Nam had been killed,

479
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,620
but this is favorable news to us.

480
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,500
Prepare the Capital Defense Military.

481
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,220
We will strike the Prohibition Bureau.

482
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,470

483
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,960
- Capture everyone!
 - Yes, sir!

484
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,380
 Aigoo, what's going on?

485
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,020
Oh, my!

486
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,360
- My apologies.
- You should watch out.

487
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,000
Aigoo.

488
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,400
Aigoo.

489
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,410
Thank you.

490
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,720
Were there government slaves like him in the Office of Inspector General?

491
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,540
Officer Hwang!

492
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,170
Commander Nam.

493
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,640
Is this the last of the documents on the merchants' inn and procurement?

494
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,630
Yes, sir.

495
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,990
It means we can go home after we review this stack.

496
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,050
Wait a minute.

497
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,210
This is...

498
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,420

499
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,560
 Your Majesty, please abolish the Prohibition Bureau!

500
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,590
The procurement merchant who supplied laborers to the Prohibition Bureau

501
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,580
was an alcohol smuggler named Sim Heon.

502
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,370
This means the Prohibition Bureau and the smuggler were on the same side

503
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,970
and protected the smuggler's interests.

504
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,930
Please abolish the Prohibition Bureau

505
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,500
and get rid of any future harm.

506
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,850
Chief Royal Secretary.

507
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,320
Here is a report from the Commander Nam of the Office of Inspector General.

508
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,170

509
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,470
What?

510
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,930

511
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,650
For loading and unloading of the cargo vessel for the Capital Defense Military,

512
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,070
Sim Heon's procurement merchants provided laborers?

513
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,680
Pardon?

514
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,800
How could that be...

515
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,700
Were you aware of the matter, Commander?

516
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,690

The fact that Sim Heon was a smuggler?

517
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,700

I have no knowledge of it.

518
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,950
How would I know what kind of characters they bring in

519
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,400
for loading and unloading of the cargo vessel?

520
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,870
Seonhyecheong* also used Sim Heon's procurement merchants to recruit laborers.
(Government office in charge of taking in tributary payment for public use)

521
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,950
Minister of Finance, were you also not aware?

522
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,390

What in the world...

523
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,480
Both the Ministry of Naval Transport and Maritime Trading and the Ministry of River and Forestry have also done so.

524
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Minister of Commerce, surely, you must have known.

525
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,140

As for those matters, administrative workers take care of them.

526
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,130
Then workers from each of those ministries should be summoned and be investigated.

527
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,820
Chief Royal Secretary!

528
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,450
Do not distract the main focus of our discussion!

529
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,550
This is about a smuggler supplying laborers for Prohibition Bureau

530
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,600
who should be cracking down on smugglers!

531
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,850
That is not it.

532
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,640
This happened because we used laborers in the first place.

533
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,660
In order to prevent events like this,

534
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,630
reforming the Prohibition Bureau with formally trained military men

535
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,340
is the correct action to take.

536
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,620
Is that not right, His Excellencies?

537
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,550

All right.

538
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,900
Go inside in an orderly manner.

539
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,430
What's wrong? You fulfilled an outstanding achievement.

540
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,800
Prohibition Bureau, Seonhyecheong, Ministry of Civil Engineering,

541
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,080
Ministry of River and Forestry, and  Ministry of Naval Transport and Maritime Trading.

542
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,850
They all say the same thing.

543
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,170
I believe he was an ordinary procurement merchant.

544
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,870
I had no idea he was an alcohol smuggler. It is the truth.

545
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,940
Because he had bribed people everywhere,

546
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,510
it will probably end as a simple embezzlement case.

547
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,750
It looks like not a single shred of evidence points to Sim Heon.

548
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,900
If he were to avoid the crackdowns simply,

549
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,090
paying off the Prohibition Bureau would have been enough.

550
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,100

Why would he have put in so much work in procurement?

551
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,190
I'm not sure.

552
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,340
Does it not seem...

553
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,030
as though he was trying to protect the Prohibition Bureau?

554
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,700
Do not dig further into this matter, and go back to your quarters, Crown Prince.

555
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,600
A personal guard to the crown prince was murdered during the crown prince's mourning period.

556
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,510
Your Majesty would have never regarded this matter so lightly. This is why I am asking.

557
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,630
Please give me an answer, Your Majesty.

558
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,770
I put the matter aside because it was no light matter.

559
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,090
After Sunghyun died

560
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,040
and the poison was discovered in Lady Sukwon's quarters,

561
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,300
how do you think I felt?

562
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,900
The only thing I could have done as a weak king

563
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,630
was to order Ho Yeon to investigate in secret.

564
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,490
 I ordered him to find out how the poison was discovered in Lady Sukwon's quarters

565
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,140
 and to find the true killer who killed Sunghyun.

566
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,080
 However, when even Ho Yeon returned as a corpse,

567
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,090
what more could I have done?

568
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,300
What?

569
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,690
It is the curfew bell.

570
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,670
He's not coming home tonight, either.

571
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,600
Your Highness.

572
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,780
Hearing you call me like that makes me sad.

573
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,490
Have you come by yourself?

574
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,650
And that question makes me even sadder.

575
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,540
It is not like that. Please come inside.

576
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,600
Your face is full of worry.

577
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,420
I brought just the perfect thing for it.

578
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,810
I found what the clerk at the Palace Liquor Storage had hidden.

579
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,950
I was craving a drink just now.

580
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,770
Do you feel more relieved now?

581
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,530
I was just about to die.

582
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,050
What kind of drink is this?

583
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,310
It is as red as the red makeup you wear for the wedding.

584
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,830
It is called gamhongro.*
(Sweet crimson liquor)

585
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,560
The color is crimson

586
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,590
and it tastes as sweet as it can be.

587
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,110
It's bitter, sour, and spicy.

588
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,240
It has a very strong taste.

589
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,950
Try it.

590
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,360
Whoa, it's bitter...

591
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,220
and it's delicious.

592
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,160
Not as good as the liquor my father distilled, though.

593
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,130
What kind of man was your father, Maiden?

594
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,690
He could kill a tiger with his bare hands.

595
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:22,610
He was a courageous man.

596
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,090
On the surface, he seemed tough and harsh.

597
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,330
But he was extraordinarily kind and gentle.

598
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,200
You must miss him.

599
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,840
I do miss him.

600
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,710
Without skipping a day.

601
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,480
But why do you ask me that?

602
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,480
When you read "Byeoljubujeon,"*
(A traditional Korean novel)

603
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,530
the turtle talks about this sweet crimson liquor

604
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,170
when he tries to lure the rabbit into going to the Underwater Palace with him.

605
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,200
"Look, Ms. Rabbit!

606
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,190
Go to the Underwater Palace and drink this sweet crimson liquor with me.

607
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:05,080
I shall give you a title and make you a woman of extremely high status.

608
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,460
Go ahead and refuse.

609
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,400
If you go to the Underwater Palace with me, you will lose your liver.*
(Referring to the novel)

610
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:35,220
The Princess Consort selection is happening currently, is it not?

611
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,870
That is only a connection made for political gain.

612
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,160
Do you remember?

613
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:54,090
 When you first met me...

614
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,250
 - Thank you.
- No need to thank me.

615
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:01,200
 I know full well of the thirst that is only relieved by this.

616
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,850
 You did not see me as a loose girl in a secret distillery

617
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,620
but a person who was craving a drink.

618
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,820
 The next time you saw me, you did not see me as a girl selling liquor...

619
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,490
 It's takju, yet it smells just as good as cheongju.

620
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,210
 It's smooth and leaves no aftertaste.

621
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,230
 but you saw me as someone

622
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,720
talented making good liquor.

623
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,760
Your Highness,

624
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,320
you have friendly and good eyes.

625
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,090
Whoever becomes your woman,

626
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:40,780
you will be able to see the best in her.

627
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,270
Careful.

628
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,660
Coming back from a night out?

629
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,670
Young Tenant.

630
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,940
Numerous wanted poster with your face is all over the streets.

631
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,960
Do you still not understand what you are facing?

632
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,990
Is 100 nyang out for your neck that light to you?

633
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,090
I asked her to go out first.

634
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,460
It is not her fault.

635
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,380
No one saw me.

636
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,240
That is even worse!

637
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,460
You will rest assured since you did not get caught this time.

638
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,180
And when you are relaxed, you will ultimately get caught.

639
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,710
Stop it now.

640
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,900
She returned without any trouble.

641
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,240
She can be more cautious next time.

642
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,960
Then, should I be locked up in here for the rest of my life?

643
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,940
When you do not even come home,

644
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,880
should I live wondering when you will be coming home?

645
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,950
Is that what you want of me?

646
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,210
- That is not it...
- Then why do you not come home?

647
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,380
As though you are avoiding me intentionally.

648
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,990
Oh, are you uneasy now since I'm the ringleader of the smugglers?

649
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,590
- Because I'm a criminal?
- That is not it.

650
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,750
You will continue to avoid me like that...

651
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,450
You will stop seeing me like that.

652
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,910
And someday...

653
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,920
you will even forget that I am here.

654
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,770
Geez, geez, geez...

655
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,130
What a fool.

656
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,270
You made a woman you love cry.

657
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:02,180
Please. Hurry and go back to the palace.

658
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,340
Before I tell Chief Royal Secretary.

659
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,430
How petty are you.

660
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:09,990
You never intend to tell her the truth.

661
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,770
If you hurt Maiden Kang this way,

662
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,380
I will not idly sit back and watch.

663
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,470
What do you mean not idly sit back and watch?

664
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,940
I will have to take her to the Underwater Palace somehow.

665
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,200
Underwater Palace?

666
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,810
It's a long story.

667
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,290
I'm leaving.

668
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,700
I do not need such a thing.

669
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,010
I saw it to my heart's content outside.

670
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,910
I am sure you have never seen it like this.

671
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,050
Are you curious?

672
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,300
No.

673
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,820
I'm not curious at all.

674
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,180
Even insignificant wildflowers look like a painting if you look at them this way.

675
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,720
Even in a stuffy room,

676
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,330
there are things you can do happily like this.

677
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,110
♫  I remember it all  ♫

678
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,560
It's pretty.

679
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,570
It looks like the shadow is wavering under the moonlight.

680
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:14,400
♫  Wandering around in my memory as my emotions rush in  ♫

681
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,090
I am not telling you to stay locked up in the room.

682
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:21,130
All I am saying is that now is the time to be cautious.

683
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,480
I am sorry.

684
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,000
I behaved like a child.

685
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,610
I became anxious that you might

686
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,370
become distant from me.

687
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,310
I am the one...

688
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,410
who feels anxious.

689
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,040
Afraid...

690
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,280
that you may end up hating me.

691
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,850
What are you talking about?

692
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,560
Why would I hate you, Young Tenant?

693
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,590
♫  I desperately want it in my dream  ♫

694
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,180
Do not...

695
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,530
go to the Underwater Palace.

696
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,980
I'll see.

697
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,310
You'll see?

698
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:14,460
Do you mean you will go or you will not go?

699
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,640
I marked you with my lips.

700
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,870
It will erase soon enough.

701
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,990
Then I will just do it again.

702
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,890

703
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,090
Does this not remind you of the old days?

704
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,170
We also participated in the Princess Consort selection.

705
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,440
Of course.

706
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,620
I was so excited to visit the palace.

707
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,360
Is that not so, Royal Consort Gyeongbin?

708
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,140
- Yes...
- Royal Consort Sukeui.

709
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,550
Gyeonbin initially started out working inside the palace.

710
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,020
Oh, you are right.

711
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,440
Gyeongbin did not enter the palace through Princess Consort selection.

712
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,330
Pardon me...

713
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,180
Is not gaining the favor of the King also a difficult matter to achieve?

714
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,210
The royal family has a choice in the Princess Consort selection.

715
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:28,110
As for gaining His Majesty's favor, the king gives his heart to you.

716
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,050
Of course, I am not saying Princess Consort selection is not important.

717
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,980
Giving your heart to someone

718
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,460
and receiving the love in return

719
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,940
is a very difficult and amazing thing.

720
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,340
I recently realized it.

721
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,250
So I will give...

722
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,140
my heart to His Highness

723
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,680
and I would love to receive his heart.

724
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,290
Do they not take off points for speaking too much?

725
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,470
Pardon?

726
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,100
Never mind. Let us go.

727
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,130
The importance of Princess Consort selection is not about the give-and-take of hearts

728
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,350
but about bearing an heir to the throne and supporting the King as his wife.

729
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,790
However...

730
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,650
among us, Gyeongbin is the only one

731
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,470
who produced a prince and bore an heir to the throne.

732
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:38,290
Ladies Sukyong and Sukeui will have to make improvements.

733
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,040
Yes, Your Highness.

734
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,360
But...

735
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,600
Lady Han, not long ago,

736
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,120
I heard you were kidnapped by Kang Ro Seo,

737
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,920
the ringleader of the alcohol smuggler?

738
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:57,630
Pardon?

739
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,200
My Lady, stay here for a moment.

740
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,100
I will call the palanquin carriers.

741
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,970
He said all I had to say was, "Yes, No, I do not know."

742
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,600
Why did they ask so many questions?

743
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,070
Gosh...

744
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:22,450
Your Highness, what brings you here?

745
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:26,810
- By chance, did you come to see–
- I was just passing through.

746
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,960
I wanted to take a stroll...

747
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,430
and I had no idea I would run into you here.

748
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:36,250
Then, are you saying we coincidentally ran into each other?

749
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,540
In this huge palace?

750
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,170
We truly must be destined.

751
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,700
Do you want to become a princess consort that badly?

752
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,670
Pardon?

753
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,310
I will say a word in consideration of you.

754
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,390
Even if you become the Princess Consort,

755
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,820
you will not gain my heart.

756
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,890
Do not worry.

757
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:01,020
I will not beg for your heart, Your Highness.

758
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,580
If I cannot buy it with money

759
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,590
and if I cannot gain it by pleading,

760
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,310
there is only one way to gain your heart.

761
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,840
What are you doing?

762
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,810
I will steal your heart, Your Highness.

763
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:23,400
Wait and see.

764
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,380
You will not even notice that I stole it.

765
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,490
Gosh, you do not have to do this...

766
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,790
All right.

767
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,610
Are you speaking of Prohibition Bureau?

768
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:44,940
Of course, it was formed after the alcohol ban.

769
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:49,230
That was after Crown Prince Sunghyun had passed away.

770
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,930
Was it around October?

771
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:54,810
His Majesty declared directly to the people.

772
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,440

773
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:06,520
 Recently, grain, fish, and meat in Hanyang have been used in alcohol-producing places.

774
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,970
 The reason for people becoming more impoverished

775
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,960
 all stems from producing alcohol.

776
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,250
The rise and fall of this nation

777
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,780
depends on whether the prohibition

778
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,820
is enforced or not.

779
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,360
I, the King, personally admonish prohibition

780
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,400
upon the bureaucracy and the people.

781
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,270
 Your Majesty's grace is boundless.

782
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,990
Since we were mourning Crown Prince's death, I believed prohibition was in order.

783
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,120
But who would have guessed that it would last ten years?

784
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,010
They said it was difficult to enforce prohibition

785
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:41,970
only with each department's workers.

786
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:44,410

Thus the Prohibition Bureau was formed.

787
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,710

At first, they were pretty shabby.

788
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,800
As they grew in size, it has come to this.

789
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:56,210
That was around the time Sim Heon started to procure in Hanyang.

790
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,650
Now that I think about it, you are right.

791
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,270
If it was ten years ago,

792
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,620
Sim Heon must have been around 20 years old.

793
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,910
How could he have gotten a government certificate appearing out of nowhere?

794
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,380
I sense something is fishy here.

795
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,400
Let us go to the Prohibition Bureau.

796
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,910
What are you doing?

797
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,580
I want to write a letter to my brother.

798
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:23,100
Saying that I'm doing fine, so do not worry.

799
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,800
I thought he had not returned yet.

800
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,600
I'm worrying myself to death like this.

801
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,950
I'm sure Brother must be very worried about me.

802
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,600
If he sees this letter when he happens to return home,

803
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,930
would he not feel relieved?

804
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,440

Clean everything up in here!

805
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,020
 Yes, sir!

806
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,490
I will borrow it for a moment.

807
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,070
Aigoo!

808
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,750
Aigoo!

809
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,450
Oh, no...

810
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,650
This is bad...

811
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,130
Wait...

812
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,200
why is this here?

813
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,370
What is going on out of the blue?

814
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:15,790
I received a report that the ringleader

815
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,530
of the smuggling group, Kang Ro Seo, was seen coming into this house.

816
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,300
The commander inspector of the Office of Inspector General is renting this house.

817
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,850
Unless the smuggler is crazy,

818
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:25,550
would she live under the same roof as the commander inspector of the Inspector General Office?

819
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,610
- Move.
- I said she's not here.

820
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,420
I said move out of the way!

821
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,710
 I said she's not here!

822
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,470
- Capture her!
 - Yes, sir!

823
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,220
Kang Ro Seo. It's Kang Ro Seo!

824
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:15,140
 It's Kang Ro Seo!

825
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,940
 Get her!

826
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,340
We tore through pretty much everything.

827
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,620
How long do we have to do this?

828
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,330
Wait and see.

829
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,630
"Scare the snake by stirring the bushes."

830
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,520
We stirred the bushes, so...

831
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,950
the snake will soon lift its head.

832
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,250
What are you doing right now?

833
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,890
 Stop right there!

834
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,510
 Stop!

835
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,240
 Stop!

836
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,570
 Get her!

837
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,270
 Get her!

838
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,740

839
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:14,310

840
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:16,570
 You seem to be an important person.

841
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,320
 Why do you hide me?

842
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,780
 Please save me.

843
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,100
 Be sure to wrap things up nicely so you are not caught by small things.

844
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,220
 All this was for your sake, Your Highness!

845
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,140
 Do you think they will spare Royal Consort Gyeongbin's life?

846
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:31,060
 I will do whatever you say, Uncle.

847
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,480
 So please, let her live...

848
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,160
 Please spare her life.

849
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,540
 If anyone is an obstacle for your future,

850
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,610
 even if that person is your flesh and blood,

851
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,700
 you must be able to kill him.

852
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,770
 The person behind you...

853
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:46,020
 Who is the person giving you orders?

854
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,170
 Why do you have this, Young Tenant?

855
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,280
 Say something!

856
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,840
 Why do you have this, Young Tenant?

857
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,090
 I'm sorry.

858
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,720
 What are you sorry about?

859
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,980
 It is all my fault.

860
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,660
 There is no way he is my son.

861
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,250
 That is impossible.

862
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,400
