1
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,320
 Criminal Nam Young ran away with the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers, Kang Ro Seo.

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,950
Their crimes weigh heavy.

3
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,410

An official who receives his salary from the country hiding the criminal

4
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,060
  and running away with her

5
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,200
 is the same as deceiving the King and breaking the law.

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,160

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,130
 As with the criminal,

8
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:03,600
 anyone who hides him or helps him will also be punishable by death

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,500
Your Highness.

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,690
 so that the law of the country remains firm.

11
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,040
 Have the soldiers of the Prohibition Bureau search in and outside the capital

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,860
 to arrest the criminals.

13
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,180

Furthermore, any disloyal subject who does not take the King’s command seriously

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,800
 shall be punished severely.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,420
 This is to prevent the sly ones from attempting to confuse the law

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,200
and disarray the politics. Remember these commands.

17
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,720
So this Monkey indeed killed Father

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,630
and the Monkey

19
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,360
is the Chief Royal Secretary?

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,920
Yes, Brother.

21
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,280
I must go end the Chief Royal Secretary’s life myself.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,640
Sit down, Brother.

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,610
I will.

24
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,250
Do you remember anything else?

25
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,990
Remember?

26
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,030
Well...

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,120
Oh, now that I think about it, he did seem quite different from his usual self.

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,520

29
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,230

30
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,240
Father, the persimmons on the persimmon tree have ripened.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,870
Have some.

32
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,190
Father.

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,660
Oh, Hae Soo.

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,090
Father, is something the matter?

35
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,490
It’s nothing.

36
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,480
I must go to the temple to check on something.

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,740
Have dinner with Ro Seo.

38
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,130
Now that I think about it,

39
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,820
 there was a sign of a ripped page in Guard Kang’s Inspection Log.

40
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,190
He said he must go to the temple?

41
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,570
Yes.

42
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,530
But why did he inscribe this in seal script?

43
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,390
It’s only used in identification seals or tombstones.

44
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,290

45
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,500

46
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,730
If it intended to point out Chief Royal Secretary,

47
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,310
he could have just written his name.

48
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,280
The seal script is familiar to me, so I overlooked it.

49
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,570
Don’t do that.

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,290
Was it here?

51
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,360
The place where my father saved you?

52
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,770
 You must never come out of there.

53
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,210
It was here.

54
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,920
What was it that my father...

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,530
wanted to check here?

56
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,180
There used to be ancestral tablets here.

57
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,790
Ancestral tablets?

58
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,770
When I came here last time, there were ancestral tablets without names here.

59
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,160
Ancestral tablets without names…

60
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,990
How unsettling.

61
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,780
What else? Is there anything else that changed?

62
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,740
Wait.

63
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,530
Here, light over here.

64
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,710
This is…

65
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,690
 A rat ate what Jang brought to Judge Lee and died.

66
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,980
 He said he bought it to use at the temple.

67
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,770
It's the last page of Father's Inspection Log.

68
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,330
This was it.

69
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,080
What your father tried to tell us.

70
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840

71
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,700
Look.

72
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,180
I have toppled the officials' authority

73
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,130
and righted the strong royal authority.

74
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,500
I was hoping it wasn't you.

75
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,790
I also hoped you would not find out until the end.

76
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,890
Why did you do it?

77
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,640
So why did you kill the Crown Prince...

78
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,930
It was for this country.

79
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,950
Due to His Highness's sacrifice,

80
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,460
His Majesty made up his mind to pursue the alcohol ban.

81
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,750
Finally, we have the means to create the King's personal army.

82
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,810
By creating a law that cannot be kept

83
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,840
and turning countless people into criminals?

84
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,450
Who is that country for?

85
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,020
It is only sacrifice needed for change.

86
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,740
What will change if we only talk of changing Joseon?

87
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,730
It was for this country

88
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,910
that I made this excruciatingly painful decision.

89
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,560
Ho Yeon.

90
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,560
Forget the past...

91
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,170
and side with me.

92
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,680
If we work together,

93
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,870
we can change Joseon.

94
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,750
I see that your Joseon...

95
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,830
is without friends nor its people.

96
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,010
It is not late to confess everything to His Majesty and accept your punishment.

97
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,660
That is the only way for you to atone for your crimes.

98
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,260
I cannot overturn the soil when the seeds have already been planted.

99
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,710
I beg you.

100
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,710
Do not make me turn you into a traitor with my own hands.

101
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,790
Ho Yeon.

102
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,730
Do not discard me. Not you, too.

103
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,710
If you will not go,

104
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,980
I have no choice but to drag you there.

105
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,760
You were a friend who shared my beliefs.

106
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,680
Why did you do it?

107
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,450
You should have joined me.

108
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,680
You were the one who discarded me.

109
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:27,000
"I confirmed that Judge Lee Shi Heum bought green pigment from Interpreter Jang.

110
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,080
I bought a small portion of the pigment and checked,

111
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
and it was without a doubt poison.

112
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,060
The pigment makes the eyes burn

113
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,390
and is unbelievably vivid and sickening green."

114
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,790
"The pigment makes the eyes burn

115
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,430
and is unbelievably vivid and sickening green."

116
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,150
I saw teacups...

117
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,320
of the same color.

118
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,850
His Majesty is in danger!

119
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,130

Will you kill your own son to save your husband?

120
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,260
 If he dies suddenly, people will suspect he was poisoned.

121
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,280
 Feed it to him little by little every day.

122
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,590
Please do not forgive me.

123
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,800
Do you mean to enter the palace?

124
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,070
You want to face them head-on.

125
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,500
I will reveal the truth.

126
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,870
Then...

127
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,150
I must stack the deck.

128
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,800
Stack the deck?

129
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,790
What will you do now?

130
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,550
The elder will soon find out we betrayed him.

131
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm going to cut him off with my own hands.

132
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,410
- More. 
 - Huh? More?

133
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,990
More!

134
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,180
- Aigoo.
- Go.

135
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,580
Careful, careful.

136
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,690
Careful!

137
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,530
Hyungnim.

138
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,030
I thought we were going to war. Why are we washing rice?

139
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,780
How would I know?

140
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,910
I'm sure our Ladyship has a big picture.

141
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,240
Just follow orders, got it?

142
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,750
Just how much alcohol do you plan to make?

143
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,150
You fight swords with swords,

144
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,320
and you fight alcohol with alcohol, no?

145
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,500

146
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,970
What is the meaning of all this?

147
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,890
Why are the soldiers from the Prohibition Bureau guarding here?

148
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,120
As if they are watching you.

149
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,650
Father.

150
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,860
The truth is...

151
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,210

152
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,250
Here.

153
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,100

154
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,510
Young Master Nam, you're just on time.

155
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,820
- Choon Gae, sit down and eat. 
 - All right.

156
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,670
Sit over here.

157
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,710
Why? Shall I set you a separate table?

158
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,020
No.

159
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,130
The date is set.

160
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,190
Then you must eat more and save up more energy.

161
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,880
Eat up.

162
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,920
Eat up, all of you.

163
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,820
What is this?

164
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,160
Do not worry.

165
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,140
It is not alcohol. It is chrysanthemum tea.

166
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,110
Why have you prepared such a fancy banquet?

167
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,040
You gave us, sons of concubines and middle-class men,

168
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,400
a chance to advance to important positions.

169
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,020
So you are like a father who gave us new life to us.

170
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,060
We prepared this banquet to thank you,

171
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,130
so please do not refuse us.

172
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,440
He is right.

173
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,710
You are our savior, Chief Royal Secretary.

174
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,470
I shall perform the sword dance.

175
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,180
Aigoo.

176
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,270
Aigoo, we get to see Woon Sim's sword dance thanks to you, Chief Royal Secretary.

177
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,080
Merchant Sim.

178
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,580
You better lie back down.

179
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,740
Where's Woon Sim?

180
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,410
Aigoo!

181
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,070
Goodness!

182
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,200
Aigoo. I was surprised.

183
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,050
What is the reason you are doing this?

184
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,730
The monkey symbol in Kang Ro Seo's letter.

185
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,100
Do you know the meaning hidden behind it?

186
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,500
What?

187
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,180
He is your son.

188
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,110
What are you talking about?

189
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,590
I have no children.

190
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,500
No. You do.

191
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,420
You always have.

192
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,710
Your son lived ten years as your dog next to you

193
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,370
and got killed by your own hands.

194
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,290
Do you not know?

195
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,300
- What nonsense— 
 - You!

196
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,210
You killed him.

197
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,220
You could not even call him your son once.

198
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,570
How are you...

199
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,720
Enough, Woon Sim.

200
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,320
Let me go.

201
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,860
Let us stop now.

202
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,460
Let this go.

203
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,470
What is that on your wrist?

204
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,810
My mother engraved it on me as she died.

205
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,830
She said if I showed this to my father,

206
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,200
he would recognize it.

207
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,250
Impossible...

208
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,370
That's impossible...

209
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,280
Even if what you say is true,

210
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,580
your mother discarded me.

211
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,130
Your mother was the one who left that horrible branding on me.

212
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,380
Did you think that was a sign of affection?

213
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,880
What are you doing?

214
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,140
Arrest these two!

215
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,740
It does not matter anymore.

216
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,760
I shall leave with Woon Sim.

217
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,550
Let us leave.

218
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,050
You wench!

219
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,200
No!

220
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,150
Your Excellency, are you all right?

221
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,410
You don't like getting bloodstain on you.

222
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,970
No!

223
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,090
I just...

224
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,740
didn't want to run anymore and stay by your side.

225
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,460
I'm sorry...

226
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,240
for making you wait.

227
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,820
No!

228
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,350
No...

229
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,430
No...

230
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,740
There is no way he is my son.

231
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,430
That's impossible.

232
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,810
Impossible.

233
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,930
Do not think you won.

234
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,440
Everything you have built will shatter to the ground.

235
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,940
No one...

236
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,380
and nothing will be left by your side!

237
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,560
I do not need what I do not want.

238
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,030
I will obtain only what I desire.

239
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,260
This time...

240
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,470
I won't let you leave alone.

241
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,890
I'm not going to wait anymore.

242
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,280
♫  It can't be a lie  ♫

243
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,940
♫  Tell me it's a lie  ♫

244
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,680
♫  Say anything  ♫

245
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,400
♫  Even a lame lie, I don't care if it's an excuse  ♫

246
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,200
♫  If it's a lie, embrace me  ♫

247
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,120
♫  Remember our love  ♫

248
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,440
♫  Laugh and tell me it's a joke  ♫

249
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,550
♫  Please tell me it's a lie  ♫

250
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:47,640
♫  The people passing by are unchanged  ♫

251
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:59,470
♫  I'm left standing alone here, the day stopped  ♫

252
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,170
♫  It's a lie, right?  ♫

253
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,115
♫  Tell me it's a lie  ♫

254
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,230
This one's ready to go!

255
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,770
What are you doing over there?

256
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,510
Stop right there!

257
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,890
We must wait for them to move as we want them to.

258
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,100
They scattered alcohol around the capital last night and disappeared.

259
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,350
But no one reported it,

260
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,470
so we cannot be certain who drank or did not drink alcohol.

261
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,230
Your Excellency!

262
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,480
There is trouble! Alcohol is springing from the wells.

263
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,290
Alcohol is springing from the wells?

264
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,740
The unused wells that were dried up suddenly began springing alcohol.

265
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,580
Gwanchon, Maehwa Village, Uhee Village,

266
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,310
Seohak Village, Daesa Village, Changsun Village, Gurigae...

267
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,210
We have no idea how many more there are.

268
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,060
 Do not think you won.

269
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,830
 No one...

270
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,410
 and nothing will be left by your side!

271
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,590
I can guess where all that alcohol was made.

272
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,080
Break their spirits to attack their weakness.

273
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,910
There is no need to arrest them all.

274
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,320
Arrest three so we can set an example.

275
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,980
 Goodness!

276
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,540
And only leave the minimum number of soldiers guarding the gates

277
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,520
and gather them all here.

278
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,090
 You can kill everyone at the distillery.

279
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,500
We shall strike Kang Ro Seo's distillery.

280
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,370
Will they really cut off their heads?

281
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,850
Aigoo. What were we supposed to do when alcohol was springing from the wells?

282
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,660
T-that!

283
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,240
Will their heads be cut off for drinking?

284
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,760
Welcome.

285
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,520
I hear alcohol was circulating in the capital last night.

286
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,030
Are you all well?

287
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,890
Watch closely.

288
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,170
See what happens when one defies the King's command.

289
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,540
I shall set an example

290
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,600
with everyone as a witness.

291
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,450
He's really going to cut their heads off.

292
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,080
I must stop him.

293
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,290
No, Ro Seo. What will you do by charging in now?

294
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,410
He's right, My Lady.

295
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,190
Our job was to lure the soldiers outside.

296
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,320
Let us wait and see a little longer, My Lady.

297
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,490
Young Master Nam will send us news soon.

298
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,530
Cuckoo!

299
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,960
Cuckoo!

300
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,630
Cuckoo!

301
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,030
Did you grab the royal seal?

302
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,430
Yes, Your Highness.

303
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,890
Then, shall we go?

304
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,980
Tutor Nam!

305
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,490
You are here.

306
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,790
Your Highness.

307
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,690
This is the royal seal.

308
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,170
Take this straight to the Queen.

309
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,780
You do realize...

310
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,240
it will be treason if we get caught with it. Treason.

311
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,040
Treason.

312
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,330
Don't speak nonsense!

313
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,010
Most of the soldiers left,

314
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,230
but you must be careful.

315
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,810
Do not worry.

316
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,990
I have learned how to fight by getting beat up by Your Highness.

317
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,720
Go. You must not be late.

318
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,960
I will.

319
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,130
Let us go.

320
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,550
 We will run away.

321
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,180
Run away?

322
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,520
I thought about what I could do that would be best at the moment.

323
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,040
I became the Crown Prince

324
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,910
through my uncle's crimes.

325
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,960
The person involved cannot punish the criminal.

326
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,200
But on the other hand, Uncle's power

327
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,210
only derives from the fact that I am the Crown Prince.

328
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,480
If I do not exist, Uncle will become nothing.

329
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,810
Princess Consort and I shall escape the palace.

330
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,570
And then,

331
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,610
the person who can take over the royal seal

332
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,750
is Your Highness.

333
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,610
Did you also agree to this?

334
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,870
But I have one request.

335
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,590
We are doing this to save everyone.

336
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,770
So...

337
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,380
please protect Royal Consort Gyeongbin's life.

338
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,020
The Crown Prince is missing!

339
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,530
Execute the criminals.

340
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,670
Is that not Kang Ro Seo?

341
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,980
Kang Ro Seo?

342
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,390
It's Kang Ro Seo.

343
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,200
- It is Kang Ro Seo.
- It really is Kang Ro Seo.

344
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,100
That's Kang Ro Seo.

345
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,960
Kang Ro Seo?

346
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,770
- Aigoo.
- Kang Ro Seo...

347
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,560
I was the one who distributed the alcohol.

348
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,150
Why would you execute them?

349
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,920
If you are to execute anyone, it should be me.

350
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,360
I expected as much,

351
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,600
but you have walked here yourself without any fear.

352
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
Have they committed a crime worthy of death?

353
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,330
Is it punishable by death to defy the alcohol ban?

354
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,310
A ban is commanded by the King.

355
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,040
If defying the King's command is not a crime punishable by death,

356
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,120
then what else is punishable by death?

357
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,280
No matter what the ban,

358
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,050
it is justifiable if it is for the people.

359
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,040
The alcohol ban is justified to prevent extravagance

360
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,160
and improve the nature of people. The justification for ethics.

361
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,490
However, is that so important that people should lose their heads over it?

362
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:19,680
You know that the alcohol ban cannot be perfectly abided by.

363
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,280
Who was it that created a law that cannot be kept

364
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,900
and pushed the people to become criminals?

365
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,700
If the law only exists to ban and punish,

366
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,270
who is that law for?

367
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,750
 By creating a law that cannot be kept

368
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,940
 and turning countless people into criminals?

369
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,670
 Who is that country for?

370
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,610
 I see that your Joseon

371
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,610
 is without friends nor its people.

372
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,930
Who goes there?

373
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,210
All right. Remember.

374
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,360
If we are caught here, we will be accused of treason and die.

375
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,680
Hurry and go.

376
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,040
We shall take over here.

377
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,340
I would rather die by the sword than die from the crime of treason.

378
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,170
We cannot hold them long. Go to the Queen!

379
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,760
Punishing and banning.

380
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:40,480
That is the law, and that is power.

381
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,590
You could have saved your life if you had stayed low.

382
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,100
So this is what it has come to.

383
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:21,010
You cannot know what will happen until we reach the end.

384
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,640
Stop!

385
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,590
 Stop!

386
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,170
 This is ridiculous!

387
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,160
You drank yesterday, too!

388
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,310
 I saw him!

389
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,580
I saw it all!

390
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,430
I saw it as well!

391
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,340
I saw them!

392
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,480
If you will execute anyone, execute him first!

393
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,390
Let go of the prisoners!

394
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,970
Let them go!

395
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,190
Let them go!

396
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:55,130
It seems the one who needs to stay low is you, Monkey.

397
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,300
Arrest everyone who defies the command!

398
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,940
Stop!

399
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,010
The Queen has commanded to arrest the traitor, Lee Shi Heum.

400
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,610
Minister of Defense!

401
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,260
What do you mean?

402
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,840
Who knows?

403
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,660
The Crown Prince has escaped the palace in secret.

404
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:48,810
What?

405
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,710
What else could we do?

406
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:55,160
The Crown Prince is not at the palace, so we must follow the Queen's orders.

407
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,270
Arrest him.

408
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,070
 - Yes, sir! 
- Stand back!

409
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,070
I must meet with the Queen myself.

410
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,590
What is the meaning of this?

411
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,510
Where is His Highness the Crown Prince?

412
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,120
I am not the one who should be answering questions,

413
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,310
but you, Chief Royal Secretary.

414
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,510
Have you teamed up with him to sneak out the Crown Prince?

415
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,080
What are you all doing?

416
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,990
Commander Nam sides with Kang Ro Seo, the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers.

417
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,550
Arrest the criminal Nam Young!

418
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,330
Chief Royal Secretary Lee Shi Heum

419
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:29,060
is poisoning the King.

420
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,970
Do you acknowledge your crime?

421
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,820
Insolence! You are slandering the Crown Prince and me!

422
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,930
- They are all lies. 
 - Then...

423
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,850
is this also a lie?

424
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,450
What about that teacup?

425
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,040
The green pigment mixed into the glaze of this teacup

426
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,980
is a pigment from the West.

427
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,950
It looks ordinary to the eyes,

428
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,340
but in fact,

429
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,760
it is a highly concentrated poison.

430
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,220
Chief Royal Secretary specially manufactured this teacup from years ago

431
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,350
and gifted it to His Majesty.

432
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,870
It is not true!

433
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,150
Gyeongbin will question you on the rest of the truth.

434
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,110
- Your Majesty. 
 -  Your Majesty.

435
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,890
Do you have anything else to say?

436
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,830
Have you discarded me?

437
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,530
Forgive me, Brother.

438
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,430
Between my son and my husband,

439
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,200
how could I choose only one?

440
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,880
Not only did you disarray the subjects and court with your sly tricks,

441
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,580
but you also tried to poison me.

442
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,200
I retract traitor Lee Shi Heum's title and return him to his lowly status

443
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,430
and I sentence him to dismemberment.

444
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,170
No.

445
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,070
No.

446
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,820
Stop, stop!

447
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,260
Your Majesty!

448
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,420
Think about this.

449
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,550
If it were not for me,

450
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:25,840
do you think you could have maintained your throne?

451
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,540
If it were not for me?

452
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,560
And you are a mere concubine's son.

453
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,830
Do you think you could have dreamed of becoming an official at court?

454
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,950
And you!

455
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,080
Would you have dared dream of becoming a literati official as a middle class?

456
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,850
Why are you all silent?

457
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,430
Insolence!

458
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,780
Stand back.

459
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,280
Stand back!

460
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,590
Let me go.

461
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,540
Let me go.

462
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,300
I said, let this go!

463
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,000
Let me go!

464
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:27,780
When shall we return?

465
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,560
It seems we must stay like this a little longer.

466
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,720
Then...

467
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,490
we can stay here a bit longer.

468
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,010
His Majesty commands to lift the alcohol ban.

469
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,290
Aigoo!

470
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,420
 Hurrah!

471
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,250
My Lady!

472
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,680
Aigoo, how festive!

473
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:57,800
 Kang Ro Seo has played a key role in revealing traitor Lee Shi Heum's crimes.

474
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,400
 They say one's past is forgotten through their contributions,

475
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,780
 so Kang Ro Seo will no longer be guilty of her crimes.

476
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,900
Are you here to tell me that I was wrong and to laugh at me?

477
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:34,470
I'm here to give this to you.

478
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,000
It's the last page of Guard Kang's Inspection Log that he hid at Mangwolsa Temple before he died.

479
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,990
It states that you obtained the green pigment from Interpreter Jang

480
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,490
and that the pigment is poison.

481
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,460
Also, with the green pigment,

482
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,380
you would have poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun.

483
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,770
So...

484
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,110
are you trying to make me realize my wrongdoings by doing this?

485
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:30,870
My guess is that he was trying to give this to you.

486
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,950
Look at the back.

487
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,810
Without a friend to share a drink with,

488
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:49,030
how else shall I forget the pain of 100 years?

489
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:53,250
On one side, he lists your crimes.

490
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:57,450
But on the other side, he writes how he misses you.

491
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,970
Perhaps on that day,

492
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,990
Guard Kang...

493
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,210
was more pained...

494
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,230
that he lost a friend than losing his own life.

495
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,930

496
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,940
The flowers are falling already.

497
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,550
The flowers fall as soon as they bloom

498
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,050
and the moon disappears as soon as it rises.

499
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,090
It seems life is meaningless.

500
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,560
The flowers may fall as soon as they bloom

501
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,300
and the moon may disappear as soon as it rises,

502
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,680
but having a friend to share a drink with even in old age

503
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,710
would be enough, no?

504
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:20,910
They say sharing a drink with a good friend makes one forget the pains of 100 years.

505
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,190
Then you must drink more.

506
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:26,020
I keep drinking by myself.

507
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,990
You think drinking as much as a tiger is something to boast about?

508
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,930
I mean as subjects serving the same King,

509
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,600
as friends sharing a drink,

510
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,530
I hope our friendship to last forever.

511
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,120
I would like a drink.

512
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,690

513
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,570

That's what happened, Father.

514
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,490
After the baby prince was born,

515
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:48,960
the Crown Prince passed down the Eastern Palace to Prince

516
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,620
 and left on an excursion around the Mount Kumgang.

517
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,700
Take me with you to Mount Kumgang.

518
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,950
My dear, your attire...

519
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,860
If I cannot go as a woman, I can go as a man.

520
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,560
My Lady, you cannot.

521
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,290
What are you doing?

522
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,230
Will you not go to Mount Kumgang?

523
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,380
What are you doing...

524
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,470
Grand Prince!

525
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,300
- My Lady! 
 - Grand Prince!

526
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,530
Grand Prince!

527
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,310
My Lady!

528
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,000
His Majesty is still not fully recovered,

529
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,470
and Prince is still young,

530
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,780
so the Queen is ruling in their place.

531
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,010
And about Brother...

532
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,250
Return to your posts.

533
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,920
 Yes, sir.

534
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,590
One moment!

535
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,820
What shall I do?

536
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,070
You?

537
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,810
Well...

538
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,700
Do you not...

539
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,280
remember getting drunk at the new officials' banquet and grabbing me by the collar?

540
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,590
Pardon?

541
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,380
Dismissed.

542
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,540
W-wait...

543
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,440
What...

544
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,080
Should we have the banquet again...

545
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,160
No, no. Don't do that. Don't.

546
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,130
W-wait, wait.

547
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,400
Give me another chance to treat you.

548
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,720
I will do anything.

549
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,730
- You mean it?
- Yes.

550
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:50,880
I appreciate any help you can provide.

551
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,740
No.

552
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,110
I can't do it!

553
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:56,460
I won't!

554
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,700
No!

555
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,870
 He will do well, I suppose.

556
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:05,990
Maiden.

557
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,570
What are you thinking about?

558
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:27,910
I just wondered if this ordinary scenery is what Father tried to protect.

559
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,040
So how long will you stay unemployed?

560
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,820
Unemployed?

561
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,850
I am on leave to focus on my studies.

562
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,040
After His Highness was dethroned,

563
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,640
I was fired from the Crown Prince tutor position.

564
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,620
My heart has never been more at ease.

565
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,300
The sky is clear,

566
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,230
the breeze is gentle,

567
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,210
the stream is calm.

568
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:56,530
Over there, Young Master Nam!

569
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,200
Young Master Nam?

570
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,140
Young Master Nam... N-Nam...

571
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,020
T-that Choon Gae, did he...

572
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,970
Did he just call me Young Master Nam?

573
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:11,050
Geum bought Choon Gae a noble title.

574
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,920
How despicable...

575
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,700
How could you sell and purchase your father and ancestors?

576
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,560
They sold it right away to me.

577
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,180
Holding my hands behind my back and acting pretentious is being a nobleman, after all.

578
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,520
Right. I cannot tell who is noble and who is not.

579
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,230
You look the same.

580
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:32,840
Goodness, the whole nation will become nobles.

581
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,920
If everyone becomes nobles, it will no longer mean anything anymore.

582
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:42,300
We should discuss this over a drink or two.

583
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,060
Two coins for a glass of takju!

584
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,690
Takju for sale!

585
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:47,910
There he is.

586
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,810
Boss Gye! Four glasses of takju here.

587
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,890
My Lady.

588
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,380
So this is how we meet, by coincidence.

589
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,940
I suppose our fates are connected.

590
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,640
- Four glasses. 
 - Four glasses!

591
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,110
- No, two bottles. 
 - Two bottles!

592
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,590
My Lady.

593
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,520
No, Kang Ro Seo!

594
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,120
Hyungnim!

595
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,390
Goodness!

596
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:22,980
Boss Gye!

597
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,160
Aigoo.

598
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,390
Boss Gye, are you all right?

599
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,910
Boss Gye.

600
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,270
Boss Gye.

601
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,380
 No!

602
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,750
 A poisonous mushroom that ruins the intestines with just one bite.

603
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,700
 Stop!

604
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:56,280
 It took so much for me to grow this hair...

605
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:07,530
That 100 nyang lady...

606
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:13,850
Poisonous mushroom...

607
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,550
At the cliff...

608
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:22,260
The ones who pushed me...

609
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,830
That color doesn't suit you.

610
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,220
- Run! 
 - Maiden!

611
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,210
Oh, my gosh!

612
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,300
Where are you going?

613
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,040
Come back here!

614
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,470
 Hyungnim!

615
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:40,850
 Hyungnim!

616
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:46,600

617
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,740
Aigoo.

618
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,440
The moon is up.

619
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,200
It's a full moon.

620
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,270
Young Tenant.

621
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,430
A coarse comb...

622
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,960
takes the shape of half a moon,

623
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,620
so it means 'be my other half.'

624
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:37,910
Will you be my other half?

625
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,270
Not sure.

626
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,710
Not sure?

627
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:53,390
Think about this carefully.

628
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,490
Nothing good will come of becoming involved with me.

629
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,880
I'm already much too involved with you.

630
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,500
Exactly. Think about it more.

631
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,990
If an official with a bright future ahead of him

632
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:07,600
accepts a woman who was a criminal in the past as a wife,

633
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,350
bad rumors will go around, no?

634
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,780
If the water is too clear,

635
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,540
no fish will live in it.

636
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:20,770
I have decided to expand my perspective and accept even the dirty and soiled things.

637
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:24,970
Are you calling me dirty and soiled?

638
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:26,890
No.

639
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,780
No, no, no. That's not what I mean...

640
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,920
I wonder why you would accept a dirty and soiled woman as your other half.

641
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,580
A larva...

642
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,420
lives under the ground eating dirt,

643
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:45,150
but it only eats clean dew drops once it changes into a cicada.

644
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,820
Cicada?

645
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,400
Are you calling me a larva or a cicada?

646
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,840
- What I mean is not— 
 - Enough!

647
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,560
I understand perfectly what you mean.

648
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,570
No, I mean, whether a larva or a cicada,

649
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,880
I love you, Maiden.

650
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,890
Whether in the dirt or clear waters,

651
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:16,760
I do not care, wherever or whatever it is.

652
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,200
I am helplessly...

653
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,360
and hopeless in love with you.

654
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,050
♫  You held my trembling hand  ♫

655
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:33,650
So hurry and answer me. Stop making me wait anxiously.

656
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,910
♫  You excited my meaningless life  ♫

657
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:50,300
♫  You approached me while making my heart flutter  ♫

658
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:56,160
♫  My heart is searching for you  ♫

659
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,720
♫  Your world is coloring my heart  ♫

660
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,540
Poor Young Tenant.

661
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,620
Your future looks to be hopeless.

662
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,280
♫  Who you are, who you are  ♫

663
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,980
♫   The question that fills my heart  ♫

664
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:19,230
♫  You came to me after so many days have passed  ♫

665
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:27,120
♫  My meaningless day is being filled with you  ♫

666
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:32,310
♫  I want to know you more, your heart  ♫

667
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:37,570
♫  I wonder if you feel the same  ♫

668
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:45,230
♫  Even in the future, I want to be with you  ♫

669
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:49,570
♫  Who you are, whoever you are  ♫

670
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:53,080
♫  Only because it is you  ♫

671
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,870
♫  No matter how many days pass  ♫

672
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:00,530
♫  I will stay by your side  ♫
