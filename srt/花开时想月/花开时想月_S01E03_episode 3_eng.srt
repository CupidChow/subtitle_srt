1
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,200
Bring it this way.

2
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,980

3
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,760
 Have we met somewhere before?

4
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,320
He's here, right?

5
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,590
Hold him down!

6
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,240
Hold onto him! How can you lose him?

7
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,580
Aigoo!

8
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,920
S***! Not me, knuckleheads! Get him! Him!

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,570
Stop right there!

10
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,550
Give up now!

11
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,270
Stop right there!

12
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,120
You really don't have any coins left?

13
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,590
Yeah, not even one.

14
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,030
What are you going to do now?

15
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,220
I have to kick him out.

16
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,140
How can I live in the same house with an inspector?

17
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,220

18
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,150
I told you to find the Pub on Wheels,

19
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,230
yet you let the inspector discover the mokbingo*? 
(Iced storage)

20
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,640
How would I know they would run in that direction?

21
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,870
We lost 100 liquor jars.

22
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,360
What would we do about our business?

23
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,810
You stink.

24
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,750
Leave the Prohibition Bureau.

25
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,350
Why does an inspector from the Office of Inspector General go out to crack down on prohibition?

26
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,950
S***...

27
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,120
His Majesty recognizes your accomplishment.

28
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,410
He bestows this wardrobe.

29
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,790
His Majesty's grace is boundless.

30
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,880
So, have you set on the answer to my question I asked you last time?

31
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,210
 For His Majesty and the Crown Prince,

32
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,040
 I will willingly become this pair of scissors.

33
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,350
 Could you also be someone like that?

34
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,140
Please allow me a little more time.

35
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,590
The reason why...

36
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,650
His Majesty placed you in the Office of Inspector General despite your inexperience

37
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,830
is because he has an expectation of you seeing how upright you are.

38
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,370
You're an inspector who should be investigating wrongdoings and corruption by government officials.

39
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,610
How much longer will you be clamping down on prohibition?

40
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,510
I came so close to arresting the culprit.

41
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,630
Please allow me to wrap up the case.

42
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,980
All right.

43
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,340
Do not keep me waiting too long.

44
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,190
What the heck is going on...

45
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,090
Are you kidding me?

46
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,690
I told you to make him leave.

47
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,540
Yet he makes a name for himself?

48
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,130
M-my apologies, Your Highness.

49
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,520
He was initiated into the organization through this incident. What now?

50
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,990
S-so...

51
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,350
Gosh, what should I do?

52
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,100
What about it?

53
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
Can you think now?

54
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,030
Well... um...

55
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,510
You can't?

56
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,350
You want to get a beating until you come with an idea?

57
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,530
Please calm down, Your Highness!

58
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,950
You ducked?

59
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,990
Do not do this, Your Highness...

60
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,940
That eyeball was as black as a Go marble and sparkly.

61
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,090
Those eyes looked so familiar.

62
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,450
Human eyes are all black and sparkly.

63
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,640
That Pub on Wheels and the liquor jars...

64
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,690
Selling that much liquor dragging on wheels. Isn't that too ineffective?

65
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,230
Gosh, people go crazy not being able to buy it.

66
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,490
The way they sell it isn't the problem.

67
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,560
Just spit it all out.

68
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,360
Goodness, my apologies!

69
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,040
Why am I the only one sitting separately?

70
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,870
You said there should be a distinction between men and women. Between masters and servants.

71
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,650
You said you don't like to share a table.

72
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,360
Since there should be a distinction between men and women, you could sit separately.

73
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,330
Since there should be a distinction between masters and servants, Choon Gae could sit separately.

74
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,690
You are just putting the distinction on me alone.

75
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,510
Whether between men and women, masters and servants...

76
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,270
You're the only one who cares about those things.

77
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,380
Wouldn't it make everyone happy if you had your own table?

78
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,350
So since I'm making a fuss about making a distinction,

79
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,420
just be separated alone.

80
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,950
Let's not be like that, and let's eat all together.

81
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,850
It won't taste good if he eats alone.

82
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,410
Never mind! I like eating alone.

83
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,790
It's so comfortable eating alone.

84
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,800
Also, please move out of the room as soon as possible.

85
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
Pardon?

86
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,220
What did you just say?

87
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,300
I tried to endure since I was desperate for money. But I cannot bear it any longer.

88
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,820
I never had it easy renting a room here.

89
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,180
It's small, shabby, and far from my workplace.

90
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,040
You take three nyang a month for food

91
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,690
but serve the same dishes every three days!

92
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,090
That's great, then!

93
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,570
Go to a house that would serve you a feast then!

94
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,120
That's not what I mean! I'm trying to settle down here.

95
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,170
Geez, I can't get the jeotgal* smell out.
(Salted seafood)

96
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,320
Hey, what's this?

97
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,490
I thought a brother and sister lived here.

98
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,560
Many people live here.

99
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,860
What brings you here?

100
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,070
Why else?

101
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,410
Did you think you would live in peace after borrowing someone else's money?

102
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,490
I already paid this month's interest. Twenty nyang.

103
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,080
I've been incredibly unlucky since yesterday.

104
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,410
I'd feel better if you could pay off some principal, not just the interest.

105
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,250
I will be sure to pay you back even if it takes some time.

106
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,360
- So don't do this...
- Everything started when My Lady yanked my hair.

107
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,650
 Give me back my money!

108
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,950
Look, look. Look here.

109
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,820
I...

110
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,130
must have the last word.

111
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,150
So you should pay back the 100-nyang debt, My Lady...

112
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,600
or you should get sold into slavery, My Lady.

113
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,000
Isn't that right?

114
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,760
If you want to keep your fingers, write out a jamae-mungi*. 
(A contract to sell oneself or spouse into slavery)

115
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,510
If you sell off your sister, I'll cancel your 100-nyang debt.
(A contract to sell oneself or spouse into slavery)

116
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,330
You're too old to be sold as a gisaeng, My Lady.

117
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,600
But you might be worth some money in taverns...

118
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,110
What?

119
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,520
Will you pay in their place?

120
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,180
Are you her husband or something?

121
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,170
A husband or whatever.

122
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,580
You should run off before you get stuck with the 100-nyang debt.

123
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,440
You! Do you think I would sell my sister to you?

124
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,820
Gosh, darn it.

125
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,120
- Brother!
- Young Master!

126
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,040
Brother!

127
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,680
How dare you!

128
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,410
- Get lost!
- Shut up!

129
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,560
What?

130
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,700
Want to stab me?

131
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,760
What to do...

132
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,750
I got it first.

133
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,640
You get me all excited if you stare at me like that.

134
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,080
"Daejeon-tongpyeon, hyungjeon.

135
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,670
Yamu-goib-inga, jo."

136
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,540
"If a homeowner kills an intruder who breaks into the house,

137
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,410
do not discuss the action taken by the homeowner."

138
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,070
Who are you?

139
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,870
An inspector from the Office of Inspector General.

140
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,250
An inspector?

141
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,580
Why is an inspector stuffing his face here?

142
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,600
Now that I see you, you're...

143
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,650
What the?

144
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,880
What's your relationship, you two?

145
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,950
Take this.

146
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,970
What are you doing?

147
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,800
You said either hang your head or cut someone else's head when a woman is mocked.

148
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,020
 What are you doing?

149
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,970
 There are only two ways to handle it when a woman is mocked.

150
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,030
 Either you hang your head or cut someone else's head.

151
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,500
 I'm choosing the latter.

152
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,780
Take your position.

153
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,140
Your feet should be as wide as your shoulders.

154
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,670
What? Are you really going to shoot?

155
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,360
Split the strength between two arms pulling and pushing.

156
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,980
Put your right hand under your chin.

157
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,500
You could not miss him even if you tried at this distance.

158
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,030
She's the one who yanked my hair first!

159
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,200
Stop breathing and shoot at the count of three.

160
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,940
One.

161
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,470
Hyungnim...

162
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,500
Two.

163
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,860
Hyungnim!

164
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,930
I'll go.

165
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,490
I'll go, all right?

166
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,190
No matter what the law...

167
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,440
I don't think you should be shooting an arrow right in front of a person.

168
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,530
Look how nobles behave...

169
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,770
Get lost!

170
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,250
Good.

171
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,580
Did I...

172
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,280
do something wrong?

173
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,610
One day suddenly, you start glaring at me.

174
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,580
You frown as soon as you see me while you are smiling.

175
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,070
It seems that you just cannot stand the sight of me.

176
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,720
Did I make a mistake of some sort?

177
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,870
It is not like that. It's just that...

178
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,920
your appearance makes me feel uncomfortable.

179
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,980
What?

180
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,110
Also, if you really want to live here,

181
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,780
go ahead.

182
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,980
My appearance makes her uncomfortable?

183
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,590
I have never heard of such a thing!

184
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,470
Gosh, what? Why? Huh?

185
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,440
You said you were kicking him out.

186
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,790
They say keep your friends close and your enemy closer.

187
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,710
This is why there should be a distinction between a man and a woman.

188
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,140
Everything the elders say is always correct.

189
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,670
I said no.

190
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,290
I had no idea you cared about a man's appearance.

191
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,930
Gosh, I said no! No!

192
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,060
What do you mean, no?

193
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,310
That young master's facial features are much more vivid than our future!

194
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,810
Well, anyway, I don't think we can run Pub on Wheels anymore.

195
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,570
They discovered the mokbingo.

196
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,320
They're clamping down outside the capital city as well.

197
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,560
You're quitting?

198
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,910
My Lady, how about me becoming a commoner?

199
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,400
We have to find another way. We have 20 mal* of takju here.
(Unit of measure)

200
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,040
We must sell this within ten days.

201
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,360
Ten days?

202
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,910
After ten days, it will lose its authentic flavor.

203
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,570
This is a report on the mokbingo case.

204
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,010
Rewrite it.

205
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,040
Again.

206
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,070
Oh-ho? You'll have to rewrite it.

207
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,620
What's with the way you're looking at your high and mighty senior?

208
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,380
Looks like you might throw a punch.

209
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,730
I will...

210
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,680
- rewrite it.
- Yeah.

211
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,480
Inspector Nam.

212
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,400
The montage you spoke of last time has been completed.

213
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,870
Officer Hwang.

214
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,650
- Give it to me.
- Pardon?

215
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,590
Hand it over. Hurry!

216
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,530
Yes, sir.

217
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,790
What was this again?

218
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,000
It is a montage based on the testimonies of the witnesses who saw the Pub on Wheels.

219
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,430
Pub on Wheels?

220
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,400
Who told you to investigate it without my permission?

221
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,400
- Chief!
- Quit this if you want to live!

222
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,020
Why are you taking it this far?

223
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,660
Hurry! Hurry up and spit it out!

224
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,400
You crazy bastard! Just do the things you're told to do! Not the stuff you were not told to do!

225
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,660
Look at this guy. He's a weirdo!

226
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,000
Officer Hwang, open his mouth!

227
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,030
Pardon? Open?

228
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,290
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

229
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,330
- Chief...
- Hey!

230
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,970
I will open your mouth.

231
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,310
Hurry!

232
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,890
Open a little more.

233
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,800
Wait...

234
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,060
Buy a lantern!

235
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,600
A watermelon-shaped lantern for lots of children!

236
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,040
A butterfly-shaped lantern for a match made in heaven.

237
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,440
A peony lantern for wishing for beauty for the ladies.

238
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,270
A jar-shaped lantern for prosperity!

239
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,380
Buy a lantern!

240
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,880
You know the liquor jars that were inside mokbingo?

241
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,610
I wonder where they were meant to go.

242
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,260
Who knows...

243
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,010
I have wish lanterns for the Buddha's Birthday, too!

244
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,580
 Buddha's Birthday.

245
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,810
 Let us meet again then.

246
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,470
Buy a lantern!

247
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,850
Buddha's Birthday?

248
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,670
Gosh, so beautiful.

249
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,020
I'll take this one.

250
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,920
And the pale rose color will be good for the skirt.

251
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,340
Yes, please wait a moment.

252
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,650
What do you think all those jars were for?

253
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,560
 Buddha's Birthday.

254
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,090
 So what?

255
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,380
There is no curfew nor patrols on Buddha's Birthday.

256
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,930
It's the biggest sale day of the year.

257
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,480
All that liquor disappeared!

258
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,270
What do you think would happen to the cost without any liquor in Hanyang?

259
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,040
- Skyrocket.
- Yeah!

260
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,440
Jade Lad said he'd come on Buddha's Birthday.

261
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,270
If we have a few more drinkers with full money pouches,

262
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,710
we can sell out all the leftover jars.

263
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,910
Where would we find those drinkers?

264
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,750
We could start looking for them now.

265
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,870
Are you finished?

266
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,100
Yes. Almost.

267
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,370
Oh, my goodness.

268
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,080
Are you hurt?

269
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,090
We're fine.

270
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,640
What a relief.

271
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,790
These are pointy.

272
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,190
You will get poked if you're not careful.

273
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go now.

274
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,980
Oh, my gosh. What do I do...

275
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,880
Did you see her?

276
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,990
Who is that woman?

277
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,370
It's Woon Sim from Giringak.

278
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,720
Who would say she's over 30 years old with that face of hers?

279
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,020
I'm asking about that man next to her.

280
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,140
Oh, Merchant Shim?

281
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,100
- A merchant?
- Yes.

282
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,010
He owns a merchants' inn in Seogang. We usually call him Merchant Sim.

283
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,780
Chief!

284
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,110
Someone turned himself in, saying he owns the mokbingo.

285
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,040
What? Turn himself in?

286
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,820
Northwest Police Bureau is currently investigating him right now.

287
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,570
We're the ones who discovered mokbingo.

288
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,620
Why would he turn himself at the Northwest Police Bureau?

289
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,010
I heard he's at the Northwest Police Bureau.

290
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,090
Is it okay for us to come in here like this?

291
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,200
I heard he confessed, saying he alone was behind everything.

292
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,820
A hundred jars all by himself?

293
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,620
Do you think that makes sense?

294
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,790
Gosh, when a man's eyes flip out,

295
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,690
there's nothing he couldn't do.

296
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,930
Gosh...

297
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,940
But what is this smell?

298
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,050
Smell?

299
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,400
My goodness...

300
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,970
It smells like salted hwangsegi*. 
(Type of croaker)

301
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,990
Gosh, it's been a while since I climbed mountains. I must be hungry.

302
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,330
Be quiet!

303
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,370
They could not have distilled alcohol here.

304
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,670
To smuggle all this liquor and sell it in the market,

305
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,720
I'm sure he must've had a partner.

306
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,220
Those black eyes I missed last time.

307
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,810
He must be in on it together.

308
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,360
Whoa!

309
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,550
Young Master!

310
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,360
Do you think I'd let you go this time?

311
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,370
What?

312
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,770
Who are you?

313
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,370

314
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,530
Gwangju?

315
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,880
What is a Gwangju person doing here?

316
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,880
 Young Master!

317
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,770
 You rotten scoundrel!

318
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,550
 Stop!

319
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,970
Are you okay?

320
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,110
That rotten scoundrel!

321
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,420
Geez, he's so fast!

322
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,980
Wow...

323
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,830
Are you hurt?

324
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,370
Geez, that rotten scoundrel!

325
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,390
The inspector was roaming around the mokbingo...

326
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,000
There was one more person who was roaming around the area.

327
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,640
What?

328
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,260
I heard the inspector say 'Gwangju' after checking the man's identity tag.

329
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,350
Gwangju?

330
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,720
The word that there is no liquor in Hanyang

331
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,850
must be getting around in Gangnam.

332
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:01,030
I can understand Inspector Nam, who almost caught a culprit last night.

333
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,190
But what's wrong with the Chief?

334
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,740
Did you not hear that the Queen Consort is with a child?

335
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,080
He's a forever-chief since the distinguished officials hate him.

336
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,310
Now that the Queen Consort has conceived,

337
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,740
well, he can kiss his advancement goodbye.

338
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,320
Geez...

339
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,900
I see. That's why.

340
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,420
Inspector Nam, sir.

341
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,860
I completed the montage you described.

342
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,480
Congratulations, Queen Consort.

343
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,240
Thank you.

344
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,220
I have been ashamed to face all of you all this time.

345
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,300
Now, I feel I have saved my face.

346
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,220
Queen, you must produce a prince

347
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,850
for this nation's foundation to be finally standing firm.

348
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,230
Are you saying our nation's foundation is not standing firm now?

349
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,040
I'm saying thicker the root of a tree,

350
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,150
it will not be shaken.

351
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,610
When there was a gusty wind two years ago,

352
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:34,130
a juniper inside the palace snapped.

353
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,470
How could that be due to weak roots?

354
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,390
It was because the trunk was hollow.

355
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,970
Wh-what? Are you saying the Crown Prince is hollow?

356
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,940
Oh, my, Royal Consort Gyeongbin!

357
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,870
I'm merely talking about the juniper that fell two years ago.

358
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,540
We have bamboo.

359
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,960
It may be hollow, but it's green and beautiful all four seasons.

360
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,290
They compare it to a king of integrity.

361
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,200
The Queen is with a child!

362
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,210
All right.

363
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,790
My gosh...

364
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:32,310
Do you think they will leave you alone?

365
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,280
The study of etiquette and courtesy and whatnot...

366
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,570
They will crush you down with all kinds of words.

367
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,980
I...

368
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,610
cannot bear to see such a sight.

369
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,940
So?

370
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,670
Will you kill that unborn baby as well?

371
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,050
My gosh! How could I kill an unborn baby?

372
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,100
They say the one who poisoned Hyungnim was not Lady Sukwon Um.

373
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,110
People say it was actually you, Mother.

374
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,910
What...

375
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,400
are you talking about?

376
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,960
The whole world is talking about it.

377
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,880
Why are you the only person in the dark?

378
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,610
He... he has...

379
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:27,090
He has... no idea how I lived for his sake...

380
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,330
How could he say that to me? How could he?

381
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,530
Please stop your crying. They can hear your cry outside.

382
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,550
I can't even cry?

383
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,600
I can't even cry...

384
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,090
People will misunderstand you if you cry now.

385
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,240
Queen is with a child.

386
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,630
Brother...

387
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,200
Crown Prince–

388
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,920
Stop.

389
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,590
Good.

390
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,570
I hear Royal Consort Gyeongbin cried her heart out because the Queen has conceived.

391
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,830
How could a mother of a crown prince be so...

392
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,850
Did you not hear the rumor?

393
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,280
The day after Crown Prince Sunghyun passed away,

394
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,130
Royal Consort Gyeongbin grilled and ate beef.

395
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,830
No wonder there is a rumor that she poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun.

396
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,480
If so, there is a rumor about Chief State Minister as well.

397
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,540
Saying that is why His Majesty keeps a distance from us.

398
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,800
Come now.

399
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,530
I wonder who makes up such stories.

400
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,460
My goodness...

401
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,410
Anyway, congratulations, Chief State Minister.

402
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,200
You will soon have a great-grandson.

403
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,450
You should throw a celebratory banquet.

404
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,630
Heaven has not abandoned Joseon just yet.

405
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,820
What are you talking about? A banquet?

406
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,050
Gosh, it turned out that way out of the blue.

407
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,960
How about our business tomorrow?

408
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,980
Jade Lad will be there.

409
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,550
Who knows? His hat strap might be made of gold this time.

410
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,860
Queen is the one who conceived. Why are men throwing a banquet?

411
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,730
And why would you have to go there?

412
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,750
Gosh, they don't call the female physician a 'pharmacy gisaeng' for no reason.

413
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,850
We must be the easiest to deal with.

414
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,200
I heard all the gisaengs in town would be there.

415
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,260
They just want us to do all the cleanup work.

416
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,230
All the gisaengs in town are going to be there?

417
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,200
Even that gisaeng, Woon Sim, whom we saw at the Unjongga?

418
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,640
Of course.

419
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,350
Without Woon Sim's sword dance, they don't even count it as a banquet.

420
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,870
You said that the gibang* where Woon Sim lives is the biggest in Hanyang, right?
(Place of business and residence for gisaengs)

421
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,910
Yes. Giringak.

422
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,960
Giringak.

423
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,580
Didn't you say they can't crackdown that place recklessly?

424
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,460
Sure. Since high officials frequent there.

425
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,210
What if we sell our liquor to Giringak?

426
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,540
Not just a few bottles, but all the jars.

427
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,570
What?

428
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,130
I'm sure they purchase a massive quantity of liquor.

429
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,910
In a gibang that sells a lot of liquor,

430
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,480
five liquor jars must not be that big of a deal.

431
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,600
My Lady.

432
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,250
How could your brain be spinning so fast?

433
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,520
Oh, is it because you're a noble?

434
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,010
Whoa, My Lady, I think we'll make about a thousand pieces of gold.

435
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,180
- A thousand pieces of gold?
- Yeah.

436
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,770
A thousand, ten thousand. A fortune!

437
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,310
- You're coming home late!
- Gosh, you scared me!

438
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,900
Gosh, you scared me!

439
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,170
What are you carrying in your hands?

440
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,190
Oh, to make lanterns.

441
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,330
Tomorrow is Buddha's Birthday.

442
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,320
Buddha's birthday.

443
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,000
Will you be making a lantern, too?

444
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,500
Take a look at this, Maiden.

445
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,800
You might recognize his face.

446
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,410
He must be connected to the mokbingo case.

447
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,580
And this guy is extremely malicious.

448
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,090
His eyes look familiar to me.

449
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,930
Be sure to let me know if you happen to see him by chance.

450
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,020
Why are you walking so fast? Did you take a good look at it?

451
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,050
How could you recognize someone just with his eyes?

452
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,810
I'm saying the eyes look familiar.

453
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,140
- Take a good look.
- Gosh, not at all. Not familiar at all.

454
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,300
- Gosh!
 - Take a look!

455
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,970
Take a look. Listen to me...

456
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,700
Maiden! Maiden!

457
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,510
 A carp lantern for the Buddha's Birthday is crafted

458
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,980
a mother's wish for her son to achieve fame and prestige.

459
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,540
Why must I achieve fame and prestige?

460
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,450
In order to love.

461
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,120
Love?

462
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,670
Remember this.

463
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,820
Without heart of love,

464
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,550
learning or service has no meaning.

465
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,230
How does it look?

466
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,480
Okay, we got it.

467
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,290
Be careful.

468
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,610
You're out, Young Master.

469
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,040
What is all this?

470
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,900
It's Buddha's Birthday.

471
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,560
It's a lotus flower-shaped lantern wishing for My Lady's parents' rebirth in paradise.

472
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,200
No. I'm talking about this carp lantern.

473
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,220
Oh, for fame and prestige.

474
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,800
One for Young Master Hae Soo and one for Young Master Young.

475
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,300
Why would she wish for me to achieve fame and prestige?

476
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,910
♫  On May eighth, the Buddha's Birthday  ♫

477
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,980
♫  Hang the lanterns high on every house  ♫

478
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,050
So cute...

479
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,590
Sure, sure.

480
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,200
Gosh...

481
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,750
Must you work on a night like tonight?

482
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,260
What kind of night is tonight?

483
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,070
It's Buddha's Birthday.

484
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,770
The day Buddha was born.

485
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,400
If it's Buddha's birthday, they should go to the temple and read the teachings reverently.

486
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,420
Why all the fuss?

487
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,950
There is no curfew tonight.

488
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,670
The young men and women roam around all night

489
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,860
as they look for each other to pair up.

490
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,350
A hot and passionate night.

491
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,180
What vulgar custom.

492
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,910
Vulgar?

493
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,680
You get to meet a person of your destiny on a night like this.

494
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:25,150
Especially when everyone gathers on the bridge to fly their wish lanterns.

495
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,400
 While doing so,

496
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,030
 you will keep making...

497
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,290
 eye contact with a woman.

498
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,880
 You keep making eye contact.

499
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,120
 Then you exchange passionate gazes.

500
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,980
 That's how you fall in love!

501
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,750
Many vacant rooms are in the area, too.

502
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,940
I have never heard of such lewd things before.

503
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,340
How could such disorderly conduct take place in a nation of Confucianism?

504
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,080
I also was wishing upon a lantern on Buddha's Birthday

505
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,030
and got to know my wife intimately overnight...

506
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,460
I'll just pretend that...

507
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,300
I didn't hear what I just heard.

508
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,060
Why...

509
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,280
He's shy...

510
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,620
Sir!

511
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,560
Do something about them.

512
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,580
You got permission to leave the palace since it's Buddha's Birthday.

513
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,410
Please quietly enjoy the lanterns and return to the palace.

514
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,290
Quietly enjoy the Buddha's Birthday celebration?

515
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,150
Does that even make sense?

516
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,730
Whether it makes sense or not, a no is a no.

517
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,530
Are you...

518
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,420
dipping that sweet thing in syrup?

519
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,940
You seem clueless.

520
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,520
You have to dip the yeot* in syrup.
(Toffee, 'yeot' also sounds like 'screw you')

521
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,890
Would you like a bite of yeot?

522
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,140
You eat yeot.

523
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,040
Aigoo, sir. Sir!

524
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,390
- Who did that!
- Aigoo! Oh, no!

525
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,560
I dropped the yeot. It was my mistake.

526
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,530
Your new robe. Are you all right?

527
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,840
Well...

528
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,640
I'm incognito. Watch what you say.

529
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:34,090
If you're afraid of unpleasant gossip, you should avoid what is not pleasant.

530
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,450
Does a yeot have wings?

531
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,160
How does it fly all the way from there?

532
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,540
It's nothing serious. Sir, go on your way.

533
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,340
What do you mean it's nothing serious? Your robe is ruined.

534
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,990
So I was thinking...

535
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,840
how about we resolve this incident beautifully?

536
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,170
Be cooperative in my escape from here.

537
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,340
Grab my collar.

538
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,440
Pardon?

539
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
Hurry.

540
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,140
Do you two know each other?

541
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,500
I've never met him before. Let's go.

542
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,190
You!

543
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,880
I offered an apology. Then you should accept it.

544
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,340
Wait... well...

545
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,260
Aigoo!

546
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,270
Sir!

547
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,250
Sir, sir! What are you doing right now?

548
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,800
Inspector, Sir.

549
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,810
Please take him away.

550
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,710
Please hurry over.

551
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,080
Wait!

552
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,760
If you grabbed a collar of an official from the Office of Inspector General,

553
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,770
you cannot just leave.

554
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,650
Which family do you come from?

555
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,920
I do not believe...

556
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,180
I have seen a noble who looks like this in Hanyang.

557
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,730
Why don't you show us your identity tag?

558
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,490
Please, Officer Hwang.

559
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,760
I heard the dogs at the Office of Inspector General bark, not being afraid of a beating.

560
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,660
A mere officer is exercising quite an authority.

561
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,810
- Woof, woof.
- What?

562
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,400
A dog?

563
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,320
Did you just insult the Office of Inspector General?

564
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,720
Let go of this, please!

565
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,590
So, would you like to see how harsh the Office of Inspector General could be?

566
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,870
Who the hell are you?

567
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,580
Hey, show your identity tag, too!

568
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,000
- You!
- How dare you!

569
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,900
How dare you? Do you know who this is?

570
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,940
- Show what?
- Come on, show it!

571
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,540
- I won't!
- You won't?

572
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,860
You! What the heck is this?

573
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,880
Why show me yeot!

574
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,290
You little...

575
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,690
You should show your identity tag when asked...

576
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,760
What are you doing? Please stop them!

577
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,030
Why should I?

578
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,380
Stop. Stop!

579
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,460
What's this?

580
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,340
These are total hoodlums!

581
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,010
Hey! Show your identity tag! All of you!

582
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,210
Hurry!

583
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,760
Hey! Show me!

584
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,820
Why does he keep asking us to show him? Show what?

585
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,400
Please. Please. Wait, please. Are you not...

586
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,910
Are you not forgetting something very important right now?

587
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,140
Oh, no!

588
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,450
Hurry! Sir!

589
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,440
Chief State Minister!

590
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,310
Congratulations on Queen Consort's conception.

591
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,450
I was not in the right state of mind. I forgot to invite you, Chief Royal Secretary.

592
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,380
Welcome.

593
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,440
His Majesty has especially...

594
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,250
presented a bottle of drink for you. So I brought it with me.

595
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,270
This lowly subject...

596
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,130
accepts a drink from His Majesty!

597
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,590
Is that not a gyeyoungbae*?
(A glass designed to  overflow when it's filled to a certain level)

598
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,660

599
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,070
This glass is a gift from me, Chief State Minister.

600
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,570
They say a flower is meant to be enjoyed when it's at half bloom

601
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,110
and you should stop drinking when you are adequately intoxicated.

602
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,930
It is because you start having desires you should not have when you drink too much.

603
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,180
A person...

604
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,340
is each born...

605
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,360
with different sized glass.

606
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,150
There is someone whose glass does not

607
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,880
fill up even if you pour a jarful of liquor.

608
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,500
And there is someone...

609
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,190
even a glass of drink is too good for him.

610
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,840
So, you are doing quite well these days?

611
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,960
There shouldn't be any liquor in Hanyang right now.

612
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,580
Where could he have gotten all this liquor?

613
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,320
Spare me!

614
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,560
Who is it?

615
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,320
Who sold liquor to you?

616
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,570
 Deliver in secret to Woon Sim of Giringak.

617
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,230
 The price is negotiable.

618
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,310
So beautiful!

619
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,200
What do I do...

620
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,650
She's not here.

621
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,350
What's going on?

622
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,940
By chance, have you seen Woon Sim of Giringak?

623
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,500
Woon Sim?

624
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,240
I thought she left earlier–

625
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,760
- What is it?
- Well...

626
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,500
I have to tell her in person.

627
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,130
I'm Ok Ran of Giringak.

628
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,990
I take care of everything when Woon Sim isn't around.

629
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,080
Tell it to me.

630
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,920
Well...

631
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,100
Gosh, My Lady! My Lady!

632
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,220
Please cover yourself properly.

633
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,970
Gosh, leave me alone!

634
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,570
Who knows?

635
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,580
I might meet a handsome man who is fated to be my future husband tonight.

636
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,680
My goodness...

637
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,670
Marriage is between two families.

638
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,490
You don't get married by looks.

639
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:01,550
I'll be looking at his face my whole life. Why only care about the family?

640
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,790
Don't follow me if you're going to nag!

641
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,140
Aigoo.

642
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,970
My Lady!

643
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,900
Aigoo, I'm not buying! My Lady!

644
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,980
Are you all right, Maiden?

645
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,690
Yes...

646
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,370
A flower almost fell off the bridge.

647
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,570
I'm sorry.

648
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,800
The night is short. I have no time to enjoy the floral scent.

649
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,050
Young Master, tell me your name...

650
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,930
My Lady!

651
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,770
Aigoo, My Lady!

652
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,690
He has to be a shady one.

653
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:53,670
He ran away when I asked for his identity tag.

654
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,410
Wait until I see him again.

655
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,390
It would be better for your own good if you never see him again.

656
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,460
Sir!

657
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,810
Sir! Gosh, my knee bothers me all of a sudden.

658
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,050
Sir! Wait for me...

659
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,080
I...

660
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,000
Gosh, he's so fast.

661
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,460
Move!

662
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,410
Jade Lad.

663
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,280
I cannot believe we ran into each other before getting to the promised location.

664
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,770
We must be destined for sure.

665
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,600
Where is your alcohol?

666
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,650
 Buy this!

667
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,500
 Buy this!

668
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,170
 Buy some chestnuts!

669
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,870
 Buy some chestnuts!

670
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,730
 Buy some chestnuts!

671
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,680
Geez...

672
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,880

673
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,830
This is...

674
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,290

675
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,030
Why is that moron here?

676
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,510
Do you know him?

677
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,020
He's an inspector.

678
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,190
Geez, that's not good.

679
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,750
I know you're in there!

680
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,000
Open the door!

681
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,150
Maiden, what are you doing here?

682
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,730
What brings you here?

683
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,500
That is what I should ask you.

684
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,280
Who is the man inside?

685
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,690
He's my lover.

686
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,240
L-lover?

687
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,170
 There is no curfew tonight.

688
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,100
 The young men and women roam around all night

689
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,260
 as they look for each other to pair up.

690
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,930
 A hot and passionate night.

691
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,540
Well, I already...

692
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,810
am aware that you're not a well-behaved lady.

693
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,150
Do you even know what this place used to be?

694
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,220
It's just an empty pharmacy.

695
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,560
What about it?

696
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,440
 That's how you fall in love!

697
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,170
 Many vacant rooms are in the area, too.

698
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:08,550
Wh-what are you- trying to do in this empty pharmacy?

699
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,330
It has nothing to do with you.

700
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:12,440
Go back now.

701
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:20,570
Then why did you make me a carp lantern?

702
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,430
Pardon?

703
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,660
Why would you wish for my fame and prestige?

704
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:28,130
I just had leftover paper, so I made it.

705
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,900
Do not do such an unnecessary thing.

706
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,410
- I'm extremely uncomfortable.
- What?

707
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,930
Unnecessary?

708
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,740
I made you one out of consideration.

709
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,610
Why would you consider me anyway?

710
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,800
I didn't think about you!

711
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,570
Wait a minute.

712
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,460
There is no way...

713
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,670
- Step aside.
- Why are you doing this?

714
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,010
- Move! I have to check something!
- What are you doing?

715
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,920
How dare you bring in liquor into the distillery that I deal with?

716
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,900
Where did you come from?

717
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,670
No wonder. They looked familiar to me.

718
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,150
Pub on Wheels, huh?

719
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,770
Are you out of your mind?

720
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,960
That's why you tried to kick me out?

721
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,740
I'm sorry about that.

722
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,630
I...

723
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:13,170
I had no idea...

724
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,080
You live in the same house with an inspector.

725
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,690
How courageous of you.

726
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,140
Gosh, he talks too much.

727
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,170
People like you traditionally died young.

728
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:28,490
You look just like someone who'd be executed for saying the wrong thing.

729
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:31,360
You should not be here doing this right now.

730
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,830
I'm used to being in a place I'm not supposed to be in.

731
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,700
All right.

732
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,910
Now that Buddha is born, let us shake off bad memories with this drink.

733
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,840
Here. Drink up. Drink it.

734
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,450
Please put it away.

735
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,150
Gosh, he spoils all the fun.

736
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,300
All right. Then take this, Maiden.

737
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,260
I'll pay for everything you drink, Maiden.

738
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,820
One nyang per glass. Exactly 100 glasses.

739
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,100
One hundred glasses?

740
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,010
- Then...
- Wait.

741
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,170
You're going to drink that right now?

742
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:13,990
Selling it wasn't enough. Now, you'll drink it?

743
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,670
We will get rid of the liquor faster if two of us drink.

744
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,650
A person's character is like water.

745
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,990
If you spill it once, you cannot turn back.

746
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,090
- If you start to indulge–
- Shush!

747
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:27,490
They say you should serve enough food to get full and enough drink to get drunk.

748
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,890
Don't you dare drink it.

749
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,120
You will go to the Office of Inspector General.

750
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:05,120
Yes, that's right.

751
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,590
Drink it up.

752
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:07,940
Drink it up.

753
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,200
 Please give me a handsome husband.

754
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,780
 Fly away...

755
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,530
So pretty...

756
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,000
Buddha's Birthday celebration is coming to an end.

757
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,140
What will you do now?

758
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:15,630
Will you leave me tied up here...

759
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,500
tomorrow and the day after?

760
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,620
Do you think I'll sit back like this?

761
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,380
What criminal spares the life of a witness?

762
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,450
What?

763
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,630
I'm joking.

764
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,370
You fell for it. You fell for it.

765
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,780
Stay here for a minute.

766
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,330
I'll bring out one more jar.

767
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,770
Oh, okay.

768
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,570
If you promise you will not report me,

769
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,840
I'll release you before jade lad comes back.

770
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,690
What?

771
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,930
It's Buddha's Birthday.

772
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,400
I put my wish on the wish lantern earlier.

773
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,960
My wish is that you turn a blind eye.

774
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,140
That's my wish.

775
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,780
Why do you make a wish made on Buddha's Birthday

776
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,060
to me and not Buddha?

777
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,320
Just for tonight...

778
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,730
Please turn a blind eye just for tonight.

779
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,870
How can I not see what I already saw?

780
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,090
Gosh! Just say you didn't see it!

781
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,890
Are you just insisting now?

782
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,130
What's wrong with drinking?

783
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:28,540
What my father taught me about drinking is that

784
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,620
it is milk from a mother...

785
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,900
who cannot produce milk for her baby.

786
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,210
For people who worked hard,

787
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,100
it is one meal to them.

788
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,720
When you get cold, it warms you up nicely.

789
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:48,670
It was a homeopathic remedy.

790
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,470
That is why you make alcohol out of rice.

791
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:57,290
That's what I learned.

792
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:04,460
But why is drinking a glass of liquor such a grave crime these days?

793
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,360
A glass of wine is just a glass of wine.

794
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,670
The law is just law as well.

795
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,950
If they say not to do it, just do not do it. That's the law.

796
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:16,660
So what I am saying is, why is that prohibition law even necessary?

797
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,900
Are you drunk?

798
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,460
I liked the good old days.

799
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,650
Back then...

800
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,180
my father was still alive...

801
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,900
and I had no 100-nyang debt.

802
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,030
So, just for today...

803
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,880
please be my Buddha, Young Tenant.

804
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,850
 Open the door!

805
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,780
Aigoo!

806
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,800
I can smell the stench of liquor!

807
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,110
Geum!

808
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,450
My Lady...

809
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,520
My Lady, I'm so sorry.

810
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,390
Huh?

811
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,150
Who is this?

812
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:22,550
I wondered who was running a liquor business that I could not even manage.

813
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,180
It was you, My Lady?

814
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,040
What's going on?

815
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,000
Isn't that the inspector who lives in the same house as you?

816
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,720
Why did you tie up the inspector?

817
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,880
Gosh, what is going on between you two?

818
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,340
Are you in a special relationship?

819
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,190
Why did you tie him up?

820
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,970
That's what I would like to ask her.

821
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,550
Let go of Geum.

822
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,470
If this is about the debt, I will pay you tomorrow if I have to.

823
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:48,760
- My Lady...
- Never mind the debt.

824
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,840
It's over for you, My Lady.

825
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,390
You can't sell liquor without our permission. You know this.

826
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:59,530
There is a certain order to this, you know!

827
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:01,940
Why is it so noisy?

828
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,470
Whom are all these new faces making all the noise?

829
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:11,020
D*** it. Who is that guy now?

830
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,580
Is he on your side?

831
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,540
Wait just a moment. I'll be right back.

832
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,070
Your Highness. Your Highness!

833
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:23,990
The rope...

834
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,290
I'm running out of time to drink. So come at me all at once.

835
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:29,880
Get him first. You, come here.

836
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,060
My Lady, My Lady, My Lady!

837
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,190
- Geum!
- Let go!

838
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:57,400
Maiden!

839
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,370
Release me.

840
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,130
What are you doing? Hurry!

841
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,250
No!

842
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,700
A useless literary civil servant.

843
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,750
- Behind you!
- Behind you!

844
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:37,240
What the heck? Why are there more and more?

845
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,070
Untie this...

846
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,130
What's this?

847
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:10,620
What's this?

848
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,760
- My Lady!
- Geum!

849
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,190
- My Lady, hurry. Let's go.
- Let's go.

850
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,480
My Lady!

851
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,590
Hurry!

852
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:51,050
You go ahead.

853
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,280
- Come on!
- Hurry!

854
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,030
Go! Go!

855
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,890
Are you all right?

856
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,040
What's going on all of a sudden?

857
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,890
Give me a moment. I almost released the knot.

858
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,750
Young Tenant!

859
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,500
Get away from here. I'll somehow...

860
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,010
drag out the time.

861
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:45,040
How lovely. Give me a freaking break.

862
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,660
Inspector Sir, you were pretty good with a bow and arrow.

863
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:02,120
But I guess you haven't held a sword that much.

864
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,960
I won't need any practice to cut you down.

865
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,090
How about it?

866
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,110
Do you regret not practicing now?

867
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:28,900

868
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:44,400
♫  Even when I'm all right, when a night like tonight is here  ♫

869
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:52,410
♫  I remember the tear you held back  ♫

870
01:08:52,410 --> 01:09:00,250
♫  Lean on my embrace, and you can rest now  ♫

871
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,300

872
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,060
 Are you in pain?

873
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,030
 Why did you catch a sword with bare hand?

874
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:09,000
 Do you love the Maiden or something?

875
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,910
 A foolish country bumpkin without any family backbone.

876
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:14,880
 What can you do without any type of connection?

877
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,130
 Wait and see.

878
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,130
 I'll show you what a fool without any connection could do.

879
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:22,390
 You truly wish to die, do you not?

880
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:23,850
 Look at them clearly.

881
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:25,900
 As consequences of your actions,

882
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,590
 how your lowlife group of people would pay.

883
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:30,510
 Please withdraw your command.

884
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:33,460
 Please kill me instead, Sire!

885
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,800
 Please kill me, Sire!

886
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,399
♫  Even when I'm all right  ♫
