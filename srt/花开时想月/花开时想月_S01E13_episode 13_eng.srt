1
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,010
 Stop right there!

2
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,500
 Stop!

3
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,970

4
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,470
 Stop right there!

5
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,600
 Get her!

6
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,510
Thank you. I will not forget your kindness.

7
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,850
So you are Kang Ro Seo.

8
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,130
I have been looking for you for a long time.

9
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,380
I did not realize you were so near.

10
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,210
Do you know me?

11
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,540
The ringleader of an alcohol smuggling group, Kang Ro Seo.

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,380
Your face is plastered every few steps.

13
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,780
Everyone in Hanyang would recognize you.

14
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,360
Forgive me. I must be going.

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,970
Find her!

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,880
Find her!

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,860
I think you better not leave at the moment.

18
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,450
There is a perfect place for such circumstances.

19
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,480

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,760

21
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,150
Explain to me what is happening.

22
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,260
I was investigating Sim Heon.

23
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,390
Then you should head outside to find him.

24
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,040
Why would you cause raucous at the Prohibition Bureau?

25
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,020
Ten years ago, Sim Heon appeared in Hanyang, and the first thing he did

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,490
was gather the people to form a group of procurement merchants.

27
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,620
The bureau that first issued a certificate to Sim Heon was the Prohibition Bureau.

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,090
Would it not be necessary to look into why

29
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,520
the Prohibition Bureau issued a commodity payment document

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,270
to a 20-year-old vagrant?

31
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,700
Do you realize what you are suggesting?

32
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,430
The Prohibition Bureau

33
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,480
is a bureau that His Majesty dedicated ten years

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,740
to gain his own private army.

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,610
Pardon?

36
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,560
Where do you think the officials who suffocate and pressure His Majesty

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,440
get their powers from?

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,710
It is the military.

39
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,280
Ten years ago, Crown Prince Sunghyun

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,650
 tried to create a private army,

41
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,590
 but he passed away without being able to achieve his goal due to the officials' interference.

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,260
The Prohibition Bureau is the volition to continue His Majesty's great work.

43
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,750
Do you mean that the ten-year-long alcohol ban

44
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,860
was to create an army?

45
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,800
It was to save on crops and guide the people in the right direction.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
What could be wrong with that justification?

47
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,330
Creating countless criminals of people

48
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,110
by an unnecessary ban in place.

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,480
How could that not be a problem?

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,070
A king of a nation

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,470
is not able to create a private army to protect himself.

52
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,880
Would that not be a problem?

53
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,100
Is that the country you desire His Highness the Crown Prince inherits?

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,800
Sim Heon is only an insignificant unexpected element.

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,500
If you continue to find fault with this matter,

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,940
it is no different from turning your back against His Highness and His Majesty.

57
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,410
Keep that in mind, and do not forget it.

58
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,700
You must now make it very clear

59
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,110
which side you will stand with.

60
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,980
It seems Kang Ro Seo wasn't at her house.

61
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,600
The outside world matters do not reach here,

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,080
so no one will mind that you are the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers.

63
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,680
You are free to stay here as long as you wish.

64
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,240
You seem to be a person of high status.

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,680
Why are you hiding me?

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,050
Let us say I am indebted to your father.

67
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,220
Do you know my father?

68
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,300
Of course, I do.

69
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,010
He was a curt but a gentleman.

70
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,820
I shall speak in detail another time.

71
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,980
I have left my place for too long and must get back.

72
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,220
Tell me your name, at least.

73
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,250
I will repay you for your kindness one day.

74
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,020
We shall discuss that another time as well.

75
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,710
We will meet again.

76
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, right.

77
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,220
Do you have anyone you must deliver a message to?

78
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,440
- Sir! 
 - Young Master!

79
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,660
Sir.

80
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,210
Her Ladyship...

81
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,950
Oh, no, Her Ladyship...

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,100
What has happened? What about the maiden?

83
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,380
The Police Bureau was here for an investigation,

84
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,820
so Her Ladyship had to run off without time to put on her shoes.

85
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,490
Run off?

86
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,600
Where did she go?

87
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,190
It is curfew soon.

88
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,560
If she is caught by the patrol guards...

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,980

She asked me to deliver this to you.

90
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,080

91
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,300
Roar! I won't eat you if you give me rice cake!

92
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,540
Roar!

93
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,610
Aigoo, Mr. Tiger.

94
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,780
Please spare me!

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,200
Father!

96
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,870
Shall I make you a rabbit?

97
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,790
No. A tiger. I like tigers.

98
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,730
You already have a tiger.

99
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,960
But I like tigers.

100
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,930
Even shoes come in pairs.

101
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,310
The tiger must have a pair, too.

102
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,420
Why do you like tigers so much?

103
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,360
You are a tiger, too, Father.

104
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,500
Everyone calls you the Tiger of the Southern Mountains.

105
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:44,840
Father, tell me about the time you caught the tiger at the palace bare-handed.

106
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,760
Again?

107
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,500
Please tell me. Please?

108
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,920
Well...

109
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,010
Maiden!

110
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,070
This. Where did you get this?

111
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,960
Who gave this to you?

112
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,100
Why do you have this, Young Tenant?

113
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,600
Speak up! Why do you have this, Young Tenant?

114
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,530
I'm sorry...

115
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,060
What are you sorry about?

116
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,280
Everything.

117
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,950
Everything...

118
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,560
is my fault.

119
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,810
If only...

120
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,820
I had not been at that place...

121
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,860
Your father...

122
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,170
passed away...

123
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,640
because of me.

124
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,720
What do you mean?

125
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,740
 You must not come of of there.

126
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,050
I owe my life...

127
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,430
to your father.

128
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,440
Owe him your life?

129
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,910
I owed him my life...

130
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,360
and I...

131
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,100
have lived having forgotten it.

132
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,690
All this time,

133
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,780
I had forgotten it.

134
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,060

135
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,550
- Young!
 - Young Master!

136
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,510
 Young Master!

137
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,000
Young!

138
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,780
- Young! 
 -  Young Master!

139
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,410
 Young Master!

140
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,010
 Young Master!

141
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,510
- Young! 
 -  Young Master!

142
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,780
Young!

143
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
Are you hurt?

144
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,830
Mother...

145
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,190
sent me a tiger from the underworld.

146
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
This tiger...

147
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,430
saved me.

148
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,640
Roar! I'm the protector of Gwanak Mountain, the divine tiger.

149
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,090
Roar!

150
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,830
 Anyone inside?

151
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,940
Father!

152
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,870
Wake up!

153
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,510
Father!

154
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,430
Father!

155
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,970
Wake up!

156
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,760
Please...

157
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,290
Wake up, please.

158
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,720
Please.

159
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,680
My father gave this to you?

160
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,510
At Mangwolsa Temple?

161
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,670
Who is it?

162
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,870
Who is the person who killed my father?

163
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,900
He engraved this before he gave it to me.

164
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,930
Sim Heon.

165
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,610
On Sim Heon's wrist,

166
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,080
this same symbol is branded.

167
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,250
Sim Heon.

168
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,490
So are you saying that Sim Heon killed my father?

169
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,510
 Do you know why you were brought here?

170
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,460
 Did that inspector not tell you?

171
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,930
 About Mangwolsa Temple...

172
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,700
 ten years ago.

173
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,260
When Sim Heon took me to Mangwolsa Temple,

174
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,600
he mentioned the incident from ten years ago.

175
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,890
That man killed my father

176
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,890
and took me there.

177
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,660
I didn't know anything...

178
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,260
That man...

179
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,050
killed my father...

180
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,260
and discarded him in the river.

181
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,250
I did not even know...

182
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,420
I knew nothing!

183
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,350
Do you remember?

184
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,160
After Sunghyun passed,

185
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,420
when we were on the garret.

186
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,420

187
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,290
What are those red lanterns?

188
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,700
They indicate where alcohol is sold, Your Majesty.

189
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,390
Lanterns to indicate alcohol sales?

190
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,300
We are in the middle of the nationwide funeral.

191
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,700
How can there be so many lanterns for drinking?

192
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,770
They are drinking away nonchalantly when the Crown Prince has died?

193
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,580
They are...

194
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,480
most likely drinking to celebrate.

195
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,440
What an insolent remark!

196
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,670
Who dares celebrate the Crown Prince's death?

197
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,380
They are those who strived against

198
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,540
His Highness from forming a private army.

199
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,880
How could they not celebrate?

200
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,970
They killed the Crown Prince.

201
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,500
They...

202
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,130
They were afraid of losing what they had,

203
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,610
so they killed the Crown Prince.

204
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,620
Send the royal guards this instant!

205
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,810
I must do away with them!

206
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,720
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

207
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,820
The military power lies in their hands at the moment.

208
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,490
If you were to strike without reason or evidence, certainly...

209
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,180
They will certainly revolt.

210
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,290
Then must I sit idly and watch those traitors go on?

211
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,470
They would not leave Pyo in peace, either.

212
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,880
I have a way to steal the military power back from them.

213
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,160
It is an alcohol ban.

214
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,810
Alcohol ban?

215
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,260
How could I forget that day?

216
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,150
You said a ruler's revenge takes ten years.

217
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,350
Everything is your high achievement.

218
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,980
Certainly, the heavens responded to Your Majesty's wishes.

219
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,060
 Why do you like tigers so much?

220
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,840
 You are a tiger, too, Father.

221
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,110
 Everyone calls you the Tiger of the Southern Mountains.

222
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,560
 Father, tell me about the time you caught the tiger at the palace bare-handed.

223
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,980
 Again?

224
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,930
 I actually wanted to give this to my daughter.

225
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,910
 I'm sure she would understand.

226
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,310
What are you all doing? Why aren't you eating?

227
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,860
We are, we are.

228
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,600
Right. Everyone, eat up.

229
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,220
Yes. Go ahead and eat.

230
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,470
Eat up.

231
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,950
Chew it well and finish all your food.

232
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,150
Have this, too.

233
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,960

234
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,550
Are you the one who inspected the tiled-roof house in the Western village?

235
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,060
Yes.

236
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,650
Yes, Your Highness.

237
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,910
Do you know who this is?

238
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,030
This is the man who survived after having the audacity to advise the Crown Prince

239
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,610
and opened his own coffin to return from the dead. Commander Nam.

240
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,610
He is a persistent one that even the underworld refused to take in.

241
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,830
- That— 
 - The one who lives...

242
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,730
in the tiled-roof house that you raided.

243
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,890
That commander was Commander Nam...

244
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,180
I truly was not aware!

245
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,940
I only thought I might be promoted if I caught the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers.

246
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,080
If anyone barges into his house with a bat,

247
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,700
I shall suspect that you did it.

248
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,950
So speak with the Northwest and Southeast Police Bureau

249
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,410
and the Capital Bureau, so they understand properly.

250
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,910
Without a doubt.

251
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,510
You need only leave it to me.

252
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,920
Who was it?

253
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,190
The one who reported that Kang Ro Seo lives at the house I rented?

254
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,470
An anonymous letter...

255
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,420

Judging by the messy handwriting on this cheap paper,

256
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,820
it must be the doing of a merchant who lives in West village.

257
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,730
Judging by the writing, the ink is as black as jade and has a tinge of violet,

258
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,010
and even the scent is fresh.

259
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,520
So it is a top-grade ink made of pine trees.

260
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,740
Pardon?

261
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,870
You can tell by smelling it?

262
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,210
It takes burning five pine trees to make one bar of the pine ink stick.

263
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,030
It is an expensive commodity that commoners could not even look at.

264
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,080
There is no merchant who could use it for an anonymous letter.

265
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,870
Then who could have done it?

266
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,170
 Now that an underground tunnel has been discovered under the capital land,

267
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,040
 it has come to the point that we cannot guarantee the safety of the capital and the palace.

268
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,760
 Thus,

269
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,150
 designate the surplus individuals at the

270
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,510
 Capital Defense Military into the King's Guards Bureau and the Prohibition Bureau.

271
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,890
 I shall promote the Prohibition Bureau as an official bureau,

272
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,480
 and I appoint Chief Royal Secretary Lee Shi Heum as the Head of the Prohibition Bureau.

273
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:53,580

274
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,560
This is the letter for 'monkey.'

275
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,070
And this is the seal script of 'monkey.'

276
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,520
That night's event was covered up as catching a group of robbers.

277
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,810
Those related to that night

278
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,260
 was the Northwest Police Bureau Chief,

279
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,620
 the Investigator,

280
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,570
 and the Corpse Examiner.

281
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,270
They are all dead.

282
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,550
And most likely,

283
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,580
it was not Sim Heon's doing alone.

284
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,680
You mean someone behind him ordered them?

285
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,150
 What else do you think it could be?

286
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,810
 The reason a mere smuggler

287
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,020
 would kill a personal guard to the crown prince.

288
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,660
Perhaps,

289
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,050
it could be an enormously serious matter.

290
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,410
A very serious matter that we cannot resolve.

291
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,890
It does not matter.

292
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,890
I still must know.

293
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,820
Why Sim Heon killed my father

294
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,860
and who it is if there is someone behind all this.

295
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,840
Thinking reversely about what you said,

296
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,090
that means if it gets out that my father died at Mangwolsa Temple,

297
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,510
someone will be in grave trouble.

298
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,570
You mean we should reveal it?

299
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,450
So everyone in the world knows.

300
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,380
Move aside.

301
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,630
Move aside.

302
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,460
What is that?

303
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,720
What is this?

304
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,230
Goodness.

305
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,910
What is happening?

306
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,730

307
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,250
 I report that in the Year of the Monkey, October 11th,

308
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,900
  Sim Heon mercilessly murdered my father at Mangwolsa Temple.

309
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,020
 Sim murdered my father

310
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,100
 and killed everyone related to cover up the incident

311
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
 and buried the matter.

312
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,030
 He threw out my father's corpse on the streets,

313
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,650
 an act that would enrage both people and the heavens.

314
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,080
Father!

315
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,580
Take a look at this.

316
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,140
There is this despicable open letter circulating the capital.

317
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,150
 The way of the heavens is just and will not forgive evildoers.

318
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,240
 The people reading this will understand my resentfulness of losing my father.

319
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,150
 Thus in order to capture Sim Heon, I, Kang Ro Seo,

320
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,410
 will reward 10,000 nyang for his life.

321
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,000
 I write here the evidence that my father left behind,

322
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,460
 so the criminal will know his own crime.

323
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,060
 By Kang Ro Seo.

324
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,510

325
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,320

326
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,860
T-ten thousand nyang?

327
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,470
What? Ten thousand nyang?

328
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,180
 Look here!

329
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,010
 Goodness!

330
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,500
This man Sim Heon

331
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,060
is worth 10,000 nyang!

332
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,820
That's impossible!

333
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,660
I hear the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers

334
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,160
is the daughter of the Tiger of the Southern Mountain.

335
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,200
That's right.

336
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,500
She smuggled alcohol to get her revenge.

337
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,080
A tiger's cub is still a tiger.

338
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,000
- That girl is no ordinary girl.
- Right.

339
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,030
 Move aside!

340
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,430
 Move aside!

341
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,590
Goodness!

342
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,090
What is all this?

343
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,100
Reporting Sim Heon...

344
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,680
- Unni, this...
- Let me see...

345
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,390

346
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,970
Year of the Monkey, October 11th...

347
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,860

348
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,250
Is this posting true? About your father?

349
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,770
Don't talk to me. I need to focus.

350
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,220
But what is this?

351
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,920
This symbol after your name.

352
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,440
Oh, that's a symbol on Sim Heon's wrist or something.

353
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,080
The Nab Sin* symbol on his wrist? 
 (Monkey character read as 'Nab Sin' in Korean)

354
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,180
Does that mean his last name is Sin?

355
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,880
Huh?

356
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,910
Sim... Sim Heon.

357
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,930
Sim Heon's last name is Sim.

358
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,180
Oh, or maybe it signifies Southwest*. 
 (Nab Sin also signifies Southwest in direction)

359
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,090
If not that...

360
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,160
Monkey of the Twelve Earthly Branches!

361
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,580
How old are the people born in the Year of the Monkey?

362
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,200
I made a mistake because of you.

363
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,380
Do be quiet.

364
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,140
Even if we work hard to write these,

365
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,220
do you know that the patrolmen take them away as soon as they're scattered?

366
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,680
It does not matter.

367
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,090
I have 10,000 nyang as the reward money.

368
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,110
So as long as people start talking about it,

369
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,650
everyone will rush to catch that man.

370
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,940
To kill me...

371
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,620

372
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,900
Mistress, do you remember that day?

373
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,430
The day Sim Heon came to kill you.

374
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,950

375
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,340
No!

376
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,470
Tell me.

377
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,160
Why did Sim Heon try to kill you?

378
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,090
Sim Heon came after killing a man named Kang Ho Yeon, right?

379
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,720
What was between you and Kang Ho Yeon?

380
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,470
Kang Ho Yeon?

381
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,380
The Tiger of the Southern Mountain...

382
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,560
That's right. The Tiger of the Southern Mountain.

383
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,040
Do you remember?

384
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,340
I have to go to Guard Kang.

385
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,230
I have to go to Guard Kang and let him know.

386
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,720
Tell Guard Kang what?

387
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,340
The monkey...

388
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,360
The monkey did it.

389
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,260
The monkey killed him.

390
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,480
The monkey?

391
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,190
The monkey. The monkey!

392
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,830
The monkey.

393
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,020
The monkey. The monkey.

394
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,660
The monkey killed him.

395
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,070
The monkey killed...

396
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,970
The monkey.

397
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,470
- The monkey killed him.
- Mistress...

398
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,330
The monkey killed...

399
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,770

400
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,230
You must have seen that open letter.

401
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,120
It says a man named Sim Heon killed Ho Yeon.

403
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
What do you make of this?

404
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,530
You were looking into Sim Heon, were you not?

405
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,370
 Sim Heon is only an insignificant unexpected element.

406
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,710
 If you continue to find fault with this matter,

407
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,260
 it is no different from turning your back against His Highness and His Majesty.

408
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,640
 Keep that in mind, and do not forget it.

409
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,490
Forgive me for saying this, but

410
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,400
what are you trying to confirm?

411
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,830
Whether I have been mistaken for ten years.

412
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,840
That is what I wish to know.

413
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,070
Ho Yeon died because I was foolish

414
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,400
and it is also my fault that I did not realize the injustice for ten years.

415
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,300
If there was wrongdoing,

416
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,700
I would like to correct it, though it may be late.

417
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,610
Considering the many circumstances,

418
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,850
it is highly likely Sim Heon murdered Kang Ho Yeon

419
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,770
and received payment for it.

420
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,070
You must allow this incident to be investigated again.

421
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,470
I cannot order an official investigation with a mere open letter.

422
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,190
I command you to investigate this matter in secret, Commander Nam.

423
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,800
No.

424
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,430
Bring Sim Heon alive to me.

425
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,260
Whether he truly killed Ho Yeon.

426
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,600
Why he killed him.

427
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,510
I must ask him myself.

428
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

429
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,720
I shall do my utmost best.

430
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,200
Chief State Minister, I did not think you would visit me.

431
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,020
Congratulations.

432
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,160
You gained everything you wished for in the end.

433
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,410
There is still a long way to go.

434
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:36,370
Oh, yes. Have you seen the letter posted around the streets?

435
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,970
Do you take an interest in such rumors, Chief State Minister?

436
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,330
It is intriguing.

437
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,400
The alcohol smuggler who provided workers for the Prohibition Bureau

438
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,190
killed the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

439
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,200
Are you not curious, Head of the Prohibition Bureau?

440
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,020
What is more, I know that Guard Kang

441
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,490
was quite close to you, Chief Royal Secretary.

442
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,380
Would you not be at a disadvantage if people started discussing Guard Kang's death,

443
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,120
Chief State Minister?

444
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,640
Whether it is more of a disadvantage for you or me,

445
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,140
we will have to wait and see.

446
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,620
I scattered all 50 of them, My Lady.

447
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,640
Good work.

448
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,270
Would this really make it possible

449
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,430
to find Sim Heon and our hyungnim?

450
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,140
For now, this is the only hope.

451
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,630
How many sheets shall I give you?

452
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,530
Ten thousand nyang?

453
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,110
- Is this real? 
 - It is.

454
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,880
Hide it, hide it.

455
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,270

456
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,560

457
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,830
Wake up.

458
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,690
I'm sleeping.

459
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,800
Come on, Gye Ssang Mok.

460
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,800
You...

461
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,390
Not Ssang Mok. Sang. Sang!

462
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,120
Do you want me to rip out your teeth?

463
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,760
You have to help me.

464
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,030
Huh?

465
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,520
I have to get out of here.

466
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,870
 Seize them!

467
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,260
 Seize them!

468
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,200
Thanks to you, the nights are quite restless.

469
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,530
Thanks to this, my nights are quite restful.

470
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,200
Everyone is looking up at the sky and not at my face.

471
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,470
So where did you gather all those people?

472
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,150
I got some help from Sang Mok's followers.

473
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,370
The workers lost their jobs

474
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,410
because the Prohibition Bureau was reformed.

475
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,950
Enemies of the past becoming allies of today.

476
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,760
 Seize them!

477
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,880
 Seize them!

478
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,620
 Seize them!

479
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,960
 Seize them!

480
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,230
They said to seize it.

481
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,780
All right, then. Go ahead.

482
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,300
 Seize them!

483
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,330
 Seize them!

484
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,660

485
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,570
I thought you had run far away

486
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,490
because you couldn't dare show your face.

487
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,240
Have you come to your death on your own?

488
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,580
Is it not wasteful to get rid of a yet useful pawn?

489
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,570
Useful?

490
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,780
They seek to capture me,

491
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,000
so I can be the pawn to capture them.

492
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,330
You will have to get rid of them all at once not to cause any further mess.

493
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,300
I shall certainly present to you the heads of  the inspector

494
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,550
and that wench to you, Sir.

495
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Congratulations, Princess Consort.

496
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,800
 Congratulations.

497
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,150
These are the girls who will serve you, Your Highness.

498
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,430
You shall stay here at the subsidiary palace until the wedding

499
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,790
and be educated on the ways of the Princess Consort.

500
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,680
I look forward to working with you, Madam.

501
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,810
Please do not use honorifics with us.

502
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,200
All right. I look forward to it.

503
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,750
Goodness.

504
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,940
Whoa, that was so suffocating.

505
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,060
My head is so heavy.

506
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,470
Can I take this off now?

507
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,300
I'm not sure.

508
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,040
Shall I go ask?

509
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
Never mind.

510
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,650
I'm too scared.

511
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,360
Yes...

512
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,650
When will I get to see His Highness?

513
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,620
It's hard to tell.

514
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,580
Would it not be difficult before the wedding?

515
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,730
Is the Eastern Palace very far from here?

516
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,790
What is the meaning of this, Training Commander?

517
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,830

You must leave Hanyang.

518
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,150

I shall speak with the Queen,

519
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,440
so come with me.

520
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,090
What is the meaning of this?

521
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,120
You do not need to know the details.

522
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,160
You cannot be here.

523
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,170
Pardon?

524
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,070
Bodyguard Kang's daughter is on a rampage to avenge her father.

525
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,090
Should it get out again that poison was found at the

526
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,390
Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode, what are we to do then?

527
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,650
If Chief Royal Secretary finds out that you did this—

528
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,550
Absurd. Your Excellency ordered me,

529
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,910
how could you call it my doing?

530
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,190
Lower your voice! What if someone hears?

531
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,720
Come with me for now.

532
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,790
Who goes there?

533
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,960
Gosh!

534
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,860
I think she heard us.

535
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,970
You wait right here. I will look into it.

536
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Aigoo, Your Highness!

537
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,780
Forgive me.

538
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,520
Training Commander.

539
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,430
Where are you going in such a rush?

540
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,050
Is something the matter?

541
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,630
It is nothing.

542
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,100
What do you mean nothing? You seem to be in a rush.

543
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,190
Go ahead.

544
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,090
Yes, I shall be going now.

545
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,910
What is that attire?

546
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,130
I see.

547
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,890
You are quitting Princess Consort and running away?

548
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,890
Oh, not at all.

549
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,080
Then why were you being chased?

550
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,480
Did you steal something?

551
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,380
That is not it, either.

552
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,360
But...

553
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,210
I think I did overhear something.

554
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,810
Princess Consort, it is me, Royal Consort Gyeongbin.

555
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,820
I'm going in.

556
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,340
Crown Prince.

557
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,620
What... Why...

558
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,840
Why are you coming out from there?

559
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,390
I had something to tell the Princess Consort.

560
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,100
It seems you will have children very soon.

561
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,260
The King spoke with Nam Young in private.

562
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,210
He met with Commander Nam in private...

563
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,900
His Majesty's health is declining,

564
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,850
so I suggest changing his medicine.

565
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,670

How was his recent examination?

566
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,750
He said he feels nauseous,

567
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,110
his heart feels heavy,

568
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,990
his mouth dries often,

569
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,800
and his limbs go numb and ache.

570
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,300
It seems fury has overcome him.

571
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,710
Recently, black spots have begun appearing on the back of his hand,

572
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,190
and they concern me.

573
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,160
His Majesty is almost 60 already,

574
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,670
so it must be from old age.

575
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,440
But they do not seem like usual black spots,

576
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,800
- and I suspect— 
 - Do not speak such nonsense

577
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,680
and cause distress to His Majesty.

578
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,340
I understand. Forgive me.

579
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,210
The cup looks warn out.

580
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,010
I shall make a new one and offer it to him.

581
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,950
What? How come Choon Gye's the only one with an egg in his rice bowl?

582
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,390
How could you do this? I'm your husband.

583
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,040
Hey! Why are you my husband?

584
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,340
Don't make me laugh.

585
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,130
A madam wouldn't give her servant eggs for no reason.

586
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,950
You're wrong!

587
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,920
No, no. Seriously, Choon Gye...

588
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,860
He just does the most work in this house, so I gave it to him.

589
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,520
What are you thinking so deeply about?

590
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,850
Sim Heon must have run the merchant's inn

591
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,290
to cover up and sell the alcohol as something else.

592
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:33,090
Just as she covered the egg with rice to hide it.

593
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,380
What are you talking about? I didn't hide the egg.

594
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,330
Covering the egg with rice to hide it...

595
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,180
Now that I think of it, inside the mokbingo,

596
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,630
why was fish there?

597
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,540
Choon Gye, did you not say you smelled something inside the mokbingo?

598
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,130
 But what is this smell?

599
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,880
The smell of salted seafood.

600
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,950
It smelled like salted hwangsegi.

601
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,480
 Salted seafood?

602
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:33,380
S***.

603
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,990
Traitor.

604
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,830
You must be hungry for that 10,000 nyang.

605
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,970
S***, what's this?

606
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,020
Go back to your places.

607
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,170
No matter how much you want that 10,000 nyang,

608
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,450
it won't be easy on your own.

609
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,030
Do you want to die?

610
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,830
Even if I kill you here, no one will care.

611
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,070
Even if you go alone to Lady Ro Seo,

612
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,590
do you think she will keep you alive?

613
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,970
Have you considered that

614
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,780
it might be a trap to bring down a traitor?

615
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,190
A trap?

616
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:22,000
If you take me, you can save your life

617
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,150
and receive the 10,000 nyang safely.

618
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,840
What nonsense is that?

619
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,580
I am...

620
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,310
the writer of those posts,

621
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,120
Kang Ro Seo's older brother.

622
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:36,290
If you only deliver this gentleman to that lady safely,

623
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,880
it wouldn't end at just 10,000 nyang.

624
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,130
It would be at least...

625
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,330
worth 100,000 nyang.

626
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,750
My sister has a big heart.

627
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,090
One hundred thousand nyang?

628
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,570
 One hundred thousand nyang.

629
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,600
I only transported the salted seafood

630
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,080
as I was told.

631
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,490
I was told if I fill out the documents like I sold them myself,

632
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,770
I would be paid well.

633
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,370
You would be paid if you let them use your name,

634
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,240
and you did not find it suspicious?

635
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,840
I did not ask since they might tell me

636
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,340
to stop if I asked about this and that.

637
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,110
Please forgive me for this once.

638
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,850
If you forgive me this time, I will tell you everything I know.

639
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,430
Where did you load the salted seafood?

640
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,950
D-dokmak.

641
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,770
I loaded them at the kiln site at Dokmak.

642
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,600
Dokmak is near Mapo.

643
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,150
It is just around here.

644
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,640
I shall depart first and inspect the area.

645
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,430
Please show this to the Ministry of Defense

646
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,080

and request military support.

647
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,660
Understood.

648
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,800

649
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,500
I do not sense any sign of life.

650
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,820
Could this really be the distillery?

651
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,680
Lower your voice.

652
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,630
I think we should...

653
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,510
Goodness! Whoa, whoa!

654
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,060
What...

655
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,570
What is...

656
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,000
This is... So suddenly...

657
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,500
Goodness, I think we fell right into their trap.

658
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,490
You are right on time.

659
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,160
Do not do anything rash.

660
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,560
The soldiers will be here soon.

661
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,460
The soldiers will not come.

662
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,870
What?

663
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,420
I am here in place of Commander Nam.

664
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,810
Please lend us the soldiers.

665
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,990
Right this moment?

666
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,160
- It will be difficult at the moment. 
 - Pardon?

667
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,970
Chief Royal Secretary suddenly asked to help repair the rampart,

668
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,390
so I sent them all up there.

669
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,970
How long will it take to call them back again?

670
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,430
Gathering the soldiers scattered everywhere...

671
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,260
It will take at least four hours.

672
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,080
What do you mean the soldiers are not coming?

673
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,370
Do you think I would have called you here without such preparations?

674
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,560
You and I...

675
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,170
can finally finish this here today.

676
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,640
Why did you kill Guard Kang?

677
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,360
He died because of the same reason as you.

678
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,800
He tried to know too much.

679
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,060
The soldiers are here!

680
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,340

681
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,420
- W-who are you? 
 - Shut up.

682
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,470
I'll kill you if you make any noise.

683
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,920
K-Kang Ro Seo.

684
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,500
Who did you get that money from?

685
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,030
Move aside!

686
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,110
Make way for His Excellency the Training Commander!

687
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,560
Is it a riot?

688
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,390
Turn around the palanquin this instant!

689
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,350
- Hurry, hurry!
- Turn the palanquin around!

690
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,270

691
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:38,750
Do you think I would have come here to capture you without any information?

692
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,720
Get Sim Heon!

693
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
Don't mess with 20 years of experience!

694
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,780
- Officer Hwang. 
 - Leave here to me and go!

695
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,350
Sim Heon!

696
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,880
Put down that gun.

697
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,910
Mak San!

698
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,750
Shoot, Mom!

699
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,770
Shoot him!

700
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:01,340
Get your revenge or save your son.

701
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,990
Will you leave it to your gun's accuracy?

702
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,450
Let him live.

703
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,220
Instead, I shall go with you.

704
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,930
Take me.

705
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,320
I don't want you or him.

706
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,280
If you shoot that wench with that gun,

707
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,530
I'll let your son live.

708
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,060
If you do not shoot until I count to five,

709
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,090
your son will die.

710
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,290
One.

711
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,590
Two.

712
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,780
Three.

713
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,770
Four.

714
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,390
Five.

715
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,150
Doyenne.

716
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,750
I shall be the last person you kill.

717
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,410
Mom...

718
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,820
Mom...

719
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,500
- Doyenne. 
 - Doyenne!

720
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,070
It is only a little stab wound.

721
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,800
Commander Nam.

722
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,690
Hurry and go.

723
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,590
There will not be another chance to end all this.

724
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,170
Commander Nam.

725
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,660
Why did you kill...

726
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,180
the Doyenne's son?

727
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,330
Why did you kill...

728
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,560
the Maiden's father?

729
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,600
Who is behind you...

730
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,520
Who is the one who ordered you to do it?

731
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,150
You can never conquer me in this fight.

732
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,600
You have too many questions

733
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,290
and cannot kill me.

734
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,000
Doyenne.

735
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,220
What are you doing here?

736
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,880
Hurry and follow him.

737
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,360
Commander Nam is alone.

738
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,340
Doyenne.

739
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,060
Will you regret sending him alone for the rest of your life?

740
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,360
That you should have followed him then?

741
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,620
Blaming yourself...

742
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,190
after you lose what is precious to you

743
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,960
is no use.

744
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,460
Go and protect him.

745
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,910
You must be next to him.

746
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,210
Hurry and go.

747
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,570
Hurry.

748
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,100
Mom, you're bleeding too much.

749
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:55,000
- Mak San...
- Yeah.

750
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,920
Once this is all over,

751
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,900
gather the villagers and farm.

752
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,320
Come on. What do you mean farming?

753
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,800
Let's go back together.

754
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,610
I'm sure the villagers are waiting for us.

755
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:14,440
We have left them for too long.

756
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,240
Be sure to stay alert in your life.

757
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,030
You did not get hurt too seriously?

758
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,620
No.

759
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,420
Live and be a good person, Mak San.

760
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,110
Your mother...

761
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,300
has to go see your brother now.

762
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,030
Because of you, Mak San...

763
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,410
I can't close my eyes...

764
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,010
Mak San.

765
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,460
Mak San...

766
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,660
Mom.

767
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,700
Open your eyes.

768
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,590
Mom!

769
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,520
Mom!

770
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,740
No!

771
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,560
Do you think I will let you die?

772
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,120
Who is it?

773
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,290
Who is behind you?

774
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,560
There is no such person.

775
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,230
It was...

776
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,210
all my doing.

777
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,610
No. No.

778
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,970
No.

779
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,370
 Lee Shi Heum...

780
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:04,160
Monkey!

781
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:39,510

782
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:06,870
♫  Even when I'm all right, even when there is nothing sad that makes me cry  ♫

783
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:15,140
♫  I feel like dying at the thought of you  ♫

784
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:20,599
♫  I want to see you  ♫
