1
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,810

2
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,460
You must take cover!

3
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,080
- Guide him!
- Yes, sir!

4
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,530
Are you all right?

5
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,050
Hurry.

6
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,760
 - Wow!
- Look at that!

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,120
 Wow, what's that?

8
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,660
 So beautiful!

9
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,740
 Look at that!

10
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,210
♫  I cannot explain this  ♫

11
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,240
♫  You held my trembling hand without a word  ♫

12
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,900
That woman is...

13
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,260
What?

14
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,780
Who?

15
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:47,400
♫  You excited my meaningless life  ♫

16
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,340
♫  You approached me  ♫

17
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,100
♫  My heart is searching for you  ♫

18
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:05,830
♫  Your world is coloring my heart  ♫

19
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,300
♫  I say, who you are, who you are  ♫

20
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,020
♫  The question that fills my heart  ♫

21
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:21,180
♫  You came to me after so many days have passed  ♫

22
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,870
♫  My meaningless day is being filled with you  ♫

23
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,670

24
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,930
♫  I want to know you more, your heart  ♫

25
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,680
Selling liquor on a cart was not enough.

26
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,430
You sold it to a gibang?

27
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,710
What must you be thinking in order to do things like this?

28
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,650
No.

29
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,810
If you were thinking to begin with,

30
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,150
I don't think you'd get into doing things like that. Yeah...

31
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,240
Does it hurt?

32
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,880
Of course, it hurts. Don't you think it hurts?

33
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,170
Why did you do this, Young Tenant?

34
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,850
You knew this would happen.

35
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,130
Why did you hold the sword with your bare hand?

36
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,990
I had no other way.

37
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,760
It is the same with me.

38
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,640
I had no other way.

39
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,340
I can't let my brother's ten fingers be chopped off.

40
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,740
Even if my flesh is torn and cut,

41
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,240
I must pay off the 100-nyang debt.

42
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,810
So what will you do now?

43
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,350
You got caught by an inspector of the Office of Inspector General.

44
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,600
I used my bare hand this time.

45
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,730
Will you use your foot next time?

46
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,080
What exactly is the prohibition for?

47
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,220
Nothing happens to sons of rich families, even if they frequent gibangs.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,740
Forcing someone to take on debt and write up a slavery contract isn't a crime.

49
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,860
But distilling alcohol is a crime deserving of death?

50
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,960
We almost died!

51
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,410
We just about died!

52
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,270
What happened?

53
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,830
It's a miracle he walked back here alive.

54
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,820
Boss Gye...

55
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,210
wanted to catch the bootleggers.

56
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,380
How about Gye Sang Mok?

57
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,650
Where is Gye Sang Mok?

58
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,430
Everyone got killed.

59
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,280
Well-trained warriors...

60
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,870
Warriors?

61
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,300
They weren't rabble?

62
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,610
Boss Gye...

63
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,540
- got hit by a girl...
- A girl?

64
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,100
Oh, no.

65
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,350
It looks like things got completely twisted.

66
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,020
Don't tell the elder.

67
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,800
I'll take care of this.

68
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,130
You know this already.

69
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,200
I must answer the elder if he asks me.

70
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
This is my business!

71
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,590
I'll take care of it.

72
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,580
Remove him from Giringak before anyone sees him.

73
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,890
You should've brought her to me if she came for me.

74
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm sorry, Unni.

75
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,880
Find out where she works.

76
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,440
As soon as possible.

77
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,640
Yes.

78
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,640
Ok Ran.

79
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,450
Yes?

80
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,040
If Sim Heon hears this,

81
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,020
you'll die, too.

82
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,410
Do you understand?

83
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,660
Yes.

84
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,280
Yes, Unni.

85
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,860
I will be sure to take care of it.

86
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,660
Leave it to me, elder.

87
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,690
Aigoo, what in the world is going on?

88
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,680
Gosh.

89
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,170
Mother...

90
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,670
Mother...

91
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,630
He must be dreaming about the madam.

92
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,050
Mother...

93
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,070
Madam?

94
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,910
Yes, his mother who passed away when he was young.

95
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,580
Mother...

96
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,140
Gosh, what!

97
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,140
Are you awake?

98
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,530
Wh-why are you in here, Maiden?

99
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,100
Well, I was...

100
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,000
Nam, are you awake now?

101
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Wh-what's going on?

102
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,130
You still look flushed.

103
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,190
You're still burning up.

104
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,450
Are you okay?

105
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,690
Get out!

106
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,880
Get out this minute! All of you!

107
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,870
- Get out.
- Yes...

108
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,170
Let's leave so he can rest. Let's go.

109
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,490
- Rest up.
- Let's leave.

110
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,240
It was not a dream...

111
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,940
Why isn't it a dream? Why not!

112
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,640
You guys don't even know whether your hyungnim is dead or alive?

113
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,280
Gye Sang Mok went there with more than ten guys.

114
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,100
Only one guy made it back.

115
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,280
Sliced by a sword down from here to there.

116
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,100
Gye Sang Mok knows what those guys look like.

117
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,000
Find Gye Sang Mok.

118
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,690
You'd better bring him back alive.

119
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,860
If not, I'll bury you guys with him.

120
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,820
 If I report that woman, I must report the Crown Prince as well.

121
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,470
 Then, the crime of distilling and selling liquor to Crown Prince

122
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,850
 carries a maximum sentence of beheading.

123
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,950
This isn't supposed to happen...

124
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,130
This can't be...

125
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,820
Geez...

126
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,550
Are you feeling better now?

127
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,420
Now is not the time to worry about me.

128
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,270
Well...

129
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,960
I have not decided what to do with you yet.

130
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,390
Go into your room and quietly wait for my decision.

131
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,080
I have to go out for a while.

132
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,690
Where do you think you're going...

133
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,530
After going through all that last night?

134
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,230
She took some time off?

135
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,530
She knows we have many patients the day after Buddha's Birthday.

136
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,210
She took off intentionally.

137
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,910
She must have bribed the administrator.

138
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,010
If she took time off, where did she go...

139
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,770
How would I know that?

140
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,470
- Jung Ran!
- Yes?

141
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,570
Do you think I don't bribe people because I have no money?

142
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm sure nothing happened to her, right?

143
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,180
If nothing happened, is that not more strange?

144
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,950
- Have you seen our hyungnim?
- No, I haven't.

145
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,640
Where is he?

146
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,720
This woman, seriously!

147
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,210
 Hey!

148
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,140
 Have you seen our hyungnim?

149
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,420
I haven't seen him.

150
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,390
 "I haven't seen him."

151
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,530
You, have you seen our hyungnim?

152
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,090
 Gye Ssang Mok? I haven't seen him.

153
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,130
 Not "Ssang Mok." It's Sang Mok. S***!

154
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,290
 Where the hell did he to?

155
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,890
 Let's to that way.

156
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,590
What happened here?

157
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,520
There.

158
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,870
Please have some.

159
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,060
It's honey water.

160
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,350
I didn't even drink that much.

161
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,460
I just rinsed my mouth with it.

162
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,670
What in the world happened?

163
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,570
 Your Highness.

164
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,980
I removed all the traces of last night, Your Highness.

165
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,680
Last night?

166
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,690
What trace?

167
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,740
If a word of this incident is leaked, it's over for you and  me both.

168
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,150
Keep that in mind.

169
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,950
What should be done about the inspector and the girl who were there?

170
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,990
A girl?

171
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,290
Let them be. They're my friends.

172
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,450
What? Your friends?

173
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,080
You may go.

174
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,290
Your Highness.

175
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,270
What in the world did you do, Your Highness?

176
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,740
Will you continue to ramble on...

177
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,040
or will you shut up with this?

178
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,350
I will accept it.

179
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,020
The rumor that the Crown Prince sneaks out of the palace

180
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,010
and is frequenting illegal distilleries is alarming.

181
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:32,060
We, your humble servants, are concerned about the rigidity of the prohibition, however,

182
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,380
we wish to obey your command, Your Majesty.

183
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,680
However, how could Crown Prince consume alcohol?

184
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,840
Your Majesty.

185
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,790
It is a false rumor which has not been confirmed.

186
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,560
Do you wish for us to confirm properly and have a formal open discussion?

187
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,400
Tell me what it is that you want.

188
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,750
Please select new counsels for the Crown Prince

189
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,210
who are knowledgeable with a hopeful outlook

190
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,430
and refine and educate the Crown Prince.

191
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,440
Are you saying to replace the entire Royal Education and Security Bureaus?

192
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,880
I happen to have appropriate candidates in mind.

193
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,570
I have written down some names.

194
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,070
Please eat one more.

195
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,460
All right. Say, ah...

196
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,800
Gosh, it's e-enough.

197
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm just worried that you keep losing weight.

198
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,750
Are you still not able to sleep well?

199
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,390
That night–

200
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:04,140
Do you still have that scary nightmare?

201
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,940
I'm sleeping very well these days.

202
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Is that so?

203
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,080
What a relief.

204
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,480
 His Majesty.

205
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,690
Greetings, Father.

206
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,150
His Majesty!

207
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,310
Crown Prince!

208
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,340
Why are you doing this?

209
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,960
How dare you shame me this way!

210
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,870
Now, the Left State Minister's grandson will become your guard

211
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,780
and will monitor you night and day.

212
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,980
Why don't you...

213
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,080
feel the torment where you cannot do anything with your hands and feet tied down?

214
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,970
Your Majesty. Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

215
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,640
What is this all about?

216
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,000
Left State Minister's grandson will monitor Crown Prince?

217
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,780
Brother!

218
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,750
After he escorted Giringak gisaengs to the Chief State Minister's banquet last night,

219
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,730
no one has seen Gye Sang Mok since.

220
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,660
In my opinion...

221
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,490
this is a power struggle among the working class.

222
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,470
The power struggle among the working class?

223
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,030
Even about ten years ago,

224
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:34,400
the power struggles in Hanyang were so chaotic.

225
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,250

One-eye.

226
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,130

Chulbangyi. Gye Sang Mok.

227
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,830

These three groups were fighting each other every day.

228
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,780

They drove out One-eye and Chulbangyi out of the capital city

229
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,180
 and Gye Sang Mok dominated Hanyang.

230
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,640
One-eye and Chulbangyi, who got kicked out then,

231
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,370
always said they'd cut off Gye Sang Mok's head.

232
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,590
If he's dead, we should see his corpse.

233
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,480
If they killed him and tossed his body outside the Gyeonggang,

234
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,150
we wouldn't see it just yet.

235
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,280
But why are you suddenly interested in Gye Sang Mok?

236
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,540
Well, I kind of have some debt.

237
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,290
You have debt?

238
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,520
Aigoo, oh, no. What to do?

239
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,730
My gosh.

240
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,510
Others will frown upon a woman about to get married going out too much.

241
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,080
Who is about to get married?

242
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,280
Who else?

243
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,270
You, Maiden.

244
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,390
I will politely ask the Minister of Defense for your hand in marriage today.

245
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,180
I will not marry an ugly man.

246
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,740
I mean, who are you calling ugly?

247
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,840
You. You.

248
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,740
Step aside!

249
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,960
You should not behave so arrogantly toward

250
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,560
your husband you will serve all your life.

251
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,380
Quietly go to the annex and read Biographies of Exemplary Women.

252
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,070
I will not adore and say yes to everything you say as your father does.

253
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,350
Thank you in advance, Father-in-law.

254
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,750
Gosh, why call me 'Father-in-law' already?

255
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,740
To ask her hand in marriage,

256
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,380
my grandson brought you a valuable gift.

257
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,020
My goodness. You did not have to.

258
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,410
It is the highest quality bamboo fan with a golden closure.

259
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,020
I hope it is to your liking...

260
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,230
It was in here.

261
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,250
What are you doing?

262
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,130
It was definitely in here. I put it in here...

263
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,820
Whose husband?

264
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,900
Gosh!

265
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,910
Have Young Master Jo followed.

266
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,150
He's not a prudent character.

267
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm sure he'll make a mistake.

268
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,380
Yes, sir.

269
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,660
Sir!

270
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,320
Gosh, where do you think you're going?

271
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,860
Gosh, no!

272
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,300
No, you can't!

273
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,170
Did you not hear that Gye Sang Mok went to the banquet with the Giringak gisaengs?

274
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,710
Some Giringak gisaeng could know his whereabouts.

275
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,840
This is Giringak. Giringak.

276
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,280
It is under the protection of the Capital Bureau and Police Bureau.

277
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,920
It is where high-ranking officials and dignitaries drink in secret.

278
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,060
If you mess with a place such as this recklessly,

279
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,270
it will become a massive problem.

280
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,180
- However–
- Now is not the time.

281
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,650
Summon the owner to the Office of Inspector General in the morning

282
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,820
and you can interrogate. Isn't that so?

283
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,040
- It will be quick.
- Wait, wait!

284
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,850
No, you can't!

285
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,080
To where?

286
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,360
Be quiet.

287
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,590
Be quiet!

288
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,260
How care you block my path?

289
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,910
Aigoo, Sir. My apologies.

290
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,840
Oh, I see. It's you.

291
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,690
That annoying country bumpkin who took my first place in the state exam.

292
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,880
Country bumpkin?

293
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,570
If it weren't for you,

294
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,940
I wouldn't be a mere guard in class rank nine?

295
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,110
Because of you!

296
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,600
 I have to retake the state examination.

297
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,020
 Nothing happens to sons of rich families even if they frequent gibangs.

298
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,770
 Forcing someone to take on debt and write up a slavery contract isn't a crime.

299
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,580
 But distilling alcohol is a crime deserving of death?

300
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,760
It looks like what you did during the exam was not a mistake.

301
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,450
You have to retake the state exam, not because of me but because you have no shame.

302
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,640
I'm not sure if you have no shame because you drank

303
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,240
or you drank since you are shameless.

304
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,200
You sure speak recklessly with that mouth of yours.

305
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,470
Hey, you. Say that again.

306
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,080
Aigoo, Sir. Please do not do this.

307
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,610
How dare you!

308
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,950
How dare you interfere?

309
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,780
You're merely an officer.

310
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,410
I beg your pardon, Sir.

311
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,830
You just hit an officer of the Office of Inspector General.

312
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,280
That's right.

313
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,840
I can hit an officer a hundred times over.

314
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,020
Why?

315
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,530
Are you complaining?

316
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,250
Any complaints?

317
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,080
Any complaints? I just ought to–

318
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,420
Young Master Jo assaulted an Office of Inspector General officer while intoxicated.

319
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,500
You are under arrest for breaking prohibition and obstruction of justice.

320
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,790
- Officer Hwang, tie him.
- You'd better let go.

321
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,820
Inspector Nam.

322
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,460
What are you doing? Tie him!

323
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,030
Yes, yes, sir.

324
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,180
- All right.
- My apologies.

325
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,710
You'd better let me go when I'm nice.

326
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,250
I got you!

327
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,460
You've been sneaking a peek into our house since earlier.

328
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,780
Who are you?

329
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,310
Oh? You want to fight it?

330
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,710
I said, show me your face when I'm being nice!

331
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,690
Geum!

332
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,670
My Lady!

333
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,980
Give it! I should just!

334
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,510
Geum.

335
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,780
Mother, my other half has finally shown up.

336
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,270
Gem.

337
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,220
Where have you been?

338
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,210
I waited for you for so long, My Lady!

339
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,090
How about you?

340
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,330
Where have you been?

341
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,420
I thought something terrible had happened.

342
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,910
Something terrible has indeed happened, My Lady.

343
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,180
Gosh.

344
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,430
Where are we going?

345
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,780
We're almost there, My Lady.

346
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,260
Over here...

347
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,050
My gosh...

348
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,560
This is...

349
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,400
Please go inside.

350
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,160
My Lady.

351
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,330
Gye Sang Mok?

352
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,170
Why is Gye Sang Mok here?

353
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,470
Well, ah-um...

354
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,820
My gosh! What's this? What!

355
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,070
H-he's dead.

356
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,070
He's dead. Dead.

357
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,680
He's dead. Oh, my!

358
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,090
He's alive!

359
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,240
What will you do?

360
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,190
Why did you bring him here?

361
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,880
What else could I do?

362
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,050
If I report to the Police Bureau,

363
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,310
they'll find out we're moonshiners.

364
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,840
And if I left him there, he'd be back to take revenge.

365
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,920
But still, what do we do...

366
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,800
Hurry and take him back where you found him.

367
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,970
What?

368
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,640
Geez, my head...

369
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,650
My head hurts...

370
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
What's with you two?

371
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,760
S***!

372
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,440
What's this?

373
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,870
Hey.

374
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,470
Untie this.

375
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,540
Untie this! Untie me!

376
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,940
Oh, my gosh!

377
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,700
This? This guy?

378
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,960
Take this guy back there? Whoa!

379
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,490
Did you guys do it?

380
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,240
How many came in?

381
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,580
I guess you're in a bind again?

382
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,040
Answer me.

383
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,410
How many are in Hangyang?

384
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,030
Do you think that the rumor about Hanyang without liquor spread only to Gwangju?

385
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,370
Rumors fly.

386
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,890
When bad things continue to happen,

387
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,630
it's a sign.

388
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,370
Droplets of water mean...

389
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,950
that the levee will collapse soon.

390
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,840
Then look at it clearly in heaven.

391
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,650
As a consequence of your actions,

392
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,560
how your gang would pay.

393
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,980
You've crossed the river you shouldn't have crossed.

394
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,270
Lee Shi Heum!

395
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,730
Lee Shi Heum, come out now!

396
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,850
Left State Minister.

397
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,270
What brings you here so early this morning?

398
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,050
What do you intend to do with my grandson?

399
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,870
Your esteemed grandson who was arrested for violating the prohibition?

400
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,810
Why do you ask me about matters in the Office of Inspector General?

401
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,780
Do not feign ignorance!

402
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,580
Your specialty is accusing someone innocent!

403
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,960
You must have plotted a scheme in regard to this as well.

404
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,890
Left State Minister.

405
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,520
You must be incredibly worried.

406
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,200
Indeed, as ocean waves are rough these days,

407
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,840
the ships with exiles capsizing

408
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,210
is not even that out of the ordinary.

409
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,900
What?

410
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,110
What did you say?

411
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,770
Please have a cup of water and go home.

412
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,710
Serve Left State Minister a cup of water!

413
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,710
Chief Royal Secretary, save me!

414
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,890
He is a third-generation only son, precious to our family.

415
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,060
If our family name is cut off this way,

416
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,880
how can I face my ancestors?

417
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,310
Ancestors?

418
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,430
As you know, I was...

419
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,250
a lowly former government slave.

420
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,120
I do not know where my hometown is

421
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,110
nor do I know who my ancestors are.

422
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,080
I have lived all my life that way.

423
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,860
Please.

424
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,450
But Your Excellency,

425
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:06,690
you are able to go back to your hometown, serve your ancestors, and quietly live out your life.

426
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,920
I am incredibly envious of you.

427
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,280
I will submit a letter of resignation to His Majesty.

428
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,520
Would that suffice?

429
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,100
Your precious grandson will arrive in your hometown

430
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,670
in perfect health, in one piece.

431
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,100
Your Excellency Jo.

432
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,570
What?

433
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,250
Because Nam Young arrested Young Master Jo,

434
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,610
Left State Minister requested a temporary post?

435
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,430
If so, the shadow that was cast in my future is finally lifted...

436
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,560
Dazzling!

437
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,300
How could this be?

438
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,600
How could this be?

439
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,210
A rare talent from generation to generation.

440
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,710
A man of resilience in a turbulent world.

441
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,870
Whoa, what are you doing/

442
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,380
You're truly an outstanding man who will rectify and save this chaotic era.

443
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,410
An inspector of the Office of Inspector General should be like this.

444
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,890
Disregarding your own future,

445
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,800
your impetuousness in denouncing wrongdoing.

446
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,180
Although your advancement will be difficult since Chief State Minister will resent you for it.

447
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,290
- Pardon?
- But still, that's a lot.

448
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,480
You could line up under the Chief Royal Secretary.

449
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,860
Of course, Crown Prince is not happy with you, so

450
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,120
if Crown Prince finds out about your achievement,

451
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,770
he'll no longer hate you.

452
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,590
But...

453
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,670
how did you know about Crown Prince and me, Chief?

454
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,700
You're dazzling. So dazzling.

455
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,020
My goodness.

456
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,110
Is that true?

457
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,490
Are you saying the marriage proposal has been called off?

458
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,640
Yes, My Lady.

459
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,860
Heaven helped me.

460
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,560
I almost got married off to that mud hopper-looking man.

461
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,680
I wonder what his name is,

462
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,610
where he lives, if he's married...

463
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,250
- Geez!
- Go ahead.

464
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,620
Gosh, seriously!

465
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,070
Hurry up! Hurry!

466
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,190
Geez!

467
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,650
- Come on.
- Stop.

468
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,040
Go here.

469
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,750
Turn around, both of you.

470
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,580
What?

471
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,510
You're going to watch me go?

472
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,560
You'd better not mess around.

473
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,080
We came prepared!

474
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,350
I got it.

475
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,100
I'm going to pee in my pants. Hurry.

476
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,210
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

477
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,210
Before that, I have some questions.

478
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,250
What now? Hurry up!

479
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:54,300
What do you mean you can't moonshine in Hanyang?

480
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,190
Drinking is illegal anyway.

481
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,860
How come you can, but I can't?

482
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,300
Do you think I'd tell you that?

483
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,420
I'm really going to pee.

484
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,940
Hurry up and turn around. Untie this, too!

485
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,680
Gosh, then hold it a little longer.

486
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,280
It's illegal, so you make money.

487
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,540
Since you can't drink, the price will skyrocket that much more.

488
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,750
Who'd want to share such a profitable business?

489
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,400
Selling liquor in Hanyang is a monopoly?

490
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,830
Happy now?

491
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,560
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

492
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,040
Hurry, hurry.

493
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,720
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

494
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,040
Then all those liquor jars in mokbingo are...

495
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,940
That's all...

496
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,390
a plan that someone invested...

497
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,720
so much time and money.

498
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,260
No wonder you're in trouble since you tried to devour

499
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,710
all that by yourself.

500
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,180
Who is it?

501
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,670
Who is the person who planned all that?

502
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,190
Why are you curious about that?

503
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,240
You'll die anyway.

504
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,780
S***!

505
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,100
My Lady! My Lady, pull!

506
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,190
Darn it! Seriously!

507
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,680
- You sure don't listen!
- You two...

508
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,820
I will get you.

509
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,790
I'll never let you die nicely.

510
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,480
Pull, pull!

511
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:49,290
What will you do by selling the Confucian classics, Scholar?

512
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,680
I need some emergency funds.

513
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,260
Fifty nyang? For one red certificate*?
(A certificate showing that you passed the state exam)

514
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,800
A fake red certificate goes for 20 nyang.

515
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,880
You could get 50 nyang for a genuine red certificate.

516
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,320
 You said you have the first-place winner from the state exam as your tenant.

517
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,530
 Just close your eyes and sneak it out.

518
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,660
 Just because he loses the red certificate doesn't mean his first place is canceled.

519
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,660

520
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,350
 Is anyone home?

521
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,980
Is anyone–

522
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,190
You're home.

523
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,830
Is Inspector Nam in?

524
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,490
He has not come home yet.

525
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,780
Who are you?

526
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,070
Ro Seo.

527
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,390
Jade Lad.

528
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,680
Maiden.

529
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,690
What brings you here, Jade Lad?

530
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,130
I came to meet Inspector Nam, but

531
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,980
I guess I actually missed you, Maiden.

532
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,890
What's he saying?

533
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,500
Goodness.

534
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,310
Why did you come here?

535
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:28,070
By coming to an inspector's home, are you saying, "Come and get me"?

536
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,540
Are you worried about me?

537
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,390
We all almost died together. Wouldn't I worry?

538
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,490
Before Young Tenant comes home, hurry and go home.

539
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,600
Why are you laughing?

540
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,260
My house is enormous.

541
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,150
So we almost never see a person's face this up close.

542
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,440
But...

543
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,630
this isn't so bad.

544
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,440
Don't worry about Inspector Nam.

545
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,750
I came because I have something to tell him in person.

546
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,560
What a gutsy bastard!

547
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,470
How dare he messes with Left State Minister's grandson!

548
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,000
We know for sure now.

549
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,460
The King and the Chief Royal Secretary are using that foolish country bumpkin

550
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,970
to keep us in check! That is for sure.

551
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,630
If it were not Young Master Jo and someone else were to go to the Crown Prince's palace,

552
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,710
the same thing would happen!

553
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,010
Father, why not do something about that inspector?

554
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,630
It's not difficult to break a leg of a hunting dog.

555
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,720
But if we kill off one hunting dog, they'll only find another.

556
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,600
What good is it?

557
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,910
Then, what should we do?

558
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:56,660
We must cut off its head.

559
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,350
Without the head,

560
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:05,230
a hunting dog would be the same as a wild dog.

561
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,120
My Lord.

562
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,560
I had no idea you'd come to see me first.

563
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
I came here to give you my answer

564
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,170
to your question.

565
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:44,960
In the Book of Changes, there is a trigram called 'Myung.'

566
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,200
If a foolish king is on top,

567
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,610
a bright servant will get hurt.

568
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,640
What?

569
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,300
No matter how we use the scissors,

570
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:05,110
I do not believe that tree would flourish.

571
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,500
Inspector Nam, Sir, you're home.

572
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,260
Eunuch Officer Kim, what brings you here?

573
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,770
- It's okay.
- I'll try carrying it.

574
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,250
- Give it to me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

575
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,330
- I'll carry it.
- It's okay.

576
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,010
I'll try carrying it.

577
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,080
I'll try carrying it.

578
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,430
It's okay. It's okay.

579
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,460
It's okay. It's okay.

580
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,310
Young Tenant.

581
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,420
Inspector Nam, you're here.

582
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,650
Please follow me for a moment.

583
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,260
It's okay.

584
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,650
Was it you, Your Highness?

585
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,320
Did you get rid of the evidence?

586
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,200
By chance,

587
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,000
did you also kill Gye Sang Mok?

588
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,520
They swung swords at Crown Prince.

589
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,320
They deserve death by dismemberment for the crime of treason.

590
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,060
But I buried them nicely. It was a lenient treatment.

591
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,280
Lenient...

592
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,950
treatment?

593
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,320
So Maiden does not need to worry as well.

594
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,350
She does not need to worry?

595
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,110
An inspector caught her while selling liquor to the Crown Prince.

596
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,540
If this incident is revealed,

597
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,450
Maiden will certainly die.

598
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,320
Maiden does not know that I'm Crown Prince.

599
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,100
And the inspector who witnessed it will keep his mouth shut.

600
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,660
All the witnesses died and are no longer in this world.

601
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,980
If Maiden were to be in danger,

602
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,470
that would not be because of me,

603
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,170
but because of your tongue.

604
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,500
Do not pass up your responsibility.

605
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,910
Due to your irresponsible behavior on Buddha's Birthday,

606
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,290
people died, and everyone is now in a bind.

607
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,700
No.

608
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,090
Everyone is in a bind because of prohibition.

609
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,900
Prohibition is only a justification.

610
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,730
A justification that sounds good, saying it prevents wasting rice.

611
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,080
Do you know what His Majesty is indeed trying to do?

612
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,210
Banning.

613
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,110
Power comes from banning things.

614
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,810
Banning drinking.

615
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,600
Banning women from remarriage.

616
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,530
Banning slaves from arguing his master.

617
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,930
Banning subjects from confronting the king.

618
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,640
All of these...

619
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,170
point to one thing.

620
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,980
As long as distinguished officials have reasons,

621
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,460
they can change the king.

622
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,280
So His Majesty can only go up against them with his justification.

623
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,810
Justification?

624
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,050
Whom is he trying to protect by using that justification?

625
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,750
What?

626
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,860
With a good sounding justification such as prohibition,

627
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,700
who do you think His Majesty is trying to protect?

628
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,670
What are you talking about?

629
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,920
Do not pretend not to know.

630
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,860
You behave no better than hoodlums in the street markets.

631
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,160
So His Majesty and Chief Royal Secretary are using shallow tricks

632
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,600
in order to protect you, if that is what it takes, Your Highness.

633
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,550
You are the one who turns those around you into

634
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,970
men of small character, Your Highness.

635
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,990
So how different are you?

636
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,780
You wanted to impress me, and that is why

637
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,330
you arrested Left State Minister's grandson.

638
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,180
Even if I were to be your servant, Your Highness,

639
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,760
I'd only become an imposter who blocks a newcomer's initiation.

640
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,540
No more, no less, obviously.

641
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,460
Why would I desire that

642
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,020
and become your servant, Your Highness?

643
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,980
Geez, that chief...

644
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,570
Then why have you not reported the incident?

645
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,700
What is the reason you're keeping silent about the Buddha's Birthday incident?

646
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:11,220
- That is–
 - If you're not trying to use me as a connection,

647
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,440
are you in love with Maiden or something?

648
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,450
What are you talking about? Love?

649
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,980
It's neither about connection nor love.

650
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,590
Then what are you trying to do exactly?

651
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,900
You're a mere country lad without any family backing.

652
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,210
What can you do without any type of connection?

653
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,660
A mere country lad...

654
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,840
without any family backing?

655
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,190
Wait and see.

656
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,750
I'll show you what a country lad without a family backing

657
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,970
nor any connection could do.

658
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,920
It's Destroying Angel mushroom.

659
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,930
If you put it in porridge and feed it to him,

660
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,700
it will damage his intestine

661
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,640
and he'll die in a couple of days.

662
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,890
You're suggesting we kill him?

663
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,120
And if we don't kill him?

664
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,660
What if someone finds him when we're away?

665
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,550
That is true, but...

666
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,050
As long as that bastard dies,

667
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,290
your debt will all disappear.

668
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,130
Everything will be resolved with this one poisonous mushroom.

669
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,670
 If you're not trying to use me as a connection,

670
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,000
 are you in love with Maiden or something?

671
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,040
Love?

672
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,280
That criminal?

673
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,570
Did Jade Lad leave?

674
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,060
There is no way.

675
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,210
Young Tenant, wait. I have something to say.

676
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,190
Do not come closer.

677
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,920
Actually, Gye Sang Mok...

678
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,930
Gye Sang Mok is dead.

679
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,250
- Excuse me?
- So...

680
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,180
you do not need to worry any longer, Maiden.

681
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,840
What do you mean Gye Sang Mok is dead?

682
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,130
Where did you hear that?

683
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,610
Let go!

684
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,890
Young Tenant.

685
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,000
Let us stop right here.

686
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,860
Gye Sang Mok is dead

687
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,180
and all the evidence and witnesses from that day are all gone.

688
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,020
Whatever you do or whatever happens to you,

689
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,620
I do not wish to know.

690
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,380
I will move out of here as quickly as I can.

691
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,700
Let us stop the ill-fated destiny between you and me right here.

692
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,640
My Lord!

693
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,800
Chief Royal Secretary, take a look at this.

694
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,730
What is all the fuss about, Royal Secretary?

695
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,800
There is an appeal to the king.

696
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,120
The content is quite...

697
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,520

698
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,450

I do not have fame nor talent.

699
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,010
 But Your Majesty has shown me overflowing grace.

700
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:08,920
 However, I have committed an enormous crime of not being able to return your grace with my service.

701
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,800
 Please dismiss me from my current post.

702
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:18,630
 I turned a blind eye to inspectors in the Office of Inspector General pouring wine at times

703
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,270
 and only to be initiated,

704
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,130
 I worked harder to catch poor civilians who were

705
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,000
 selling a bottle of takju.

706
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,990
 That is my first crime.

707
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,810
 In order to punish me, Crown Prince

708
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,720
 ordered Chief Inspector Kim Seok Won

709
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,220
 to make me return to my home in the country.

710
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,180
 I did not comprehend his will and went against the plan.

711
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,070
 That is my second crime.

712
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:51,450
 The fact that Crown Prince roamed around streets alone on Buddha's Birthday

713
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,890
 and breaking prohibition without hesitation

714
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:59,930
 is all because I tormented Crown Prince.

715
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,520
 That again is...

716
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,740
 my third crime.

717
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,010
 I present this forthright statement putting my life on the line.

718
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,810
Chief!

719
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,450
Nam Young submitted...

720
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,440
an appeal requesting dismissal of the entire Office of Inspector General.

721
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:19,990
No!

722
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:21,920
 Dismiss the Chief Inspector Kim Seok Won and...

723
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,640
 13 other inspectors in the Office of Inspector General.

724
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,280
 Select upright and righteous servants

725
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,900
 to educate and cultivate Crown Prince

726
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,720
 and counsel him when is in the wrong.

727
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,560
That crazy bastard.

728
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,810

729
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:42,900
Summon Inspector Nam Young of the Office of Inspector General, who wrote this appeal right away!

730
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,560
A newcomer who became an inspector for less than a month.

731
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,950
Not only did you impeach all your supervisors,

732
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,830
you wrote an appeal strongly reproaching Crown Prince.

733
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,210
Do you dare wish to live?

734
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,690
Seeing the perilous state of our nation,

735
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:04,030
how could I promote only my personal comfort?

736
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:10,060
I beg your deep understanding of my patriotism.

737
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,410
You disarrayed the hierarchy within an organization

738
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,290
and you dare insult the Crown Prince.

739
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:16,980
Is that the patriotism you speak of?

740
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,180
I do not wish to beg for my safety, Your Majesty.

741
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,780
You!

742
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,940
Indeed wish to die.

743
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,800
 He's not a hunting dog nor a wild dog.

744
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,820
 A wolf cub, huh?

745
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,410
 No matter how we use the scissors,

746
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,870
 I do not believe that tree would flourish.

747
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,560
Your Majesty.

748
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,410
You must strictly consider Nam Young's irreverence

749
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,570
and punish him severely.

750
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,460
Your Majesty.

751
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,670
Fundamentally, three offices of Joseon*
(Office of Inspector General, Censors, Special Advisors)

752
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:07,850
put their lives on the line when making their appeal to you, Sire.

753
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:11,010
If you were to punish him severely over this,

754
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,720
I fear the ability to speak uprightly may be stifled.

755
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,740
I beg your deep understanding, Your Majesty.

756
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,480
I do not want to hear such a thing.

757
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,060
Dismiss Inspector Nam Young and withdraw his appointment document.

758
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,820
However, Your Majesty...

759
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,050
He requested his dismissal, and you granted his wish.

760
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,250
That cannot be severe punishment.

761
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:43,450
Let Inspector Nam Young concurrently hold a post as a librarian in Crown Prince Sigangwon

762
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:47,300
and be accountable for the words he just spoke of.

763
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,260
Pardon?

764
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:55,160
Inspector Nam who does not fear death and makes a forthright plea

765
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,190
is perfect to be Crown Prince's teacher.

766
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,880
Your Majesty.

767
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,340
But the work at the Crown Prince Sigangwon...

768
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,920
What you say does make sense, Chief Royal Secretary.

769
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,990
Nam Young, I will appoint you as a librarian at Crown Prince Sigangwon.

770
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,710
Go to the Crown Prince's palace once a week

771
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:18,750
and educate the Crown Prince yourself and counsel his wrongdoings.

772
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,750
Y-y-your Majesty...

773
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,940
Please withdraw your command.

774
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,140
Please...

775
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,170
Please send me in exile.

776
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,550
No...

777
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,020
Please punish me with death!

778
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,030
Please punish me with death, Your Majesty!

779
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,680
Move it.

780
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,060
What if you damage your recovery?

781
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,540
I didn't like him from the beginning.

782
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,880
How dare you stab me in the back?

783
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:36,790
To stop a tiger,

784
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:40,180
you should not raise a wolf.

785
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,480
Are you not the one who recommended that

786
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,720
we select counsels for Crown Prince and educate him?

787
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,700
Well...

788
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,340
so that you do not end up like me,

789
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,100
you should watch out, Chief Royal Secretary.

790
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:31,170
 Whatever you do or whatever happens to you,

791
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,360
 I do not wish to know.

792
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,360
 Do not drag me further into your overly dramatic life!

793
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,820
That's right.

794
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:43,730
I can do it alone.

795
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,910
I can take care of it by myself.

796
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,340
Where are you going at this hour?

797
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,390
Why do you ask me such a thing?

798
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,350
You said you no longer are interested in what I do.

799
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:30,510
I didn't say I wanted to know.

800
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,630
Because you roam around late at night like this,

801
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:34,910
I'm just saying you should behave.

802
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,640
You behave yourself, Young Tenant.

803
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,360
Decide whether you'll arrest me or no longer care what I do.

804
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,300
Whatever.

805
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,090
Don't worry about what that woman does. Don't mind her.

806
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,510
Are you hungry?

807
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,160
It's time to eat.

808
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,050
How much longer will you keep me here?

809
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,510
Shut up.

810
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,980
Eat this porridge.

811
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,310
My Lady.

812
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:37,020
Do you know what's in here?

813
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,510
Destroying Angel mushroom.

814
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:43,630
Even with one bite, it will destroy your intestine and kill you.

815
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,060
Poisonous mushroom.

816
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,290
Why did you tell him that, My Lady?

817
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,920
It's one of the two.

818
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,810
Eat this and die here

819
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,410
or forget about everything that happened with us.

820
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,380
Oh, yes...

821
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,060
Of course, of course.

822
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,330
Even that 100-nyang debt...

823
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,140
I'll forget about it.

824
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,030
Let us all go our separate ways from here.

825
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:08,310
Don't listen to him, My Lady. Of course, he's lying.

826
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,260
N-no, I'm not.

827
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,580
I'm telling the truth.

828
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,270
How about the promissory note? Where is it?

829
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,520
At the gambling den.

830
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:19,230
If you untie me, I'll go right over and bring it back.

831
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,360
No, My Lady!

832
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,300
If you keep him alive, he'll surely come back to take revenge.

833
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,510
You should shut up!

834
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,930
My Lady and I are talking.

835
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,180
You shut up!

836
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,370
Do you really want to croak?

837
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,670
See?

838
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,680
Look at him. He says he'll kill us.

839
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,570
My Lady, he's like this.

840
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,150
Hurry up and feed him the porridge.

841
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,390
My Lady, darn it.

842
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,870
Hey, say ah.

843
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,350
Wait, Geum. Geum, wait a minute!

844
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:52,510
It's all taken care of as long as he dies!

845
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,640
What are you doing here?

846
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,410
- Listen–
- Don't touch me!

847
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,600
Listen to me. There is a reason.

848
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,250
What reason?

849
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,440
Moonshining wasn't enough, and now...

850
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,180
Maiden, seriously...

851
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,790
Are you not afraid of heaven?

852
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,060
It's not like that.

853
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:31,640
If not, isn't that a person tied up in there?

854
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,810
What were you going to do?

855
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,770
I don't know!

856
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,430
We did this because we didn't know what to do.

857
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,200
Whether to kill him or keep him alive...

858
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,080
I just don't know.

859
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,250
I tried to understand somehow

860
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,740
how desperate your situation is. But...

861
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,580
no more.

862
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,930
I do not have a choice.

863
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,370
Okay.

864
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,950
There.

865
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:23,400
Wait...

866
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,410
- Let go.
- My Lady, stop him!

867
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:30,940
Selling liquor in Hanyang is a monopoly.

868
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,710
What?

869
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,690
Why do you think Gye Sang Mok said we couldn't moonshine in Hanyang without permission?

870
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:47,670
He said he'd kill other moonshiners.

871
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:51,170
If we release him now,

872
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,130
he'll kill us.

873
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,510
My Lady! Get him!

874
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:03,080
Ouch!

875
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,320
Geez, what are you doing?

876
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,490
If we die, it's all your fault, Sir!

877
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:15,770
You're all dead!

878
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,920
Stop right there!

879
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,080
S***, would you stop if you were me?

880
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:30,860
D*** it.

881
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,420
S***, seriously...

882
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:10,780
S-save me, My Lady.

883
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:14,160
Sav-save me...

884
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,510
S-save me...

885
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,210
Save me...

886
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,560
That's right.

887
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,180
That's right.

888
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,380
A little more.

889
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,720
A little bit more.

890
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:44,050
A bit more.

891
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,290
You can't let go.

892
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,140
Don't let go.

893
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,010
Don't let go.

894
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:12,520
A little bit more.

895
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,440
A little more.

896
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,380

897
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:47,280
♫  Even when I'm all right, when a night like tonight is here  ♫

898
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:55,540
♫  I remember the tear you held back  ♫

899
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:59,280
♫  Lean on my embrace, and you can rest now  ♫

900
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,190

901
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,640
 We're all dead now.

902
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,070
 We'll all die.

903
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:10,210
 The physician says he's over the critical point.

904
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:12,990
 When he awakes, he'll come to kill us.

905
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,100
 - Take of your clothes.
- What?

906
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,870
 Did she go to save Gye Sang Mok?

907
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:18,540
 She went to kill him.

908
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:21,140
 I'm sorry. This is the only way.

909
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,070
 Why did you only find out that Gye Sang Mok was here!

910
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,640
 Go inside and sleep.

911
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,040
 Nothing will happen tonight.

912
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,860
♫  Even when I'm all right  ♫
