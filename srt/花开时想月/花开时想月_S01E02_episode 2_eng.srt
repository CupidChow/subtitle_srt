1
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,210

I'm proud of you.

2
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,910
It has been 200 years since our Nam family has lived away from holding an office.

3
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,610
It is finally time we enter the royal court and make our family name known.

4
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,350
Father, it is all thanks to you for raising and taking care of me.

5
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,640
Not only is he the winner of the state examination, look how handsome he is.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,710
The only thing you are lacking is the power and influence of the family.

7
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,410
I will find a wife who will strengthen you.

8
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,960
Therefore, do not hang around those who are not respectful

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,780
and do not go to any improper places.

10
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,180
Do not forget this.

11
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,970
The future of our family depends on you, Young.

12
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,180
Self-discipline comes from an upright heart.

13
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,290
If you do not hold it in your heart,

14
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,590
you cannot see even if you look,

15
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,470
and you cannot understand even if–

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,580

17
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,670

18
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,480
You cannot understand even if–

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,000

20
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,720

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,300
You cannot understand even if–

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,710
Really!

23
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,020
Geez...

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,650

25
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,890
What in the world? How odd and bizarre!

26
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,820
I agree. Agree.

27
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,830
I definitely agree.

28
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,400
I never dreamed that a Jangwon* would rent a room from us.
(The first-place winner from the state examination)

29
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,580
This is the hand that placed you in the first place!

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,680
- Ro Seo, this is the hand of a Jangwon!
- Yes, yes...

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,150
Did you have to find a room in a place like this?

32
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,320
After paying the horse rental 80 nyang for the lost horse,

33
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,440
I only had 20 nyang left. What can I do?

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,670
Please endure for a few months.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,510
 You said you desperately need the money.

36
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,560
That young master is a scholar from the countryside who knows nothing about Hanyang.

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,250
That's why he's moving in paying 20 nyang.

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,850
If it were anyone else, he would never pay 20 nyang for that room.

39
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:12,270
I thought of you, My Lady. That's why I brought someone easy to rip off.

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,400
Brother, please come and eat.

41
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,720
She accepts three nyang for meals for a month.

42
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,690
How is it that the side dishes are so shabby?

43
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,410
Aigoo, look at this.

44
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,050
It's a feast since we have a winner from the examination.

45
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,410
A feast?

46
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,770
Nam, come here and sit down.

47
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,990
Aigoo...

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,490
Why would you sit there, Maiden?

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,740
Should I eat standing up then?

50
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,310
There should be a distinction between men and women.

51
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,960
How could we share the same table?

52
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,640
Choon Gae, come and eat with us.

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,260
- Yes.
- Yes, My Lady.

54
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,340
There is a distinction between masters and servants.

55
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,770
How could a master and a servant share the same table?

56
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,450
Then just starve!

57
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,740
 Therefore, do not hang around those who are not respectful

58
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,930
 and do not go to any improper places.

59
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,480
Eat slowly.

60
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,410
Here you go.

61
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,990
Nam, here you go.

62
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,380
Ro Seo, eat plenty.

63
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,500
We were lonely, just the two of us.

64
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,540
Now, it feels like a home with people in it, with all of us bustling.

65
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,570
Let us get along just like one happy family.

66
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,500
We're family now that we share our meals. There is not much to it.

67
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,560
One family?

68
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,030
- Choon Gae, eat a lot.
- Yes.

69
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,930
Try this. It's white kimchi.

70
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,430
There you go.

71
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,370

72
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,660
Wow, are there two suns?

73
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,880
You look brilliant!

74
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,790
Are you an in-inspector?

75
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,320
That is right.

76
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,260
 Why is she staring at me like that? So burdensome.

77
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,100
Look at these glaring eyes.

78
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,680
Gosh, what are you doing?

79
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,790
These are the eyes that recognize criminals

80
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,530
and attacks the wicked with his horn.

81
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,470
It is the Haechi.*
(Mystical animal signifying integrity in politics)

82
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,520
Aigoo, yes. Well, then.

83
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,370
There's Haechi on your back, too.

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,490
Of all the offices he could hold,

85
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,160
why does he have to be an inspector?

86
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm surname Nam, Young, appointed to the Office of Inspector General.

87
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,630
My greeting to you, Crown Prince.

88
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,950
Lift your head.

89
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,640
 How dare you!

90
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,460
 - Geez!
- Step back!

91
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,950
 Did he use his foot?

92
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,800
 Did you just kick me?

93
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,190
That...

94
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,360
What is wrong?

95
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,870
You look as though you have seen me before somewhere.

96
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,670
Well...

97
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,530
That is not possible...

98
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,460
I recently arrived in Hanyang. How could I...

99
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,770
have seen your face when you're in the palace, Crown Prince?

100
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,450
I thought you were a country bumpkin who was utterly lost.

101
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,870
You understand me better than I gave you credit for.

102
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,590
I will remember your face and name.

103
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,270
You may leave now.

104
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,560
Do not forget that your life will be

105
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,580
cut short if you have a loose tongue.

106
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,910
What?

107
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,900
The ribbon of your robe is unfastened.

108
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,340
'Yong-wi-eo-bok. Eo-ja-teuk-ji.'

109
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,320

It is said that if a dragon is dressed up as a fish, a fisherman could catch a dragon.

110
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,380
What?

111
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,280
If a fisherman catches a dragon and makes a fish stew out of it,

112
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,950
how would anyone know whether that is

113
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,050
fish stew or dragon stew?

114
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,920
Fish stew?

115
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,350
Your Highness, I pray that

116
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,630
you do not lose your dignity

117
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,270
and do not become lazy about keeping formality.

118
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,380
That punk! Is he saying he will catch and make fish stew out of me?

119
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,340
S***...

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,170
This one looks good.

121
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,510
Nice!

122
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,360
And next...

123
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,940
this one and that one.

124
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,100
My Lady!

125
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,520
You startled me, My Lady.

126
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,500
Do you steal those medicinal herbs and buy liquor?

127
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,890
Gosh! Do you know how expensive liquor is?

128
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,940
It doesn't add up to be much by stealing–

129
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,710
No. Why...

130
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,850
What?

131
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,530
What's wrong? What is it, My Lady?

132
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,790
Geum...

133
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,640
Do you want to make some money with me?

134
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,970
Crazy!

135
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,090
Did you make this?

136
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,950
I learned how to make it from my father when I was little.

137
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,750
How is it?

138
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,520
What is this?

139
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,650
Why...

140
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,720
Why do I detect the warm scent of spring from a drink?

141
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,780
Why do I taste the fruit I have never tasted from a drink?

142
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,940
Did-did you really make this, My Lady?

143
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,960
Do you think I can make some money with this?

144
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,580
Yes-no, no!

145
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,060
Are you out of your mind?

146
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,880
The crackdown on prohibition these days is no joke.

147
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,270
You'll get in big trouble, My Lady!

148
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,220
It costs 20 poon per glass.

149
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,820
So it will be worth 20 nyang per jar.

150
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,990
I could not earn ten nyang even if I worked for a month.

151
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,180
But I can earn 20 nyang with this one jar.

152
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,020
Gosh, but still...

153
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,210
Still, if you get caught, you'd be exiled.

154
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,150
No way.

155
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,680
If I sold one jar a day,

156
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,500
I'd make 200 nyang in ten days.

157
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Six hundred nyang for a month.

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Six hundred nyang! Six hundred...

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,840
Six hundred nyang... Six hundred?

160
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,550
With that much money, I could pay off my debt and

161
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,500
you can become a commoner rather than a slave.

162
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,510
Let's do it only for a month.

163
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,840
I'll give you half.

164
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,640
Whatever I make, I'll give you half.

165
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,990
Half?

166
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,010
Chief Royal Secretary asks for you, sir.

167
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,550
Please get on the horse.

168
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,030
Sir.

169
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,970
What do you think?

170
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,150
The garden is quite as beautiful as the palace, isn't it?

171
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,720
At one time, it belonged to my master.

172
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:46,180
Since then, it had always been my job to look after this garden.

173
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,640
The trees might seem like they will grow without a problem if you leave them alone.

174
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,880
But actually, it's not like that.

175
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,140
You have to see if any of the branches are diseased,

176
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,310
or they're overgrowing but weakly...

177
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,610
I have to observe carefully if they're getting enough sun.

178
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,020
Is that so?

179
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,700
This tree...

180
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,330
This tree is hidden under the shadows of big trees

181
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,700
and cannot see much light.

182
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,080
Look at this.

183
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,060
The leaves have lost vitality

184
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,890
and the stems are drying up as the days go by.

185
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,270
What do you think I should do with a tree like this one?

186
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,650
To cut out the shade, so small trees could thrive.

187
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,540
The duty of the king's subjects is no different.

188
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,520
For His Majesty and the Crown Prince,

189
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,440
I will willingly become this pair of scissors.

190
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,750
Could you also be someone like that?

191
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,630
It's my deceased wife's 49th-day memorial ritual.

192
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,150
No matter how strict the prohibition law is,

193
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,820
I really want to use good quality alcohol for the ritual.

194
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,530
I will wish for her to be born a noble lady in her next life.

195
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,330
My Lady, the alcohol.

196
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,520
It's one nyang.

197
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,650
Yes.

198
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,360
Thank you.

199
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,700
Thank you so much.

200
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,870
Wait.

201
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,910
Buy something delicious and feed it to your baby.

202
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,710
You said you'd make 600 nyang a month.

203
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,060
When will you make that money when you're listening to all the sob stories?

204
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,150
We can make money from people who do not have to

205
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,390
squeeze every penny they got.

206
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,180
Gosh, I don't know about this.

207
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,430
Gosh!

208
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,200
Geum, wait for me.

209
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,260
A foolish king and a loyal subject...

210
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,590
Are you worried about something?

211
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,310
Whenever you have worries, you always wash brushes like that.

212
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,740
Did I do that?

213
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,610
I'll have to warm up more water.

214
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,050
Give it to me. I'll do bring it for you.

215
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,980
No. I'll go myself. I'll get some fresh air.

216
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,310
What are you doing there right now?

217
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,180
Why are you shuffling through my things?

218
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,600
I was only looking for some water.

219
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,290
I will get some for you. Go back to your room.

220
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,900
W-w-wait, wait...

221
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,670
What is this smell?

222
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,470
Oh, my!

223
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,050
Aigoo, oh, no. I'm sorry. My hand slipped.

224
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,070
Your hand slipped?

225
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,880
- How could this be...
- I'll wash it for you before it sets in.

226
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,950
Hurry up and take it off.

227
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,060
Wait. Wait.

228
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,920
- Hurry up and take it off.
- Wait! Wait a minute!

229
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,900
Wait a minute! What are you doing?

230
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,450
Wait! Wait!

231
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,800
Wait! Wh-what are you doing?

232
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,200
I will wash this clean and give it back to you.

233
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,970
Go back to your room.

234
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,930
- Do not roam around and stay in your room.
- Wait, wait!

235
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,130
Let go of me...

236
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,370
Choon Gae!

237
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,390
Choon Gae! Choon Gae!

238
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,830
- Choon Gae.
- Young Master, what's wrong?

239
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,430
Find another room to rent as soon as possible.

240
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,060
Huh? Why?

241
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,070
I'm petrified that continuing to live in this house would cause serious flaws

242
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,670
in my principles and chastity.

243
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,480
- Huh?
- True...

244
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,600
What kind of woman wouldn't desire a winner from the state exam?

245
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,290
Actually, being a Jangwon would be more than enough.

246
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,860
But look how handsome I am on top of that.

247
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,940
How could she not have desires she should not have?

248
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,230
It's not so odd, after all.

249
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,240
What is he saying...

250
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,120
 Use this!

251
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,050
Did you think you wouldn't get caught if you smuggled liquor from Qing?

252
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,290
You and I both...

253
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,370
are trying to make some money using the prohibition.

254
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,240
You're trying to take everything for yourself...

255
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,600
You'll get hurt if you do that.

256
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,670
Whether I'll get hurt or not...

257
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,460
I'll find out after I take everything myself.

258
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,920
In Hanyang,

259
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,600
there shouldn't be anyone else who makes and sells liquor besides us.

260
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,170
Not even one person.

261
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:27,090
There is not a quiet day in the street markets, thanks to you, Chief Royal Secretary.

262
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,250
The rooster crows the loudest right before the dawn.

263
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,960
A rooster that does not know how to decipher day and night

264
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,510
will get his neck twisted sooner.

265
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,910
I will keep that in mind, Chief State Minister.

266
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,130
How... how arrogant!

267
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,210
What in the world is that Prohibition Bureau supposed to be?

268
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,130
A group of hoodlums is gathered there.

269
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,730
I heard that the Chief Royal Secretary summoned Jangwon* to his home.
(The first-place winner from the state examination)

270
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,700
It cannot be a coincidence that the ranks were switched during the last examination.

271
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,180
An offspring of a lowly mistress, with a foolish country bumpkin,

272
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,220
and now all the hoodlums!

273
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,270
Look at the way this nation is turning out!

274
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:20,260
Is this the reason we caused the coup putting our lives on the line?

275
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,020
What else could we do?

276
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,030
They have the justification on their side.

277
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,230
The justification of saving the harvest crops

278
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,390
and prevent extravagance.

279
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,990
Did you summon me, Your Highness?

280
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,530
So, you're Kim Seok Won, who has been serving as a chief inspector for five years

281
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,600
- at the Office of Inspector General.
- Yes, Your Highness.

282
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,890
You rebuked the Left State Minister for accepting bribes

283
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,500
and is on his blacklist, I hear.

284
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,950
It is because I am the one who is lacking, Your Highness.

285
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,660
I could summon you to work at Crown Prince Sigangwon.*
(An institute in charge of educating the crown prince)

286
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,870
Pardon?

287
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,170

288
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,880
My Lady.

289
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,480
I heard you purchase things like this.

290
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,000
Excuse me.

291
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
Over there. Over there. Go, go.

292
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,040
How can I help you?

293
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,070
- How much?
- Two bottles.

294
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,110
Get me some manbyungcho* over there in the drawers.
(Rhododendron plant)

295
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,350
Over there.

296
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,840
Over there. That way.

297
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,860
Yeah, that way. That way.

298
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,590
- Manbyungcho...
- Manbyungcho...

299
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,760
Thank you.

300
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,320
How much could you bring by next week?

301
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,180
We, newcomers, prepared these offerings for you, seniors.

302
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,390
Please accept this

303
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,800
and generously rid of our newcomer status.

304
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,040
Make him write up a letter of resignation in a month.

305
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,730
Has he not just been assigned?

306
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,680
That's why you should get rid of him from the get-go before he gains any power.

307
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,360
Do you think you could do it?

308
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,780
We do this jar ritual when newcomers join us.

309
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,390
It's a long tradition of the Office of Inspector General.

310
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,150
However, due to the strict prohibition this year,

311
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,300
we will substitute it with omija tea.

312
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,560
Receive it.

313
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,600
Consider your colleague as you drink it and hand it to the next person.

314
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,950
Isn't this...

315
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,010
alcoholic drink?

316
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,080
What?

317
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,250
What are you talking about?

318
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,190
I said it was omija tea.

319
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,580
Didn't I say it was omija tea?

320
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,890
I heard that the newbie from the countryside is not very principled nor knows to save face.

321
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,410
You do not know the difference between alcohol and omija tea?

322
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,490
Hey, wow. He's this bad?

323
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,840
Drink up.

324
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,920
If you refuse to drink it,

325
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,760
you will not be initiated.

326
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,640
 Do not forget this.

327
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,520
 The future of our family depends on you, Young.

328
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:51,190
If I must abandon my moral duty and a sense of shame to rid of newcomer status,

329
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,720
this is my answer, Chief.

330
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,830
 Hang him up high!

331
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,380
Chief, Chief...

332
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,160
Wait, wait a minute...

333
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,960
Chief...

334
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,610
Wait...

335
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:38,120
Come down after you reflect upon your irreverent attitude fully.

336
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,820
Do you understand?

337
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,780
Let's go.

338
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,830
Chief!

339
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,360
Chief! Don't go!

340
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,800
Please, wait, Chief...

341
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,670
Over...

342
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,500
Over there... wh-who are you?

343
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,550
If... if you're a gh-ghost, reveal yourself–

344
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,500
No, no. Get lost!

345
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,960
If you're human, reveal yourself!

346
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,210
Please...

347
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,880
Gosh, please let me live...

348
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,910
What are you doing here?

349
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,200
Maiden?

350
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,870
What is the big deal? You should've just drank it.

351
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,880
Why did you let them do this to you?

352
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,320
'What is the big deal?'

353
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,620
It is a strict prohibition.

354
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,600
Alcohol isn't always bad.

355
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,950
It warms you up in the winter cold.

356
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,140
It comforts you when you're bored during the night.

357
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,430
It helps friends open up to each other.

358
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,060
If the friends drink and open up,

359
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,480
it will lead to a sword fight.

360
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,350
Young tenant, you have no friends, huh?

361
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,860
I just do not quite feel the need. So I have not made friends.

362
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,180
I see.

363
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,860
Aigoo.

364
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,560
Hey... come on... what do you think you're doing?

365
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,170
I'm looking for the knot!

366
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,610
Gosh, they tied you up so tightly.

367
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,370
But...

368
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,240
what were you doing out here at this late hour?

369
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,510
Excuse me?

370
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,110
Oh, well...

371
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,190
Well... um...

372
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,340
Ghost! Ghost, ghost!

373
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,360
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost, ghost, ghost...

374
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,510
A ghost over there...

375
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,910
It's a rabbit.

376
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,130
A rabbit.

377
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,130
A ghost!

378
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
You scared me... don't do that... don't...

379
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,240
Please don't do that...

380
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,800
My goodness!

381
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,930
There is no such a thing as a ghost.

382
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,390
How would you know that?

383
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,100
There are so many people who died unjustly.

384
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,700
If there indeed are ghosts, there is no way my father wouldn't have visited me.

385
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,930
He never even visited me in my dream.

386
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,070
Gosh, let's go down now.

387
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,270
Aigoo.

388
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,020
Untie me completely...

389
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,680
Wait for me. Wait...

390
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,190
Kim Gyun and Park San Jo are assigned to distribute munitions.

391
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,000
Lee Tae Jin and Ha Nak to rites and ceremonies.

392
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,910
Oh Hee Dong and Kim Ik Hyun, who have been initiated, will each

393
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,300
follow Ha Do Cheol and Yoon Shin will go to Sipjagak*.
(A cross-shaped architecture near the palace)

394
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,810
Watch them and learn.

395
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,340
 Yes, sir!

396
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,780
What do I need to do?

397
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,130
You?

398
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,900
Do another initiation and get rid of the newcomer status.

399
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,680
Or...

400
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,520
be sure I do not hear your voice.

401
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,910
During the reign of King Myeongjong,

402
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:14,230
the convention to mock and humiliate newcomers during the initiation has been abolished.

403
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,470
If I report to the Gyeongguk Daejeon about abusing newcomers, you get 60–

404
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,810
I said, do not let me hear your voice!

405
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,630
Please tell me another way to be initiated.

406
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,510
As long as it is not drinking alcohol, I will do anything.

407
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,120
Alcohol?

408
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,080
Then will you crack down on prohibition with police officers?

409
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,890
Crack down on prohibition?

410
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,090
Five alcohol sellers.

411
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,290
If you arrest five alcohol sellers in a month, I will have you initiated.

412
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,070
If you don't,

413
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,590
you'll have to write a resignation letter.

414
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,130
Not someone who distills alcohol...

415
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,100
not someone who drinks it...

416
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,140
Asking him to catch five alcohol sellers means

417
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,890
he has no intention of upgrading his status.

418
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,110
Then...

419
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,460
Then what do we do?

420
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,980
Do we continue to keep him here?

421
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,630
Hold on.

422
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,610
I will straighten this out.

423
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,430
So...

424
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,110
I guess you wouldn't know since you just arrived in Hanyang.

425
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,350
The most difficult people to catch in a crackdown are alcohol sellers.

426
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,920
They sell in utmost secret

427
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,910
and they have hoodlums around them.

428
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,370
They often brandish knives.

429
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,070
Whoa, knives...

430
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,820
I'm not too good with that.

431
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,290
That's why they established Prohibition Bureau.

432
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,170
So, you should...

433
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,300
Use my brain, not a knife, huh?

434
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,540
- You are absolutely right!
- Pardon?

435
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,270
Did you say your name is Officer Hwang? Follow me.

436
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,770
M-m-me?

437
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,720
Wait...

438
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,200
Hey!

439
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,040
Am I the only one going? You guys...

440
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,860
Sir, sir!

441
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,000

(Traveling Merchants]

442
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,110
What is going on?

443
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,230
They're girls.

444
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,340
Girls?

445
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,990
They said they would be back today. Today!

446
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,120
Ignorance brings courage.

447
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,020
They have...

448
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:52,150
no idea their life is in danger.

449
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,180
 Meet me at Supyogyo Bridge at the hour of sheep.* 
(Between 1 p.m. - 3 p.m.)

450
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,780
All right! Take it easy, take it easy!

451
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,230

You want to die!

452
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,810
 Come on! Move!

453
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,140
 What's this?

454
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,360
 Move! Don't block the road!

455
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,830
 Come on!

456
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,650
They say butterflies smell its scent from 10,000 ri away.

457
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,870
It's an accessory called 10,000 ri-scent hairpin.

458
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,350
If you put that in your hair,

459
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,400
it will bring you a respectable husband.

460
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,960
He doesn't have to be respectable.

461
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,270
But he has to be handsome.

462
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,510
Welcome, ladies! We have lots of new items.

463
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,210
- Let us go.
- Yes, My Lady.

464
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,270
- Oh, my!
- Aigoo...

465
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,370
Are you all right?

466
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,260
I'm all right.

467
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,330
- Where did it go?
- Are you all right?

468
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,330
My Lady, have you seen the hairpin you were looking at earlier?

469
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,970
I'm not sure.

470
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,130
Look there. That laundry basket.

471
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,530
What are you hiding inside your basket?

472
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,270
What are you talking about?

473
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,420
My Lady, you saw it, right?

474
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,510
You saw her hiding the hairpin in her basket, right?

475
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,530
I guess she could have...

476
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,490
How dare you try to get out of it after stealing?

477
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,010
Hand over that basket right now!

478
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,240
My gosh!

479
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,030
Hand it over!

480
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,160
Who...

481
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,780
He's my servant.

482
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,320
Park Choon Gae.

483
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,440
This is Officer Hwang.

484
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,830
Why are you introducing me to your servant?

485
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,460
Who do you think knows all the details of nobles' personal lives?

486
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,990
The slaves.

487
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,790
 Whether their master is drinking alcohol or not.

488
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,560
 If the master purchases alcohol, whom does he buy it from?

489
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,480
 It would be quickest to ask the slaves of that household.

490
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,540
Gosh, I said, hand it over to me!

491
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,670
Steal? I did not steal!

492
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,160
What is the matter?

493
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,390
Policeman.

494
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,830
This wench stole a hairpin and is denying it.

495
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,060
I said I didn't! It's a misunderstanding.

496
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,360
- Did you actually see her steal?
- This lady saw her.

497
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,690
No... when did I say I saw her steal it?

498
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,710
I said I guess she could have.

499
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,060
My gosh, you must shake off even her petticoat!

500
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,910
Especially this basket. Please look inside this basket first.

501
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,870
Fine. But I am a noblewoman, after all.

502
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,570
I cannot let just anyone inspect my body.

503
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,670
Please let his lady inspect me.

504
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,290
Then, I will look inside the basket.

505
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,070
It seems there is something you are hiding as well.

506
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,520
What are you talking about?

507
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,390
Geum!

508
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,860
My Lady, what took you so long?

509
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,550
Something came up. Let's hurry.

510
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,150
Are you sure they're coming?

511
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,840
They definitely said they were coming today.

512
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,170
Herbal medicine?

513
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,600
- You mean medicine prescription?
- Yes.

514
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,230
There is a physician who only visits wealthy families.

515
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,280
He writes a prescription at a pretty high price.

516
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,400
And there is a pharmacy that fills that prescription.

517
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,790
Did he say anything else?

518
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,160
What is the content of the prescription?

519
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,180
He said the names of medicinal herbs are written in it.

520
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,410
Manbyungcho, byungkotnamu,

521
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,780
haedongpi...

522
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,490
And what was it...

523
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,660
- Cheung-cheung...
- Cheungcheung doongeulrae?

524
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,370
That's right! That's it! Wow!

525
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,750
Cheungcheung doongeulrae?

526
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,790
 - Get them!
- Stop right there!

527
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,050
My liquor...

528
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,270
Stop right there!

529
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,630
My Lady, it's not going to work.

530
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,480
We must run! Hurry!

531
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,780
- My liquor!
- No!

532
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,250
Hurry! Run!

533
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,500
Let us go now.

534
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,060

535
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,960

536
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,000
Let's see...

537
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,140
No. No, you can't!

538
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,250

539
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,390

540
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,470
Father, you're home for the day.

541
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,830
Guess what I brought for my pretty daughter of mine.

542
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,350
What is it?

543
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,920
Have you not been saying that you want to visit Mount Kumgang?

544
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,720
Mount Kumgang?

545
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,700
Am I going to Mount Kumgang?

546
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,110
Here...

547
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,330
Here. It's Mount Kumgang.

548
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,010
Hang this in your room and look at it to your heart's content.

549
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,690
Does it not truly resemble Mount Kumgang?

550
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,360
Why can't a girl visit Mount Kumgang?

551
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,490
Gosh...

552
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,980
What do I do with this painting?

553
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,420
Darn it!

554
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,880
I believe we both have something we would like to hide.

555
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,160
How about we both ignore what we know?

556
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:00,170

557
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:02,530
Manbyungcho, byungkotnamu,

558
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,420
haedongpi, cheungcheung doongeulrae.

559
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,640
If you take the first letter of each ingredient, it's 'Manbyunghaechoong.'

560
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,720
It's a shoddy code.

561
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,450
If we interrogate the physician who wrote this prescription,

562
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,020
we can find out which household bought alcohol.

563
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:20,460
Whoa, it looks to me like an ordinary prescription.

564
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,980
Nam, I think you were born to be an inspector.

565
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,530
They are truly evil and wicked people.

566
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,770
Despite the strict prohibition, they have no fear yet sell liquor however they want to.

567
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,080
They deserve to die.

568
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,450
People like that should have three generations of their families destroyed.

569
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,320
All three generations should get 100 beatings and be imprisoned for three years!

570
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,910
Geez!

571
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,430
Stop talking and eat!

572
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,770
You're so particular about the differences between women, men, masters, and servants.

573
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,580
Are you not particular about table manners?

574
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,020
Brother, eat plenty.

575
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,790
Sure, sure.

576
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,290
Choon Gae, you, too. Eat a lot.

577
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:10,730
Yes, My Lady.

578
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,910
 I didn't like him from the beginning.

579
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,210
He was annoying, to begin with.

580
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,170
Why didn't you tell me that the young tenant is an inspector?

581
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,210
It's all over for us now.

582
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,090
What are you doing?

583
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,820
Either throw it out or drink it all.

584
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,720
We have to do one or the other.

585
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,760
Gosh, we can get more than 20 nyang for this one jar.

586
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,300
No, My Lady!

587
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,400
- My 20 nyang!
- We're ruined already.

588
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,740
Gosh, my 20 nyang!

589
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,340
Darn it!

590
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,900
Stop, stop, it'll break!

591
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,800
Wait, wait!

592
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,020

593
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,870
What are we doing here again?

594
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,370
What are you doing?

595
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,580
They will not be suspicious of a pharmacy they raided already.

596
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,110
Acupuncturist Oh would not be back any time soon.

597
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,320
So?

598
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,610
Outside of the capital city is vast,

599
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:28,200
yet there aren't as many patrols.

600
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,720
Up to Mapo, Seobingo, Itaewon, and Hangangjin,

601
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,020
there are only one chief officer and nine soldiers. That's all.

602
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,170
And?

603
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,250
We can put our liquor on this cart and sell it.

604
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,500
If they raid an illegal distillery, there is nowhere to go.

605
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,070
With this, we can run with it if there is a crackdown.

606
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,980
Run with it?

607
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,430
So-called...

608
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,280
'Pub on Wheels.'

609
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,130
 We'll be selling in the streets, so we'll sell takju.

610
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,700
 It will cost ten poon per glass.

611
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,210
Cheers.

612
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,290
Not much to it.

613
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,660
My Lady!

614
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,910
Let's go!

615
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,250
 Let's say a policeman appears.

616
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,650
 Quickly shut down and take off.

617
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,510
Aigoo! I'll go this way!

618
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:47,300
That way!

619
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,580
 The escape route is?

620
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,710
 We do not overlap.

621
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,380
 Let's say we hit the dead end.

622
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,810
 We escape up high.

623
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,260
 - Aigoo, hurry!
- Let's go!

624
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,950
Over there... what's that?

625
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,820
It's a goblin fire!

626
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,350
It's a goblin fire! A goblin fire!

627
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,680
Drink a glass of this and reenergize.

628
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,140
 Aigoo, so good!

629
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,050
Prince! Prince! Please stop!

630
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,130
It's dangerous!

631
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,930
I said not to run.

632
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,740
You might fall.

633
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,610
Hyungnim, look at this.

634
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,310

I wrote this for you, Hyungnim.

635
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,930
Hyungnim?

636
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,350
Where are you, Hyungnim?

637
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,520
Hyungnim?

638
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,430

639
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,780
Hyungnim?

640
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,610
Your Highness!

641
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,510
Are you all right?

642
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,800
Did you have a nightmare again?

643
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,970
A drink...

644
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,630
Give me a drink.

645
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,620
Your Highness...

646
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,270
It's okay.

647
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,720
Leave now.

648
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,140
I want to be alone.

649
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,840
I see no one who is drunk.

650
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,110
Let us call it a day.

651
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,950
I guess we'll call it a day here.

652
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,540
Let us head home.

653
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,470
Did you hear the news?

654
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,390
I heard there is something called 'Pub on Wheels' outside the capital city.

655
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:50,080
I heard about it, too! They show up here and there, out of nowhere!

656
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,550
I heard their drinks taste as sweet as honey.

657
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,970
Did you hear that?

658
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,020
- Get in line.
- Here you are.

659
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,010
 Stay in line. Stay still.

660
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,710
- Give me a glass, too.
- Hey!

661
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,650
Who told you you could sell in our area?

662
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,260
I need permission here, too?

663
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,980
Let's go somewhere else.

664
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,150
I can't let you go like that.

665
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,320
Line up, man.

666
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,180
I got here first.

667
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,220
What the hell...

668
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,980
S***!

669
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,240
Why is this jerk laughing after getting hit?

670
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,690
Wow, I finally feel awake.

671
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,470
What the hell is he rambling?

672
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,740
Behind you!

673
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,760
Would it suffice as my payment?

674
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,320
Daebak.

675
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,990
S***!

676
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:57,250
Look!

677
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,010
Look here! Wake up!

678
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,820
Officer Hwang.

679
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,450
I definitely smell alcohol.

680
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,820
Hand me that for a moment.

681
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,000
Sir!

682
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,230
I haven't had takju in a while.

683
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,710
So, are you saying you're not from Hanyang?

684
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,900
Well, I guess you could say it's pretty close...

685
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:05,420
or far if you say so. I'm from Gaeseong up north.

686
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:11,420
If you say 'Lee Chui Joong'* who lives in Gaeseong, everyone will know.
(Sounds like drunk in Korean)

687
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,100
Nice.

688
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,930
It's takju, yet it smells just as good as cheongju.

689
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,100
It's smooth and leaves no aftertaste.

690
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,660
I can tell that you're not a merchant.

691
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,620
Do you mean to come all the way to Hanyang from Gaeseong to drink?

692
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,320
Thanks to that, I got to meet you two.

693
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,050
All right...

694
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,660
Accept one more glass.

695
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,410
A glass per jade bead.

696
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,880
The petals are inviting me to drink now that I have a glass in my hand.

697
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,300
There are flowers, drinks, and even the moon.

698
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,990
I just need friends to share my drinks with.

699
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,400
Here.

700
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,570
Take glass for yourselves.

701
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,320
It's on me.

702
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,660
There.

703
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
It has to be real jade, right?

704
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,000
How much could one bead be worth?

705
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,040
My goodness.

706
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,760
What is wrong? You act as if you've done something wrong.

707
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,210
Do something wrong? What are you talking about?

708
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,110
You must've played with flowers in the middle of the night.

709
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,600
It's spring.

710
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,300
The petals fly and stick to me. What can I do?

711
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,700
Don't stay out too late.

712
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,120
Don't get mixed up in unpleasant incidents.

713
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,040
Look.

714
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,320
- Stop!
- Stop right there!

715
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,460
Stop!

716
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,800
Stop right there!

717
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,430
Aigoo!

718
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:24,710

719
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:31,600

720
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,940
 A traveler!

721
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,940
Stop right there!

722
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,080
Me?

723
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,580

724
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,600
- Arrest him.
- What are you doing?

725
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,790
- What are you thinking?
- Wait!

726
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,310
Oh, boy!

727
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,180
Wow, that was impeccable!

728
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,930

729
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,430
Hey, taking off!

730
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,730
 Let's go!

731
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,520

732
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,900

733
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:09,710

734
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:16,480

735
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,560
Woon Sim, Merchant Sim is here.

736
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,030
The new liquor is here.

737
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,720
Let us open up Giringak.

738
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,390
 Yes, madam.

739
00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,930
Our business will flourish.

740
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,450
The liquor tastes like it is mixed in water.

741
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,210
They will have to drink several bottles to get drunk.

742
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,980
The price is rising, but

743
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,460
the liquor tastes worse.

744
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,730
You just need to get drunk off of it.

745
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,430
Why be picky about its taste?

746
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,500
It sounds to me like you're saying all that a gisaeng* needs to know is how to pour drinks.
(Highly trained and accomplished courtesans)

747
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,960
Still twisting things as always.

748
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,870
Did you hear the news?

749
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,280
Pubs on wheels.

750
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,670
You're talking about that, too?

751
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:32,190
Selling liquor pulling a cart, huh?

752
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,040
How long do you think that will last?

753
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,420
There is always a first time for everyone.

754
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:41,970
I hear the liquor sold on a cart in the market streets is so delicious.

755
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,960
I cannot believe how poor our Giringak drinks taste.

756
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,130
It hurts my ego.

757
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,880
It's nothing.

758
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,510
Leave it here.

759
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:01,270
Don't go around with bloodstains on you.

760
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:11,010
I heard there are people who are running  Pub on Wheels lately.

761
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:17,270
Deputy Inspector, did you know about this?

762
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:20,860

Well, people insist on drinking.

763
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,710
What could I do?

764
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,940
Even if I catch them all, more of them pop up.

765
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:33,840
All the drinks and silver coins I offered to you all this time

766
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,630
is enough to purchase a tile-roofed house.

767
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,850
You must consider my sincerity.

768
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,800

769
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,540

770
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,920
 Let's go!

771
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,480

772
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,640
What?

773
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:05,290
Are you saying Capital Bureau and Police Bureau are cracking down on a grand scale?

774
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,290
That Pub on Wheels or something... because of that?

775
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,300
Yes, including Prohibition Bureau. Across the board.

776
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,610
So, why don't you just call it a day?

777
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:16,600
What are you talking about?

778
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,850
We just need to catch one more to be initiated.

779
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:21,780
- Pardon?
- Get ready.

780
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,410
We must be one step ahead of Prohibition Bureau.

781
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,760

782
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,210
My Lady!

783
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,670
Did you carry all that?

784
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:50,950
Wasn't it heavy?

785
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:53,620
Heavy? It's as light as a feather.

786
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,890
What's that?

787
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:02,770
If we do well, I think I can earn enough to pay off my 100-nyang debt today.

788
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,540
- A celebratory drink in advance.
- Yay!

789
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,720
Here.

790
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,520
If you want to be initiated,

791
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,220
throwing a party is the real deal.

792
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,570
Put two gisaengs on both sides of him

793
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,820
and let them party all night. You'd be initiated right away.

794
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,820
With such an easy method,

795
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:22,660
why are you going about it the hard way?

796
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,530
There's a way to rid of my status fair and square.

797
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,440
Why should I have to use such a shortcut?

798
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,790
Because it's comfortable.

799
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,290
Comfortable as in 'taking it easy.'

800
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,770
My heart does not feel comfortable.

801
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,460
My body is not comfortable, either.

802
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,230
Wait and see.

803
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,770
I will catch the Pub on Wheels for sure tonight

804
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:42,560
and will upgrade my status.

805
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,930
Wow...

806
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,620
What do I do now?

807
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,680
It's unusually quiet tonight.

808
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,480
Is it because the moon is so bright?

809
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,490
Hey.

810
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,550
Give me a glass of drink.

811
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,360
My Lady...

812
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,790
D*** it.

813
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:11,980
Whoa, good, good, good.

814
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,250
I'll count to ten. Run!

815
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,980
- One.
 - One!

816
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,140
- Two.
 - Two!

817
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,930
Catch them. Hurry up and catch them!

818
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,500
 Hey, stop right there!

819
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,220
 Stop right there!

820
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,220
 Stop! Stop right there!

821
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,380
 Stop!

822
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,940
Hey, stop right there!

823
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,150
 Get them!

824
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:39,080
 Get them!

825
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,270
Hey, split! Left and right!

826
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:42,580
Follow me!

827
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,630
 Go in there!

828
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,910
 - Get them!
- Stop!

829
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,520
 - Over here! 
- On the east side.

830
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,610
 Stop!

831
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,820
 Get them!

832
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,880
 Get them!

833
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,150
 - Stop! 
- Inspector Nam!

834
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:15,080
Inspector Nam, wait...

835
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,460
Geez! D*** it!

836
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:20,840
 Over there!

837
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,340
Oh, over there!

838
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,860
You're dead.

839
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:54,690
 Hyungnim!

840
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:58,060
What are you doing? Get him, get him. Hurry! Go!

841
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,120
Stop!

842
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:22,310
I'm an inspector.

843
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:25,110
Don't think about running away.

844
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:02,490
Have we...

845
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:06,300
met somewhere before?

846
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:33,730

847
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:49,520
♫  Even when I'm all right, when a night like tonight is here  ♫

848
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:57,620
♫  I remember the tear you held back  ♫

849
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:02,990
♫  Lean on my embrace, and you can rest now  ♫

850
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:05,850

851
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,130
 Why does an inspector from the Office of Inspector General going out to crack down on prohibition?

852
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,630
 I have to kick him out. How could we live in the same house?

853
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,650
 Please move out as soon as possible.

854
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,840
 Did I do something wrong?

855
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,120
 His appearance makes me feel a little uncomfortable.

856
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,580
 Buddha's Birthday.

857
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,670
 There is no curfew on Buddha's Birthday

858
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:23,000
 and it's the biggest sale day of the year.

859
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,720
 Who knows? I might meet a handsome man who is fated to be my future husband.

860
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,140
 Take a look, Maiden.

861
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,780
 You might recognize the face.

862
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,460
 He's extremely wicked.

863
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,950
 The eyes look so familiar.

864
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:38,750
 Stop right there! I will not let you get away this time!

865
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,340
 What?
