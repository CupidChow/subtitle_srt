1
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,000

2
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,790
You...

3
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,520
Monkey!

4
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,710
Commander Nam!

5
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,440
Commander Nam, are you all right?

6
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,300
How hasty of you.

7
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,050
You almost died!

8
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,370
What happened to Sim Heon?

9
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,310
He fell.

10
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,510
Do you understand what's going on now?

11
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,400
Let's not make things difficult for both of us.

12
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,950
Run away on your own.

13
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,920
Why are you letting me go?

14
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,600
I only focus on my own business.

15
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,820
Search the area and capture his henchmen.

16
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,180
 Yes, sir!

17
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,990

18
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,920
Merchant Sim asked to bring them.

19
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,580
Goodness.

20
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,060
All right. Let us get going.

21
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,540
When we meet Her Ladyship, let her know I played a big role.

22
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,660
Aigoo, don't worry about it.

23
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,400
The Young Master has a very decisive personality.

24
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,620
Really?

25
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,780
Now, you seem like the lady's older brother.

26
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,290
Let us go and capture Sim Heon!

27
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,030
Huh?

28
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,910
We aren't going to the lady?

29
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,000
I am the eldest son in the family.

30
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,230
I cannot leave taking my father's revenge to my younger sister.

31
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,470
I must gather the people.

32
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,030
I will certainly...

33
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,540
slaughter him with my own hands!

34
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,530
What's with you? I can't get used to this.

35
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,270

36
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,930
An interrogation began as soon as the poison was found at her abode.

37
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,930
And the death sentence by poison was carried out at a rapid speed.

38
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,630
I was wondering why no one spoke against it.

39
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,470
The judge was the Chief State Minister.

40
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,010
They said that while Maiden Kang tries to avenge her father,

41
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,230
the poison discovery at Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode cannot resurface.

42
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,730
Did they say for certain that the court lady did this?

43
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,700
Yes.

44
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,150
Your Highness.

45
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,800
Did you find out about Court Lady Park?

46
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,300
Yes. She was originally a palace maid of the Financial Bureau.

47
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,650
Financial Bureau?

48
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,280
Is it common for a palace maid of the Financial Bureau to start working at the King's quarters?

49
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,090
No. It is absolutely rare.

50
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,070
Unless someone put her there.

51
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,630
When did she start working at the Queen's Palace?

52
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,780
That was in the October of the Year of the Monkey.

53
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,210
October of the Year of the Monkey?

54
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,100
Now in less than ten years, she is the servant at the King's quarters.

55
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,160
She must have a remarkable supporter.

56
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,610

57
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,480
Prepare to leave.

58
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,580
I must meet with Uncle.

59
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,470
What do you mean?

60
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,480
Who overheard you?

61
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,050
What I mean is that someone overheard,

62
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,890
but I do not know who it was.

63
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,810
You foolish bastard!

64
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,580
Father.

65
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,380
How come you cannot do anything right?

66
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,050
What were you thinking placing the poison at Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode

67
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,020
and make this big mess?

68
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,010
Do you not remember?

69
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,810
That day, Crown Prince Sunghyun and you were

70
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,330
 arguing savagely over the issue of the private royal army.

71
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,570
 And coincidentally that night, he suddenly passed away.

72
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,800
It was clear everyone was suspecting that you had poisoned him.

73
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,940
Be quiet, you...

74
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,730
No one can know about the matter with Lady Consortship Sukwon Um!

75
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,230
The fate of our whole family is on the line!

76
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,870
Court Lady Park is a trouble that you created.

77
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,590
You will have to cut her out yourself.

78
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,210
Yes, Father.

79
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,240
Have you found

80
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,150
Sim Heon's corpse?

81
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,110
Yes. We collected it and buried it nearby.

82
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,730
Once these matters are taken care of, we shall have alcohol back in the capital.

83
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,960
For now, tell everyone to lay low.

84
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,140
Understood.

85
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,290
What shall we do with Kang Ro Seo and the inspector?

86
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,350
If there is no other choice,

87
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,200
we must end things.

88
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,010
If you have defiled your body voluntarily,

89
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,630
kill yourself!

90
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,400
This man...

91
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,830
raped me.

92
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,190
Who else was here?

93
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,300
His Highness was here a while ago.

94
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,280
Did you not meet himâ€”

95
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,930
Why did you not say so?

96
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,800
He said you already have a guest inside,

97
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,840
so he told me not to disturb you.

98
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,010
Goodbye, Mom.

99
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,490
Mom...

100
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,610
 Doyenne.

101
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,900
 Commander Nam. Hurry and go.

102
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,050
 There will not come another chance to end all this.

103
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,210
 Doyenne.

104
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,990
 Will you regret sending him alone for the rest of your life?

105
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,250
 That you should have followed him then?

106
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,500
 Blaming yourself...

107
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,840
 after you lose what is precious to you

108
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
 is no use.

109
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,140
 Go and protect him.

110
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,420
 You must be next to him.

111
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,080
Mom...

112
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,950
Mom!

113
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
Monkey?

114
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,350
The first letter of Nab Sin* means to repeat, 
 (The character meaning monkey)

115
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,550
but it is also the ninth branch of the Twelve Earthly Branches,

116
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,240
it signifies a monkey.

117
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
Monkey.

118
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,620
He called him Monkey.

119
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,370
Your father was not trying to alert us about Sim Heon,

120
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,390
but about that man in the white attire.

121
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,840
Monkey...

122
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,590
If Father called him that, it means he knew the man.

123
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,790
There has to be someone who knows about him.

124
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,060
What is the matter?

125
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,220
I am anxious.

126
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,570
The scattering of the post could have put that man in a difficult position,

127
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,230
but if he is set on killing everyone who knows about that day,

128
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,360
the person in most danger at the moment

129
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,000
is you, Maiden.

130
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,330
I am scared...

131
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,150
that I might lose you.

132
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,660
That I might not be able to protect you.

133
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,310
I will make sure that does not happen.

134
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,070
So...

135
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,810
do not let go.

136
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,920
I will not let go, either.

137
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,770
I will not let go.

138
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,820
Never.

139
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,300
 Forgive me, Your Majesty.

140
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,030
Now that Sim Heon is dead,

141
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,560
there is no one to ask about that day.

142
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,520
If you mean to make sure the events of that day are true,

143
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,900
there is a witness.

144
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,340
A witness?

145
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,760
It is me.

146
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,160
- What? 
 - That day,

147
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,260
I was at Mangwolsa Temple.

148
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,410
Did you see Ho Yeon dying with your own eyes?

149
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,490
Yes.

150
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,210
I saw Sim Heon killing Guard Kang

151
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,270
with my own two eyes.

152
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,210
But...

153
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,390
the man who took Guard Kang's life, in the end, was not Sim Heon, but someone else.

154
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,660
Seeing as he wore funeral attire for the Crown Prince's mourning period,

155
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,970
he had to have been an official.

156
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,960
Did you see his face?

157
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,880
Forgive me for saying this,

158
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,870
but I did not see his face.

159
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,980
However...

160
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,250
I heard Guard Kang

161
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,090
call him Monkey.

162
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,720
Monkey?

163
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,760
After that day,

164
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,010
Sim Heon gathered people in Hanyang to form a group of government contractors.

165
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,370
The bureau that first issued him a government document

166
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,080
was the Prohibition Bureau.

167
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,040
There is a high chance that

168
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,480
it was someone who was connected to the Prohibition Bureau ten years ago.

169
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,720
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

170
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,770
Continue.

171
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,500
That man will try to kill Guard Kang's daughter.

172
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,300
Although she is a criminal who went against the alcohol ban,

173
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,400
please have mercy on her.

174
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,200
Ho Yeon died because I was incompetent.

175
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,600
How could I not feel sympathy toward his daughter?

176
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,240
But we must find out who killed Ho Yeon

177
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,830
so we can find a way to help his daughter.

178
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,680
Commander Nam, find out who the Monkey is.

179
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,270
But you must be discreet.

180
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

181
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,670
Monkey...

182
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,080
Monkey...

183
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,200
Monkey...

184
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,800
Your Highness.

185
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,390
Chief Royal Secretary is here.

186
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,390
Do not let anyone in.

187
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,600
Your Excellency, it seems His Highness is not feelingâ€”

188
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,680
C-chief...

189
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,410
Chief Royal Secretary!

190
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,290
I did not allow you to enter.

191
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,330
Eunuch Kim, send everyone away.

192
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,110
Do not leave.

193
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,100
You must go back.

194
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,870
I am not feeling well.

195
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,900
Did I not tell you to send everyone away?

196
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,100
U-understood.

197
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,800
I came because I thought you might be curious.

198
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,000
I am not curious.

199
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,340
- Instigating Sim Heonâ€” 
 - I do not want to hear it.

200
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,150
Instigating Sim Heon to get rid of Kang Ro Seo and Commander Nam was alsoâ€”

201
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,170
I said I do not want to hear it.

202
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,600
Killing Ho Yeon was also my doing.

203
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,200
Did you not say he was your close friend?

204
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,230
It could not be helped.

205
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,590
He had found out something he should not have.

206
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,220
Something he should not find out?

207
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,600
I poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun.

208
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,410
What did you...

209
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,140
just say?

210
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,850
It was not Lady Consortship Sukwon Um.

211
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,540
It was me, Your Highness.

212
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,670
No.

213
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,080
That is impossible. That is not possible.

214
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,890
It was to pass on a strong country to Your Highness.

215
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,490
To make sure the officials do not try to seize and control you.

216
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,460
The alcohol ban was for you.

217
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,390
The Prohibition Bureau was formed for you.

218
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
Bringing in the daughter of the Minister of Defense as princess consort was also for you.

219
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,900
All these things were all for you.

220
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,490
For me?

221
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,050
Killing Commander Nam and Maiden Ro Seo

222
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,630
was all for me?

223
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,590
If they reveal all the truth,

224
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,060
the court will discuss deposing you, Your Highness.

225
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,360
Stopping that from happening is also for you.

226
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,080
That is enough!

227
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,800
I have never wanted to become the Crown Prince!

228
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,700
I must immediately report this to Father.

229
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,980
Do you think Royal Consort Gyeongbin

230
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,960
will be safe then?

231
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,580
It was rumored that Royal Consort Gyeongbin had poisoned the Crown Prince.

232
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,930
If you are deposed, will they

233
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,310
let Royal Consort Gyeongbin live?

234
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,700
If you want to see your mother's title stripped and sentenced to death by poison,

235
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,900
go ahead and tell His Majesty.

236
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,400
You do not need to do anything, Your Highness.

237
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,200
I shall get rid of everything that gets in your way, Your Highness.

238
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,260
I will not do anything.

239
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,360
I shall pretend I never heard anything.

240
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,620
Please...

241
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,780
spare their lives.

242
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,280
How can you be so soft-hearted?

243
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,000
You should know that as a King,

244
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,340
you should be prepared to cut off

245
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,100
anyone who gets in the way, even if they may be your own blood.

246
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,680
They are my friends.

247
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,160
For the first time in my life,

248
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,470
I have opened my hearts to them as friends.

249
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,690
I will do anything else you ask of me, Uncle.

250
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,220
So, please...

251
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,570
Please spare their lives.

252
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,500
They will end up endangering Your Highness and Royal Consort Gyeongbin.

253
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,130
We can...

254
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,970
give them what they are looking for.

255
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,700
Make up a false criminal, and let them believe that they avenged her father.

256
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,710
How would you make a false criminal?

257
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,590
A palace maid overheard the Training Commander

258
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,280
talking with the servant of the Queen's Palace.

259
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,330
It was regarding the deposed consort from ten years ago.

260
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,560
It is clear the two planted the poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode,

261
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
so we can make it look like they hired someone to kill Guard Kang.

262
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,460
Is there evidence?

263
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,520
Evidence...

264
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,710
can be forged.

265
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,490
That is right.

266
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,810
Now, you are acting like a King.

267
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:52,991
 I have a way to steal the military power back from them.

268
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:55,491

It is an alcohol ban.

269
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,571
 Alcohol ban?

270
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:59,251
Your Majesty is powerless,

271
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:04,401
so you cannot allow or ban it without justification. However...

272
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,731
there is a justification that the alcohol ban conserves crops.

273
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,701
Your Majesty, use that justification.

274
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,591
Justification...

275
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:15,601
But the alcohol ban will be temporary.

276
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:19,201
How many would indeed follow that law?

277
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:22,951
Only the destitute people will suffer.

278
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:25,701
Hence the alcohol ban.

279
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:29,791
There is justification, but the law will not be followed.

280
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:33,261
There will certainly be those who defy the ban and then

281
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:39,201
that would give new justification to create a group to enforce the law on those people.

282
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:43,121
No one will suspect that the alcohol ban

283
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:47,821
is meant for Your Majesty to create an army.

284
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:53,901
 It will take less than ten years for that small group to become Your Majesty's army.

285
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:57,501
 Your Majesty, Chief Royal Secretary is here to see you.

286
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:59,511
Let him enter.

287
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:16,601
Your Majesty, the criminal who poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun was finally discovered.

288
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:21,111
Court Lady Park disappeared?

289
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:22,531
What do you mean?

290
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:26,901
Well, her house has been emptied out, and she is nowhere to be found.

291
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:29,961
W-what?

292
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,691
Arrest him!

293
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:42,571
Arrest Training Commander Yeon Chae Bong.

294
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,141
Yes, Sir.

295
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:46,481
Let me go. Get your hands off of me.

296
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,431
What is the meaning of this ruckus, Minister of Defense?

297
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:51,661
There is an accusation that the Training Commander conspired with the servant of the Queen's Palace

298
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:56,611
and planted poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode ten years ago.

299
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:57,471
Fatherâ€”

300
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:02,291
You will not be able to leave your residence, either, Chief State Minister.

301
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:08,001
You will have to explain yourself, Training Commander.

302
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:09,581
Take him away.

303
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:11,511
Let me go. Let me go!

304
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,391
Wait...

305
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:16,811
Let me go!

306
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:20,351
- Chief Royal Secretary?
- Yes.

307
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,501
Chief Royal Secretary asked the soldiers to repair the rampart,

308
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:25,041
so they could not be dispatched right away.

309
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:28,101
- Coincidentally on that day?
- Yes.

310
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:32,401
But thankfully, I ran into the Chief Royal Secretary in front of the Ministry of Defense.

311
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,781
He told me that the soldiers of the Prohibition Bureau could help,

312
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,501
so I showed him the insignia.

313
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:39,271
 "Scare the snake by stirring the bushes."

314
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:43,131
 We stirred the bushes, so the snake will soon lift its head.

315
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:45,251
 What are you doing right now?

316
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:52,371
 If you continue to find fault with this matter,

317
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:55,801
 it is no different from turning your back against His Highness and His Majesty.

318
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,471
 Keep that in mind, and do not forget it.

319
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:19,411
 The person who wants to keep Sim Heon from talking the most.

320
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:22,981
Commander Nam!

321
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:25,171
Chief Inspector.

322
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:28,631
The Training Commander has been arrested.

323
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:31,361
What do you mean?

324
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:35,891
Ten years ago, the Training Commander planted poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode.

325
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:40,191
He is accused of murdering Guard Kang to cover it up.

326
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:46,021
The Training Commander was behind Sim Heon?

327
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:47,511
Is that true?

328
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:48,821
It is true.

329
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:53,011
Princess Consort overheard the Training Commander speaking with

330
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,351
the servant of the Queen's Palace.

331
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:56,221
Princess Consort?

332
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:57,411
What about evidence?

333
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,401
Is there evidence?

334
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:04,101
The evidence will be revealed soon.

335
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,761
They killed my brother

336
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:09,021
and brutally murdered the Maiden's father.

337
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,051
Everything will be revealed.

338
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:14,411
So relay that to the Maiden.

339
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:18,111
That there is no need for her to avenger her father anymore.

340
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:36,391
If he knew Father,

341
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:40,421
I could have seen his face.

342
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:43,681
- My Lady! 
 - My Lady.

343
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:47,431
What is going on?

344
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,751
My Lady, it is all over now.

345
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:52,721
The criminal has been captured.

346
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:54,461
The criminal has been captured?

347
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:56,621
Yes. It was the Training Commander.

348
00:28:56,621 --> 00:29:00,461
He killed Crown Prince Sunghyun and blamed it on Lady Consortship Sukwon Um,

349
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:03,261
then did that horrible thing to your father.

350
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:04,881
Is that true?

351
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:09,601
My Lady. It is all over now.

352
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:13,361
Then the Training Commander...

353
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,151
is Monkey?

354
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:23,721
Ten years ago, this criminal

355
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:27,621
commanded servant Park of the Queen's Palace, then palace maid of the Financial Bureau,

356
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:32,321
to plant poison at Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode.

357
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:34,271
Is this true?

358
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:36,961

How could I command...

359
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:39,331
a palace maid that I do not even know?

360
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,941
You poisoned Crown Prince Sunghyun

361
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:43,161
and blamed it on Lady Consortship Sukwon Um,

362
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:48,151
then promoted Park to the palace maid of the private royal quarters for the deed.

363
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:51,921
 Chief Royal Secretary asked the soldiers to repair the rampart,

364
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,931
 so they could not be dispatched right away.

365
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,871
Poisoning the Crown Prince...

366
00:29:57,871 --> 00:30:00,571
What are you talking about?

367
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,981
I have never done such a thing!

368
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,891
Bring her here!

369
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,911
Training Commander.

370
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,731

She asked to deliver this to you.

371
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:30,801
That court lady is the private servant of the Queen's Palace?

372
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,241
Apparently so.

373
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:36,331
It is yet to be seen

374
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:38,551
whether the Queen was involved in this matter.

375
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:44,841
Twist the criminals' legs.

376
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:55,731

377
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:05,701
Prepare the soldiers in secret.

378
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:06,811
Pardon?

379
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:09,321
They are trying to kill us.

380
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:11,701
We cannot sit idle.

381
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:14,051
Are you suggesting a coup?

382
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,411
In any case, Chief Royal Secretary...

383
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:19,221
is already planning to kill us by accusing us of treason.

384
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:22,291
The Training Commander's army has been decreased by half in size.

385
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,691
How could we go up against them?

386
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,321
Then,

387
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,741
should we do nothing

388
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:33,081
and let Lee Shi Heum have our necks?

389
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:35,281
If we do nothing,

390
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:38,401
we will become traitors for certain.

391
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,571
But if we gather soldiers,

392
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:44,071
we have at least half a chance

393
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:47,561
to overturn the circumstances.

394
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,211
Welcome.

395
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,461

I have been waiting for you.

396
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,391
Meet the Maiden? At the palace?

397
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,701
Under these circumstances, I cannot leave the palace.

398
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,771
Maiden is wanted.

399
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,671
There is no way for her to come here safely.

400
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:17,811
Do not worry about that.

401
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,301
I have a way.

402
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:23,401
What way do you mean?

403
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:26,911
 Your Highness, Princess Consort is here.

404
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:29,621
Let her enter.

405
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,951
Your Highness, you called for me...

406
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:41,821
Young Master Nam?

407
00:32:56,171 --> 00:32:58,751
I didn't think I would do this again.

408
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:01,291
This is the first time with me.

409
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,111
Get the pass that Lady Ae Jin gave us.

410
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:10,941
These are things for the wedding

411
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:13,581
and personal items belonging to Princess Consort.

412
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:19,041
Thank you.

413
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:34,921
My Lady.

414
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:38,261
Aigoo.

415
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:39,721
Aigoo.

416
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:44,521
- Careful. 
- There we go.

417
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:49,321
Maiden Han. I mean, Princess Consort.

418
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,781
Oh, never mind the formalities.

419
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:55,521
So why did the Queen want to see you?

420
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,781
I do not know.

421
00:33:57,781 --> 00:33:59,661
You will find out when you get there.

422
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:10,221

423
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:14,681
You can go inside and serve tea to Her Highness.

424
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:16,281
All right.

425
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:42,301
Sit.

426
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:54,401
You must have had a hard time getting here.

427
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:56,201
Lift your head.

428
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:05,431
Do you recognize me?

429
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:08,001
That day...

430
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:11,741
you let me hide in your palanquin.

431
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:13,781
You were the Queen.

432
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:16,461
I told you we would meet again.

433
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:21,041
I told you we would discuss your father when we meet again.

434
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,481

435
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,581
This is...

436
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:41,941

It is Ho Yeon's inspection log.

437
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:44,781
I can finally return it to you.

438
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:49,991
How did Your Highness come in possession of this?

439
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:57,691

440
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:03,941

441
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,331
This is...

442
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,851
Since the Crown Prince's passing until this moment,

443
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:15,481
I have recorded all of my investigations in this book.

444
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:19,391
Please take care of it, Your Highness.

445
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:21,791
This must include the fact

446
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:26,281
that my uncle planted poison in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode.

447
00:36:27,941 --> 00:36:33,111
You will entrust me with the book that records my family's wrongdoing?

448
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:35,001
You judge the right and wrong of matters

449
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:38,961
more highly than the rise and fall of your family.

450
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:45,321
Your Highness has guided Maid Palace Park to confess

451
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:48,491
and we were able to lift the accusations against Lady Consortship Sukwon Um.

452
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:51,151
But if this is revealed now,

453
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:55,381
we will never be able to find out

454
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,651
who murdered Crown Prince Sunghyun.

455
00:36:58,371 --> 00:37:01,361
Before a full account of the incident is revealed,

456
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:04,411
I ask Your Highness to keep it.

457
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:09,971
Should something happen to me,

458
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,511
the only person to continue my task

459
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:16,921
is Your Highness.

460
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:26,951
It seems Guard Kang sensed that danger would befall him

461
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,571
and entrusted that to me.

462
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,541
Do you believe...

463
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:39,121
that my father found the answer?

464
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:43,501
The evidence will be in that book.

465
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,501

466
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,541
Which palace do you work for?

467
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,511
I work for the Queen's Palace.

468
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:41,951
- Were you the only one here? 
 - Yes.

469
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:43,841
I was the only one here.

470
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:09,641
- Your Highness. 
 - What are you doing here?

471
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:12,371
If this is to avenge your father,

472
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:14,581
the criminal has already been captured and is being tortured,

473
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:15,941
so it will be resolved soon.

474
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:17,491
I already know that, butâ€”

475
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:19,671
It will all be resolved if you stay put.

476
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:22,411
Why do you keep putting yourself in danger?

477
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:24,331
This concerns my father.

478
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:27,301
I cannot leave it to others and sit idle.

479
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:43,621
Forgive me.

480
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:49,101
Are you all right?

481
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:52,671
I shall see you off.

482
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:54,321
Let us go.

483
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:05,841
Your Highness.

484
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,521
What were you thinking?

485
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:11,821
Bringing the Maiden into the palace?

486
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:14,901
What if someone saw her?

487
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:20,921
Come with me.

488
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:24,641
There is a way to exit without anyone knowing.

489
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:41,521
Is it here?

490
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:44,261
The way to exit without anyone knowing?

491
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:46,921
Get down.

492
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:50,941
Again?

493
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:52,951
Are you suggesting that I should get down?

494
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:00,311
Get on.

495
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:07,501
Young Tenant, forgive me for stepping on you.

496
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:10,181
I-it's all right.

497
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,181
Am I heavy?

498
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:19,271
N-no, not at all.

499
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:22,521
I'm sorry.

500
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:26,181
Maiden.

501
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:27,311
Yes?

502
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:30,921
Hurry up...

503
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,381
Take care of yourself.

504
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:35,971
Yes, you as well, Your Highness.

505
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,671

506
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,241
What are you investigating?

507
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:03,031
Are you looking for more evidence?

508
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:07,701
I was only searching for the evidence that the Maiden's father left behind.

509
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:10,091
One of them was in the palace.

510
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,791
Nothing is for certain yet.

511
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:15,391
If everything ends well,

512
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:18,071
I shall do something about the charges against the Maiden.

513
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,891
So do not put the Maiden in danger anymore.

514
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,371
You are my friends,

515
00:42:24,131 --> 00:42:26,501
and I speak out of worry for you both.

516
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:32,671
There are three types of friends in this world who are useful when befriended.

517
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:35,581
A friend who is upright,

518
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,181
a friend who is trustworthy,

519
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:39,271
and a friend who is knowledgeable.

520
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:40,321
But...

521
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:45,281
Your Highness is none of these.

522
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:46,331
What?

523
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:51,471
Even still, I consider Your Highness my friend.

524
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:57,231
If I find out anything, I shall let you know first.

525
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:58,821
Then, I shall be going.

526
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:15,851
What are you doing?

527
00:43:15,851 --> 00:43:17,841
You asked me to bring everyone here.

528
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,951
Right, right. Yes.

529
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:24,801
What is going on with you?

530
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,961
You don't want to avenge your father?

531
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:40,721
I am Kang Ro Seo's older brother, Kang Hae Soo!

532
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:41,901
- What? 
 - Kang Hae Soo?

533
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:45,331
If you help me to capture Merchant Sim,

534
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,651
- the reward is 10,000 nyang! 
 - Ten thousand nyang?

535
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:49,091
No.

536
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:52,021
- A hundred thousand nyang. 
 -  A hundred nyang! Aigoo!

537
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:53,471
 A hundred thousand nyang!

538
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,861
Everyone will be rewarded sufficiently.

539
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:58,931
Kang Hae Soo!

540
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:00,901
 Kang Hae Soo!

541
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:02,571
 Kang Hae Soo!

542
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:05,721
Let us head to Hanyang!

543
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:08,721
 Let's go!

544
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,901
-  Let's go!  
 - Wait!

545
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,491
Who are you?

546
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:16,941
Merchant Sim is dead.

547
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:18,771
- What? 
- Merchant Sim is dead?

548
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:21,001
The guards appeared and wiped them out.

549
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:22,761
He's dead?

550
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:24,381
He's dead?

551
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:27,741
- What? 
 - This was all for nothing.

552
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:30,701
- Let's go. 
 - Let's leave.

553
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,431
Wait!

554
00:44:36,201 --> 00:44:40,351
That Sim's distillery is in Inghwado.

555
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:43,481
If we take over that place,

556
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:46,091
we would get more than just ten thousand nyang.

557
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,791
 Distillery? That's more than ten thousand nyang!

558
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,931
What are you talking about?

559
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:52,331
You want to go back there?

560
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:54,981
If you can't avenge your father,

561
00:44:54,981 --> 00:44:58,031
you might as well earn money.

562
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:04,751
 Kang Hae Soo!

563
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:06,811
 Kang Hae Soo!

564
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:08,581
 Kang Hae Soo!

565
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,301
 Kang Hae Soo!

566
00:45:10,301 --> 00:45:12,451
 Kang Hae Soo!

567
00:45:12,451 --> 00:45:14,121
 Kang Hae Soo!

568
00:45:57,551 --> 00:45:59,281
Stop right there.

569
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:01,451
If you do not stop,

570
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:04,031
you will lose your head right here.

571
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,441
The only humiliation of my life

572
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:11,431
is putting that official attire on you and placing you in court.

573
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:15,281
I shall certainly draw blood from you today

574
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:19,611
-  and right my past! 
 - Not only did you poison Crown Prince Sunghyun,

575
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:22,531
but you mean to replace the King once again?

576
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,771
Whom are you accusing of killing Crown Prince Sunghyun?

577
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:35,121
We have found evidence at Court Lady Park's quarters.

578
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:36,131
What is...

579
00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:37,931
"The Crown Prince will not give up on a private army,

580
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:40,851
so if we cannot stop him, we must kill him

581
00:46:40,851 --> 00:46:42,531
to rid of future trouble."

582
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:45,101
It is a letter that you wrote yourself.

583
00:46:47,031 --> 00:46:50,671
This is your imitation of my handwriting.

584
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:55,641
Who will believe this forged evidence?

585
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:03,871
Do you not remember?

586
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:05,661
Twenty-nine years ago,

587
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,971
you taught it to me yourself.

588
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:16,111
 It looked exactly the same as Grand Prince Neungsan's.

589
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:20,851
 Write down what I say.

590
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:28,331
 This is the letter that Grand Prince Neungsan sent to Right State Minister.

591
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:35,651
Even then, no one suspected a thing.

592
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:40,591
This is your handwriting, Your Excellency.

593
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:46,791
Once the tide changes direction,

594
00:47:47,571 --> 00:47:49,951
irrationality becomes reason.

595
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,171
How long do you think you can fool the heavens

596
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,411
with such fleeting foolery?

597
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:07,721
If heaven is not on my side,

598
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:12,481
all I need to do is move the heaven and change the sun.

599
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,641
I have raised a tiger...

600
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,221
and let it into my garden.

601
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:51,551
Is this...

602
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:56,321
the truth?

603
00:48:56,321 --> 00:49:02,661
Finally, we can undo the injustice done against Crown Prince Sunghyun.

604
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:35,501
What will happen to Chief State Minister and the Training Commander?

605
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:39,261
They will be punishable as traitors.

606
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:44,131
Then, are Commander Nam and Maiden Ro Seo safe?

607
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:48,091
It would depend on how Your Highness manages them.

608
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:50,821
Try to reason with them as much as you can.

609
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,801
I do not wish to harm

610
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:58,021
those you hold dear.

611
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:02,881

612
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:32,271

613
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:36,881
 But we must find out who killed Ho Yeon

614
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:40,751
 so we can find a way to help his daughter.

615
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:49,191

616
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:56,681
Goodness.

617
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:00,081
So many of them.

618
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:07,241

619
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:13,751
 Young Tenant!

620
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:21,961
What are you inspecting so thoroughly?

621
00:51:23,591 --> 00:51:25,851
Something feels off.

622
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:27,421
What does?

623
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:31,851
The Maiden usually does not look so put together like this.

624
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:44,691
 I obtained a portion of the poison that was found in Lady Consortship Sukwon Um's abode.

625
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:48,051
 I placed a silver needle in it and checked again in an hour.

626
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:51,191
 The silver had turned black.

627
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,971
 There was no color change from the silver needle in the Crown Prince's body,

628
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:59,161
 thus it is suspected that it was a different kind of poison.

629
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,881
The depiction of her appearance?

630
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:10,131
Of course, I got it from a witness.

631
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:12,781
He must have had some drawing skills.

632
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:14,441
He had already drawn it and brought it in.

633
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:18,231
He had already drawn it and brought it in?

634
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:20,851
Usually, we have a painter sit down

635
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:24,801
and say whether it looks like the person or not and repeat the drawing process.

636
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,541
So it takes a long time.

637
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:30,061
But thankfully, the process moved swiftly.

638
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:35,051
 His Highness vomited green bile,

639
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,301
 so I asked the physicians in the market street,

640
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:38,251
Not that kind of poison...

641
00:52:38,251 --> 00:52:40,011
Do you know of any poison that makes one vomit?

642
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:45,411
 No one knew of a poison that made one vomit bile.

643
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:50,881
 While I was away from the house, someone had left an anonymous letter.

644
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:56,101
 It told me to investigate the goods that Interpreter Jang San Moon brought in from Tsing.

645
00:52:57,781 --> 00:53:00,981
 I visited Interpreter Jang, but

646
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:02,411

a robber had broken in

647
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:05,501
  killing the entire family and burning down the house,

648
00:53:05,521 --> 00:53:08,661
 so there was nothing left to investigate.

649
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,071
Eight kkeut.

650
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,911
I'm nine kkeut!

651
00:53:26,811 --> 00:53:29,161
Aigoo, I feel so sorry for you all.

652
00:53:30,281 --> 00:53:34,871
I heard you are quite the painter.

653
00:53:34,871 --> 00:53:36,931
Pardon? Me?

654
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:38,791
That is a payment in advance.

655
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:42,771
If you can paint me, I shall give you five nyang.

656
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:45,681
What? F-five nyang?

657
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:08,541
I do not think I can give you five nyang for such a poor skill.

658
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:13,401
Pardon? W-wait, you promised to give me five nyang if I paint your face.

659
00:54:16,301 --> 00:54:20,101
Then, I shall give you a choice.

660
00:54:20,101 --> 00:54:23,641
You can be dragged to the Office of Inspector General and walloped for false testimony.

661
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:24,861
P-pardon?

662
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,441
Or...

663
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:32,051
tell me who ordered you to make a report with this drawing

664
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:34,091
and receive your five nyang.

665
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:45,261
 The head courtesan of Giringak visited

666
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:48,361
 and revealed that she had sent the anonymous letter.

667
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:51,361
 She told me why she had sent it to me.

668
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:54,411
 As for what I heard from Mistress Jo,

669
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:58,831
 I shall decipher its validity before recording it here.

670
00:55:00,461 --> 00:55:02,441
 He left this with me

671
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:04,951
and said that if he does not return,

672
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:08,911
I must meet with Mistress Jo of Giringak.

673
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:13,011
But by the time I visited her,

674
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:15,691
her funeral had already taken place.

675
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:19,101
Now I leave this with you.

676
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:21,451
As Guard Kang's daughter,

677
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,881
you will be better off

678
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:27,181
than me stuck in this palace.

679
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:29,011
Mistress Jo...

680
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:55,891
I do not know who it is. I only received the money.

681
00:55:56,951 --> 00:55:58,481
Oh, but his hand...

682
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:02,371
His right hand had six fingers.

683
00:56:13,401 --> 00:56:18,201
Is Chief Royal Secretary in?

684
00:56:38,071 --> 00:56:40,901
Why are you here without contacting me first?

685
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,431
And alone?

686
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:46,521
You are not in a position to roam around recklessly.

687
00:56:46,521 --> 00:56:50,781
I am here to ask you something.

688
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:55,631
You must know how my father died

689
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:59,591
if you saw the open letter.

690
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:03,121
The day before my father died,

691
00:57:04,611 --> 00:57:07,501
a courtesan visited him.

692
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:10,991

693
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:16,161
Was it you who left the anonymous letter?

694
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,231
Yes.

695
00:57:18,231 --> 00:57:21,091
I left it, Sir.

696
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:25,031
Then tell me.

697
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:27,401
You must have a reason for visiting me.

698
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:30,611
That is...

699
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:41,901
That is how he left and returned as a corpse.

700
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:45,981
The courtesan who visited my father that day

701
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:48,641
was Mistress Jo.

702
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:54,721
I found out Mistress Jo had died the same day my father died.

703
00:57:56,221 --> 00:58:00,211
Do you know something about this?

704
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:06,401
Why would you want to know about that?

705
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:08,911
The criminals who killed your father

706
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:13,301
have already been revealed as the Chief State Minister and the Training Commander.

707
00:58:13,301 --> 00:58:15,741
Do you think that as well?

708
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:19,561
That Sim Heon's commander was the Chief State Minister?

709
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:25,841
If you know something, do tell me.

710
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,651
Any detail.

711
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:31,571
- If you remember anythingâ€” 
 - She is alive.

712
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:35,451
What?

713
00:58:37,071 --> 00:58:38,651
Mistress Jo.

714
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:41,641
She is alive.

715
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:20,871
Go down.

716
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:00,781
His Excellency is taking a bath at the moment.

717
01:00:00,781 --> 01:00:03,151
Please wait here.

718
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:04,751
All right.

719
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:40,511
 Judging by the writing,

720
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,161
 the ink is as black as jade and has a tinge of violet,

721
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:45,311
 and even the scent is fresh.

722
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:48,581
 So it is a top-grade ink made of pine trees.

723
01:00:50,011 --> 01:00:51,621
 It is the same scent.

724
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:53,411
 A top-grade ink made of pine trees.

725
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:38,641
Monkey.

726
01:01:55,431 --> 01:02:00,031
Do you know who the Monkey is?

727
01:02:54,801 --> 01:02:57,331
The Monkey! The Monkey will kill me!

728
01:02:57,331 --> 01:02:59,451
He will kill me!

729
01:02:59,451 --> 01:03:00,771
I will die!

730
01:03:00,771 --> 01:03:02,281
I will die. I will die!

731
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:41,631
 The Monkey! The Monkey will kill me!

732
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,781
He will kill us all. Kill us all!

733
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:45,371
We all die!

734
01:03:45,371 --> 01:03:46,851
He will kill us all. He will kill us all.

735
01:03:46,851 --> 01:03:48,601
He will kill us all.

736
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:59,701

737
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:20,121

738
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:22,801
 Did you know all along?

739
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:24,211
 Can you not leave it alone?

740
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:26,671
 Those who did nothing wrong became criminals

741
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:29,381
 and those who did not have to die died!

742
01:04:29,381 --> 01:04:31,431
 You are under arrest.

743
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:32,681
 The Monkey.

744
01:04:32,681 --> 01:04:34,961
 That was you, Chief Royal Secretary?

745
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:39,331
 Your father and I were friends with the same dream.

746
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:41,571
 I have sacrificed myself to do this.

747
01:04:41,571 --> 01:04:43,171
 How about Woon Sim?

748
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:47,381
 Do you know the meaning hidden behind the Nab Sin symbol on Kang Ro Seo's open letter?

749
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:48,941
 What do you mean?

750
01:04:48,941 --> 01:04:50,981
 Nam Young will have to die so the others can live.

751
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:52,771
 So Princess Consortâ€”

752
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:54,011
 How...

753
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:55,871
 How could you do such a thing?

754
01:04:55,871 --> 01:04:57,431
 Execute the criminals.

755
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:59,501
 No!

756
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:01,821
 No!

757
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:04,521
 What will you do now?

758
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:07,111
 Now the real fight begins.
