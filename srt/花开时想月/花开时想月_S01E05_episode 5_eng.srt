1
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,760

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,860
S-save me, My Lady.

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,930
Sav-save me...

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,480
S-save me...

5
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,330
S-save me...

6
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,700
That's right.

7
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,280
That's right. Right...

8
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,820
A little more...

9
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,620
A little more.

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,250
A little more...

11
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,550
Good job.

12
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,200
You can't let go.

13
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,790
Don't let go.

14
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,570
Don't let go.

15
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,070
That's right. Pull...

16
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,640
There. Got it.

17
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,230
Oh, my.

18
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,630
A little more.

19
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,870
No!

20
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,260
Maiden!

21
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,910
My Lady!

22
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,650
Maiden.

23
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,170
Why?

24
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,800
What's that?

25
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,620
We're all dead.

26
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,300
We'll all die now.

27
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,780

28
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,220
I was crazy. I was crazy...

29
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,230
Gosh, I was crazy. So crazy...

30
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,670
Why-why did I...

31
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,480
What in the world are you trying to do?

32
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,150
What are you doing here, Young Tenant?

33
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,650
What?

34
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,530
Why do you keep following me around?

35
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,050
Follow you around?

36
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,560
Whom are you accusing of chasing you around?

37
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,100
 Stop right there!

38
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,000
You said you're not interested in what I'm up to.

39
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,660
You said not to drag you into my overly dramatic life. So why...

40
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,530
Why do you keep following me and ruin everything for me?

41
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,530
What? Ruin everything?

42
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,680
If it weren't for you, I would've paid off my 100-nyang debt.

43
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,580
I had earned most of it.

44
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,290
If I had paid it off, today's incident wouldn't have happened!

45
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,770
You're the one who broke the prohibition and moonshined!

46
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,910
So we're all going to die now! Are you satisfied?

47
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,430
He must be dead.

48
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,440
He won't last much longer anyhow.

49
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,450
It was a little bit, but we definitely fed it to him.

50
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,470
Right, My Lady?

51
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,420
"Fed it?"

52
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,980
What is she saying you fed him?

53
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,500
Destroying Angel mushroom.

54
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,170
Destroying Angel mushroom...

55
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,710
Poisonous?

56
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,100
Are you saying you were trying to poison him?

57
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,380
What else could we do?

58
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,830
If we don't kill him, we'll die!

59
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,910
I didn't put it in.

60
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,980
Yes. What?

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,500
I didn't put Destroying Angel mushroom in the porridge.

62
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,510
My Lady!

63
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,490
What a relief.

64
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:00,300
I guess you still had a tiny bit of human conscience.

65
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,200
What a relief? I don't think so.

66
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,150
That Sang Mok. He knows where we live.

67
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,130
What is going on?

68
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,320
Why go to an inn in the middle of the night?

69
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,000
They said our house column might collapse.

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,910
I guess it became rotten with so much rain last summer.

71
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,070
Rot? Where?

72
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,140
In the back room.

73
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,430
Young Tenant saw it.

74
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,750
Right?

75
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,390
Excuse me? What...

76
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,070
You said the ants gnawed at the column.

77
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,620
- The ants gnawed...
- Huh?

78
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,450
The column that ants gnawed at

79
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,200
may look fine from the outside, but it's just as hollow rice puffs.

80
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,410
Right?

81
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, yes...

82
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,460
What would happen to it when it gets wet and dry repeatedly?

83
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,260
- Crack...
- Crack...

84
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,580
- It would collapse.
- Right? It would crack.

85
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,510
Nam...

86
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,920
Of course. You have quite an eye.

87
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,560
Woon Sim... Woon Sim...

88
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,240
Woon Sim!

89
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,630
 Don't you know what I did for you?

90
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,070
Of course, I do.

91
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,280
When my father sold me, you fed me and dressed me.

92
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,370
You raised me.

93
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,420
I'm doing this for you as well, boss.

94
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,500
 Open the door!

95
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,470
 How dare you! You think you'd be fine after treating me like this?

96
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,010
 Open the door! Open...

97
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,350
Woon Sim!

98
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,800
Woon Sim!

99
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,410
You should come.

100
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,370
That's Gye Sang Mok.

101
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,470
I'll send a message to Merchan Sim.

102
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,930
No, don't.

103
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,980
It's too late in the night.

104
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,870
No need to be fussy.

105
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
Why are you out here?

106
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,960
Because of the sound of the wind.

107
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,210
When it's so windy like this, an arrow would be useless.

108
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,040
An expert archer knows how to read the flow of the wind.

109
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,840
I do not like windy days.

110
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,210
I'm reminded of a bad memory.

111
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,770
Seeing how tumultuous your life is,

112
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,320
I think you have more than a couple of bad memories.

113
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,640
My father passed away.

114
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,870
On a windy day like today.

115
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,920
Father!

116
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,780
Father!

117
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,460
Father!

118
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,230
Father! Father...

119
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,000
I think it started then.

120
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,620
How tumultuous my life became.

121
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,870
Go inside and go to sleep now.

122
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,980
Well, even if Gye Sang Mok is alive,

123
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,170
I do not think anything will happen tonight.

124
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,890
Why do you not report me to the Office of Inspector General?

125
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,590
Running the Pub on Wheels,

126
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,670
moonshining on Buddha's Birthday...

127
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,500
You now know that I had imprisoned Gye Sang Mok.

128
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,670
So why do you not report me?

129
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,070
 Then why have you not reported the incident?

130
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,900
 are you in love with Maiden or something?

131
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,610
That's not it!

132
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,160
What do you mean?

133
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,620
So what I mean is... um...

134
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,240
Well, if...

135
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,290
they find out you were selling liquor...

136
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,740
I'd also be involved in the scandal as your tenant.

137
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,570
The reason I'm keeping my mouth shut is for the sake of my reputation and prestige.

138
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,440
My apologies.

139
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,080
If anything were to happen to me, I'd never mention your name.

140
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,520
So, I'd say that you had no idea even though we lived under the same roof.

141
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,150
I promise to say that it is all my fault.

142
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,910
I really hate ambiguous situations.

143
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,080
I'll definitely have to clarify with whom the responsibility lies.

144
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,520
As far as I know, there is one more person who is also responsible.

145
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,690
As of today,

146
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,420
I will also be serving as a librarian at Crown Prince Sigangwon.

147
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,090
I'm Nam Young.

148
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,100
Your Highness, please bow your head and bow to him twice.

149
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,470
Me?

150
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,940
To him?

151
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,010
Your Highness, please mind your manners toward your teacher.

152
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,520
You dared to humiliate a prince of a nation.

153
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,510
Now, you want to become my teacher?

154
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,100
Leave while I'm speaking to you politely.

155
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,050
Your Highness.

156
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,760
It's all right to postpone our formal introduction.

157
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,890
But I have something to speak to you about in private.

158
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,900
Please ask others to leave us.

159
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,230
I told you to leave.

160
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,090
It is of urgency.

161
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,960
Shut your mouth.

162
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,320
Try speaking one more word.

163
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,580
I will cut off your tongue.

164
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,980
Your Highness!

165
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,840
Please...

166
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,770
tell others to leave us.

167
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,200
What are you doing?

168
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,580
Grab it.

169
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,650
If you do wish to speak with that tongue of yours,

170
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,330
try to touch the edge of my robe with that wooden sword.

171
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,750
The sword is a barbaric weapon. I have not trained with it.

172
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,160
Being an inexperienced bookworm is not something to brag about.

173
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,630
Please do not uselessly brag about your strength. Please hear me out.

174
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,910
I told you I'd cut off your tongue.

175
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,340
Grab it.

176
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,100
You said the edge of your robe...

177
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,650
Try it if you think you could do it.

178
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,370
Then I'll be mindful of my manners as I treat you as a teacher.

179
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,680
Grab it again.

180
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,340
Geez, he'll become a corpse before he becomes a teacher.

181
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,360
You're quite tenacious.

182
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,770
I'm not...

183
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,620
that good...

184
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,140
when it comes to losing.

185
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,320
Eol Dong!

186
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,570
Escort Librarian Nam.

187
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,550
He would like to do the formal introduction next time.

188
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,950
Not yet...

189
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,440
Not yet, please.

190
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,790
Geez, I'm sick and tired of him.

191
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,370
This time, I'll make sure you never stand back up.

192
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,940
I touched it.

193
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,320
The edge of your robe.

194
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,240
Can you see?

195
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,560
Not yet. A bit longer.

196
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,390
Not yet?

197
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,200
It looks like she will turn and face this way soon.

198
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,620
Royal Consort Gyeongbin, I cannot stand it any longer.

199
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,720
Oh, no. A little longer.

200
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,860
- Bear a little longer.
- Royal Consort...

201
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,800
Queen Consort.

202
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,870
- She's turning around.
- Oh, yes!

203
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,350
Aigoo!

204
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,720
They're daylilies.

205
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,960
They say you'll give birth to a son if you keep them close to your waist.

206
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,140
Keep them in the vase

207
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,300
and put them around your waist when you're inside.

208
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,470
Do you believe such folklore, too, Grandfather?

209
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,110
The distinction between a boy and a girl will be determined after 100 days.

210
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,800
You cannot turn back.

211
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,080
Please be diligent in following my instruction.

212
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,300
If a boy were to be born merely by putting flowers around the waist,

213
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,350
I would've been born a boy, not a girl.

214
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,280
You must...

215
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,930
produce a prince.

216
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,240
I will do my best, Grandfather.

217
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,220
Queen Consort's energy is so strong

218
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,620
that I cannot even feel the baby's energy.

219
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,390
If she were to be born as a man,

220
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,400
she has the energy of a mighty general who would've founded a nation.

221
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,010
A general?

222
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,170
No wonder...

223
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,710
She's 20 years younger than me, yet

224
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,700
I wondered why my knees trembled.

225
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,030
So you couldn't see whether she's having a boy or a girl?

226
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,500
It's not important whether she's having a boy or a girl.

227
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,960
Please be careful.

228
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,650
She's not someone you should go up against, Royal Consort Gyeongbin.

229
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,140
Hyungnim!

230
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,800
S***! Seriously!

231
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,570
What did they say?

232
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,770
No one saw him?

233
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,490
No one saw him.

234
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,670
Are you sure there is no such young master in Hanyang?

235
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,250
There was no one like that among unwedded men.

236
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,170
Then...

237
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,060
are you saying he has a wife?

238
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,710
It could be that he does not live in Hanyang.

239
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,990
To search outside of Hanyang,

240
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,560
I would need a lot of this.

241
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,930
Would this suffice?

242
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,980
Is this the painting of Kumgang by Dan Hong?

243
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,720
This valuable painting...

244
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,150
His face is much more valuable than this.

245
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,450
Be sure to find him even if you have to search the entire country.

246
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,630
Do you understand?

247
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,010
What happened? Have you seen my hyungnim?

248
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,980
Geez, you haven't even seen anyone who looks like him?

249
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,130
Procession of the Sungkyunkwan Confucian scholars for an appeal to the king!

250
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,390
 Procession of appeal!

251
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,380
Procession of the Sungkyunkwan Confucian scholars for an appeal to the king!

252
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,750
 Procession of appeal!

253
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,870
Procession of the Sungkyunkwan Confucian scholars for an appeal to the king!

254
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,660
 Procession of appeal!

255
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,760
Procession of the Sungkyunkwan Confucian scholars for an appeal to the king!

256
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,260
 - Procession of appeal! 
- I'll rush.

257
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,070
Maiden!

258
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,730
It's me. From that women's accessory store last time.

259
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm a bit busy right now.

260
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,770
You rushed off last time. I did not even have a chance to ask your name.

261
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,510
I'm Han Ae Jin.

262
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,330
I'm Kang Ro Seo. All right then.

263
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,490
Wait! Why are you in such a rush that you're always running around?

264
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,630
You were running on Buddha's Birthday, too.

265
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,580
Did you see me on Buddha's Birthday?

266
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,670
You were with a handsome man.

267
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,040
Is he your lover?

268
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,400
Listen carefully.

269
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,840
If you go around speaking of what you saw that night,

270
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,370
I will not leave you alone.

271
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:25,250
If the rumor spreads about a young lady of a distinguished family stealing in the market street,

272
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,650
wouldn't it be humiliating?

273
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,070
You were carrying an inappropriate object as well.

274
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,690
In any case,

275
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,210
neither of us has anything to gain by spreading rumors.

276
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,900
I'm saying we should be careful.

277
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,640
Do you understand?

278
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,110
What? Is it a relationship that should be kept secret?

279
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,670
Forbidden love?

280
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,070
 Please abolish the Prohibition Bureau!

281
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,470
Under the guise of prohibition,

282
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:05,450
ruffians of the Prohibition Bureau are continuing to abuse the poor citizens.

283
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,600
Please abolish the Prohibition Bureau!

284
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,040
 Please abolish the Prohibition Bureau!

285
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,090
Please dismiss the treacherous subject, Lee Shi Heum,

286
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,200
who is leading Your Majesty to exercise merciless politics!

287
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,900
 Please dismiss Chief Royal Secretary Lee Shi Heum!

288
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,000
It is said that the heavenly will is revealed through the will of the people.

289
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,730
His Majesty...

290
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,850
also will not be able to ignore public opinion.

291
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,880
 Please abolish the Prohibition Bureau!

292
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,090
 Please dismiss treacherous subject, Lee Shi Heum!

293
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,420
With a situation like this at hand,

294
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,310
how would this tea cool me down!

295
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,880
After they dismiss you from your post,

296
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,700
it's obvious that they will go after Crown Prince next.

297
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,070
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

298
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,010
As long as I am alive,

299
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,780
they will never threaten

300
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,960
the Crown Prince ever again.

301
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,180
 Move it!

302
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,680
Rummage through everything!

303
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,150
Go through everything!

304
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,930

305
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,510
Training Commander.

306
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,230
What brings the Investigation Bureau all the way here?

307
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,750
The soldiers from the Capital Defense Military have been caught moonshining in the street market.

308
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,630
His Majesty has ordered the Investigation Bureau to conduct interrogations.

309
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,310
W-wait...

310
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,570
Take him.

311
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,130
What are you doing?

312
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,270
Everyone, leave.

313
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,210
What do you think you're doing?

314
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,060
What do you mean, Chief State Minister?

315
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,580
Are you saying I plotted to have the Capital Defense Military soldiers moonshine in the street market?

316
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,970
You should ask such a question to the training commander.

317
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,050
There are 5,000 soldiers in the Capital Defense Military.

318
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,380
- You cannot monitor every one of–
- True.

319
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,110
Five thousand soldiers are quite numerous.

320
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,830
The Capital Defense Military soldiers who increased in numbers during the war are not receiving their pay properly.

321
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,390
They are selling liquor for their livelihood.

322
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,070
Reducing the size of the Capital Defense Military

323
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,050
could be a solution.

324
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,620
Crown Prince leaves the palace to drink liquor.

325
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,680
Could you even justify the prohibition?

326
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,720
The prohibition comes from His Majesty.

327
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,490
It is something that His Majesty prohibits, and he could allow it if he wants to.

328
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,900
Are you not the one who put him in that position, Your Excellency?

329
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,430
Try to mobilize the Confucian scholars from all over the country to appeal to the king.

330
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,300
If I make an issue of the loosely managed Capital Defense Military,

331
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,990
how far do you think this issue would go?

332
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,250
I would never leave the court by myself.

333
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,130
Chief Royal Secretary...

334
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,420
You!

335
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,560
Geez, seriously!

336
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,760
What are you doing?

337
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,180
Look who's talking.

338
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,830
You're the one who tainted this precious face.

339
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,350
Geez, so gross.

340
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,050
- Geez!
- Inspector Nam, are you all right?

341
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,560
Yes...

342
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,430
Eol Dong, get new water.

343
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,500
Pardon?

344
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,650
The water is clean.

345
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,020
Then would you like to drink it?

346
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,930
I'll change the water.

347
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,040
All right. Go ahead then.

348
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,950
What you wanted to say to me putting your life on the line.

349
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,170
Woon Sim, what brings you here to the Hyeminseo?

350
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,880
I heard you're good with patients with broken bones and blood vessels.

351
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,970
I have such a patient. Please take a look at him, physician.

352
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,120
Where is the patient?

353
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,380
He is not in the state to bring him in with me.

354
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,610
You'll have to travel, physician.

355
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,500
All right. Give me a moment.

356
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,350
Madam Physician,

357
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,920
how about you accompany us, too?

358
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,570
Me?

359
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,020
My Lady! My Lady!

360
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,650
Geum!

361
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,780
My Lady, there is big trouble!

362
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,910
Big trouble?

363
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,970
The physician says that...

364
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,350
he's past the critical point for now.

365
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,990
Once he wakes up, he'll come to kill us.

366
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,560
First of all, let's tell that inspector.

367
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,010
 If they find out you were selling liquor...

368
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,390
 I'd also be involved in the scandal as your tenant.

369
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,650
No, this concerns me.

370
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,330
It has nothing to do with Young Tenant.

371
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,320
What do we do then?

372
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,070
Should we run away?

373
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,030
My Lady...

374
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,480
Geum.

375
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,370
Take off your clothes.

376
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,530
What?

377
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,020
I said, take off your clothes.

378
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,140
Physician Yoo sent some medicine for the patient.

379
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,010
Tell him what you saw at Buddha's Birthday celebration.

380
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,630
I saw Gye Sang Mok on Buddha's Birthday.

381
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,070
You saw Gye Sang Mok?

382
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,320
Yes.

383
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,740
There was a girl next to him, but I couldn't see her face.

384
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,500
She had a headdress on. She was definitely a female physician.

385
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,490
Female physician?

386
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,690
Merchant Sim!

387
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,110
Merchant Sim!

388
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Merchant Sim! Merchant Sim! It's Giringak!

389
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,860
We heard Hyungnim is at Giringak right now.

390
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,910
Giringak?

391
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,840
If Gye Sang Mok is at Giringak, why would she go there voluntarily?

392
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,070
But how come the two of you are together?

393
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,560
Where is Maiden?

394
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,580
It looks like you're wearing Maiden's dress.

395
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,770
She asked me to exchange our clothes out of the blue.

396
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,330
She took a bundle of medicine and headed to Giringak.

397
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,550
Medicine?

398
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,340
Are you saying she went to save Gye Sang Mok or something?

399
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,360
She went to kill him.

400
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,950
What?

401
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,520
No. To be exact...

402
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,740
she went to die there.

403
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,710
 I'm sorry.

404
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,540
 This is the only way.

405
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,930
 If I don't,

406
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,910
 Geum, my brother,

407
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,580
 and even Young Tenant would be in danger.

408
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,460
 As for this sin,

409
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,590
 I will pay for this in my next life.

410
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,010
Stab him.

411
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,180
There is no way...

412
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,320
she'd be able to escape that place after she kills him.

413
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,070
He's in a deep sleep due to his medicine.

414
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,290
He would not be able to fight back.

415
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,270
It's either you kill or get killed.

416
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,620
Why are you hesitating?

417
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,180
Go on.

418
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,250
It will be too late if you don't rush.

419
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,850
No!

420
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,370
There is a path you should not walk on

421
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,360
and there is an army you should not attack.

422
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,160
Are you planning to go and have a reckless sword fight?

423
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,300
Then will you just leave Maiden like that and let her die?

424
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,030
It is said, "Byung-ja, gue-do-ya."

425
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,220
It is said, "War is about deception."

426
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,050
It is also said, "Gong-gi-moo-bi, chool-gi-bul-eui."

427
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,150
"Attack where they are not prepared, and go forth unexpectedly." So...

428
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,600
we must not let them know that we're deceiving them.

429
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,610
Why did you find out only now that Gye Sang Mok was here!

430
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,960
I'm sorry.

431
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,970
It's here, Merchant Sim.

432
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,890
It hasn't been long since he's been medicated.

433
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,920
Hyungnim...

434
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,610
Are you awake?

435
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,960
You're so reckless.

436
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,670
I had no idea you'd come here alone.

437
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,910
Is it you?

438
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,100
The one who told Gye Sang Mok to kill me?

439
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,590
Kill you?

440
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,970
Me?

441
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,330
What would I gain by killing you, My Lady?

442
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,870
It looks like you have 100-nyang debt.

443
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,100
How come you have that...

444
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,050
You couldn't pay this month's interest, so your debt increased by 20 nyang.

445
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,630
No matter how capable you are, earning ten nyang in a month must be tough.

446
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,140
But your interest increases by 20 nyang every month.

447
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,430
You could never pay off that debt with an ordinary measure.

448
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,860
That was your best chance earlier.

449
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,260
Your last chance to kill the creditor and get rid of that debt.

450
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,920
Now, when Gye Sang Mok wakes up soon, you will

451
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,740
either be sold to a tavern

452
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,780
or be sold as a mistress of a rich man who'd pay off that debt.

453
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,410
You'll probably be sold to a place you do not wish to go.

454
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,200
Is that not right?

455
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,230
However...

456
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,600
I will give you...

457
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,620
one more chance.

458
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,600
You can change your own destiny.

459
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,660
A chance of a lifetime.

460
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,310
What are you saying?

461
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:09,520
At first, I thought two girls were being quite daring.

462
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,320
I thought you'd get caught by either crackdown officers or people who are worse.

463
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,290
But...

464
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,740
you had grander plans.

465
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,110
My Lady.

466
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,980
When ordinary people...

467
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,470
need a huge sum of money suddenly,

468
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,210
they either sell everything they have

469
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,050
or they steal.

470
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,140
But then...

471
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,600
you were different, My Lady.

472
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,360
You had a pretty daring idea like Pub on Wheels

473
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,050
and even grow your business by dealing with me.

474
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,260
On top of that,

475
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,190
you put Gye Sang Mok in that lousy state.

476
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:56,030
Well, although you are quite rash,

477
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,110
I liked it very much.

478
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,550
- That's because–
- How much...

479
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,000
do you think I was sold for?

480
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,900
Twenty nyang.

481
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,090
My father's cost of liquor. Twenty nyang.

482
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,600
But today, this Woon Sim...

483
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,740
cannot be bought with 1,000 nyang or 10,000 nyang.

484
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,410
Sell yourself to me, My Lady.

485
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,780
Are you not curious as well?

486
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,100
How far you're capable of going?

487
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,830
We're executing official duty.

488
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,510
Everyone, cooperate!

489
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,690
While I hold their attention, find the Maiden and leave.

490
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,290
I will look for Gye Sang Mok.

491
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,310
It's an inspection from the Office of Inspector General.

492
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,150
Look into every single room and search!

493
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,440
 Yes, sir!

494
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,930
Who did this to you?

495
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,650
What do they look like?

496
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,590
What are you talking about?

497
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,490
Come to your senses!

498
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,950
Tell me who did this.

499
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,390
Gye Sang Mok!

500
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,080
Merchant Sim, it's an inspection.

501
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,470
Inspection?

502
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,880
Hyungnim!

503
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,790
 Unni, inspection from the Office of Inspector General!

504
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,320
Inspection?

505
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,860
We searched all over Hanyang and could not find any corpses of the hooligans.

506
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,500
I did think you had quite a backing.

507
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,070
But you have a greater connection than I had imagined.

508
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,730
Connection?

509
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,560
What are you talking about?

510
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:42,190
When you're lying, you must hide your emotions, My Lady.

511
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,820
An inspector from the Office of Inspector General and a moonshiner are on the same side.

512
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,550
It would be a shocking and immoral case.

513
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,780
Hyungnim! Aigoo!

514
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,120
You!

515
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,150
What is going on here?

516
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,080
We don't know, either.

517
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,000
Ouch! S***!

518
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,580
It hurts!

519
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,300
Hyungnim, your arms and legs are all broken.

520
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,780
Are you okay, Hyungnim?

521
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,470
What?

522
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,970
Why would my perfectly fine arms and legs be broken?

523
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,040
I remember meeting up with Chulbangyi and One-eye at the three-way street.

524
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,690
If I'm in this state, those punks must be crossing the Sanzu River.*
(Mythological river at the edge of living and the dead)

525
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,780
What?

526
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,510
We took Seogang, right?

527
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,720
Hyungnim.

528
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,540
What? Did we lose it?

529
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,730
I mean, that happened a long time ago.

530
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,020
What are you talking about?

531
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,810
Inspector? What is an inspector doing here?

532
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,830
Well, is there a problem?

533
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,080
Inspector Nam, we found storage.

534
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,080
What are you doing!

535
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,610
 What are you doing!

536
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,310
That was rude of me.

537
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,140
I'm sorry.

538
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,610
Are you going to open up all the rooms in here?

539
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,240
Do you expect me to call her by the name so that everyone can hear it?

540
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,040
That is nonsense.

541
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,570
How can we inspect Giringak without reporting to the higher-ups?

542
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,500
The atmosphere at the Office of Inspector General is unsettled thanks to your appeal to the king.

543
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,090
If we do this, we'll all lose our necks over this.

544
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,750
As for your necks,

545
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,810
- I will protect them.
- What?

546
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,040
Isn't this the slacker from last time?

547
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,200
How will you protect my job, Young Master?

548
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,560
If you find out who my father is,

549
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,150
you'll be completely shocked.

550
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,540
Give me a break.

551
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,630
I know all the faces of the sons of distinguished excellencies.

552
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,900
How dare you bulls*** me?

553
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,050
Officer Hwang, carefully choose your words.

554
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,640
If you're going to s*** around like that, show me your identity tag!

555
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,210
- Officer Hwang, mind your manners.
- What?

556
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,680
I said, show me your identity tag. Please!

557
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,230
Why? Are you scared?

558
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,310
If you're scared, then just croak.

559
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,840
- He's the Crown Prince.
- Crown or clown.

560
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,820
I won't deal with him unless he shows his identity tag.

561
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,560
Wh-what?

562
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,610
Say what?

563
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,850
- Crown.
- Crown?

564
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,210
- Crown Prince?
- Yeah.

565
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,780
Crown Prince!

566
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,520
Cr-cr-crown Prince!

567
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,740
If you found out who my father is,

568
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,000
I told you you'd be shocked.

569
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,440
I deserve to die, Your Highness!

570
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,750
If you cooperate with us,

571
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:06,030
Crown Prince will not make an issue of your wicked monstrosity any further.

572
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,440
Is that not right?

573
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,840
What are you doing? Follow me.

574
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,690
Ah, ye-yes. We're coming.

575
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,280
It's here, sir.

576
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,010
Here is the key.

577
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,700
I'm the overseer of Giringak, Woon Sim.

578
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,440
I'll open it for you.

579
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,650
Prohibition is very strict.

580
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,200
Giringak is no different.

581
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,140
Oh, right.

582
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,190
I saw a female physician confused and lost on my way over.

583
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,340
Isn't that strange?

584
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,550
Pardon me.

585
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,980
 She had a headdress on. She was definitely a female physician.

586
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,700
Oh, my gosh!

587
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,540
Who...

588
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,810
are you?

589
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,030
I asked who you were.

590
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,460
I'm not worthy of your attention, Inspector sir.

591
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,310
I run a small inn in Seogang.

592
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,620
A traveling merchants' inn...

593
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,030
So, what brings you here to the gibang?

594
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,770
I came to take a few gisaengs with me.

595
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,160
But I guess today is not the day.

596
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,890
I'll come back next time.

597
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,640
What is...

598
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,540
your name?

599
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,290
I'm Sim Heon.

600
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,170
If you ever stop by my inn, I will be sure to take good care of you.

601
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,110
♫  I say, who you are, who you are  ♫

602
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:16,930
♫  The question that fills my heart  ♫

603
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:23,950
♫  You came to me after so many days have passed  ♫

604
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:32,070
♫  My meaningless day is being filled with you  ♫

605
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,070
It looks like the search for the treasure is over.

606
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,450
Let's go now.

607
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,480
Pardon?

608
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,820
Yes, yes.

609
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,380
What in the world are you thinking?

610
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,120
At this rate, going after the danger is habitual for you.

611
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,300
What if you got caught by someone else? What then?

612
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,420
Well, um...

613
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,790
In any case, are you all right?

614
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,670
 An inspector from the Office of Inspector General and a moonshiner are on the same side.

615
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,530
 It would be a shocking and immoral case.

616
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,150
Why did you come here?

617
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,710
Why did I come here?

618
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,190
Why do you think I came here?

619
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,430
Because you're so hopeless and reckless...

620
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,480
Why would you go there...

621
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,830
Never mind. Let's just stop it.

622
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,660
Wait, what happened to your face?

623
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,320
Did someone beat you?

624
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,950
My gosh...

625
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,360
Goodness...

626
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,340
- Maiden!
- Jade Lad!

627
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,140
You're all right.

628
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,300
Are you injured at all?

629
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,220
Why do you grab a noble lady's hand without her permission?

630
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,660
You were holding her for a long time.

631
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,800
That was unavoidable!

632
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,600
My gosh.

633
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,930
What is up with both of you?

634
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,160
How did you bring someone who lives in Gaeseong?

635
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,470
Jade Lad, why are you dressed like that?

636
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,750
By chance, are you pretending to be an inspector?

637
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,910
He told me to do it.

638
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:39,400
My goodness. You refused to wear an officer's uniform. You found it and put that on.

639
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,020
How...

640
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,290
How could you be so thoughtless?

641
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,680
One of you should've stopped the other.

642
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,570
How could you two behave the same way?

643
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,520
Wait a minute. We're the same?

644
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,990
That is harsh.

645
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,270
Why are you offended?

646
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,320
Then should I be elated?

647
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,710
I don't feel good about it, either.

648
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,350
Maiden, where are you going?

649
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:04,050
Maiden, take back what you said about us being the same.

650
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,690
Come on!

651
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,100
Seriously.

652
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:11,610
Minister of Defense, I'm saying I'll be a matchmaker for your family.

653
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,660
Pardon?

654
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,740
Matchmaking?

655
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,500
Now that the marriage arrangement has been called off with His Excellency Jo's son,

656
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,870
you should look for a new son-in-law candidate.

657
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,550
My goodness.

658
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,730
That is true.

659
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:32,590
But my daughter is still so immature

660
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,610
and she tends to care for appearance.

661
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,570
There is a perfect person then.

662
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:39,530
Pardon?

663
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:44,170
He is good enough looking that he won't be overlooked compared to others.

664
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,270
And he passed the state exam at a young age and is already moving up.

665
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,120
He is also favored by His Majesty.

666
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,300
His patriotism for the country is also highly valuable.

667
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,800
He is a rare find of a man in recent times.

668
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,390
Who...

669
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,110
I can't believe we're grilling such valuable beef.

670
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,740
How extravagant...

671
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,600
Geez, the government is always saying not to eat cows.

672
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,610
You do everything they tell you not to do.

673
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,190
Be quiet!

674
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,560
You should not say such an unappetizing thing in front of food.

675
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,300
- Say ah.
- I don't want to.

676
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,980
 An inspector from the Office of Inspector General and a moonshiner are on the same side.

677
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:57,400
 It would be a shocking and immoral case.

678
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,470
So, Nam...

679
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,010
The column near the back room that the ants gnawed at looks perfectly fine.

680
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,110
What in the world?

681
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,010
Oh, I'm sorry...

682
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:13,680
Yes, well... um...

683
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,010
Have some, Maiden.

684
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,350
Maiden!

685
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:29,290
Pardon?

686
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,890
The meat is burning.

687
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,570
Oh, okay.

688
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:38,390
Gosh, such valuable meat. It's all burned.

689
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,610
What are you thinking so deeply?

690
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,060
It is nothing.

691
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,590
All right. Try this.

692
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,940
Mushrooms go perfectly with beef!

693
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,890
Oh, where did you get the mushrooms?

694
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,010
It was in the kitchen.

695
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,360
I had such a hard time getting it since it was stuck in a corner.

696
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,190
I should just eat it raw...

697
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,040
Hey!

698
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,820
Ro Seo, why are you doing that to the mushroom?

699
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,230
Whoa, gosh!

700
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:24,070
I hate mushrooms!

701
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,160
Right, My Lady?

702
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,850
Yeah, well...

703
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:28,680
This isn't fit for the meat.

704
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,910
It's not!

705
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:43,490
Aigoo, look at this...

706
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:45,240
Gosh, I can't believe it's raining!

707
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,660
What do we do now?

708
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,050
Geez...

709
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,270
- Let's move.
- Yes.

710
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:51,390
Let's move!

711
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,990
Take this. This...

712
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,900
Move this.

713
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,190
Hot!

714
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,300
Hot! This...

715
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,870
What do I do...

716
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,450
My gosh. It's hot!

717
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,200
Whoa...

718
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,760
Aigoo...

719
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,420
My goodness!

720
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:17,910
I'll give you 20 nyang for one mal of liquor.

721
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,220
It will be 200 nyang for 10 mal.

722
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,590
It will be 1,000 nyang for 50 mal.

723
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,400
It doesn't matter whether it's cheongju or soju.

724
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,890
But it has to be best tasting.

725
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:38,940
You know all about making a profit. You wouldn't be getting into a losing business.

726
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,250
What are you trying to gain by doing this?

727
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,050
The same as you, My Lady.

728
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,210
Freedom.

729
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:57,270
It's worth risking danger.

730
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,500
I will accept your offer.

731
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,210

732
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:45,680

733
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:09,530
♫  With the sparkling stars far away  ♫

734
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,720

735
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,490
 Congratulations, My Lady.

736
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,020
 We received a marriage proposal from the Minister of Defense.

737
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,240
 I think we may be in the way.

738
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,450
 Let us go.

739
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,270
 After reading your appeal to the king,

740
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,880
 I realized how gutsy you are, Inspector Nam.

741
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,260
 You plotted treason?

742
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,060
 Get ready.

743
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,530
 We'll start out early tomorrow morning.

744
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,710
 I'm making an example of you.

745
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,820
 What happens if anyone covets Hanyang.

746
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,340
 Maiden.

747
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,360
 I came to say to take care.

748
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,610
 Do not meddle in someone else's life!

749
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,600
 Leave when I'm being nice.

750
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,580
 You have a nice life.

751
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,460
 I hope...

752
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,130
 you value yourself more.
