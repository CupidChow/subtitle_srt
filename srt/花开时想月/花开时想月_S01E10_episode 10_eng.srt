1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,680

2
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,100
Can't believe the Crown Prince appears out of nowhere.

3
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,210
Will this not be a problem?

4
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,720
The Crown Prince appears between an alcohol smuggler and an inspector.

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,340
With this turn of events, we will have to find their base and take care of them covertly.

6
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,650
By base, you mean...

7
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,650
There was more than one cart that passed through the capital gate.

8
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,730
If there is a seller, there has to be a buyer.

9
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,830
Search the capital thoroughly and find those who bought alcohol.

10
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,050
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,550
It is the order of the Chief Royal Secretary.

12
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,020
Go ahead.

13
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,800
Bring her into the palace? Not that girl.

14
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,860
Why can't I bring her?

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,870
She is the daughter of Kang Ho Yeon, Hyungnim's guard.

16
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,260
You said you were close to him.

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,900
Once they find out Your Highness brought that girl into the palace,

18
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,750
she will be in danger as well as you.

19
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,850
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,370
Whom are you saying should not find out?

21
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,340
Who else could it be?

22
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,810
Do you mean Chief State Minister

23
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,870
was involved with the death of the maiden's father?

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,450
Do not try to dig deeper.

25
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,120
Your Highness does not have the power

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,400
to protect yourself or that girl.

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
For now, stay put.

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,170
After I take care of everything,

29
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,200
I shall find a way for you to keep

30
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,580
that girl by your side.

31
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,260
No one saw you.

32
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,600
Father is quite angry, however.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,390
But do not worry about it.

34
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,620
If anything happens, I shall let you know right away.

35
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,760
Thank you, Maiden Han.

36
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,010
Gosh.

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,380
Well, there are some reasons for me not to like you...

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,810
but you are helping me by not getting caught.

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,240
Are you feeling better?

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,070
Goodness, I'm fine.

41
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,120
I only bled a little. Otherwise, I'm—

42
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,190
You aren't fine!

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,590
Aigoo, you are safe and well, Geum.

44
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,120
That's the only thing that matters to me.

45
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,020
Thank you, Maiden Han.

46
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,050
All the women I got to know in Hanyang are lawbreakers.

47
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,080
But you wouldn't take them all to the Office of Inspector General, would you?

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Knowing the truth and hiding the criminal is also a crime.

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,350
Pardon?

50
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,960
It means we are accomplices.

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,640
I see...

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,140
What can we do?

53
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,960
She's so pretty. I cannot find fault with her.

54
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,010
- What should we do?
- So...

55
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,820
what happened with you and Young Master Nam?

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,900
It isn't like that!

57
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,530
"Like that?"

58
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,800
What is "that"?

59
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,540
I only asked how you got caught.

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,120
Oh, I...

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,550
Well...

62
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,340
My Lady, you do not seem well.

63
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,100
- Are you unwell?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,600
No.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,940
No.

66
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,390
Your pulse is so fast.

67
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,350
Five pulses are normal in a single breath,

68
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,850
but right now, it's six...

69
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,890
No, seven.

70
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,420
You're breathing fast, and your face is flushed.

71
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,900
It must be because of what happened yesterday.

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,650
That horrid man did that horrid thing.

73
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,260
Maiden, take a deep breath.

74
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,090
Goodness, no! That's not it.

75
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,270
Well... It's just that it is hot.

76
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,890
Goodness, so hot in here.

77
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,400
Maiden Han, I must speak with you.

78
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,210
My Lady.

79
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,960
Why are you in a daze? Did something happen?

80
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,790
- Young Master! 
 - No, no.

81
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,290
No...

82
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,140
Yes, Choon Gae, escort Lady Han to her home.

83
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,810
This way, My Lady.

84
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,300
Maiden. I will be going now.

85
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,620
Maiden.

86
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,400
I was not thinking properly yesterday.

87
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,260
Suddenly finding out Jade Lad is the Crown Prince...

88
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,150
I was not in the right mind, and too many things were happening.

89
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,780
So, there is no need to explain anything to me or ask me to be understanding.

90
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,330
I know well that you are to marry Maiden Han.

91
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,850
Let us pretend it never happened.

92
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,020
I do not concern myself anyway.

93
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,270
But I do.

94
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,090
That is enough.

95
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,840
Right now, our priority is to catch that man.

96
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,570
You and I can both be safe once he is caught.

97
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,210
And after that...

98
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,920
And after that, let us discuss

99
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,730
the other matters then.

100
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,130
Go back inside.

101
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,410
I am here to ask you something.

102
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,790
I am glad you are safe.

103
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,030
I was worried.

104
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,270
What is your true intention?

105
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,780
True intention?

106
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,600
Are you not close with Merchant Sim?

107
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,930
So you met him.

108
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,500
I already told you.

109
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,470
You will get to meet him eventually while in this business.

110
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,340
What is your relationship with him?

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,660
We used to be in love when we were younger.

112
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,470
But now, we are only a courtesan and an owner of an inn.

113
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,830
We are even less than that.

114
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,610
I am asking what you intended to do by dragging me into this.

115
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,270
What do you intend to do?

116
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,060
I will catch him.

117
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,970
Before that man can hurt the people I care about,

118
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,450
I will get him first.

119
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,910
How?

120
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,770
With guns?

121
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,040
There are multiple patrolmen at Merchant Sim's inn.

122
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,990
A single misfired gun

123
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,000
means they can kill two of you.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,250
I guess you do not care about

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,990
losing another son.

126
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,810
- Shut that— 
 - You will have to find another way.

127
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,460
A way to cut off his limbs

128
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,860
and make sure he cannot do a thing.

129
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,060
Is that girl safe?

130
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,700
Yes, Chief Royal Secretary.

131
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,520
As far as involving His Highness in such a dangerous incident,

132
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,880
I should hold you responsible.

133
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,580
But I will not.

134
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,670
- Forgive me. 
 - Instead,

135
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,070
last night's events did not happen.

136
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,240
The fact that His Highness ran out to save a woman outside the palace

137
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,750
cannot be found out by the rumor-hungry vultures.

138
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,280
Do you understand?

139
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,000
I understand.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,350
So...

141
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,100
what is your business with that man from last night

142
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,840
that you got yourself into such a dangerous matter?

143
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,460
On the outside, he is merely an owner of an ordinary inn,

144
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,470
but in truth, he is a heinous man

145
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,150
who runs a distillery and kills for his own benefit.

146
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,250
Please allow me to report this to His Majesty and reveal the truth.

147
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,050
Did you find evidence?

148
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,290
Not yet.

149
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,720
Find evidence.

150
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,320
Once you do, I shall submit a report to His Majesty.

151
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,070

152
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,740
Merchant Sim or Sim What...

153
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,020
When is he going to show up?

154
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,560
Daughter of the Southern Mountain Tiger?

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,210
- That wench? 
 - Yes, sir.

156
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,220
Kang Ro Seo is Kang Ho Yeon's daughter.

157
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,390
She lives alone with her brother.

158
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,070
Their house seemed to have been empty for a few days.

159
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,780
And the ones who bought her alcohol?

160
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,920
We are still searching.

161
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,350
You know the protection fees are due on the 15th of this month, correct?

162
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,470
Make preparations.

163
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,980
I cannot even sell anything. What protection fee?

164
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,280
At least, give me some alcohol before demanding me to pay taxes.

165
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,850
Aigoo!

166
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,240
Do you want me to report you?

167
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,980
Should I report you to the Prohibition Bureau?

168
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,590
The alcohol is coming soon. Just prepare the protection fee.

169
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,990
The inn has impenetrable defenses.

170
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,910
There are multiple thugs guarding the place.

171
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,930
They check the identity of all the merchants who enter.

172
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,930
Give up on killing Merchant Sim.

173
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,800
It will only put you in more danger.

174
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,400
If we find evidence first, we can submit a report to His Majesty.

175
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,020
So finding evidence is our priority.

176
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,030
Evidence?

177
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,540
Evidence would be piled up inside the inn.

178
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,860
The problem is that even if we find evidence,

179
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,360
they will highly likely escape again by buying out an official.

180
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,260
It's difficult to kill him.

181
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,560
And it's difficult to get him even if we find evidence.

182
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,720
What are you suggesting we do?

183
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,770

The amount of money to pay off

184
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,490
 the Prohibition Bureau every month must be thousands of nyang.

185
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,510
 We can make up for it once we get paid the protection fee from the distillery.

186
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,750
It is money in the end.

187
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,790
I heard they would earn tens of thousands of nyang on the 15th.

188
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,170
They buy out officials by paying them thousands of nyang

189
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,670
and they pay the Prohibition Bureau as well.

190
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,410
So they are avoiding the crackdown by buying out Prohibition Bureau workers.

191
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,030
What?

192
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,560
Does that mean we can't catch him after all?

193
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,740
It means we must find both of them.

194
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,040
The evidence and the money.

195
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,270
Blocking their escape plan.

196
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,620
How do we know what their escape plan is?

197
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,950
We must follow them.

198
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,820
We must follow where the money comes from and to where.

199
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,140
- Gye Ssang Mok. 
 - Yes?

200
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,660
Tell me what you meant to speak to me about last time.

201
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,630
About the owners of the distillery.

202
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,400
It's not Ssang Mok.

203
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,000
It's Sang Mok, My Lady.

204
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,290
Speak up!

205
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,590

Why is Gye Sang Mok not showing himself?

206
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,500
Where did he run off to after receiving payments upfront?

207
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,640
- We are looking for him, too.
- Yes...

208
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,650
That person who got caught smuggling alcohol into the capital with a fake military seal.

209
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,210
- Was that Gye Sang Mok by any chance?
- No...

210
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,990
That couldn't be.

211
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,640
What's that supposed to mean?

212
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,700
Give us the alcohol or give us back our money!

213
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,690
Shut your mouths!

214
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,470
Calm down.

215
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,850
Master Gye is back.

216
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,530
Oh, no.

217
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,930
- What is it? 
 - Unni, Merchant Sim is...

218
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,150
That's enough.

219
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,260
You already checked and saw that they weren't here.

220
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,990
This is obstruction of business.

221
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,700
Get out, all of you.

222
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,400
Open it.

223
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,420
You want to go in there?

224
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,260
What did I tell you?

225
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,860
They are not here.

226
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,590
He's here to kill me.

227
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,310
He's going to kill me...

228
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,380
Away!

229
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,780
Go away!

230
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,690
Out!

231
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,980
Get out!

232
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,470
Get out!

233
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,550
Are you happy seeing the person who went mad because of you?

234
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,890
You mean, she is alive because of me.

235
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,210
You're afraid, are you not?

236
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,310
You're afraid he might abandon you.

237
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,030
I would abandon you if I were him.

238
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,440
A hunting dog that fails to hunt is of no use.

239
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,730

Can you not do anything yourself?

240
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,770

Stop complaining and hurry up.

241
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,670
I owe you 50 mal of alcohol.

242
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,580
I shall repay you double.

243
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,280
I shall be waiting...

244
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,990
in anticipation.

245
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,330
All right.

246
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,020
This is expensive and valuable alcohol.

247
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,420
Don't spill any.

248
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,940
Once you have a sip of this, you won't be able to drink any other alcohol.

249
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,390
How could we go back to drinking other alcohol after this?

250
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,290
So I was thinking...

251
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,610
how about we switch out the dealer now?

252
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,780
Switch out?

253
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,170
They demand higher pay for the alcohol.

254
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,800
And they rip off so much in protection fees.

255
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
They don't even provide alcohol on time.

256
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,220
If we...

257
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,830
put our strengths together...

258
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,780
If we work together,

259
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,240
we can call the shots as buyers.

260
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,220
But if we do not pay the protection fee,

261
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,520
they will drag the Prohibition Bureau here and clamp down on us.

262
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,660
S***. Did I tell you not to pay the protection fee?

263
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,550
Give them all the protection fees they ask for. All of it!

264
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,110
I will...

265
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,460
make sure you get them back.

266
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,660

267
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,550

268
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,200
We are here to remove a slave status.

269
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,030

270
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,530
This is proof that you are no longer a maidservant owned by the government.

271
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,460
I promised you that I would remove your slave status when we first began working together.

272
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,680
I wanted to do this for you first thing.

273
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,980

274
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,610
My Lady...

275
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,430
I am sorry for everything.

276
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,450
I made you go through things that you did not have to experience.

277
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,770
Why is that your fault?

278
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,470
It was all because of those horrid people.

279
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,300
Now, you can go anywhere, Geum.

280
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,010
Whether you stay here or start a new life at a new place.

281
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,850
You are free to choose.

282
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,510
How could I go anywhere without you?

283
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,200
You could suffer worse things because of me.

284
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,460
Have you forgotten?

285
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,750
We promised to split everything evenly.

286
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,280
Half the money, half the suffering.

287
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,710
So...

288
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,970
I'm not leaving.

289
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,490
I'm going to stay with you, My Lady.

290
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,450
Geum.

291
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,380
My Lady.

292
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,100
How peaceful it is without Inspector Nam.

293
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,490
Certainly. So peaceful, leisurely, and boring—

294
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,360
No, no, no! I'm not bored!

295
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,560
- Take back your words. 
 - I take it back. Take it back!

296
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,080
- Rub it into the ground with your foot.
- Yes.

297
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,210
What are you doing not stopping him?

298
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,310
Inspector Nam.

299
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,310
You are under probation.

300
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,190
This is the main hall.

301
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,440
The Inspector General is here.

302
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,040
All right.

303
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,720
Now, go back.

304
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,870
What are you doing? Stop him!

305
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,000
Inspector Nam—

306
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,210
Stop him!

307
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,820
Inspector Nam! Let us leave.

308
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,550
Forgive us, Your Excellency Inspector General.

309
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,150
It is you again. Take him out.

310
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,410
Come on! Seriously!

311
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,580
Seven years ago,

312
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,660
you were the fifth rank official in the Ministry of Finance.

313
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,660
What are you talking about out of the blue?

314
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,510
Seven years ago was when the walls of Southern Mountain were being repaired.

315
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,940
At the time, you recruited all 300 repairmen

316
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,840
from Merchant Sim's workforce.

317
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,430
That is when you first got to know Merchant Sim.

318
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,260
What does that have to do with anything?

319
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,430
At that time,

320
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,130
you received a large sum of money in secret from Merchant Sim.

321
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,820
What do you mean? Money?

322
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,220
Are you slandering me without any evidence right now?

323
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,150
Yes. I am trying to slander you without any evidence.

324
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,190
W-what did you say?

325
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,750
Rumor impeachment.

326
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,540
A rumor is enough to impeach a high-ranking official from his position.

327
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,820
That is the right given to an official of the Office of Inspector General.

328
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,440
Thus, I will submit a report to the King that you received a significant sum of money

329
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,600
from a procurement merchant as a bribe.

330
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,930
Y-you...

331
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,300
Who knows?

332
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,820
Perhaps, you might be the next to hang yourself on the girder.

333
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,740

334
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,450

335
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,420
As expected. The vehemence that denounced the Crown Prince.

336
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,480
You mean madness.

337
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,880
Then,

338
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,980
is it finally over?

339
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,640
The relaxing...

340
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,200
and peaceful...

341
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
and boring life.

342
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,650
 We must follow them.

343
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,950
 We must follow where the money comes from and to where.

344
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,980

345
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,590
Who goes there?

346
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,270
Choon Gae?

347
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,550
Geum?

348
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,800
What is happening? Are you all right?

349
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,170
Gye Sang Mok, you...

350
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,690
Not me.

351
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,470
Over there.

352
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,110
It does not look like it would be easy to enter.

353
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,830
Let us wait and see.

354
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,370
The inn will empty out soon.

355
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,140
Take this message to your inn master.

356
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,420
"We will be taking all of your money."

357
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,780
When did you learn to use poison stingers?

358
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,520
They're not poisonous. They're tranquilizers.

359
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,140
Oh, I see.

360
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,250
Apricot flowers are best on a moonlit night.

361
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,260

362
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,750
They would see it at the inn, right?

363
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,830
Of course.

364
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,530
Even my brother up in heaven could probably see it.

365
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,820
The hide and seek

366
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,010
is over with this.

367
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,880
Goodness.

368
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,890
What is going on?

369
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,780
That's...

370
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,260
Merchant Sim.

371
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,110
Untie this! Untie this!

372
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,140
They are from Sapyeongjang.

373
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,390
With that girl with the cart.

374
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,350
They are taking everything in the storage.

375
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,580
Follow me!

376
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,320
What did I tell you?

377
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,340
I cannot believe you came here on your own.

378
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,490
Have you come to die?

379
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,000
October 11th of Year of the Monkey!

380
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,690
The Northwest Police Bureau Chief, who was a soldier of the Capital Bureau at the time,

381
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,680
succeeded in subjugating 17 robbers at Mangwolsa Temple.

382
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,910
The forensic pathologist who studied the corpses from that day,

383
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,770
 the examiner who wrote the report, and

384
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,220
the Police Chief who rose to the position of Deputy Inspector for that day's achievements.

385
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,780

It turns out none of them are of this world anymore, unfortunately.

386
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,310
Except for you and me.

387
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,930
There must have been

388
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,820
a deadly secret for all the witnesses of that day to die.

389
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,090
And I happened to have seen it.

390
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,760
- Is that not right? 
- So...

391
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,520
what did you see?

392
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,970
The man who wielded the Double Handed Sword.

393
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,750
Were you trying to hide the fact that...

394
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,620
that man was there that night?

395
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,550
That is enough.

396
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,530
If you die now, no one will know.

397
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,070
Put that sword down.

398
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,130
Did you find it?

399
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,700
Of course, I did.

400
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,880
Definite evidence that no one will deny.

401
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,480

402
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,700
You have made many enemies.

403
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,830
It will be quite troublesome

404
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,300
to deal with all of them.

405
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,420
They are all quite crazy.

406
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,400
Officer Hwang.

407
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,040
- Tie him up. 
 - Yes, sir.

408
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,070
Catch him!

409
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,070
- Arrest him! 
 -  Yes, sir!

410
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,830
Geez...

411
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,240
What in the world!

412
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,570
Find him!

413
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,920
He will be a runaway for the rest of his life.

414
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,720
If he gets caught, he will be executed right away.

415
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,620
He will be arrested soon.

416
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,610
No one will defend him now.

417
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,130
I suppose...

418
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,050
it might be more humiliating to wander his whole life without any money.

419
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,900
But...

420
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,500
But what is this?

421
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,100
They were just there. So I brought them.

422
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,690
I have some takju left.

423
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,360
Would you like to have a sumptuous drink?

424
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,000
Here. One cup each.

425
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:09,920
Whoa. The citron scent is wonderful.

426
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,380
I could drink this all night.

427
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,180
Golden and round.

428
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,550
It looks just like a full moon tonight.

429
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,410
It is a Full Moon drink.

430
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,620
What are you all doing? Drink up.

431
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,510
Cheers!

432
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,200
Young Tenant.

433
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,120
Did that make you uncomfortable?

434
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,910
No, not at all.

435
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,850
Everyone seems happy.

436
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,060
So why are you out here alone?

437
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,850
You know,

438
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,450
I thought...

439
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,620
that there was nothing good about alcohol.

440
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,430
That the alcohol ban was right and alcohol was bad.

441
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,230
I thought if alcohol disappeared from this world,

442
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,510
the world would be a brighter and better place.

443
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,000
But...

444
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,890
it was the complete opposite.

445
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,830
Once we tried to get rid of alcohol,

446
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,600
people wanted to drink even more by paying more,

447
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,500
kill people over alcohol,

448
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,580
and dig tunnels under the capital walls.

449
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,980
That is what the world has come to.

450
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,330
By nature, alcohol is medicine if used for good purposes

451
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,260
and poison if used for bad purposes.

452
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,610
I do not know much about the laws, but

453
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,740
I suppose this is true for everything.

454
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,750
For good purposes, it is medicine. For bad purposes, it is poison.

455
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,390
So it is all up to people.

456
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,590
Whether it becomes medicine or poison.

457
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,470
Goodness.

458
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,840
Why are you staring at me like that?

459
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,230
I can finally understand what my mother told me.

460
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,850
Without a heart of love, learning and success mean nothing.

461
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,310
Loving someone means that person's happiness becomes my happiness

462
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,260
and their worries become my worries.

463
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,690
She meant that...

464
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,700
I should look after the people with that heart.

465
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,990
I will submit an appeal to His Majesty asking to lift the prohibition.

466
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,810
Then,

467
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,500
you will no longer be a criminal.

468
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,980
Will you wait for me?

469
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,580
Until I get everything in order

470
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,250
and return?

471
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,730
Look, Young Hoon.

472
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,960
Young Hoon.

473
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,740
Look, wake up.

474
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,860
Now is the time.

475
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,820
We have to leave now.

476
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,720
Our new titles await us.

477
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,900
What?

478
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,830
Honorable subjects.

479
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,080
Investiture.

480
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,500
Go, go!

481
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,710
Catch them!

482
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,260
Stop right there!

483
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,740
Don't come! Just go!

484
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,380
Young Hoon...

485
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,600
Hurry and go!

486
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,510
Young...

487
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,390
- Hurry! 
 - Move, you bastard!

488
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,380
Move! Stop right there!

489
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,110
You were crying and fussing, saying you didn't want to get married.

490
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,030
Did you change your mind already?

491
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,410
Marriage? Who said anything about getting married?

492
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,340
I have something to ask you, Maiden.

493
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,180
What is it?

494
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,040
You live...

495
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,740
without thinking about your responsibilities or duties.

496
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,510
What you want and what you want to do...

497
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,090
That is all you think about.

498
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,960
You do not think about the consequences and act as you please.

499
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,320
Are you insulting me right now?

500
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,750
No, I'm not. It's just that...

501
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,380
I am asking you what it is like to live that way.

502
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,770
How does it feel to live like you, Young Master Nam?

503
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,460
To live suppressing and hiding your true feelings?

504
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,460
If you live that way, the rice cake soup you ate this year will be digested by next year.

505
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,370
You are right.

506
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,940
For the first time in my life,

507
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,210
I intend on following what my heart desires.

508
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,090
Let us break our engagement.

509
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,600
Do you mean it?

510
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,900
But how?

511
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,730
We will have to argue for it until we get our way.

512
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,020
Ae Jin.

513
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,910
It will be a long-term battle from now on.

514
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,910
I shall find out about Young Master Chui Joong's family

515
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,710
and appeal to my future in-laws. Yes.

516
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,000
Young, what are you doing?

517
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,480
Please forgive your disgraceful son.

518
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,870
For what?

519
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,730
I will not marry the Minister of Defense's daughter.

520
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,980
What do you mean?

521
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,160
Please...

522
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,990
request to break off our engagement.

523
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,130
Get up.

524
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,850
There is no need for this.

525
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,890
For the past ten years,

526
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,860
you have looked after me like your own son, but there is no way for me to repay you.

527
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,160
All the while...

528
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,580
I have received so much support from the family. Thus, I have no right to ask this.

529
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,100
But please...

530
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,070
accept my request this once.

531
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,470
I told you...

532
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,390
there is no need for this.

533
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,640
The marriage document was returned to us.

534
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,600
Pardon?

535
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,920
They have already broken off the engagement with you.

536
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,210
Minister of Defense.

537
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,840
What brings you here at this late hour?

538
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,090
You charged the Ministry of Defense with the Capital Defense Military

539
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,300
and yet you have not apologized.

540
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,830
That was...

541
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,110
quite unfortunate.

542
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,500
Unfortunate?

543
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,960
Do you not think that you were partially responsible

544
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,390
for not taking proper care of the military seal?

545
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,280
Let me ask you one thing.

546
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,620
Thirty years ago, during the dethronement of the then king,

547
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,690
if my late father had not opened the palace gates for you,

548
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,850
would you have succeeded in the dethronement?

549
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,440
What do you mean by that?

550
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,950
A single choice can make a person an honorable subject

551
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,200
or the traitor of the nation.

552
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,400
- Minister of Defense! 
 - No matter how little regard you have for me,

553
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,210
you should not have raided the military storage without my approval.

554
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,760
I shall be breaking off the engagement with Inspector Nam.

555
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,750
There is no law stating that only the House of Yeon can produce queens and concubines.

556
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,040
 Queens and concubines?

557
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,820
Is the Minister of Defense implying that he intends to make his daughter the Princess Consort?

558
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,890
The King intends to make the Minister of Defense the Crown Prince's father-in-law.

559
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,640
We have been fooled by Chief Royal Secretary's schemes.

560
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:18,210
Should the Minister of Defense becomes the Crown Prince's father-in-law,

561
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,470
the 3,000 soldiers will belong to the King's.

562
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,330
We must put a stop to this.

563
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:26,740
Remember the time of Crown Prince Sunghyun.

564
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,290
We encountered so much trouble because one of our own could not be the Princess Consort.

565
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,120
We must put a stop to this.

566
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,170
The tragedy of ten years ago

567
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:40,710
cannot repeat itself.

568
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,560

569
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,440
Who is it...

570
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,910
that you truly serve?

571
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,610
Your Highness.

572
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,170
I worry that you will harm yourself.

573
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,590
Please withdraw your sword and return to your quarters.

574
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,130
Hyungnim!

575
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,320
Hyungnim!

576
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,260
You cannot, Grand Prince Deokwon.

577
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,750
Let me go!

578
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,050
I must go to Hyungnim.

579
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,570
Hyungnim! I am here.

580
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,330
Hyungnim!

581
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:44,150
Hyungnim!

582
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,690
Hyungnim...

583
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,830
Your Highness!

584
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,430
 Your Highness!

585
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,620
 Your Highness!

586
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,300
 Your Highness!

587
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,400
 Your Highness!

588
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,000
 Your Highness!

589
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:28,160
Your Majesty, do you truly believe that Chief Royal Secretary can protect the Crown Prince?

590
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,980
You already know this well, Your Majesty.

591
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,610
The Crown Prince...

592
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:37,440
is not as suitable for the throne as Crown Prince Sunghyun was.

593
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,280
Chief State Minister!

594
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,200
Watch what you say.

595
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,900
Once the Crown Prince rises to the throne,

596
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,240
the nation will be in more chaos.

597
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,700
Would His Highness be able to succeed the throne safely,

598
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:57,240
and secure his place on it?

599
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,620
Are you using the Crown Prince

600
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,350
to threaten me right now?

601
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:07,500
How could a Prohibition Bureau consisting of hoodlums

602
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,310
have any moral or center?

603
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,420
If...

604
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,850
the incident from 30 years ago should occur again,

605
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,980
the ones who are able to protect Your Majesty are not those hoodlums,

606
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,160
but the ones who placed you on that throne...

607
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,450
It is us, your loyal subjects.

608
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:35,710
Please place Yeon Heung Seon's daughter as Princess Consort

609
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:39,350
 and open a path of concord with your devoted subjects

610
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,780
  who supported you through the dark times.

611
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,520
Your Highness, I hope your body and mind are well.

612
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,890
Yes.

613
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:02,030
You seem quite healthy as well, Chief State Minister.

614
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:06,680
I would not die until I see Your Highness take in your Princess Consort.

615
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,700
The Queen is a Yeon.

616
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,230
If the Princess Consort is also from the House of Yeon...

617
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,510
All the ladies of the court would be...

618
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,200
from the House of Yeon.

619
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,700
Gosh.

620
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,890
What are you doing here?

621
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,510
Your Highness.

622
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,610
I hear they will soon ban all marriages temporarily.*
(Temporarily ban marriages of unwed women in order to choose a wife for the crown prince)

623
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,950
Oh. Yes.

624
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,150
I suppose the Crown Prince is already of age.

625
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:45,570
Is there someone His Majesty has in mind?

626
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,870
Pardon?

627
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,870
He does not tell me,

628
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,800
so I am asking if you know anything, Gyeongbin.

629
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,680
You should ask me yourself if you want to know.

630
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:59,110
Your Majesty.

631
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,310
It seems you have someone in mind, Queen.

632
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,860
It is not important whom I may have in mind.

633
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,940
Your Majesty's opinion is all that matters.

634
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,180
Is that so.

635
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,540
Your grandfather seems to think differently.

636
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,570
I am a member of the royal family.

637
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,650
I know that well.

638
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,100
There are varying opinions even within the royal family.

639
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,980
- The engagement is called off? 
 - Yeah.

640
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,910
My young master must be the only person who looks so happy

641
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,440
after having his engagement called off.

642
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,760
Oh, and...

643
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,690
- Here. 
 - What are you doing?

644
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm not a government slave anymore.

645
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,770
I'm no longer a slave, and I'm a commoner now.

646
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:53,160
There is now a large and impenetrable class barrier between you and me.

647
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,490

It's for Lady Ro Seo.

648
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:00,030
Young Master asked me to deliver this to her.

649
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,760
Geum, as for you...

650
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,700
Whether you are a government slave or a commoner,

651
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,310
you were always precious to me.

652
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,570

653
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,650
 I have sat at my desk and read countless books

654
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,530
 and ascertained that I knew all of this world.

655
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,850
 However...

656
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,820
 only after I met you,

657
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,880
 I have come to worry about falling off a cliff,

658
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,700

659
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,100
 worry about drowning in the vast ocean,

660
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,780
 and worry about suffering hardship.

661
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,710
Aigoo!

662
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,830

663
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,620
Inspector Nam!

664
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,180
Aigoo.

665
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:31,360
The country will be turned upside down.

666
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:35,410

667
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,430

668
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,900
 I thought I knew all the right and wrongs.

669
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,440
 But only after meeting you

670
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,310
 did I realize what I have known so far

671
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,870
 was only regulations and laws.

672
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,980
♫  Even if I am alone  ♫

673
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,210
 Worrying for someone and caring for someone.

674
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:13,160
 As a result, knowing what it feels like for the heart to be full...

675
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,170
 I felt those feelings only after I met you.

676
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,880
 No matter how much I try to empty my heart,

677
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,600
 you have filled it up

678
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,350
 and even my wishes and hopes

679
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,260
 are all for you, Maiden.

680
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,540
Do not struggle.

681
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,070
I will make sure you are not lonely in your death

682
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:03,820
and send along that girl soon.

683
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,860
 If a hunting dog is too wild,

684
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,110
it ruins the hunt.

685
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,090
If you let me handle it,

686
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,700
I will make sure I do not go against your will, sir.

687
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,230
Please give me one more chance, sir.

688
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,000
I will do anything you ask.

689
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,460
Now...

690
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,200
I shall be going, sir.

691
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:38,180
 I hope that your afternoons are peaceful.

692
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:48,350
 I hope that your nights are safe.

693
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,850
 I hope that the ground is solid

694
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,730
 and the sky is clear.

695
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,040
 I hope the wind is gentle

696
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,820
 and the waves

697
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,730
 are calm.

698
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,550
 That is all I wish for.

699
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,830
 Perhaps...

700
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,750
 I am too early,

701
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
 or perhaps...

702
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,340
 I am too late.

703
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,310

704
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,040
 Would you please...

705
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,430
 come meet me?

706
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,760

707
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,780
 Did you hear the news?

708
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,650
 That inspector died.

709
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,790
 Is that true?

710
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,890
 - Kang Ro Seo is here! 
 - Is that true?

711
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,010
 Kang Ro Seo is here!

712
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,360
 I must go and see for myself.

713
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,370
 Don't move.

714
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,700
 Where's Kang Ro Seo?

715
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,390
 I lost my memories.

716
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,620
 How dare you touch a woman without permission!

717
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,600
 Are you not looking forward to it?

718
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,300
 What Lady Kang might do after hearing that you died?

719
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,780
 So please go find Lady Kang first.

720
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,590
 I am too late.

721
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,450
 I am so sorry.
