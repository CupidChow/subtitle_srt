1
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,710
Get them!

2
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,540
Get them!

3
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,810

4
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,860
We have no other choice.

5
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,850
- Head to Giringak first. 
 - What?

6
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,960
What about you, My Lady?

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,320
I know this area better.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,550
And I'm faster at pulling the cart.

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,250
But what if you get caught?

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,190
They are more likely to catch us if we're together.

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,230
All right?

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,800
Oh, no.

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,780
Stop right there!

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,100
Stop right there!

15
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,080
That way!

16
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,040
What is that?

17
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,200
 Is something the matter?

18
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,440
Young Tenant.

19
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,180
Don't struggle and come with us.

20
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,030
Did you not say that you wanted to know about Mangwolsa Temple?

21
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,090
I also have much I want to know.

22
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,970
What you know.

23
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,660
How much you know.

24
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,580
You will have to tell me everything.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,700
Take him.

26
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,730
What are you doing? Come on.

27
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,010
Are you all right?

28
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,000
What are you doing? Go after them.

29
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,120
Careful. Carefully.

30
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,900
What...

31
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,330
What is it?

32
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,140
W-what...

33
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,500
What is it?

34
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
I...

35
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,530

36
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,040
Guard Kang?

37
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
Yes.

38
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,740
Maiden's father was Hyungnim's guard?

39
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,970
Yes. Right Guard Kang Ho Yeon.

40
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,060
He was better known as the Tiger of the Southern Mountain.

41
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,750
 Something about hunting a tiger with his bare hands.

42
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,380
 I see.

43
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,160
I heard about Hyungnim's guard catching a tiger that had come into the palace.

44
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,220
So the Maiden and I had such a connection.

45
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,180
When did she lose her father?

46
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,320
According to the family records,

47
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,010
in October of the Year of the Monkey.

48
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,710
That was not long after Hyungnim passed away.

49
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,340
Then...

50
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,290
she has lived without a father for ten years.

51
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,910
It is dark. Be careful.

52
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,900
Why on earth is this tunnel here?

53
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,840
It's a dead end.

54
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,730
Why would they make this here?

55
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,440
Aigoo.

56
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,290
This is...

57
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,600
 Stop right there!

58
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,680
It is a very familiar place.

59
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,020
Goodness.

60
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,680
I was wondering how they had disappeared so quickly.

61
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,870
This was it.

62
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,940
What do you mean by that?

63
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,490
They dug a tunnel underneath the castle walls

64
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,800
and connected the inside and outside of the capital.

65
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,940
This is probably how they transported alcohol all along.

66
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,590
Alcohol.

67
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,180
They cannot have gone far.

68
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,820
- Search the area! 
  - Yes, sir!

69
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,600
 Over here!

70
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,330
Let us leave.

71
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,320
This is how they transported the alcohol?

72
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,810
Through the tunnel?

73
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,450
It was probably impossible to transport

74
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,200
large amounts of liquor through Sungnyemun Gate through normal means.

75
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,770
The passage would have to fit

76
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,760
not only one jar, but over 100 jars.

77
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,140
Then they would not have had to be inspected before entering Sungnyemun Gate.

78
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,620
Such a method existed...

79
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,520
Why did I not think of this before?

80
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,700
Don't even think about it.

81
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,690
Gosh. I was only joking.

82
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,500
Wait...

83
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,780
Do you not smell something?

84
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,780
I do. I smell something fishy.

85
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,240
What... Wait.

86
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,500
Come.

87
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,670
Why is this here?

88
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,050
No wonder there are mice all over the place.

89
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,400
I think they locked the door.

90
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,470
Let us go back through the way we came.

91
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,040
Darn it.

92
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,180
Be careful.

93
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,540
Step aside.

94
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,630
Goodness.

95
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,100
Maiden, be careful.

96
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,860
Maiden.

97
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,450
Can you reach anything?

98
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,400
I think I can.

99
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,610
Just a little bit more...

100
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,890
I think we better find another way.

101
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,670
Yes... Right... Let's do that.

102
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,790
Fortunately, the military has not captured anyone.

103
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,630
It looks like she must have run away.

104
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,160
Whoa. What a relief.

105
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,550
But I hear they found the alcohol cart.

106
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,980
On the Southern Mountains.

107
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,210
That means she didn't even get that far.

108
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,450
That means something indeed happened.

109
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,940
He scared me.

110
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,330
W-why...

111
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,680
Why is he like that?

112
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,290
If an alcohol cart was found,

113
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,080
that means something urgent happened

114
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,920
that forced her to run away without it.

115
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,930
- I... 
 - I...

116
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,930
You go first.

117
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,440
No, you first.

118
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,870
- That cart— 
 - No, never mind. Stop.

119
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,100
I think it is better we do not talk.

120
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,790
You...

121
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,410
go first.

122
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,930
 How can I believe you? Everything is a lie.

123
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,540
 From the beginning to the end, have you ever been truthful with me? Even once?

124
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,510
There was alcohol in that cart.

125
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,970
You found out anyhow.

126
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,920
What is the point of lying?

127
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,380
Will you...

128
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,270
hate me now?

129
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,150
I do not hate you.

130
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,420
Not even a little bit.

131
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,460
I have never hated you.

132
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,210
Not even once.

133
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,270
If you find out what I did,

134
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,980
you might hate me.

135
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,520
What else did you do now?

136
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,890
Are you out of your mind?

137
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,680
The military seal?

138
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,890
See? I knew you wouldn't like it.

139
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,120
What is the reason you are going so far?

140
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,500
Did you earn, what...

141
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,760
1,000 nyang pulling carts or something?

142
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,550
I did.

143
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,200
You earned 1,000 nyang?

144
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,350
Yes.

145
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,030
Goodness.

146
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,520
What do you want?

147
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,330
I want to know how much longer I have to wait.

148
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,910
Are you going to turn Giringak into a courtesan house with no alcohol?

149
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,730
You came all the way here to ask me that?

150
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,650
 She had a headdress on.

151
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,120
 She was definitely a female physician.

152
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,960
You know who that female physician is, don't you?

153
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,210
What are you talking about?

154
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,180
The day Gye Sang Mok gained consciousness, there was a female physician at Giringak.

155
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,790
How would I know who that is?

156
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,690
She must have come with the physician I had sent for.

157
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,270
If you aren't going to answer me, I'll be going.

158
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,870
I'll find out soon enough.

159
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,250
I have seen that girl's face.

160
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,110
What did you want to do with the 1,000 nyang you earned?

161
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,110
I just...

162
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,600
If I suddenly end up with 100 nyang of debt,

163
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,990
I did not want to feel hopeless, like falling off a cliff.

164
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,390
I just wanted a lifeline.

165
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,700
And I didn't like people calling me a poor noble, either.

166
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,630
But while I did it,

167
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,990
I liked that I was making money with my own hands.

168
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,250
I enjoyed seeing people happy

169
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,260
as they drank the alcohol I made.

170
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,390
I'm not good at sewing or weaving clothes,

171
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,020
but it made me feel like I was good at something.

172
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,420
I know I sound absurd.

173
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,750
It is absurd.

174
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,710
I cannot hate you even after knowing all this.

175
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,420
Sorry?

176
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,140
No, it's nothing.

177
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,440
What are you doing?

178
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
This is the lifeline we need right now.

179
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,550
First...

180
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,060
let's get out of here.

181
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,520
So...

182
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,100
you came here to meet Ro Seo, not Inspector Nam?

183
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,410
Yes. That is correct.

184
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,150
 He doesn't seem as scholarly as Inspector Nam,

185
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,370
 but his clothes

186
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,060
 and everything he is wearing is of high quality.

187
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,770
What is your relationship with Ro Seo?

188
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm not certain.

189
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,260
My feelings have grown too much to call us friends.

190
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,640
Please take good care of her.

191
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,290
What is the point of having titles these days?

192
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,530
Who cares about winning the state exam?

193
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,200
Right.

194
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,560
Who cares about petty pay?

195
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,180
 Who cares?

196
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,560
Why are you two together...

197
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,230
Jade Lad.

198
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,300
Could it be...

199
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,020
you two were together the whole night?

200
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,130
Hide Maiden in the palace?

201
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,040
Please hide her in the Eastern Palace until I can catch that man.

202
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,210
I thought you said I could not bring her to the palace without a proper procedure.

203
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,260
Well.

204
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,710
I was already looking into how to get her into the palace.

205
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,440
Although, because of the urgent circumstances,

206
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,080
I will not be able to go through the proper procedure.

207
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,800
It will just be a few days.

208
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,100
A few days?

209
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,310
Once the Maiden enters the palace,

210
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,070
I do not plan on letting her out.

211
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,810
I do not know if it will be days or months,

212
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:26,000
but while you catch that man, I will win her heart.

213
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,380
So that the Maiden would want to remain in the palace.

214
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,770
Do you not think she will be safer by my side?

215
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,730
You are to marry the Minister of Defense's daughter after all.

216
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,780
So, what job are you working exactly?

217
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,360
So, it's kind of...

218
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,960
wood and mud construction.

219
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,850
I will not study for the state exam anymore.

220
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,880
I'm going to build a paulownia tree chest when you get married.

221
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,600
That is all I wish for.

222
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,870
Marriage? I do not want to get married.

223
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,270
You do not want it?

224
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,100
- Which is it? 
 - What?

225
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,890
Is it the rich young man from Gyesong or Nam?

226
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:15,140
Goodness, it isn't like that.

227
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,250
Aigoo. I wouldn't usually say this,

228
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,640
but Nam is to become the Minister of Defense's son-in-law.

229
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,330
Would it not be best to stop having feelings for him?

230
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,540
 Please reconsider your command.

231
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,690
A man who works for the public

232
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,600
took his own life when he was caught distilling alcohol in secret.

233
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,530
And now, an alcohol cart was found in the capital.

234
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,640
The prohibition has become so lax.

235
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,910
Will you only sit back and watch?

236
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,780
However, expanding the Prohibition Bureau is a different matter.

237
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,410
The Ministry of Taxation is already in financial difficulty.

238
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,330
This will be no different from giving money away to hoodlums.

239
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,230
How could that be for the people?

240
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,060
Please reconsider your command, Your Majesty.

241
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,260
 Please reconsider your command, Your Majesty.

242
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,030
If the financial state of the Ministry of Taxation is the reason we cannot expand the Prohibition Bureau,

243
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,920
could we not consider downsizing the Capital Defense Military to allow for the budget?

244
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,050
What nonsense!

245
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,870
The Capital Defense Military guards His Majesty!

246
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,860
The Capital Defense Military

247
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,460
has not even caught the bandits who raided the Police Chief's house.

248
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,650
The budget of a country

249
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,610
should be reduced on unnecessary matters

250
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,360
and used where it is needed.

251
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,150
There was alcohol in the cart, not weapons.

252
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,210
Why are you always so hasty?

253
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,990
Forgive me, Father.

254
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,850
Aigoo.

255
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,600
But I hear they are expanding the Prohibition Bureau.

256
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,830
It is obvious what he is thinking.

257
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,140
He is planning to use the Prohibition Bureau as His Majesty's private army.

258
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,700
Even if they expand the Prohibition Bureau, there will only be 1,000 soldiers.

259
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,670
The Capital Defense Military has 5,000,

260
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,870
what could they do with only 1,000?

261
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,680
It is not only 1,000.

262
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,710
A small crack is enough to sink a ship.

263
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,100
I am sure they have another scheme.

264
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,520
The Minister of Defense has 3,000 soldiers in his command.

265
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,550
We could meet their match if we expand the Prohibition Bureau to 1,000.

266
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,850
But would the Minister of Defense wish to become the Crown Prince's father-in-law?

267
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,160
He is an exemplary subject, no doubt.

268
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,200
They are people who have made

269
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,650
an oath pledged in blood to never betray each other.

270
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,320
Even with an oath pledged in blood,

271
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,780
an oath without trust

272
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,440
is of no use.

273
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,700
Do not worry, Your Majesty.

274
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,200
The walls are starting to crumble.

275
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,980
Soon, the roof will fall apart.

276
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,330
Father.

277
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,820
Oh, Ae Jin.

278
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,310
Yes. What is it?

279
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,470
I thought you might be hungry.

280
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,360
So...

281
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,740
about last night's alcohol cart...

282
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,780
Yes!

283
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,070
That was an alcohol cart. An alcohol cart!

284
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,230
Goodness. How could they suspect me of smuggling weapons?

285
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,260
Do I look that easy?

286
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,830
Did you catch them by any chance?

287
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,810
Just wait until I catch them.

288
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,250
I shall execute everyone who is connected to it.

289
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,630
Pardon?

290
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,720
E-execute?

291
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,990
You can't!

292
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,450
I have to go to Geum.

293
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,670
She must be worried about me.

294
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,810
He saw your face.

295
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,780
We saw his face, too.

296
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,700
He tried to kidnap an inspector of the Office of Inspector General.

297
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,430
Isn't arresting him all that is left?

298
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,300
And will you volunteer to testify?

299
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,940
That he tried to abduct me

300
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,360
but you saved me by pushing your alcohol cart?

301
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,910
If we report him, we must report you, too.

302
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,860
There is no way to arrest him without arresting you.

303
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,000
Then what do you want me to do?

304
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,190
Do not tell the Maiden she will be going to the palace.

305
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,260
I shall tell her myself face to face.

306
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,870
Young Master Lee...

307
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,260
said he would prepare a place for you to stay.

308
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,990
A palanquin will be here in the afternoon.

309
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,200
But...

310
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,380
what about you?

311
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,070
Did they not try to harm you?

312
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,330
Should you not hide as well?

313
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,800
We found out there is a tunnel in the capital that is connected to the outside.

314
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,250
If we can prove that he dug the tunnel,

315
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,300
I will certainly be able to arrest him.

316
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,530
It is only for a few days.

317
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,950
Only a few days.

318
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,020
I shall arrest him,

319
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,120
so hang on just for a little while longer.

320
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,190
Aigoo.

321
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,780
 His Highness, the Crown Prince.

322
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,660
"His Highness, the Crown.."

323
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,590
What?

324
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,040
Pyo's here to see me?

325
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,710
- Goodness! 
 - Your Highness!

326
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,250
Your clothes...

327
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,300
I wonder what brings him to see me...

328
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,690
Crown Prince.

329
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,580
What brings you here?

330
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,990
I would like to ask for your help with something, Mother.

331
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,340
My help?

332
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,110
Me?

333
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,320
Did Inspector Nam go somewhere?

334
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,450
He had to go to the Office of Inspector General in a rush.

335
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,580
So, where am I going?

336
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,690
Jade Lad couldn't be taking me to Gyesong.

337
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,810
You will find out once you get there.

338
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,640
You should get on the palanquin.

339
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,020
Did I surprise you?

340
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,490
I am the Crown Prince of Joseon.

341
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,440
Lee Pyo.

342
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,130
Gosh.

343
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,490
That's not right.

344
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,310
Welcome. I'm actually the Joseon of the Crown Prince.

345
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,270
No, what am I saying?

346
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,620
I am...

347
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,390
the Crown Prince of Joseon.

348
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,030
That goes over there.

349
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,460
Wait, no, no.

350
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,110
Over here? Here.

351
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,900
No...

352
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,240
Over here?

353
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,270
Yes, yes! That's perfect.

354
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,830
Yes!

355
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,260
Goodness!

356
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,690
Brother.

357
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,630
Why are you suddenly decorating Yeonhwadang?

358
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,350
That is...

359
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,850
So... the truth is...

360
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,430
Gosh.

361
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,890
I was not going to tell you, Brother.

362
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,830
The rumored woman that the Crown Prince met.

363
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,170
Rather than having the rumor spread about having a woman outside the palace,

364
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,930
I thought it would be better to have her stay in the palace.

365
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,360
Do you have any idea what you are doing?

366
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,910
Once the Crown Prince's marriage selections begin,

367
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:37,220
what do you think they will do for the position of princess consort?

368
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,680
They will try to control us by finding the smallest weakness of the Crown Prince.

369
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,330
And to bring a woman into the palace at a time like this!

370
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,340
You know, the boy has never acted like this before...

371
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,110
His Highness has never acted this way before,

372
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,830
and he begged me so earnestly.

373
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,180
How could I refuse him?

374
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,580
It is not as if we don't know her family.

375
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,730
What do you mean by that?

376
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,580
That girl...

377
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,310
She is the daughter of the Southern Mountain Tiger.

378
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,590
That surprised you, no?

379
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,770
I was shocked as well.

380
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,290
You never know about connections between people...

381
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,580
Anyhow, we shall keep her here

382
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,100
and then make her a concubine

383
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,920
after the royal wedding.

384
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,960
When did you say that girl is arriving?

385
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,910
Move aside.

386
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,090
Move aside.

387
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,710
Move aside.

388
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,170
It's so stuffy.

389
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,180
- How do people ride in this thing? 
 - Move aside.

390
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,560
Move aside.

391
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,440
This won't do.

392
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,820
You cannot show your face, My Lady.

393
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,870
What?

394
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,520
Gosh.

395
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,410
Goodness.

396
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,890
This pulley...

397
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,480
Aigoo.

398
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,710
Here I go.

399
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,080
It was already a shock that the Police Chief took his own life.

400
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,570
And now an underground tunnel?

401
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,130
Aigoo.

402
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,010
Did you make it down there?

403
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,060
Can't he tell?

404
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,550
Yes.

405
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,370
Can you see the tunnel?

406
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,970
- There is no tunnel.
- What? There isn't?

407
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,720
There is no tunnel. Nothing at all.

408
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
He says it's not there.

409
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,550
Impossible.

410
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,650
Aigoo.

411
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,970
Sir, there's not much room here. You should have come down after I went up.

412
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,480
Goodness.

413
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,360
We blocked the entrance as you ordered.

414
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,840
The construction will end soon.

415
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,700
It will be best not to leave any traces that could cause trouble.

416
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,830
What will you do about the inspector and the girl?

417
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,330
Search everywhere from the Medical Service Bureau
to the Royal Infirmary and find that girl.

418
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,400
If we catch that girl,

419
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,770
the inspector will find us on his own.

420
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:21,680
You will only work aside from sleeping and eating.

421
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,000
Aigoo.

422
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,460
I'm doing this since they say they will pay us double.

423
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,840
But how is this a well?

424
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,960
Do you not think they are connecting the outside and inside of the capital?

425
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,900
What is the point of whether it connects the capital to outside

426
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,650
or dig a hole under the palace?

427
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,650
We only have to focus on earning money.

428
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,390
Perhaps...

429
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,050
the Japanese are digging this tunnel

430
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,470
in order to start a war. You never know.

431
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,630
Japanese?

432
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,630
If that is the case,

433
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,670
we will be the nation's traitors

434
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,730
who helped the foreigner's invasion.

435
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,610
Then,

436
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,930
we could become honorable subjects if we report this.

437
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,000
Honorable subjects?

438
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,340
Not only a title, but we will also receive fortune and land.

439
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,500
A title and fortune?

440
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,390
They must carry out a large-scale construction to dig such a tunnel.

441
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,650
There must be countless workers involved.

442
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,060
We can find evidence if we only look.

443
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,830
What will we investigate when there is no tunnel?

444
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,530

We found the Police Chief's suicide note, confessing it was all his doing.

445
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,980
- That means this is a closed case. 
 - Chief Inspector—

446
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,070
Inspector Nam!

447
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,280
Inspector General, Sir.

448
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,930
Am I a joke to you?

449
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,930
The tasks that I assigned to you are still on your table.

450
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,910
Where are you coming back from doing what?

451
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:56,410
I warned you not to do unnecessary things.

452
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,700
Give me your inspector badge this instant.

453
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,940
- Sir— 
 - What are you doing, Chief Inspector?

454
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,260
Hurry and take his badge from him.

455
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,200
Give me your badge.

456
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Until I give you permission,

457
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,460
all your inspector duties are on hold.

458
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,150
This is a courtesan house, not a temple.

459
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,810
Get lost!

460
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,720
What is happening?

461
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,190
You must leave after you finish eating.

462
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,590
Could you let me stay here?

463
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,370
I'll do anything you ask.

464
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,910
You should not say those things lightly.

465
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,170
Saying you will do anything you're told to do.

466
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,030
Do not ever say that to anyone else.

467
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,820
Understand?

468
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,400
Geum, you asked for a day off yesterday as well.

469
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,450
Just one day.

470
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,950
Just one day, please.

471
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,690
My family went missing.

472
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,060
Did you not say your family was in Hamheung?

473
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,250
That is why this is an even urgent matter.

474
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,380
They are so far— Ow!

475
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,480
My leg, ow.

476
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,640
Why does my ankle hurt here?

477
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,450
Here.

478
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,280
Move aside.

479
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,750
I said, you couldn't look outside.

480
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,590
Wait, I need to make a stop somewhere.

481
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,900
Pardon?

482
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,350
He said we should take you straight to your destination.

483
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,180
It will only take a moment. Just a moment.

484
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,480
Gosh.

485
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,490
What are you doing?

486
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,410
Which female physician was not here yesterday?

487
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,640
Tell me this instant!

488
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,340
Hold it right there.

489
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,590
I will bring Geum out here, so do not ever leave the palanquin.

490
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,790
My Lady!

491
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,430
- You cannot leave the palanquin! 
 - Move aside!

492
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,870
I was told I had to escort you safely.

493
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,420
Oh, no!

494
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,370
I apologize. I cannot run away alone to save myself.

495
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,610
Tell Jade Lad I'm truly sorry.

496
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,650
Pardon?

497
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,840
My Lady!

498
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,460
My Lady!

499
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,450
You!

500
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,170
You startled me.

501
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,160
Why are you so jittery? Did you do something wrong?

502
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,060
Do something wrong? Do what wrong?

503
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,180
Anyhow, have you seen my young master?

504
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,400
What?

505
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,860
How would I know where your young master is?

506
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,620
The thing is,

507
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,210
he never came home last night.

508
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,160
Inspector Nam didn't come home last night?

509
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,710
For now,

510
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,710
let's go to Lady Ro Seo's house.

511
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,720
What...

512
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,070
Why would we go to Lady Ro Seo's house?

513
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,910
Could it be my young master and Lady Ro Seo spent the night together?

514
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,670
Come on.

515
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,260
Geez! What is going on?

516
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,880
My young master is to be married to the daughter of the Minister of Defense!

517
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,090
That's why I'm telling you to come with me.

518
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,970
- We can go and check.
- Geez!

519
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,090
Hand over that female physician.

520
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,760
I don't know what business you have,

521
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,500
but I can't do that.

522
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,910
Goodness!

523
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,140
Aigoo, so many of you.

524
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,120
Nice!

525
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,550
Yes!

526
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,120
Choon Gae.

527
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,390
Choon Gae!

528
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,170
Choon Gae! Choon Gae!

529
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,480
Choon Gae!

530
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,540
My Lady.

531
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,030
It's me you want. Is it not?

532
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,930
Let us go.

533
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,050
 I do not know if it will be days or months,

534
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:38,920
 but while you catch that man, I will win her heart.

535
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,640
 So that the Maiden wants to remain in the palace.

536
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,310
We meet again, Inspector Nam.

537
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,610
You came to see me of your own will.

538
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,370
What are you thinking?

539
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:04,100
I have a report to make on finding an alcohol cart in the capital last night.

540
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,580
Do not worry.

541
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,340
As long as you do not reveal what happened last night,

542
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,790
the soldiers at the Ministry of Defense will not find out whom I saw.

543
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,340
We were unexpectedly hindered yesterday,

544
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,820
but shall we...

545
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,790
continue our conversation?

546
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,930
Will you kidnap me again?

547
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,080
Not at all.

548
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,360
You will visit me on your own accord this time.

549
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,850
I shall see you at Mangwolsa Temple.

550
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,950
She ran out of the palanquin?

551
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,710
W-well, it seems...

552
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,230
she saw a female physician, Geum, being chased by thugs

553
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,950
and chased after them.

554
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:07,320
- Your Highness. 
 - Where are you going?

555
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,260
- Move aside, Uncle. 
 - I cannot do that.

556
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,680
I must go. Giddyup!

557
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,130
Oh, no.

558
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,240
What are you doing?

559
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,390
- Call the guards. 
 - Yes, Your Excellency.

560
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,120
Y-Your Highness...

561
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,520
Are you not Eunuch Kim of the Eastern Palace?

562
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,680
Is something happening at the Eastern Palace?

563
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,320
N-no.

564
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,630
Nothing is happening.

565
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,320
I just...

566
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,930
needed to go to the lavatory.

567
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,770
I see.

568
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,470
Then get going.

569
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:53,240
Aigoo.

570
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,960
Inspector Nam!

571
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,500
Young Master...

572
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,370
Choon Gae!

573
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,170
What has happened to you?

574
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,190
Lady Ro Seo was taken by those thugs.

575
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,100
They took her.

576
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,430
What do we do?

577
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,110
 Not at all.

578
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,540
 You will visit me on your own accord this time.

579
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,560
 I shall see you at Mangwolsa Temple.

580
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:25,830
Take care of Choon Gae.

581
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,800
 No. Please.

582
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,590
- Where is Lady Ro Seo? 
 - At Mangwolsa Temple.

583
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,820

584
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,920
So this wench really did that to Gye Sang Mok?

585
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,730
She looks so thin and so weak.

586
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:55,540
Anyhow, she is the reason we could not sell alcohol for a month.

587
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,460
We could've made tens of thousands of nyang in a month.

588
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,740
Think about how much we lost.

589
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,950
The amount of money to pay off the Prohibition Bureau every month

590
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,870
must be thousands of nyang.

591
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,330
We can make up for it once we get paid the protection fee from the distillery.

592
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,750
Let us go.

593
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,800
What was that?

594
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,730
Geez...

595
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,210
Are you playing hide and seek?

596
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:51,010
Let's not make a scene.

597
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,870
This is a place to console the souls of the dead.

598
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,150
A man like you knows how to console the souls of the dead?

599
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:01,810
It was you who killed the Doyenne's son.

600
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,670
Do you know why you were brought here?

601
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,440
Did that inspector not tell you?

602
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,930
About Mangwolsa Temple...

603
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,210
ten years ago.

604
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,760
Mangwolsa Temple?

605
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,990
It was only a wench like you

606
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,910
who was getting in my way all along.

607
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,800
And seeing how a wench like me bothers you so...

608
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,010
tells me you're not that big of a deal.

609
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,610
You must not understand the situation yet.

610
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,160
Watch carefully.

611
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,130
I will find everyone related to you or has done business with you and kill them.

612
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,630
I guess that inspector would die first.

613
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,550
He will come here on his own accord to save you.

614
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,840
You just try touching a hair on Young Tenant.

615
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,500
I will make sure you pay.

616
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:12,220
Unfortunately, there isn't a cart for you to push today.

617
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,350
I shall keep your memorial tablets

618
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,680
here, together.

619
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,110
Stay here!

620
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,200
No!

621
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,410
Open this door. Open this door!

622
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,350
 Open this door!

623
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,800
Don't hurt Young Tenant.

624
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,700
I'll make you pay! Open this door!

625
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:40,550
Open this door!

626
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
I'm about to obtain one soon.

627
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,440
I suppose our beating each other up paid off.

628
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,120
Where is the Maiden?

629
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,320
You will not be able to meet her before you enter the afterlife.

630
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,250
I shall let you go there first.

631
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,710
I shall send you both in an orderly fashion.

632
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,000
Attack!

633
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,040
Forgive me for saying this,

634
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,130
but Your Highness must protect yourself from now on.

635
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,540
Look who's talking.

636
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:04,130

(Main temple hall)

637
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,290
It wasn't...

638
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,470
a tiger.

639
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,190
Nam Young!

640
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,810
Pull yourself together!

641
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,690
Young Tenant!

642
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,310
Maiden.

643
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:55,480
Take the Maiden and get out of here.

644
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,380
Uncle.

645
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,300
Chief Royal Secretary?

646
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,670
Protect the Crown Prince!

647
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,650
The Crown Prince?

648
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,540
Let us get out of here.

649
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,880
Let us go.

650
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,310
You must return to the palace, Your Highness.

651
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,640
But they—

652
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,490
Will you hold them responsible for what happened here today?

653
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,760
Escort His Highness.

654
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,210
Are you all right?

655
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,950
Are you not hurt?

656
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,970
What about you? Are you all right?

657
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,570
I'm all right.

658
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,920
Then it would be best for us to part here.

659
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,580
Go this way to the capital.

660
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,510
You should get going.

661
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,910
No.

662
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:50,500
Then I shall go ahead first.

663
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,890
Maiden.

664
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,110
I am sorry.

665
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,070
What are you sorry about?

666
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,340
It is all my fault.

667
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,880
I was the one who smuggled alcohol into the capital

668
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,420
and I was also the one who pushed the cart at that man.

669
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,940
You did nothing wrong.

670
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,090
For not going when you told me not to.

671
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:26,030
For counting all the way to ten when you told me to.

672
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,100
For sending you alone saying it can be dangerous.

673
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,830
It was all my fault.

674
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,200
I will not leave just because you tell me to.

675
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,800
Go.

676
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,540
You have a place to return to.

677
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,340
You have a road of flowers

678
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,490
and silk ahead of you.

679
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:52,050
They are of no use.

680
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,230
Neither flower nor silk roads

681
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,580
will be able to shake my heart.

682
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:15,340

683
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,990
I will count to ten and to ten again.

684
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,310
And even then,

685
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:29,080
it is you for me.

686
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,980
♫  When I walked one step closer to you  ♫

687
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,460
♫  You would walk two steps away  ♫

688
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:53,760
♫  I think of how we used to be  ♫

689
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,730
♫  My heart ached too much  ♫

690
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:03,690
♫  So I decided not to long for you anymore  ♫

691
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:11,040
♫  Just watching you made me ache  ♫

692
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,540
♫  I still saw you at the end of a long day  ♫

693
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:22,710
♫  And spent those days hating myself  ♫

694
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:27,350
♫  I pity myself again today  ♫

695
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:37,430
♫  You probably won't know that I am like this  ♫

696
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:58,280
♫  Love is an unfamiliar emotion to me  ♫

697
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,170
♫  I miss you  ♫

698
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:04,190

699
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,840
 Let us pretend it never happened.

700
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,580
 I do not concern myself anyway.

701
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,910
 But I do.

702
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:12,480
 What do you intend to do, My Lady?

703
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,710
 I will catch him.

704
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,910
 Before that man can hurt the people I care about, I will get him first.

705
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:19,870
 Once they find out Your Highness brought that girl into the palace,

706
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:22,400
 she will be in danger as well as you.

707
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,200
 Do you mean Chief State Minister was involved with the death of the maiden's father?

708
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,850
 Will His Highness be able to succeed the throne safely,

709
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,750
 and secure his place on it?

710
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,600
 Your Highness!

711
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,300
 You're afraid he might abandon you, are you not?

712
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,870
 You have made many enemies.

713
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,400
 It will be quite troublesome to deal with all of them.

714
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,430
 They are all quite crazy.

715
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:49,400
♫  You probably won't know  ♫
