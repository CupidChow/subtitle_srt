1
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,900
Be well.

2
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,290
Do not be discouraged that the engagement was called off.

3
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,840
Do not worry about me.

4
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,430
Why is your arm so thin?

5
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,700
I shall send money as soon as I arrive—

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,080
The bracelet...

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,510
Wait.

8
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,760
Where is your bracelet?

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,140
P-pardon?

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,500
But...

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,470
He said your future would be troubled...

12
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,630
This will not do.

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,280
We must stop by the Myeonggwak scholar's house–

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,220
Father, I think the ship is about to depart.

15
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,550
- What? 
 - You must hurry onboard.

16
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,430
Careful, watch your feet.

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,800
Young, you must watch out for yourself.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,710
- Yes, Father. 
 - Depart!

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,880

20
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,380

21
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,660

22
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,460
Do not struggle.

23
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,970
I will make sure you are not lonely in your death

24
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,020
and send along that girl soon.

25
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,660
Two joints from Hanyang to Gaesong.

26
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,410
By foot...

27
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,600
- One, two... 
 - My Lady! My Lady!

28
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,770
We must make you new clothes.

29
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,400
What new clothes?

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,330
I hear they will select a Princess Consort soon.

31
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,210
What does that have to do with me?

32
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,390
His Excellency said he would put your name on the bridal candidate list.

33
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,180
- On the bridal candidate list? 
 - Yes.

34
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,920
Goodness.

35
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,320
You broke off two engagements,

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,470
so I was worried you would never get married.

37
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,080
But it seems...

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,290
you were meant to be a Princess Consort.

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,150
Now let me see.

40
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,460
What do I need to prepare?

41
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,010
The whole Joseon knows the Crown Prince is a ruffian.

42
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,190
I'd be crazy to become the Princess Consort.

43
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,130
Never.

44
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,980
My Lady!

45
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,930
What are you doing?

46
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,400
Why did you pack your things?

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,870
Are you going somewhere?

48
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,970
Do not tell Father.

49
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,300
- Tell him what? 
 - That I'm running away.

50
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,280
What?

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,220
My Lady!

52
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,690
 Kang Ro Seo.

53
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,170
 Female, 20 years old. The ringleader of an alcohol smuggling group.

54
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,770
 Guilty of forging the military seal to smuggle alcohol into the capital.

55
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,670
 Anyone who captures and reports her will be rewarded 100 nyang.

56
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,980

A noblewoman named Kang Ro Seo

57
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,210
dug a tunnel from mokbingo to inside the capital to smuggle alcohol?

58
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,140
Mokbingo...

59
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,940
Did you not say the Police Chief who took his own life had done that?

60
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,910
It seems that after the mokbingo was discovered,

61
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,290
it became difficult to smuggle alcohol into the capital.

62
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,470
Thus she must have turned the blame on the Police Chief.

63
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,870
A crime worthy of death!

64
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,040

The Ministry of Defense posted a reward on her

65
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,560
and we are investigating everyone who passes through the four main and minor gates.

66
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,580
We will be able to catch her soon.

67
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,120
Your Majesty.

68
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,860
This indicates that the capital defense has been breached.

69
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,710
It indicates that all the soldiers defending the capital

70
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,900
did not even realize a tunnel had been dug.

71
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,650
You must make someone take responsibility for this.

72
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,540
You are right, Chief Royal Secretary.

73
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,310
The Ministry of the Secretary shall discuss how to reform the military.

74
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,790
Your Majesty.

75
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,700
Reform of the military must be done with serious consideration.

76
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,820
- Please reconsider your command. 
 - I do not want to hear it.

78
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,710
Anyone who did not report the criminal knowing who it is

79
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,330
and whoever hides the criminal will all be punished for the same crime.

80
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,800
Search in and outside the capital and make sure the criminal is caught.

81
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,580
That is ridiculous.

82
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,390
How could she dig a tunnel

83
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,900
and lead an alcohol smuggling group consisting of tens?

84
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,900
It is true that she forged the military seal to smuggle alcohol into the capital.

85
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,180
If there are false accusations,

86
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,470
the Ministry of Defense will investigate to uncover them.

87
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,070
How is this only her fault?

88
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,730
Not looking after the hungry people

89
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,540
and driving them to defy the alcohol ban.

90
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,120
The court is at fault for all this!

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,830
Is the prohibition...

92
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,470
truly for the people?

93
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,410
I must see Father.

94
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,390
"I am in love with the criminal."

95
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,830
Will you confess that to him?

96
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,380
What do you think will happen if Chief State Minister finds out about this?

97
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,070
He will take that girl as your weakness and try to control Your Highness.

98
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,210
Just as he did with the Crown Prince Sunghyun.

99
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,770
Then shall I sit idle and watch?

100
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,710
That girl is...

101
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,750
my friend's daughter.

102
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,590
How could I not be anguished? However...

103
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,970
protecting that girl...

104
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,940
is only possible if we have power.

105
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,490
If you wish to protect the one you care for,

106
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,490
you must become powerful.

107
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,680
But...

108
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,660
I shall search for that girl

109
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,230
in whatever way I can.

110
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,750
You were all gathered here.

111
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,470
- Like a swarm of rats. 
 - What are you all doing?

112
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,760
Escape through the back.

113
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,420
Hurry, go, go!

114
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,440
Will you be all right?

115
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,780
Yes, you won't be any help even if you're here.

116
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,530
Still, will you be all right alone?

117
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,450
- You want to fight him? 
 - Come on!

118
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,400
Where's Kang Ro Seo?

119
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,810
If she's not here, she's not here.

120
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,980
Don't ask me about it and throw a crazy fit.

121
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm not going to ask twice.

122
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,140
Where did you hide my money?

123
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,810
I lost my memories.

124
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,900
Take that off.

125
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,120
Stop.

126
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,940
Move aside.

127
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,460
Do you not know who this is?

128
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,860
We were ordered to open all palanquins to check the face.

129
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,130
Open the window.

130
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,330
She is the Queen.

131
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,670
If you must check my face, you must.

132
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,440
Is that all?

133
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,650
Yes.

134
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,080
Forgive me, Your Highness.

135
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,740
What a fuss.

136
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,150
How could a girl do such a horrid thing?

137
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,680
Your Excellency.

138
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,440
- Her Ladyship... 
 - What did Ae Jin do again?

139
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,070
She ran away.

140
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,270
What do you mean she ran away?

141
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,270
The truth is,

142
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,720
she went out last night.

143
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,540
I thought she would return soon.

144
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,320
Then where did she sleep last night?

145
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,500
That's what I mean...

146
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,120
The Princess Consort selection will begin soon.

147
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,100
If anyone finds out she ran away...

148
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,630
I shall hire people to search for her in secret.

149
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,850
So you must make sure the word does not get out.

150
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,620
Understand?

151
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,410
- Maiden Han. 
 - I have been looking for you everywhere.

152
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,540
You must run away. Right this instant!

153
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,000

154
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,380
D*** it.

155
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,500
Maiden.

156
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,590
Oops.

157
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,640
Why did you bring that child's toy if you were in such a hurry?

158
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,010
It will be heavy to carry.

159
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,760
It was my father's.

160
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,840
 Roar! I won't eat you if you give me some rice cake.

161
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,900
 Roar!

162
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,120
How adorable. Is it a cat?

163
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,920
A tiger.

164
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,040
Oh, a tiger.

165
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,480
So why are you still here, My Lady?

166
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,410
I ran away.

167
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,830
Ran away?

168
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,570
It's a long story.

169
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,710
There is nowhere in the capital where your wanted poster isn't up.

170
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,210
 All the main and minor gates are blocked.

171
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,500
Gye Sang Mok's distillery is destroyed

172
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,630
and your house has already been searched.

173
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,000
We have prepared a ship, so come with us.

174
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,850
If you delay any longer, you won't be able to leave Hanyang altogether.

175
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,510
To where?

176
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,610
It's my first time leaving Hanyang.

177
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,800
My Lady, we are not going on a field trip.

178
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,790
Please go back to your home now.

179
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,760
I told you I ran away.

180
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,960
I do not have a home now.

181
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,810
Maiden Kang, let us go to Gaesong.

182
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,060
Do you not want to see Gaesong if we are on the run anyway?

183
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,270
I must deliver the news to Inspector Nam.

184
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,150
I think you better not.

185
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,930
They say if one does not report you knowing your crimes,

186
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,320
that person will be punished the same.

187
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
And he's an inspector.

188
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,750
We should be thankful that he is turning a blind eye on us.

189
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,250
Then, what about Woon Sim?

190
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,290
If we tell Woon Sim where we are going—

191
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,140
There is 100 nyang reward on your neck, My Lady.

192
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,870
Do not trust anyone...

193
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,440
and do not tell anyone. That is the best way to leave.

194
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,850
Maiden.

195
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,460
I think you better listen to them.

196
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,880
 Will you wait for me?

197
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,830
 Until I get everything in order

198
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,810
 and return?

199
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,580
How could this be possible?

200
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,150
We have a map and a structural plan.

201
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,250
How can we still say that the merchant did not do this?

202
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,860

Where are the map and the structural plan right now?

203
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,130
- Inspector Nam took them with the report to the King— 
 - Then...

204
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,360
where is that report?

205
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,150
With Inspector Nam...

206
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,430
Then where is Inspector Nam?

207
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,580
Well, Inspector Nam...

208
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,820
Goodness.

209
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,780
Missing work without permission. What in the world?

210
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,180
If he is so disgruntled, tell Inspector Nam to come see me in person.

211
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,550
Where did he go? He said he was leaving to submit the report.

212
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,580
He would never miss work without permission, though.

213
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,400
- No. 
 - Never.

214
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,660
Was he too shocked about his engagement being called off?

215
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
He actually looked happier, though.

216
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,040
Right?

217
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Something isn't right.

218
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,760
Eunuch Kim.

219
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,310
His Highness asks for Inspector Nam urgently.

220
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,650
We are also looking for that Inspector Nam.

221
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,840
Pardon?

222
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,620
Chief Inspector!

223
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,590
There is trouble!

224
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,420
Inspector Nam...

225
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,500
Move aside!

226
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,910
The crabs and crawfish must have bitten his face off.

227
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,540
It is difficult to identify the face.

228
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,010
His clothes and valuables have been stolen.

229
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,700

230
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,600

231
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,460
Inspector Nam!

232
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,770
Inspector Nam!

233
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,190
Inspector Nam!

234
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,310
Did you not say that you were visiting the grave of your father?

235
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,900
I thought you would return tomorrow.

236
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,310

The scene outside the palace seemed unusually suspicious,

237
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,810
so I returned earlier than planned.

238
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,520
The scene outside the palace seems suspicious?

239
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,820
The guards of the Prohibition Bureau are harassing noblewomen

240
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,860
on the grounds of finding a criminal.

241
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,200
Those men are no different from street thugs.

242
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,000
How could you assign them with matters of the nation?

243
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,760
So that was it?

244
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,370
The Prohibition Bureau is the problem.

245
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,590
Is that what Chief State Minister ordered you to say?

246
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,810
I am only speaking my mind.

247
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,490
This is why I keep my distance from you.

248
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,890
Leave now!

249
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,950
I feel suffocated sitting here with you.

250
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,280
- Your Majesty. 
 - Chief Royal Secretary.

251
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,270
What is it?

252
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,770
Inspector Nam's corpse has been discovered.

253
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,070
What do you mean, corpse?

254
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,300
Are you saying he is dead?

255
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,740

Will His Highness be able to succeed the throne safely,

256
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,980
 and secure his place on it?

257
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,390
 Are you using the Crown Prince

258
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,490
 to threaten me right now?

259
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,440
He threatened me in regards to the Crown Prince...

260
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,690
Is this what he meant?

261
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,400
Is he trying to kill the Crown Prince and all his people?

262
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,700
Your Majesty.

263
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,630
This time around!

264
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,560
I will not idly sit back and watch.

265
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,820
Your Majesty.

266
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,410
Please...

267
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,780
you must return to the Queen's Palace, Your Highness.

268
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,400
If you stay here, his illness will worsen.

269
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,790
Do not use the heart of the father who lost his child...

270
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,640
Chief Royal Secretary.

271
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,280
Summon the royal physician.

272
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,720
The Queen is not entirely wrong.

273
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,220
Making guards out of thugs

274
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,630
will only create a disorderly mob.

275
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,350
There is enough justification now.

276
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,100
First, hold them responsible for digging the tunnel

277
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,150
and reduce the budget and workforce of the Capital Defense Military.

278
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,170
Then, there will be enough budget to station armed soldiers

279
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,700
within the Prohibition Bureau.

280
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,410
Hurry.

281
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,930
I do not think my body will endure much longer.

282
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,260
When is it coming?

284
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,080
It's coming!

285
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,280
Where?

286
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
The boat's coming in!

287
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,330
Anyone getting on board, get ready.

288
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,660
Hey, hey, hey.

289
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,300
- Did you hear? 
 - Hear what?

290
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,760
- That inspector died. 
 - What? What inspector?

291
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,690
You know, that... you know...

292
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,280
The countryside inspector, who was set to marry the daughter of the Minister of Defense.

293
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,370
Aigoo.

294
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,740
I thought he had a bright future ahead of him.

295
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,350
This is how a person's fate changes overnight.

296
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,770
You're right.

297
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,300
- So you should all— 
 - Goodness!

298
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,880
What do you mean?

299
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,090
W-what?

300
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,190
You said the inspector died.

301
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,490
Is that true?

302
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,670
I, uh...

303
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,670
Never mind. Get on the boat first.

304
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,170
- I asked if that is true! 
 - My Lady!

305
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,830
K-Kang Ro Seo.

306
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,920
Here! Here is Kang Ro Seo!

307
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,300
What is the name of that inspector?

308
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,720
- Do you know the name of that inspector?
- My Lady!

309
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,460
- Mak San! 
 -M-Mom.

310
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,810
That inspector! What do you mean he died?

311
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,850
- My Lady. 
 - The inspector...

312
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,220
He's dead... The inspector...

313
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,410
Go!

314
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,640
Kang Ro Seo goes there!

315
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,650
What? Oh, yes.

316
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,850
W-who's Kang Ro Seo?

317
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,930
I-I am Kang Ro Seo!

318
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,170
Catch her!

319
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,960
Catch her!

320
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,390
Gosh.

321
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,390
Never mind.

322
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,940
Cover him.

323
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,830

324
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960

325
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,050
There is no way...

326
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,650
That cannot be true.

327
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,800
That's...

328
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,470
Right, Geum?

329
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,400
That isn't true, right?

330
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,200
The identification tag...

331
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,380
said it's Inspector Nam.

332
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,390
No.

333
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,530
No. Something has to be wrong.

334
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,740
I must go for myself and see.

335
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,020
Where do you think you're going?

336
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,460
Let me go!

337
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,280
- We must stop her. 
 - Maiden.

338
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,890
My Lady, no!

339
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,160
If you go, you will die, too.

340
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,110
He must be waiting for me.

341
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,870
He asked me to come and see him.

342
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,890
He asked me to come and see him...

343
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,530
What do I do?

344
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Let me go!

345
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,890
Let me go!

346
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,420
Look.

347
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,740
Look at this.

348
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,340
I made this.

349
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,020
Well made, right?

350
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,560
I actually...

351
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,480
wanted to give this to my daughter.

352
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm sure she would understand.

353
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,490
Here.

354
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,240
You must not come out of this space.

355
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,350
You!

356
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,050
You...

357
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,610
Do you recognize me?

358
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,960
Why have you locked me up in here?

359
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,540
I did not lock you up. I saved you.

360
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,250
Young Master!

361
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,420
C-Choon Gae.

362
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,750
- Choon Gae. 
 - Young Master!

363
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,360
Aigoo. I thought you had died.

364
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,640
Oh, aigoo...

365
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,130
Are you all right?

366
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,760
 They will think you are dead.

367
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,690
It will be tricky if there is no corpse,

368
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,370
so I have made the necessary preparations.

369
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,260
It will earn you some time.

370
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,280
Earn some time?

371
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,310
For you to find Lady Kang.

372
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,500
The wanted posters with her face on them are all over the streets.

373
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,970
She is known as the ring leader of the alcohol smuggling group

374
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,970
and there is a 100-nyang reward for her.

375
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,900
How could that be...

376
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,390
Where is she now?

377
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,680
No one is able to find her just yet.

378
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,420
Perhaps she is somewhere safe.

379
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,870
If she has not left Hanyang yet,

380
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,970
she must have heard the news of your death about now.

381
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,030
Are you not looking forward to it?

382
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,100
What would Lady Kang do now that she heard that you are dead?

383
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,500
You...

384
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,400
What are your true intentions?

385
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,050
True intentions?

386
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,820
How sad to hear you say that.

387
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,160
I am on Lady Kang's side.

388
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,500
So please find her first for me.

389
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,680
Make sure she's not hurt at all. Not even a hair on her body.

390
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,500
Get off.

391
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,500
Come here.

392
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,440
This way.

393
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,130
What is this?

394
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,070
I think I've been here before.

395
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I think I've seen this face before, too.

396
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,230
Let's go!

397
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,610
Right?

398
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,450
We've met before, right?

399
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,890
I think I'm right.

400
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,760
Ow, that's hot!

401
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,300
- Your Highness, I will do it. 
 - No, no.

402
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,760
It's all right.

403
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,590
Please taste this.

404
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,150
I have grilled it myself.

405
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,190
Here.

406
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,250
What is so exciting that you would grill meat?

407
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,600
The dead is dead.

408
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,230
The living must live.

409
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,050
This is why when Hyungnim passed away,

410
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:38,380
people said you were excited and grilled meat.

411
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,870
Then...

412
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,420
what am I supposed to do?

413
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,300
I was worried that you might stop eating

414
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,380
and follow after Crown Prince Sunghyun.

415
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,710
If that happened,

416
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,800
how would I go on as your mother?

417
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,710
Nam Young is dead.

418
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,280
I do not even know

419
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,290
what happened to that girl or where she is.

420
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,950
But I...

421
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,680
as the Crown Prince of this nation...

422
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,370
I am trapped in here, unable to do anything.

423
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,710
What did I do to deserve eating meat?

424
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,100
Your Highness.

425
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,290

426
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,020
Chief Inspector, yes?

427
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,940
You are as handsome as they say.

428
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,340
And you are so manly.

429
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,740
Me?

430
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,640
This way, please.

431
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,010
Let me go.

432
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,680
Hold on.

433
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,260
W-what...

434
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,500
Officer Hwang, let us leave.

435
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,820
Yes.

436
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,810
Inspector Nam!

437
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,080
How could this be...

438
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,870
You died...

439
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,410
Y-you...

440
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,810
You are alive!

441
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,690
I must ask you both

442
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,910
to help me.

443
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,270
His Majesty is distraught about the recent events.

444
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,450
Yes. That is understandable.

445
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,290
I noticed you had not yet submitted the Princess Consort candidate list.

446
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,860
Have you changed your mind?

447
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,210
Goodness. N-not at all.

448
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,960
I will submit it. Certainly.

449
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,950
If everything goes as planned,

450
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,600
your daughter will become the Princess Consort.

451
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,320
As planned...

452
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,290
As long as everything goes as planned.

453
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,420
Is there something you are concerned about?

454
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,660
Pardon?

455
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:14,590
Well, unfortunate events keep occurring.

456
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,670
I just wonder how the world is going to turn out.

457
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,840
Anyhow,

458
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,540
how is it going with capturing that ringleader of the alcohol smugglers?

459
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,680
Oh, yes. We are working hard to find her.

460
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,430
It is a mystery where she disappeared to.

461
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,510
Just wait until we find you.

462
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,360
My Lady, you are standing out too much. We have to be natural.

463
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,300
She has back pains.

464
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,070
There is no doubt about it. They are soldiers from the Ministry of Defense.

465
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,680
They are lifting all the girls with cover skirts over their heads.

466
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,030
There is no way for us to get in, My Lady.

467
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,020
It doesn't matter if there is a way or not.

468
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,420
I will go in even if I have to climb the wall.

469
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,120
All of you, go ahead and leave.

470
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,450
I will manage on my own.

471
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:39,260
- I will come with you. 
- I can't leave without you either, My Lady.

472
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,690
I didn't want to leave until I caught him anyway.

473
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,920
You are all going to go into the capital?

474
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,220
Maiden Han, you should go home.

475
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,060
I don't want to. I told you I ran away.

476
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,730
Do you think this is a joke?

477
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,030
If someone like you is with us,

478
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,850
what will they think of us?

479
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,040
That's right.

480
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,000
We could all be in trouble.

481
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,970
Trouble?

482
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,350
Now that I think about it,

483
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,200
Maiden, you are the daughter of the Minister of Defense.

484
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,880
So?

485
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,950
I am the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers.

486
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,880
The daughter of the Minister of Defense

487
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,610
and the ringleader of alcohol smugglers.

488
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,140
What?

489
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,800
 We do not know what she will do.

490
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,510
What do you mean by that?

491
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,240
Just as I said, we do not know what she will do.

492
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,560
She is the most reckless in Joseon.

493
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,400
We must capture her before she does anything.

494
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,250
Before the Ministry of Defense, the Prohibition Bureau, and Merchant Sim catch her.

495
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,850
Are you asking us to forge the Ministry of Defense pass

496
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,300
and help someone who smuggles alcohol into the capital?

497
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,400
They say anyone who hides the criminal or does not report her intentionally

498
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,100
will be punished just the same.

499
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,290
We have Han Ae Jin, the daughter of the Minister of Defense!

500
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,430
The moment you move a finger,

501
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,830
we will take that as a sign to kill his daughter.

502
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,490

503
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,030
- It's Kang Ro Seo! 
 - Kang Ro Seo.

504
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,130
 Kang Ro Seo.

505
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,620
 Kang Ro Seo?

506
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,080
Whoa, whoa, you just moved.

507
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,630
If I die, I will tell Father it was because of you.

508
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,040
Stay put.

509
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,740
You are not acting like a kidnapped person at all.

510
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,180
Just cry. Cry.

511
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,740
Over there! You!

512
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,870
You moved.

513
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,150
Come here.

514
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,400
Put two hands high in the air and walk this way slowly.

515
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,520
Slowly. Up to here.

516
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:54,900
Wait, wait.

517
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,700
Wait.

518
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,780
What are you doing?

519
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,830
I found it.

520
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,510
Send this to Father.

521
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,870
I'm finished.

522
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,110

523
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,350
Now return to your place.

524
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,690
Go!

525
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:26,990
Do not move.

526
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,340
No one move!

527
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,580
- Don't move! 
 - No one move.

528
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,830
Don't move! Back off.

529
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,270
Come on.

530
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,720
You!

531
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,440
Don't move.

532
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,000
Stay still.

533
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,560
Minister of Defense!

534
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,500
Minister of Defense.

535
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,010
 Lady Ae Jin was...

536
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,910
 What about Ae Jin?

537
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,420
Where is she now?

538
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,740
She was kidnapped by Kang Ro Seo.

539
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,020
She was what?

540
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,580
 This is a letter Her Ladyship asked to deliver to you.

541
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,710
 Father.

542
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:21,950
 I have been captured by the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers.

543
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,640
 These people are insane.

544
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,950
 There are hundreds of viscous individuals,

545
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,740
 and they are armed with hundreds of guns and explosives.

546
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,260
 There will be sever consequences if you do not take them seriously.

547
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,390
 They may hurt me if the Ministry of Defense even attempts to arrest them,

548
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,480
 so you must never, never take any action.

549
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,120
 And...

550
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,720
 please do not think to make me into a Princess Consort.

551
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,500
 Sincerely, Ae Jin.

552
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,570
Aigoo.

553
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,940
Aigoo, Ae Jin.

554
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,100
 Aigoo, aigoo.

555
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,890
You are all working so hard for my brother.

556
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,690
I cannot stand to sit back and watch.

557
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,290
Come on and eat.

558
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,350
You over there, come and eat.

559
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,750
It is all right.

560
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,630
Guard your places.

561
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,070
All right then...

562
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,190
I suppose there is nothing to be done.

563
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:40,890
I personally made this fruit salad and brought it all the way to the Eastern Palace.

564
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,630
Mere guards looked down on me

565
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,590
and did not even touch my food...

566
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:50,920
I suppose His Majesty...

567
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,410
will hear of this...

568
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,420
We are honored to eat them.

569
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,970
Why did you not say so earlier?

570
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,210
Eat up, all of you.

571
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,940
Enjoy, everyone.

572
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,120
Your Highness!

573
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,390
What...

574
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,220
I heard the daughter of the Minister of Defense was kidnapped.

575
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,910
One shout from them, and the soldiers couldn't do anything!

576
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,810
Aigoo.

577
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,080
- Eat up. 
 - Thank you.

578
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,450
I hear they have the power to control space and time.

579
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,830
Aigoo, that's nonsense.

580
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,360
They're not Hong Gil Dong*. 
(A heroic fictional Korean character)

581
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,760
But if her face is on the wanted poster,

582
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,630
she should have run away from the capital.

583
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,780
Why did she come back inside?

584
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,350
That's true.

585
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,090
Why did she come inside?

586
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,650
Oh, welcome!

587
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,260
Aigoo, welcome.

588
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,180
The talk of the Minister of Defense's daughter being kidnapped by the ringleader of the alcohol smugglers

589
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,410
is stirring everyone up in the streets.

590
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,060
Why did Maiden Ro Seo and Ae Jin have to be together?

591
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,910
They are the worst pair.

592
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,860
You did say there was no way of knowing what she would do, but...

593
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,740
Kidnapping the daughter of the Minister...

594
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,960
There is no going back from this.

595
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,990
Are we doomed?

596
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,990
We must hurry.

597
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,380
Before she causes a bigger mess.

598
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,260
Will it really be all right?

599
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,770
Don't worry.

600
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,130
I have the Doyenne and Mak San with me.

601
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,670
The soldiers won't be able to make any moves because of Maiden Ae Jin,

602
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,050
but Sim Heon will certainly show up.

603
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,700
He must have heard about us since we caused all that commotion getting into the capital.

604
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,840
That is why we followed you.

605
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,070
He will certainly show up.

606
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:18,630
Just you wait. I'll make a bullet hole in his forehead.

607
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,520
So...

608
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,710
what about me?

609
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,220
What should I do?

610
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,950
Maiden...

611
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,320
you can just stay put.

612
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,910
I want to do it, too. I can cause a distraction.

613
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,400
We may have lost the money, but now we have the tunnel as our justification.

614
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,530
And now that Inspector Nam is dead, all we have to do is capture Kang Ro Seo.

615
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,820
Capture Kang Ro Seo and bring her to me. Then...

616
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:18,470
once the Prohibition Bureau becomes a military camp,

617
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,970
you shall earn a position there.

618
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,950
Yes, sir.

619
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,310
The preparations are finished, Minister.

620
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,200
All right. Let us depart.

621
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,490
Yes, sir.

622
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,300
- Depart! 
 -  Yes, sir!

623
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:58,630
I don't think this is right.

624
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:01,550
Come on, do not worry.

625
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,780
All you have to do is take me to Gaesong after all this is over.

626
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,900
Gaesong? Why Gaesong?

627
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,750
Do not ask further.

628
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,260
What about you, My Lady?

629
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,140
What will you do now?

630
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:19,350
I can't trust the rumors until I see for myself.

631
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,970
I must go to the Office of Inspector General.

632
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,400
Aigoo! Aigoo, Young Master!

633
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,300
How can you leave me like this?

634
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,780
Aigoo.

635
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,330
Aigoo.

636
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,080
Aigoo, Young Master.

637
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,530
Aigoo.

638
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,000
There's Kang Ro Seo!

639
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,900
- Capture her! 
 - Yes, sir!

640
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,710
- Aigoo! 
 - Stop right there!

641
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,600
Aigoo.

642
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:24,830
Aigoo.

643
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,330
Aigoo...

644
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,700
 Catch her!

645
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,280
 Stop right there!

646
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,560
 Stop right there!

647
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,870
What's going on?

648
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,930
What's the commotion?

649
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,390
 - Move aside! 
 - Stop her!

650
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,750
Kang Ro Seo!

651
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,230
Catch her!

652
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,770
Stop her!

653
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,140
 Stop right there!

654
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,540
 Stop right there!

655
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,700
Stop her!

656
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,100
Stop right there!

657
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,350
 Stop right there!

658
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,140
Let her go.

659
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,080
Before I cut your arm off.

660
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,810
Get behind me.

661
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,670
Goodness!

662
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,070
Officer Hwang?

663
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,560
 Stop right there!

664
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,020
 Move aside!

665
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,800
 Stop right there!

666
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,250
 Stop right there!

667
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,120
I told no one to come inside!

668
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:17,400
G-goodness, Inspector N-Nam!

669
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,870
What...

670
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,760
Y-you are not dead?

671
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,570
There is something more shocking

672
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,800
than the dead rising from his grave.

673
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,240
W-what are you talking about?

674
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,630
The one who stole the military seal

675
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,450
is Maiden Ae Jin.

676
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:33,840
W-what...

677
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,660
What did you say?

678
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,330
If you think back on it, there must have been clues.

679
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,950
Did she ever suddenly visit the Ministry of Defense?

680
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,520
 Aigoo, how wonderful!

681
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,350
 - Oh, my! 
 - No, it's okay.

682
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,770
Could she...

683
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,980
If this knowledge gets out, no noble family will agree

684
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,130
to a marriage with Maiden Ae Jin, much less become a Princess Consort.

685
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,900
If you do as I say,

686
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,070
I shall bring Maiden Ae Jin safely back home

687
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,390
and convince her so that she wants to become

688
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,010
the Princess Consort.

689
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,010
Not that one.

690
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,100
This one.

691
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:36,620
Aigoo, Young Master.

692
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,580
- There's Kang Ro Seo! 
 - Capture her!

693
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,410
 - Yes, Sir!  
 - Stop right there!

694
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,330
That way!

695
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,320
 Stop right there!

696
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,290
Minister of Defense.

697
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,030
What has happened?

698
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,760
We pretended to chase her for a while, then gave up.

699
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,600
That is enough.

700
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,220
Tell everyone to withdraw.

701
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:11,400
How dare you touch a lady!

702
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,310
Maiden Ae Jin?

703
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,620
Young Master Lee Chui Joong?

704
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,270
Your Highness.

705
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,820
Your H...

706
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,590
Geez.

707
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,610
- Move! 
 - Your Highness!

708
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,330
Move aside!  What are you all doing?

709
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,070
S***.

710
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,860
Do they think they're the only ones who can climb rooftops?

711
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,100
Hey!

712
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,700
You can't do this? You can't?

713
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,310
You can't do this?

714
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:29,700
♫  I fill the world with the shining stars up above  ♫

715
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:35,800
♫  I wanna be your star  ♫

716
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,530
♫  Your footsteps fade  ♫

717
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,350
 Your Highness!

718
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,010
♫  I'm running, fly  ♫

719
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,260
Aigoo, aigoo.

720
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,670
Young Master!

721
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,890
How could you go before me?

722
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,050
Young Master!

723
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:00,650
Aigoo... aigoo...

724
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,800
I heard the inspector died.

725
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,880
I hear he even won the state exam.

726
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,820
Then why did he die?

727
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:16,110
Aigoo, Young Master.

728
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,970
Young Master.

729
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,850
Aigoo... Young Master...

730
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,610
 Goodness!

731
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,140
Aigoo, Young Master!

732
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:50,160
How resentful your soul must be, not being able to pass in peace, Young Master...

733
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,760
Aigoo! Young Master!

734
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,000
How resentful you must be!

735
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,590
Aigoo, Young Master!

736
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,330
How resentful you must be that you can't go in peace...

737
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,400
Aigoo, Young Master!

738
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,490
I caught you.

739
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,730
Aigoo, Young Master!

740
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,570
Will you leave me like this?

741
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,130
Aigoo, Young Master!

742
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,390
Aigoo.

743
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:51,390
Aigoo.

744
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,860
Aigoo.

745
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:01,200
Aigoo.

746
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,920
Aigoo.

747
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,820
Aigoo.

748
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,580
Young Master. Aigoo...

749
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,340
Aigoo. Aigoo.

750
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:21,930
Young Master, how can you go before me?

751
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,990
Aigoo.

752
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:28,020
Aigoo.

753
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,330
Aigoo.

754
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,000
Aigoo, Young Master!

755
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,180
How resentful your soul must be, not being able to pass in peace, Young Master...

756
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,810
Aigoo, Young Master!

757
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:15,330

758
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,980
I caught you.

759
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,410
♫  I cannot explain this  ♫

760
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:35,700
♫  You held my trembling hand without a word  ♫

761
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:41,320
♫  You excited my meaningless life  ♫

762
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:50,460
♫  You approached me while making my heart flutter  ♫

763
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:56,260
♫  My heart is searching for you  ♫

764
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:03,920
♫  Your world is coloring my heart  ♫

765
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,110
♫  I say, who you are  ♫

766
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,010

767
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,350
 It is Maiden Ro Seo's.

768
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,300
 She said something about it belonging to her father.

769
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,610
 He seemed somewhat uncomfortable with me.

770
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:18,190
 We cannot sit idle at times like this.

771
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,630
 Aren't my lips too red?

772
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,290
 It means you should make your mark on him with those red lips.

773
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:26,140
 Her Ladyship cannot live an ordinary noble life.

774
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,390
 Young Master, you know that better than anyone.

775
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,290
 You will have to give up everything.

776
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,810
 Family.

777
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,110
 Honor.

778
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,490
 And even your life.

779
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:38,350
 Why do you not come home?

780
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:40,230
 As though you are avoiding me.

781
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:43,060
 Come to the Underwater Palace with me and drink this sweet crimson liquor.

782
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:46,150
 I shall make you a woman of extremely high status.

783
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:47,760
 Forgive me.

784
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,650
 Do not go to the Underwater Palace.

785
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,098
♫  You shined the light upon me  ♫
