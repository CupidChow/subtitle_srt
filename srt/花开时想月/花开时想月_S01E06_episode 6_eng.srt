1
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,900
Aigoo, aigoo.

2
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,570
D*** it...

3
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,780

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,760
This way.

5
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,300
This is the kitchen.

6
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,000
The kitchen?

7
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,570
It has been neglected for years after a crackdown.

8
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,450
So I took over.

9
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,510
The king is past fifty and grows weaker by day.

10
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,490
And the Crown Prince is a known drinker.

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,250
It means there are only a few years left until the prohibition is lifted.

12
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,560
Then...

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,450
what do you think the biggest business in Hanyang would be?

14
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,580
Alcohol business.

15
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,400
This will be the largest kitchen in Seogang.

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,100
Imagine it.

17
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,500
Imagine this place filled with customers.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Coming through.

19
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,300
What do you think?

20
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,610
Do you think that is possible?

21
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,650
Wrong.

22
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,970
You do not question such a matter.

23
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,720
You desire it.

24
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,310

25
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,070
If I win, you must pay respect to me as the teacher

26
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,500
and receive the lesson.

27
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,130
Would that be all?

28
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,480
If you truly bring me to my knees,

29
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,750
I shall call you 'hyungnim.'

30
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,580
You cannot go back on your words.

31
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Your sword skill has improved.

32
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,670
I am a quick learner in pretty much anything.

33
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,470
How long will you continue to dodge me?

34
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,020
I-is this...

35
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,840
wooden swordsmanship?

36
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,270
I never said that I would strike you with my sword.

37
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,210
What is this?

38
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,300
I never said I would make you kneel with a sword, brother.

39
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,380
Inspector Nam wins.

40
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,350
Nonsense.

41
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,170
How can he not remember?

42
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,190
You must show respect to your hyungnim before you ask.

43
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,860
We are good brothers. We treat each other without unnecessary propriety.

44
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,390
What? Why? You're staring at me without any propriety, do you know that?

45
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,610
So?

46
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,170
Will you not answer your younger brother?

47
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,630
There is an illness called blackout or oblivion when one suffers from melancholy.

48
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,080
It is also called dementia.

49
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,030
It is one's own brain erasing a horrible memory.

50
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,150
Is there such a comfortable illness?

51
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,930
It is an illness that surfaces because one's heart is not comfortable.

52
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,110
It is not an illness but a blessing.

53
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,490
If memory does nothing but torment you,

54
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,880
it is much better to forget it.

55
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,390
If you do not learn, you do not progress.

56
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,070
And if you do not progress, there is no end.

57
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,610
If there is no end, how could the torment end?

58
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,090
In this world,

59
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,290
there are such endings.

60
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,670
Things that are endless and undecipherable

61
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,320
but you must cover up and pretend not to know.

62
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,910
What does that mean?

63
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,580
There is no need to pay the debt?

64
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,320
Remember when Gye Sang Mok went missing?

65
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,850
He must have lost the promissory note then.

66
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,730
And he must have hurt his head pretty badly. He lost his memory.

67
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,550
I'm sure he doesn't remember his business with us, either.

68
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,290
How do you know that?

69
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,820
I overheard it on the market streets.

70
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,680
So you need not worry anymore.

71
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,990
Is that so?

72
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,830
Come forth.

73
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,380
Who...

74
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,680
Aigoo!

75
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,240
Master Sir!

76
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,600
Why did he have to rent at a place like this?

77
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,260
We apologize. There is not much for us to offer you.

78
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,630
That is all right.

79
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,300
It is my fault for visiting unannounced.

80
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,050
Father!

81
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,130
Young.

82
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,310
Father, what brings you to visit here without a word?

83
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,460
I heard from my cousin's son, Seo Jong, that the King appointed you as the Crown Prince's tutor.

84
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,980
You did not even have time to send a letter?

85
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,480
Forgive me.

86
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,430
I meant to find someone to send word.

87
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,330
Is everything going smoothly?

88
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,350
I hear the Crown Prince is someone who would ruin this country.

89
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,880
Well, he hasn't ruined the country just yet.

90
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,070
Yes.

91
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,430
Father, this is the owner of this place, Young Master Kang and his sister.

92
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,170
I have already met them.

93
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,670
Although it is improper to greet the kitchen maiden face to face.

94
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,100
We need to go somewhere together. Make preparations.

95
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,770
We are going to visit the Minister of Defense.

96
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,660
The M-minister of Defense?

97
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,730
They have sent us a marriage offer.

98
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,990
A marriage offer?

99
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,820
He asks to see the face of his future son-in-law.

100
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,800
A marriage offer? From the Minister of Defense?

101
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,780
Yes.

102
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,700
It is fresh news.

103
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,860
And I hear Chief State Minister arranged it.

104
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,730
Well, well.

105
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,460
Uncle will have a fit when he hears this.

106
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,430
I must go out for a moment.

107
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,410
Whoa. Where are you going, Your Highness?

108
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,560
I shall not let you go today.

109
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
If you want to drink,

110
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,480
I shall get it for you somehow, so please drink it here. Right here.

111
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,690
I do not want to drink.

112
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,500
I want to see someone.

113
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,680
After reading your appeal to the King,

114
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,250
I realized how gutsy you are, Inspector Nam.

115
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,250
I was not being gutsy. It was foolishness.

116
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:19,250
It is better to have vigor than not to have it.

117
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,540
Is that not so, Minister?

118
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,290
Oh, yes. Certainly.

119
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,620
He only knows how to read.

120
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,830
He is a child who does not know the ways of this world.

121
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,860
I ask Your Excellencies to teach him much.

122
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,860
I hear you had your first lecture with the Crown Prince today.

123
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,980
How did that go?

124
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,980
 They have sent us a marriage offer.

125
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,980
He asked you a question.

126
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,140
Oh, yes. He followed along better than I had expected.

127
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,300
That is good news.

128
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,760
You wrote that one must rectify what is not right.

129
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,650
So I hope that you can guide His Highness well

130
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,610
so that he can follow the right path.

131
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,320
Yes, Your Excellency.

132
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,080
 They have sent us a marriage offer.

133
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,850
That feels great.

134
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,990
It would be better if this were alcohol instead of water.

135
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,380
What are you doing here, Jade Lad?

136
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,360
I heard a rumor.

137
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,300
I hear Inspector Nam is to marry the Minister of Defense's daughter.

138
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,910
 Rice cakes for sale!

139
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,960
These are all side dishes for alcohol.

140
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,180
Takju would go well with mung bean pancakes.

141
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,360
Are you not making liquor anymore?

142
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,750
Well, we shall see.

143
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,600
I like the liquor that you make.

144
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,720
It tastes friendly.

145
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,530
I thought you would like something extravagant like soju.

146
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,450
Of course, I do like soju.

147
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,470
Soju is best when trying to forget all the matters of the world.

148
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,990
Just one or two shots make you feel light-headed.

149
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,170
But drinking with a friend

150
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,270
made me think that it was a shame to get drunk so quickly.

151
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,700
For the first time.

152
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,840
Friend?

153
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,000
You. My drinking friend.

154
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,380
Once the prohibition is lifted, I shall become your drinking friend for real.

155
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,690
The prohibition will not last hundreds and millions of years.

156
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,540
Well then. It is a shame that we must postpone drinking to another time.

157
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,020
Choose what you want.

158
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,720
I shall buy it all for you, even if it means I must untie my gat* strap.
(Traditional Korean hat for men)

159
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,660
How about this one?

160
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,570
- Good, good.
- Good?

161
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,350
What do you mean to stay here?

162
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,880
He asks us so earnestly. It was difficult to refuse.

163
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,220
It is not unusual for guests to dwell at the house of such a distinguished family.

164
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,560
I am an inspector at the Office of Inspector General.

165
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,930
It could look as if I am being bribed.

166
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,240
How blind you are.

167
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,660
Will you be an inspector all your life?

168
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,810
Once the marriage with the Minister's daughter is set, you will soon move up the ranks.

169
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,230
I shall send someone to get your belongings from the place you are staying at.

170
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,170
So be it.

171
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,790
Do you mean t-today?

172
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,320
If you become involved with a household like that and a bad rumor circulates,

173
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,400
it would not be good for your future.

174
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,740
I shall set the marriage date as soon as possible.

175
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,890
Don't get any ideas and behave well.

176
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,780
My Lady!

177
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,660
How is he? Did you see him?

178
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,790
Congratulations, My Lady.

179
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,260
He is very handsome, like a well-sculpted chestnut.

180
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,500
A carved chestnut is still a chestnut.

181
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,090
This won't do. I must see him for myself.

182
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,340
Aigoo, My Lady!

183
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,680
My Lady!

184
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,800
That man is...

185
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,360
What in the world. He's someone else's chestnut.

186
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,090
Where did it go? I definitely put it here.

187
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,050
Cheon Geum!

188
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,290
Cheon Geum!

189
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,070
 My Lady!

190
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,090
Geez!

191
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,050
Oh, no.

192
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,460
You!

193
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,640
Who is the female physician who went to Chief State Minister's banquet on Buddha's Birthday?

194
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,550
- Come out! 
- Who is it?

195
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,570
What do I do?

196
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,780
Geez.

197
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,060
You.

198
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,410
What did you do after the banquet?

199
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,030
We went to play with lanterns.

200
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,800
Who was it? Raise your hands.

201
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,570
Raise them properly.

202
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,730
Higher, higher. Darn it.

203
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,800
Huh?

204
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,290
Huh?

205
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,360
What about you?

206
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,970
I, um...

207
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,540
I also went to play with lanterns.

208
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,010
Yeah.

209
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,780
It was Buddha's Birthday. Of course, I did.

210
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,140
With whom?

211
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,790
With whom...

212
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,920
Well, that's...

213
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,060
Well, that's...

214
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,110
So, I...

215
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,410
She was with me flying lanterns.

216
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,550
What?

217
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,570
Then who was the female physician who was with me?

218
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,530
Aigoo.

219
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,030
Hey, listen up.

220
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,060
Thank you a little bit for lying,

221
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,630
but I'm out of your league for a slave like you to desire.

222
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,840
When did I desire you?

223
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,120
You and I are both servants.

224
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,750
We're different. We're completely different.

225
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,220
You are just a personal slave, and I'm a worker at a district office.

226
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,220
I will become a mistress for a noble family to set my life straight.

227
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,680
Got that?

228
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,730
A mistress?

229
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,780
Geez.

230
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,680
Choon Gae, you're so cute.

231
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,340
Cute?

232
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,740
Good for you.

233
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,140
Good times.

234
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,830
So annoying.

235
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,240
Geez.

236
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,820
Wait.

237
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,010
Who are you?

238
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,290
Ae Jin of House Han.

239
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,650
Of the Minister of Defense?

240
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,620
Yes.

241
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,100
What...

242
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,050
What impertinence.

243
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,980
There may be talks of marriage,

244
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,520
but we have not even sent you official documents.

245
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,920
But how could you stop a man

246
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,200
so rudely in the middle of the market street?

247
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,730
Have you not learned about the line between a man and a woman?

248
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:37,820
I do not think you should say that as someone who held a woman's hand in the market streets.

249
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,670
Um... what are you talking about?

250
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,550
What is there between you and Maiden Kang?

251
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,070
Is she your lover?

252
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,990
Stop talking nonsense.

253
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,110
I am asking if you love her.

254
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,270
Why would you ask me that?

255
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,830
I am asking my future husband if you love another woman.

256
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,680
Do I not have the right?

257
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,760
Why do you keep connecting me to her?

258
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,500
Maiden Ro Seo and I are...

259
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,150
What do you think of this one?

260
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,740
I can buy it all for you.

261
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,860
There's nothing... between...

262
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,300
Is that the Minister of Defense's daughter in talks of marriage with him?

263
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,690
I think we will get in their way.

264
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,130
We should go.

265
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
W-what's between those two?

266
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,130
They're holding hands?

267
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,540
What's between them?

268
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,200
Why do you keep asking me?

269
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,310
Then who else would I ask?

270
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,470
Don't you think they look good together?

271
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,330
Unbelievable.

272
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,890
Gosh. They're too close.

273
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,220
My.

274
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,210
Maiden Kang, we meet here again.

275
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,300
So...

276
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,490
It seems you all know each other.

277
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,050
You must introduce me.

278
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,030
Introduce me.

279
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,090
So...

280
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,980
- This is— 
 - What is the point of introductions?

281
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,410
Maiden Han and I have had a few exchanges

282
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,540
and the two of you already seem close.

283
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,350
Close to whom?

284
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,420
We just met.

285
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,310
And there is nothing between Inspector Nam and me that is worth explaining.

286
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,580
I see.

287
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,500
Then I suppose there is something between you and the Horse Thief worth explaining.

288
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,880
He's my friend.

289
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,220
- Friend? 
 - Friend?

290
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,600
He is your friend?

291
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,500
How could a man and a woman be friends?

292
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,810
I agree. There is a line between a man and a woman.

293
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,050
As expected.

294
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,780
It must be because you are soon to be man and wife.

295
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,140
Your values are also similar.

296
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,620
Man and wife...

297
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,840
Man and wife?

298
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,040
We have not even exchanged marriage documents.

299
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,680
Please do not misinterpret things.

300
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,140
Haven't we met before?

301
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,280
Do you remember?

302
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,650
A beautiful face like yours is hard to forget.

303
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,360
I'm Ae Jin of House Han.

304
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,300
Do tell me your name, Young Master.

305
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,620
Me?

306
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,710
I'm no one important.

307
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,370
Not important?

308
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,610
But you have such an important face.

309
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,730
Just say anything.

310
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,160
Chui Joong of House Lee.

311
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm from Gaeseong.

312
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,560
Gaeseong?

313
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,950
I have always wanted to go there.

314
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,440
What about marriage? Are you married?

315
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,000
Surname Lee...

316
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,210
What family are you from?

317
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,170
Oh, where in Hanyang are you staying?

318
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,730
Nam Young, how lucky you are.

319
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,360
To gain such a pretty and cheerful wife.

320
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,330
- Is that not so, Maiden? 
 - Oh, yes.

321
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,290
You look very good together.

322
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,250
You two are a match made in heaven.

323
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,810
H-heaven...

324
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,990
Geez.

325
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,750
If I was able to remember by seeing her face,

326
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,130
I would've remembered when I saw that annoying bastard Merchant Sim's face.

327
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,700
He looks like a cucumber stuck in fermented soybean paste.

328
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,250
Hyungnim.

329
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,280
You lost your memories because you banged your head.

330
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,060
So wouldn't they come back if you banged your head again?

331
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,010
Are you saying I should crack open my head again?

332
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,050
You think so?

333
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,590
There is such a thing as shock therapy.

334
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,780
Well.

335
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,990
Hyungnim.

336
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,250
Yeah. Hit me with this.

337
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,880
With this?

338
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,140
I'll close my eyes.

339
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,540
So hit me unexpectedly without telling me. Make sure you do it right.

340
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,450
Don't make me go through it two or three times. Got it?

341
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,590
Got it.

342
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,650
Whoosh!

343
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,990
All right!

344
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,120
Hyungnim! You opened your eyes, didn't you?

345
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,270
Punk, I have good reflexes.

346
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,780
Fine. I'll do it properly this time.

347
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,540
I'll do it.

348
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,020
You have to commit to it this time, Hyungnim.

349
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,300
All right.

350
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,300
Aigoo!

351
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,560
Aigoo, Hyungnim!

352
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,590
How dare you!

353
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,750
She is a woman of a noble family. What is the meaning of this?

354
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,200
- Aigoo, are you all right, Hyungnim?
- Hyungnim!

355
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,000
Hyungnim!

356
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,650
There is no need for this.

357
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,250
He says he does not remember anyway.

358
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,170
It seems this happened because your leg isn't well.

359
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,020
If you just return my ribbon, I shall let it slide.

360
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,530
He is nowhere to be found even if we search for him.

361
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,780
It's certain something has happened to him.

362
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,530
I should not have let him go to Hanyang alone.

363
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,880
It was a goblin for sure.

364
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,740
No way, a goblin?

365
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
Did you eat something wrong?

366
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,290
I'm telling you it's true.

367
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,280
I came out here to get water at night.

368
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,560
A goblin this tall had blood all over it

369
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,360
and it came out of the mountains over there.

370
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,870
Mom, Mom, Mom. There's blood.

371
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,090
Mom.

372
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,910
Come on, Cheon Geum.

373
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,140
Cheon Geum.

374
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,310
Come on, Cheon Geum.

375
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,860
I'm here.

376
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,220
I found it!

377
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,280
Cheon Geum.

378
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300

379
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,550
Your Excellency.

380
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,650
Nothing has changed here.

381
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,330
It is just as it was 20 years ago.

382
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,050
I heard you were looking for me, Left State Minister.

383
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:42,240
I hear Grand Prince Neungsan's servant is exceptionally bright.

384
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,520
They say you remember everything you read and can recite them by heart.

385
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,840
It is a useless talent.

386
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,930
I hear you also...

387
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,910
write his letters for him.

388
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,150
Your handwriting...

389
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,640
looked exactly the same as Grand Prince Neungsan's.

390
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,140
Write down what I say.

391
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,150
Right State Minister said that

392
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,170
the current king was born from a concubine,

393
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,320
thus he is less legitimate than King Seongjong's son,

394
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,920
Grand Prince Neungsan.

395
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,870
So Grand Prince Neungsan must be supported as the king even now

396
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,970
to correct the ways of the world.

397
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,490
Are you saying...

398
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,100
Grand Prince Neungsan schemed treason?

399
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,820
This is...

400
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,620
the letter that Grand Prince Neungsan sent to Right State Minister.

401
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,140

402
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,190

403
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,550
How could Grand Prince Neungsan...

404
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,470
 Lee Shi Heum shall be lifted from the low-class status and appointed as a public official.

405
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,900
 The land and servants confiscated from Grand Prince Neungsan

406
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,130
 shall be awarded to Lee Shi Heum.

407
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,600
You have changed quite a lot.

408
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,260
It is all thanks to you, Your Excellency.

409
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,100
You killed your own master

410
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,100
and changed your fate.

411
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:58,300
So it would not be so difficult to replace your master again.

412
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,600
Is that not so?

413
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,700
I hear you told the Minister of Defense to take Inspector Nam as his son-in-law.

414
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,580
Did you promise him the position of the Left State Minister?

415
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,390
It is merely a match between

416
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,960
a well-suited man and woman.

417
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,140
Do not try to hide it.

418
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,400
Are you not planning to use him as a dog to rip apart the Crown Prince?

419
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
Is this what you did to Crown Prince Sunghyun?

420
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,050
What are you talking about?

421
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,930
You planted eyes and ears in the Eastern Palace

422
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,630
to observe Crown Prince Sunghyun.

423
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,810
You must truly think that I did not know that.

424
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,680
You will not have your way this time.

425
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,790
I shall...

426
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,860
protect Crown Prince with my life.

427
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,860
It's fine.

428
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,440
We were meant to go different paths anyway.

429
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,480
It's for the better.

430
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,050
Brother?

431
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,810
Ro Seo.

432
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,440
My Lady.

433
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,250
The wind is getting in.

434
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,620
Close the door.

435
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,570
Geez.

436
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,710
Why are you doing this?

437
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,910
What have you done with my son?

438
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,120
Whom are you talking about?

439
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,060
He looks exactly like him.

440
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,900
They're twins.

441
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,570
 He must be connected to the mokbingo case.

442
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,140
You know his face.

443
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,250
- What did you do with my brother? 
 - I did it. It was me. Me.

444
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,630
My sister knows nothing.

445
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,000
- Young Master! 
 - Did you do it?

446
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,340
Brother!

447
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,100
It was all my fault.

448
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,120
My sister did it because I wasn't good enough.

449
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,170
Why are you getting involved, Young Master? You don't know anything!

450
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,400
- Then do you know something, Geum? 
 - No.

451
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,840
- So it was you! 
 - No!

452
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,750
I really didn't. I don't know your brother.

453
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,970
All of you, shut your mouth!

454
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,300
I will not ask a second time.

455
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,540
What did you do to my son after tying him up in a shaman house?

456
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,410
I mean...

457
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,240
The person who was tied up in the shaman house

458
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,440
was Gye Sang Mok.

459
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,250
Gye Sang Mok? You did what to Gye Sang Mok?

460
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,200
So...

461
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,700
That hooligan...

462
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,510
made us owe him a 100-nyang debt.

463
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,370
I see.

464
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,250
So you killed him because you couldn't pay back the 100-nyang debt?

465
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,000
No, I didn't kill...

466
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,870
He almost died.

467
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,520
So how do you know my son?

468
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,200
The Office of Inspector General was looking for him.

469
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,270
Office of Inspector General?

470
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,790
Why would they look for my brother?

471
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,530
No, no, no!

472
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,710
Shoot me, shoot me!

473
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,850
Shut up!

474
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,180
D*** it.

475
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,140
He was found out.

476
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,300
That idiot got found out by the Office of Inspector General.

477
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,190
Tell me more details.

478
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,940
A mokbingo was discovered.

479
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,200
There were 100 liquor jars in there.

480
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,140
But the Office of Inspector General seems to think your son is connected to the incident.

481
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,420
We have nothing to do with the mokbingo.

482
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,770
We were just trying to sell some alcohol in Hanyang.

483
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,920
- Alcohol? 
 - You were trying to sell alcohol?

484
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,440
Song Mak San!

485
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,660
Yes, Mom?

486
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,030
You little!

487
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,980
Stop moving.

488
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,030
Mom, shoot!

489
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,360
Shoot them. They're lying!

490
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,630
- No! 
 - They're all lying about Hyung!

491
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,640
No, no!

492
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,430
 Maiden.

493
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,350
Are you sleeping, by any chance?

494
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,360
Hurry and go.

495
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,870
Hey!

496
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,790
He used to rent a room in the back.

497
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,550
He has nothing to do with this.

498
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,100
I'll send him on his way. I can do it.

499
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,010
Come on!

500
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,920
You don't seem to be asleep.

501
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,520
Maiden?

502
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,480
 What are you doing here at this late hour?

503
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:19,430
I felt it was rude of me not to say goodbye.

504
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,280
- I'm here to say goodbye. 
 -  Never mind it.

505
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,160
 We're not going to see each other anymore anyhow.

506
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,060
 What is the point of goodbyes?

507
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,400
Still, we lived under the same roof.

508
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,710
- Let us speak face to— 
 -  Face to face?

509
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,690
I don't want to see your face anymore, Young Tenant.

510
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,160
Just go.

511
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,160
Are you angry with me about something?

512
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,530
Come out just for a moment.

513
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,760
- Let's speak face to face. 
 -  Just go!

514
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,030
I may not keep my manners,

515
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,480
but I know I must not be close with a man who is to be married.

516
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,030
 So,

517
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,800
don't ruin your life by getting involved with me, Young Tenant.

518
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,040
So just have a good life

519
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,080
guarding your successes and honor.

520
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,080
And don't ever...

521
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,460
come back here again.

522
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:38,890
I also meant to tell you to be well.

523
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,260
 I shall forget all the bad memories. So...

524
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,120
I hope you mend your ways

525
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,380
and live a new life.

526
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,450
You are impatient and too brazen for your own good,

527
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,590
 so you will have many hardships in your life.

528
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,760
So,

529
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,590
think before you act.

530
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,790
And walk down a righteous path.

531
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,870
What is he saying?

532
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,530
- He means, have a good life. 
 - What?

533
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,660
- Have a good— 
 - Be quiet!

534
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,180
Humans do not realize the blessings they have received at birth.

535
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,140
It means a person does not realize the value of oneself.

536
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,290
 You are the only one who can know your worth.

537
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:38,780
 So remember how precious you are.

538
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,970
Aigoo!

539
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,900
Shut up and go away!

540
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,320
Go away!

541
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,960
Go away?

542
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,220
Are you not being too harsh?

543
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,920
Don't poke your nose into someone else's life

544
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,650
and just mind your own.

545
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,320
Gosh, I meant well.

546
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,720
Do what you will!

547
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,020
However you live, this is the last time.

548
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,480
So we shall never see each other again!

549
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,790
- Geez. 
 - Seriously.

550
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,690
Well then. Shall we get back to our conversation?

551
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,100
Reel it in.

552
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,960
Come on.

553
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,970
What is that?

554
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,740

555
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:05,360
 Do you think that the rumor about Hanyang without liquor spread only to Gwangju?

556
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,310
 Rumors fly.

557
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,950
Make preparations.

558
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,690
We shall leave early tomorrow morning.

559
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,950
 Yes, sir.

560
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,600
Do you suspect it's the Gwangju lot who did this?

561
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,690
I'm making an example out of him.

562
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,370
What happens if anyone covets Hanyang.

563
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,720
Apologies.

564
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,410
We can't let you report us to the Police Bureau before we get on the boat.

565
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,090
If you just leave us like this,

566
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,090
who is to set us free after you cross the river?

567
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,300
That is not our problem.

568
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,280
Let's go, Mom.

569
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,930
We won't report you, so just untie us.

570
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,220
We mean it. We won't report you.

571
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,520
Right, Young Master?

572
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,210
O-of course. I swear to you on my honor.

573
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,490
We don't trust promises in words.

574
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,960
Let's go, Mak San.

575
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,480
Help!

576
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,370
Anyone! We're tied up here!

577
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,750
- Young Master!
 - Brother!

578
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,340
I'll kill all of you.

579
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,130
If you kill us, you'll regret it.

580
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,880
- What? 
 - You are losing the opportunity of your life.

581
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,150
What do you mean?

582
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,280
It seems you need a lot of money.

583
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,310
If you let us go, we'll help you earn money.

584
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,820
Stop playing games.

585
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,070
You're obviously a poor noble family.

586
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,030
I have an agreement with Giringak to receive money for providing liquor.

587
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,340
Giringak?

588
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,800
My Lady, you never told me that.

589
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,070
It seems you sell alcohol as well.

590
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:53,410
If you let us go, I'll split half of it with you.

591
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:56,020
My Lady! You promised to split it with me.

592
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,530
Stop lying.

593
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,540
Why would Giringak receive alcohol from a noblewoman like you?

594
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,630
My Lady, were you going to take all the money and keep quiet?

595
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,540
- I'm talking!
 - Be quiet, everyone!

596
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,120
From now on, only this lady talks.

597
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,530
 The physician took Her Highness's pulse,

598
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,620
and said with a pulse so strong and firm, it must be a boy.

599
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,740
- Really?
- Yeah.

600
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,340
So if the Queen births a son,

601
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,340
what happens to the Crown Prince?

602
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,900
Do you think he could keep his place when a more suited heir is born?

603
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,860
Chief State Minister will do whatever it takes to depose him.

604
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,050
This is not some market street.

605
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,710
Chief State Minister, let us go.

606
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,310
That is...

607
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,170
- That b**** first said— 
 - I told you to watch your words and actions.

608
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,770
It has been 20 years since our low-class status was lifted from us.

609
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,610
Do you wish to carry the slave label to your grave?

610
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,830
If you cannot be of any help, live as if you are dead.

611
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,360
Don't look so sullen. You're not being sold off.

612
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,160
You suggested the negotiation.

613
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,510
Due to you, that female physician and your brother are safe.

614
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,370
This way. Come on.

615
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,530
I always cast my fishnet over there before I go to sleep.

616
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,410
So I was...

617
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,560
Whoa. What are you doing?

618
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,140
Geez.

619
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,270
Why is this girl so strong?

620
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,680
- Huh? 
 - Let's hurry up.

621
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,870
- It's a long journey across the river. 
 - But she...

622
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,690
Mom!

623
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,670
A few months ago, a one-eyed corpse was found inside a jar.

624
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,680
The Capital Bureau and the Justice Department investigated,

625
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,240
but it went unsolved as there were no witnesses or a culprit.

626
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,490
Come out of here? How...

627
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,210
But now, there is another similar corpse.

628
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,430
We were ordered to investigate this with the Inspector General Office.

629
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,100
The corpse examiner will be here soon, so don't...

630
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,890
Goodness, don't touch it with your bare hands.

631
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,020

632
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,100
This man...

633
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,460
is from Gwangju.

634
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,120
Gwangju?

635
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,040
 Over here!

636
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,520
Where is Gang San?

637
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,990
We couldn't find him.

638
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,180
Seven to three.

639
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,290
- You take three. 
 - Seven.

640
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,110
I'm the one who agreed to do business with Giringak.

641
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:55,440
How could you take seven?

642
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,460
You may have guns and swords, but that will not do.

643
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,160
- Six to four. 
 - Eight to two.

644
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,140
Listen here.

645
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,230
You were the one who suggested we work together.

646
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,230
You are the one who has more to lose.

647
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,090
We have lived our whole lives on alcohol.

648
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,130
This is the yeast our townspeople make.

649
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,200
It will be difficult to find yeast of this quality even in Hanyang.

650
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,070
How much more

651
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,640
of this yeast do you have?

652
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,350
A lot.

653
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,320
Seven to three. Including the price of the yeast.

654
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,910
Even if we are certain he was a Gwangju person,

655
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,580
how could we find the deceased person's family in this vast place?

656
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,320
We should go to Gwangju's Government Bureau and see if they have any missing persons.

657
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,040
It is a long way from here.

658
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,780
We must first go to borrow a horse.

659
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,300
 For sale!

660
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,580
Who are you?

661
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,000
This is Gang San's identity tag.

662
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,130
Looks like we're at the right place.

663
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:41,180
Attack!

664
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,570
Doyenne, we're in trouble.

665
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,880
They're all dying.

666
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:30,080
Gae Ddong, take the kids and go into town.

667
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,310
All right.

668
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,600
Hold on. What are you planning to do?

669
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,400
Should we not call the guards?

670
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,220
How can we trust those patrols?

671
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,280
We only trust ourselves.

672
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,540
Here.

673
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,870
What am I supposed to do with this?

674
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,460
Put your finger here and pull the trigger.

675
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,200
It's loaded.

676
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,600
But...

677
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,490
Well made.

678
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,960
A gunshot.

679
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,420
Where did it come from?

680
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,160
Over there toward the market.

681
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,960
I'll shoot you for real this time.

682
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,350
Get lost.

683
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,410
G-gun.

684
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,910
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and get out of here.

685
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,690
We should call on the guards nearby.

686
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,110
What are you doing?

687
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,430
What are you going to do with this?

688
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,860
There are people inside.

689
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,940
I must go around the back to get in.

690
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:48,980
Even if you go around the back, a gun is a gun, and an arrow is an arrow.

691
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,020
Inspector Nam. Inspector Nam!

692
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,560
It looks like I've crossed the Sanzu River, not the Gyung River.

693
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,120
Gosh, darn it!

694
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,300
Goodness.

695
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:03,860
Gosh.

696
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,660
What am I supposed to do with this?

697
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,730
Why is Young Tenant here?

698
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,520
Wait! Inspector Nam!

699
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,440
Wai...

700
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,880
Gosh.

701
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,560
Turn around slowly.

702
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,040
Y-you... a gh-gh-ghost...

703
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,700
What's wrong with him?

704
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,170
Leave while you still can.

705
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,950
Wow, what a poor treatment of guests.

706
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:12,200
You crossed the river first.

707
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,130
What did you do with Gang San?

708
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,640
Well.

709
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,140
He's deep...

710
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,790
at the bottom of Gyung River.

711
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:33,350
Mom!

712
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,550
Mom!

713
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,770
Take him.

714
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,580
As far as a gun is concerned,

715
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,700
once you shoot a gun, it is only a stick

716
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,450
until you load it again.

717
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,830
So...

718
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,480
this is when you use a sword.

719
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:07,930
I'm the inspector.

720
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,750
Hello?

721
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,370
Are you all right?

722
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,940
Gosh.

723
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,710
Mom...

724
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,480
Maiden?

725
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,080
 It's this way!

726
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,170
 - Over there!
- Run!

727
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,300
 Get inside!

728
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,420
Don't come closer...

729
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,850
What's this?

730
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:48,350
I-Inspector Nam?

731
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,070
W-what... Goodness.

732
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,340
Gosh.

733
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,950
What happened?

734
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,040
You go ahead to the Inspector General Office.

735
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,080
I must check on something.

736
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:39,400

737
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:56,760
♫  My heart is searching for you  ♫

738
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:04,270
♫  Your world is coloring my heart  ♫

739
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:08,630
♫  I say, who you are, who you are  ♫

740
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,300
♫  The question that fills my heart  ♫

741
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,190

742
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,840
 What do you think about having the maiden move into the palace?

743
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,920
 Do you mean to include the maiden in the Queen selection process?

744
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,410
 It is a shame.

745
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:27,510
 She would be suitable as the Princess Consort.

746
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,830
 Just tell me who killed my son.

747
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,330
 If I do?

748
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,900
 - A 100 mal. 
 - A 100 mal?

749
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,350
 A 100 mal of alcohol.

750
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,740
 Mom, this is a trap.

751
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:38,720
 They're trying to lure us in and kill us all at once.

752
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,200
 You're going to kill me?

753
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,090
 Why don't you kill that inspector already?

754
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,040
 You are the real owner of mokbingo.

755
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,290
 It was you who was at the temple

756
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:50,620
 ten years ago.

757
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:53,498
♫  Only because it is you  ♫
