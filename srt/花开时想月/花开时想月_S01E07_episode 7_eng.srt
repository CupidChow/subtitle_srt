1
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,840

2
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,440
I know full well.

3
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,150
How meaningless it is to be able to buy anything with money.

4
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,060
I-I was about to pay for it.

5
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,950
Even though you don't really want it?

6
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,580
Please add this to the cost.

7
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,110
Yes, sir!

8
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,900
Here you go.

9
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,810
If I do this, it becomes a little bit more meaningful, no?

10
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,060
Excuse me?

11
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,030
My Lady!

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,910
Hi.

13
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,930
My Lady! My Lady!

14
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,350
Young Master!

15
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,480
I'm sorry!

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,610
Sorry!

17
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,190
Young Master!

18
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,720
Young Master!

19
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,280
Young Master!

20
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,790
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,810
During the Buddha's Birthday celebration,

22
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,860
I suddenly remembered that I did not pay you for the jarful of liquor I drank.

23
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,730
Here is the cost of the liquor.

24
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,940

25
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,740
Moksanghwa.*
(One of the compatibility reading results)

26
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,430
The daughter of the Minister has

27
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,430
a fate that puts on the wings for your son.

28
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,980
They will live in conjugal harmony, so they will have abundant children.

29
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,660
They will enjoy happiness and wealth.

30
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,990
That is an incredible compatibility reading!

31
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,970
However, one thing...

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,330
Your son has one ominous sign in his fate.

33
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,290
Ominous sign?

34
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,570
 There is bad luck.

35
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,680
 Not just one, but two.

36
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,910
Earlier this afternoon,

37
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,690
where were you, and what did you do?

38
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,710
She was with me.

39
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,070
We looked around Unjongga together.

40
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,430
By chance, did you go to Sapyeongjang in Gangnam?

41
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,300
Why would she go to Gangnam?

42
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,470
I said she was with me.

43
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,760
All-day long. Just the two of us.

44
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,800
Please step out for a moment.

45
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,910
I have something to say to her alone.

46
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,880
Why should I?

47
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,900
I don't want to.

48
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,340
- Please step outside.
- I said no.

49
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,370
Follow me, Maiden.

50
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,940
I thought you'd never see me again.

51
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,920
Why did you come here?

52
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,060
I have no idea what I should believe.

53
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,080
Were you truly with that young master all day?

54
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,780
Why do you ask if you will not believe me?

55
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,340
How can I believe you? Everything is a lie.

56
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,120
From the beginning to the end, have you ever been truthful with me? Even once?

57
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,040
Is there a reason why I should be truthful with you?

58
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,970
There is no reason.

59
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,110
There's no reason I should believe you, either, Maiden.

60
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,740
Whether you believe me or not, do whatever you want.

61
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,420
I have no reason why I should prove to you that I was with Jade Lad.

62
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,970
It seems that you two had a great time together.

63
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,060
Do not dare even dream of it.

64
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,970
He is not someone you can be with.

65
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,820
Why not?

66
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,670
Because he's a son of a distinguished family?

67
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,030
Is it some wealthy family in Gaeseong?

68
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,640
Is he part of the royal family or something?

69
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,170
What if he is from a wealthy family in Gaeseong? And what if he is part of the royal family?

70
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,060
Well, you're about to marry into the Minister of Defense's family and change your life.

71
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,910
Is there a rule that says I cannot change my life, too?

72
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,520
Just because you're wearing new clothes and new shoes,

73
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,420
does it seem as though everything that happened never took place?

74
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,800
You said you'd forget all the bad things that had happened. So petty.

75
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,580
What? Petty?

76
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,600
So, never mind me. Just get married.

77
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Why are you bringing up my marriage now?

78
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,400
Besides, you're no longer my tenant.

79
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,430
Whomever I meet and whatever I do...

80
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,520
It is none of your business.

81
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,220
So, you and I should go on our way.

82
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,150
Fine.

83
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,960
Let us go on our own way.

84
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,280
Whether you cross the river or run into bandits!

85
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,260
I will no longer care.

86
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,780
That's what I hope for.

87
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,060
We truly have no reason to ever see each other again.

88
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,270
 Please keep it a secret.

89
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,040
A secret...

90
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,070
Do you mean that you like to dress like a man?

91
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,340
Or do you have another reason why you're dressed like a man?

92
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,240
I cannot give you any answers right now.

93
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,250
Just pretend as if you do not know.

94
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,620
Sure. Fine.

95
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,880
It is not so bad to have a secret between you and me.

96
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,090
This marriage must take place.

97
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,210
So...

98
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,900
is there a way?

99
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,830
You must...

100
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,460
 have the wedding before the summer is over.

101
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,280
I will warn you about one thing.

102
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,540
If you meet me again over something scandalous,

103
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,620
I will be different from now on.

104
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,000
Do not expect mercy from me.

105
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,400
 If the wedding does not happen

106
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,360
 and he is overpowered by the energy, never mind the marriage,

107
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,370
 your son's future will be ruined.

108
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
 How can I believe you? Everything is a lie.

109
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,190
 From the beginning to the end, have you ever been truthful with me? Even once?

110
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,390
 I will give you...

111
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,930
 one more chance.

112
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,810
 You can change your own destiny.

113
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,180
 A chance of a lifetime.

114
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,160
You're home late.

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
The master was waiting up for you but has fallen asleep.

116
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,710
Choon Gae.

117
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,010
Yes?

118
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,630
Go to Lady Ro Seo's home early in the morning

119
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,190
and watch her and see where she goes

120
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,830
and whom she meets. Report to me of every move she makes.

121
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,590
Monitor Lady Ro Seo?

122
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,740
Why?

123
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,800
To protect her.

124
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,190
Is Lady Ro Seo in danger?

125
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,560
Why? From whom?

126
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,470
From me.

127
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,060
What is he talking about?

128
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,580
She's made a mess of this place again.

129
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,200
It's time for you to eat.

130
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,590
Here.

131
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,310
Say ah.

132
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,250
Who knows what you put in here...

133
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,520
You think I don't know that you're trying to kill me?

134
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,780
What would I gain by killing you?

135
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,080
That bastard...

136
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,670
That bastard came back to kill me, right?

137
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,960
Woon Sim, you brought him back, so he could kill me, right?

138
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,260
Are you that afraid of dying?

139
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,660
Then tell me.

140
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,850
Why must you deserve to die?

141
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,870
You despicable b****!

142
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,480
I went through so much to teach you when you had nothing to show for.

143
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,480
And you dare try to run away with a bum!

144
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,680
See?

145
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,620
He ran away, leaving you behind, and he hasn't come back for you.

146
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,530
Go ahead and wait for him forever. And see if he ever comes back for you.

147
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,410
Please don't!

148
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,590
Please don't...

149
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,520
You can't answer any of my questions, and yet

150
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,420
you sure do remember what happened a long time ago.

151
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,020
You said you want to live.

152
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,920
Then eat.

153
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,030
Here. You have to eat to live.

154
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,300
You have to live in order to remember.

155
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,410
Eat.

156
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,690
So you could remember!

157
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,100
No brewery or alcohol storage was discovered around the blacksmith's workshop.

158
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,790
It means the blacksmith's workshop is for cover, and they're brewing alcohol somewhere else.

159
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,670
Why don't you...

160
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,840
just kill that inspector?

161
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,110
He's not just an inspector but the Crown Prince's tutor.

162
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,410
It will only create a headache for us if we mess with him.

163
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,120
For now,

164
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,090
keep monitoring him to see what he's up to.

165
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,410

166
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,730
What is this?

167
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,930
It's an amulet that protects you against bad luck.

168
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,740
A teacher of Myeonggwak* for the royal family made this for you.
(A branch that selected auspicious days)

169
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,870
It cannot be completely ineffective.

170
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,690
What do you mean by that? What bad luck?

171
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,690
Do not worry too much.

172
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,410
He says you will be fine as long as we hasten the wedding.

173
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,580
Hasten the wedding?

174
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,100
How did yesterday's incident wrap up?

175
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,740
Ah, yes. Well, I reported to the government office. It should be fine now.

176
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,880
Do not worry.

177
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,560
I cannot tell whether what happened yesterday was a dream or real.

178
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
I feel so spaced out–

179
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,530
Hurry up and eat, please.

180
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,830
You must eat a lot to heal quickly.

181
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,950
Gosh.

182
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:32,200
It's true that absence makes the heart grow fonder.

183
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,660
Without Nam, the food table feels so empty.

184
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,770
Do you not agree?

185
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,010
What do you mean feel empty?

186
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,620
I love living cozily, just the two of us, like this, Brother.

187
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,680
Cozily, the two of us...

188
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,310
But...

189
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,140
Choon Gae, what are you doing here?

190
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,940
Aigoo, I feel so uncomfortable at the Minister of Defense's house.

191
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,020
The house is humongous, and there are so many servants.

192
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,210
I have nothing to do there.

193
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,100
You're not doing much now anyway.

194
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,270
Just consider me as a dog who watches your house.

195
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,540
Right.

196
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,330
Early this morning,

197
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,050
a jar was discovered in Gyeonggang.

198
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,490
 The dead man's name is Song Gang San.

199
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,910
He was a blacksmith who used to work in a blacksmith workshop in Sapyeongjang in Gangnam.

200
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,040
A man from Gangnam was found dead in Hanyang?

201
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,670
He's a twin.

202
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,250
I had personally seen his face.

203
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,060
A twin?

204
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,470
In any case, in order to find his family,

205
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,620
we arrived at Sapyeongjang beyond Gyeonggang.

206
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,400
But bandits appeared all of a sudden

207
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,710
and raided the blacksmith's workshop that Song Gang San used to work in.

208
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,380
With this identity tag.

209
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,290
Oh-ho. So you're saying that bandit killed Song Gang San. Right?

210
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,910
The strange thing is that not only did they not report the murder,

211
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,570
the family of the deceased disappeared.

212
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,340
They ran away?

213
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,630
It means they have something to hide.

214
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,440

Usually, cases like this mean fights among the gangs.

215
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,600

Not being able to report

216
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,320
means they must be guilty about something.

217
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,840
 A few months ago, a corpse with one eye was discovered inside a jar.

218
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,630

219
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,460

220
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,240
Let's start at mokbingo.

221
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,260
Mokbingo?

222
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,470
I'm sure there is a reason why Song Gang San was hanging around mokbingo.

223
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,810
If you say mokbingo,

224
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,200
the culprit who turned himself in is behind bars at Northwest Police Bureau.

225
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,340
He was hanging around mokbingo.

226
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,600
Do you know him?

227
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,490

It's my first time seeing his face.

228
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,140
Are you sure you don't know him?

229
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,520
- Look carefully!
- I don't know.

230
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,140
After being seen around mokbingo,

231
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,750
- he was found dead.
- What?

232
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,450
H-he died?

233
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,430
What do you think you're doing?

234
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,490

Who let them see the criminal without my permission?

235
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,320
Northwest Police Bureau Chief, I already told the truth.

236
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,600
Please have mercy on me.

237
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,690
He's still under investigation.

238
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,260
Leave now!

239
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,340
I will ask him one last question.

240
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,900
Who did you buy the ice from for mokbingo?

241
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,290
Ice?

242
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,650
Well...

243
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,240
- Who was it again...
- You!

244
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,310
You said you dug iced yourself last winter.

245
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,790
Ah, yes, that's right!

246
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,890
I dug for the ice and put them there myself.

247
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,360

248
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,370
Are we just going back like this?

249
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,770
There was nothing inside the mokbingo.

250
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,210
Both of them do not know anything.

251
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,710
Wait, will you truly give up on studying for the state examination?

252
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,250
I am at a loss as to how I am going to survive right this minute.

253
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,280
What good is taking the state exam?

254
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,340
In order to buy my sister a chest made out of paulownia wood,

255
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,440
I need to make money.

256
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,210
Please take these books, too.

257
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,270
Young Hoon!

258
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,720
I considered you a friend.

259
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,970
Do you know how much my sister and I suffered because of you?

260
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,080
Hae Soo, I deserved to die.

261
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,110
I have so much debt because of my mother's medicine.

262
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,150
I fell for it when they said they'd pay off my debt.

263
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,660
D*** it!

264
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,800
Use it for your mother's medicine.

265
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,170
And the friendship between you and I is over with this.

266
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,670
Hae Soo!

267
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,430
I will repay all the hardships you have experienced thus far.

268
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,590
Do you think I'd fall for what you say again?

269
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,360
This is for real this time.

270
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,240
I found great work to do.

271
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,720
- Come on now! Let go of this!
- I'm telling the truth!

272
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,340
- They don't offer the job to just anybody.
- Come on!

273
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,800
- One nyang per day.
- Forget it–

274
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,050
One nyang per day?

275
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,650
I don't care how many people you have to bring in.

276
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,840
Finish the construction as quickly as you can.

277
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,980
Right after the construction is completed, we bring in liquor.

278
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,970
Yes, Merchant Sim.

279
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,510
Merchant Sim.

280
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,410
You know that inspector?

281
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,490
He went to the Northwest Police Bureau and met with Shin, who turned himself in for mokbingo.

282
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,650
He keeps trying to cross the river he should not cross.

283
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,070
Then...

284
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,320
we should cut off the bridge for good.

285
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,530
I hear there are bandits in Gangnam.

286
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,750
And I heard Inspector Nam tried to catch them by shooting arrows.

287
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,790
A group of bandits and shoot arrows?

288
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,050
Your daughter almost became a widow even before her wedding.

289
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,810
A widow!

290
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,680
The wedding date has not even been set yet.

291
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,500
So I was thinking, how about we move up the wedding date?

292
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,480
Since we're living under the same roof anyhow,

293
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,540
would it not be nice to have the wedding before the summer is over?

294
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,790
Before the summer is over means...

295
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,510
you are saying to hold the wedding right now.

296
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,810
It would be problematic if you were to postpone the wedding.

297
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:04,320
There is nothing bad about moving up the date.

298
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,680
Why don't you pick a nice date?

299
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,920
Hasten the wedding, huh?

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,960
Now that I'm trying to bring Inspector Nam under my wings,

301
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,040
this is how they take him away from me.

302
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,310
I would be losing if I were to dismiss him from the tutor position.

303
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,730
And even if I let him continue,

304
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,910
I would still be losing in this fight.

305
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,050
Do not worry too much, Your Majesty.

306
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,770
They are only discussing the possibility of marriage.

307
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,040
When you think everything seems perfect,

308
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,650
that could be the most dangerous timing.

309
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,270
You must have thought of a plan.

310
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,830
Although this tea seems to look clear and peaceful,

311
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,980
the tea leaves that sunk to the bottom float to the top if you shake the glass.

312
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,670
I will try shaking things up.

313
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,550
One of the maids from the Queen's quarters went outside the palace to meet her ailing father

314
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,450
and saw Crown Prince at Unjongga.

315
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,090
I heard he bought a lot of clothes and accessories for a woman.

316
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,620
P-pardon?

317
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,030
A woman's clothes?

318
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,480
There is nothing strange about a butterfly visiting a flower.

319
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,510
But it could be problematic for the Crown Prince to have a woman outside of the palace.

320
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,810
So, before a bigger problem surfaces,

321
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,830
what do you think about discussing

322
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,590
the royal nuptial?

323
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,420
It is a gift to congratulate you on your daughter's offer of marriage.

324
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,380
My goodness. You did not have to...

325
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,370
We did not even exchange nuptial documents just yet.

326
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,280
Thank you.

327
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,250
I am disappointed, however.

328
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,050
I'm sure your daughter is more than qualified to become a princess consort.*
(Wife of the crown prince)

329
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,440
Pardon?

330
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,430
Princess Consort?

331
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,190
Thirty years ago,

332
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,330
if your deceased father had not opened the palace gate,

333
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,030
the coup could not have been successful.

334
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,810
If they were to select queens and princess consorts based on your achievements,

335
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,320
you would have become the King's father-in-law already.

336
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,200
Well, I believe in living a peaceful and comfortable life.

337
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,160
Although you achieved the highest accomplishment,

338
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,920
you are not being treated properly.

339
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,120
I just brought it up because I feel for you, Your Excellency.

340
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,730
- Where are you going?
- Gosh! Scared me!

341
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,900
Over here.

342
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,240
That Choon Gae...

343
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,750
Gosh, that Choon Gae. What a hassle!

344
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,130
How long will he follow me around?

345
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,920
Did you call me?

346
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,650
I didn't call you!

347
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,300
I didn't!

348
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,690
Oh, my goodness!

349
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,620
Gosh, look at you!

350
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,020
My Lady, are you getting married?

351
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,340
Why did you bring him with you?

352
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:33,300
Gifting a hairpin to a woman

353
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,100
is almost like...

354
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,010
propo–

355
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,450
proposing marriage, no?

356
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,360
I heard your wedding date has moved up.

357
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,750
Did you receive a gift from Inspector Nam?

358
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,210
What the heck?

359
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,540
Why would Young Master Nam give this to me?

360
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,540
Gosh, hey!

361
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
What in the world are you thinking?

362
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,770
Your master will be in huge trouble at this rate.

363
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,260
What are you saying?

364
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,950
Think about this carefully.

365
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,150
Why would a young master about to get married have his servant follow Lady Kang?

366
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,350
What would other people think of this?

367
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,370
They'd think he's got two women.

368
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,760
Two women? Watch what you say!

369
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,870
You don't know what kind of person my Young Master is!

370
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,900
That's what I mean. What if the Minister's family hears of what you're doing?

371
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,890
The idea of your master becoming the Minister's son-in-law will vanish.

372
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,490
Darn it. That can't happen.

373
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:59,470
That's what I mean. You should watch your master, not Lady Kang. You idiot!

374
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,040
I see.

375
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,370
That does make sense.

376
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,120
Lady Kang is doing well with Jade Lad. So don't interfere.

377
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,610
- You got that?
- Lady Kang and Jade Lad are getting along well?

378
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,160
Look. Look at how Lady Kang is dressed.

379
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,750
Jade Lad bought her all that.

380
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Aigoo. No wonder.

381
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,680
Lady Kang and Jade Lad are supposed to meet alone tonight.

382
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,010
Make sure your master doesn't come near here. Got that?

383
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,010
- I got it.
- Good, good.

384
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,480
Go, go!

385
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,840
I did tell him what you told me to.

386
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,670
Don't you think Jade Lad really likes you?

387
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,380
Gosh, I told you no.

388
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,070
He gave this to me as payment for the liquor.

389
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,390
Will you really go on like this and marry me?

390
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,450
What in the world are you talking about?

391
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,100
I'm asking you to call off the marriage.

392
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,100
We both love someone else. So why should we get married?

393
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,560
A marriage is between two families.

394
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,020
You do not get married just because you want to

395
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,820
and do not just because you do not want to.

396
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,770
Do not insist on this unreasonably. Go inside now.

397
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,390
Whoa...

398
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,490
What will you do if Young Master Lee Chul Joong and Lady Kang fall for each other?

399
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,930
Stop speaking such nonsense!

400
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,690
Who's falling for whom?

401
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,100
You're in love with Lady Kang, too!

402
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,170
Love?

403
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,350
What's so great about love anyway?

404
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,160
What is important between man and wife is not love.

405
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,170
It is about respecting each other, being truthful without lies,

406
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,140
and trusting each other infinitely.

407
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,440
I will be like that when I marry.

408
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,670
He's not fun at all.

409
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,830
Fu-fun? Wait...

410
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,720
You do not marry to have fun!

411
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,540
How come all the women in Hanyang

412
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,520
insist on doing something they cannot do!

413
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,970
Choon Gae, why are you back so early?

414
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,160
I'm done.

415
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,610
What do you mean you're done?

416
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,260
Please stop paying attention to her.

417
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,270
You're about to get married. Why do you keep hitting on Lady Ro Seo?

418
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,580
'Hitting on'?

419
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,230
When did I hit on her?

420
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,960
From what I heard,

421
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,710
Jade Lad or Lad Lee or whatever...

422
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,000
she's getting along well with that rich young master from Gaeseong.

423
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,770
Why are you stuck between the two and interfering?

424
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,900
Wait, wait. What are you talking about?

425
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,810
They're supposed to meet tonight, too!

426
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,310
The two of them are meeting tonight?

427
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,770
Who is meeting whom tonight?

428
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,280
Your Highness.

429
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,580
Inspector Nam is here to see you.

430
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,390
What are you talking about?

431
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,560
Why would he come here at this hour?

432
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,710
Your examination is coming up. We should study through the night.

433
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,040
Who says?

434
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,610
I heard that you have a hard time falling asleep due to insomnia.

435
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,860
I will read you a book all night long.

436
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,320
"When it comes to carnal desires,

437
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,980
you may fall into it easily. But do not fall for it.

438
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,090
Once you get used to it, you will fall off the endless cliff."

439
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,240
- When it comes to carnal desires–
- I was thinking...

440
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,740
what if I brought in Lady Kang into the palace?

441
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
What?

442
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,980
The bandits are all over the place right now.

443
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,940
As well as the Buddha's Birthday and...

444
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,520
you never know what kind of danger she might fall into.

445
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,270
I wonder if it would be good for her to come into the palace and live a

446
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,850
safe and comfortable life.

447
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,260
Lady Kang is a young lady of nobility.

448
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,230
How could you bring her into the palace without proper procedure? Do not play around.

449
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,930
I'm not playing around. I'm being genuine.

450
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,010
No.

451
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,490
It must be love.

452
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,440
Is your love merely bringing Lady Kang

453
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,180
into the palace scandalously and making her a concubine?

454
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,930
Who says I'll bring her in as a concubine?

455
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,980
I do not have a wife yet.

456
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,880
Unlike you, who is about to get married.

457
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,400
Wait, then...

458
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,550
are you saying you would include Lady Kang...

459
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,000
in the queen selection process?

460
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,200
How far is she going?

461
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,470
You do have a way of surprising people.

462
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,920
I have something to confirm with you despite being rude.

463
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,830
Giringak sure changed a lot.

464
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,690
You accept liquor from just anyone now.

465
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,180
What could I do?

466
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,110
Park, who used to run the biggest tavern in Hanyang,

467
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,080
became a bandit and all.

468
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,030
Cut the crap.

469
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,040
Tell me his name first.

470
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,520
The bastard who killed my son.

471
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,010
You should ask that at the government office.

472
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,270
How would I know that?

473
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,880
There must be someone who's been supplying liquor to Giringak all this time.

474
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,370
Give me his name and where he lives.

475
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,870
Just tell me that.

476
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,350
And if I do?

477
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,580
Do you think you could kill him?

478
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,200
If you go after him clumsily,

479
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,170
he'll cut off all of your necks.

480
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:53,950
I saw clearly what happens while doing this line of work.

481
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,240
If he's capable of cutting off our necks at any given time,

482
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,490
we should at least know who he is, so that we can be prepared.

483
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,190
She's right. Our lives are on the line.

484
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,460
That's what I mean.

485
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,600
Why are you in such a rush, My Lady?

486
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,940
As you said, you'll run into him even if you don't want to once you start doing this work.

487
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,640
Park, I heard you have many people to look after.

488
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,390
If you have to feed all your people, you'll need money.

489
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,840
A lot of it.

490
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,630
Make some money and find your son's killer.

491
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,590
You kill two birds with one stone.

492
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,400
So?

493
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,130
Get on with the business first, you're saying?

494
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,370
Mom, this is a trap.

495
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,070
She's trying to drag us in and kill us all.

496
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,430
If you don't believe me, then shoot me.

497
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,710
You think I can't shoot you?

498
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,140
If she had set the trap, she couldn't have come all this way alone.

499
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,100
Can't you tell by the fact that we're all still alive?

500
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,430
So, how much liquor do you want?

501
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,420
One hundred mal.

502
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,980
- One hundred mal?
- One hundred mal...

503
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,400
One hundred mal of alcohol...

504
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,730
We would need at least four carts for that much.

505
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,320
How would we avoid the Sungnyemun Gate checkpoint patrol?

506
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,590
That's why I'm offering 2,000 nyang.

507
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,670
Would I give you 2,000 nyang for an easy job?

508
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,850
Whether you dig underground or buy off the gate guard,

509
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,110
that is the business of the liquor sellers.

510
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,260
See?

511
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,290
I'm telling you, this is a trap.

512
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,270
We'll do it.

513
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,020
One hundred mal of alcohol.

514
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,890
Just get the money ready.

515
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,990
Great.

516
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,540
I'll trust that you'll keep your promise.

517
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,270
I'll wait for you.

518
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,100
With 2,000 nyang...

519
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,390
Wait a minute.

520
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,240
At 70/30...

521
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,450
600 nyang.

522
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,700
If we split in half, 300...

523
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,790
Three hundred nyang!

524
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,310
One thousand nyang or 2,000 nyang. That's only when we pass the city gate.

525
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,380
It's not like we're sneaking in a jar or two.

526
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,560
How would we pass the Sungnyemun Gate checkpoint carrying all that?

527
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,130
In any case, it means someone had to be supplying the liquor all this time.

528
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,460
There has to be a way.

529
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,020
I told you it was a trap!

530
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,200
My Lady.

531
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,720
My gosh!

532
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,940
Ouch...

533
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,390
An alley cat was eavesdropping.

534
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,750
There's no alley cat this big.

535
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,210
Ow!

536
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:15,570
Maiden Ro Seo.

537
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,360
It's me. Me. Han Ae Jin.

538
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,440
Gosh, what are you doing here, Maiden Han...

539
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,630
Maiden, were you a moonshiner?

540
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,290
I knew you were pretty extraordinary, but...

541
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,010
I think she figured out everything. What should we do with her, My Lady?

542
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,020
What else? We have to kill her.

543
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,350
Wait...

544
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,570
It's a flintlock.

545
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,740
Huh?

546
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,970
This fires using the flint rather than a matchlock.

547
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,600
But this is no longer made in the country.

548
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,970
Did you bring it in from Russia?

549
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,830
What the? What do you know about this gun?

550
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,570
My father is the Minister of Defense.

551
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,350
Oh, yeah?

552
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,620
Then we'll have to kill you for sure.

553
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,680
K-kill...

554
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,820
K-kill me?

555
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,280
Mai-Maiden Kang...

556
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,560
Maiden Kang, do something!

557
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,170
Will you really leave me to die?

558
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,790
There is a way Maiden Han...

559
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,350
could live.

560
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,870
Father.

561
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,220
Aigoo! My Ae Jin!

562
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,250
What brings you all the way here?

563
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,070
Ta-da!

564
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,580
There are some of your favorite refreshments, Father.

565
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,430
I made them myself.

566
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,630
Aigoo, how wonderful!

567
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,400
My daughter has such a kind heart.

568
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,000
Let me see.

569
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,720
Aigoo! So pretty!

570
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,740
Aigoo!

571
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,870
Oh, my!

572
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,960
I'm so sorry, Father!

573
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,440
No, it's okay.

574
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,950
It's all right.

575
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,900
Aigoo, you made these so beautifully.

576
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,150
Ae Jin, all right...

577
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,540
Try one. Say ah.

578
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,210
Allow you to meet Jade Lad?

579
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,910
Why are you asking me that?

580
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,550
You said to exchange a favor between us.

581
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,740
Oh, never mind if you can't do it.

582
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,770
No, that's not it...

583
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Aren't you marrying Inspector Nam soon?

584
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,380
I can't do anything about the marriage.

585
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,740
But...

586
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,520
a sliver of memory with the one I love...

587
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,880
If I keep that memory in my heart,

588
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,210
wouldn't it provide me strength through the crisis I may face in my life?

589
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,850
A sliver of memory?

590
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,310
If you live with such a thing in your heart,

591
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:41,360
your concerns and worries would only deepen.

592
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,720
Forget it if you're going to nag.

593
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,260
No. That's not it...

594
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,230
How would I deliver this letter to someone who lives in Gaeseong?

595
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,570
I don't even know where he lives or when he'll come to Hanyang.

596
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,910
You could ask Young Master Nam.

597
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,590
Excuse me?

598
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,310
I noticed that you two seem pretty friendly.

599
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,710
That would be difficult.

600
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,220
Oh, forget it if you don't want to.

601
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,320
No, it's not that I don't want to.

602
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,910
What are you doing over there?

603
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,030
I'm glad you came.

604
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,620
Maiden Kang is here to see you, Young Master Nam.

605
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,320
- Pardon?
- Me?

606
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,820
Oh, yes, well...

607
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,190
I have something to say to you.

608
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,180
Be sure to keep your promise.

609
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:10,060
 Would it be okay to arrange a meeting between the woman he will marry with another man?

610
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,280
What is it that you're hesitating so much?

611
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:23,960
Did Jade Lad return to Gaeseong?

612
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,970
He went back to Gaeseong.

613
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,680
By chance, do you know when he'll be back here?

614
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,000
You must be terribly disappointed that you did not get to see him last night.

615
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,150
Pardon?

616
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,330
He will not be back anymore. Not ever.

617
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,850
He won't be back?

618
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,870
Gosh, that can't be.

619
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,990
By chance, is there a way you could contact him?

620
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,190
I must deliver something to him.

621
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,500
I'm sure I told you that you could not be with that man.

622
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:58,010
Oh, that's that, but...

623
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:03,810
a person's heart cannot be folded away like a piece of paper.

624
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,930
Couldn't you understand just for one day?

625
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,940
A sliver of memory... something like that.

626
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,800
Forget him even if you must force yourself.

627
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,910
Do not meet him. Do not even look at him.

628
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,200
Just put a lid on your heart and let it rot.

629
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,420
While doing so, your chaotic heart will quiet down someday.

630
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,620
You will one day stop thinking about him.

631
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,380
Gosh, I must deliver something.

632
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,110
Give it to me. I will deliver it to him.

633
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,880
Me. I'll do it.

634
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,970
I said I'd give it to him.

635
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,820
- I said I'd give it to him.
- I said, you can't!

636
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,260
Fine then.

637
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,790
You must deliver it to him in my place.

638
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,680
Not this.

639
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,260
This is the last time.

640
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,740
Do not ever...

641
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,550
come looking for me over something like this.

642
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,160
Young Hoon...

643
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,230
Aigoo.

644
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,210
Lower. Even lower.

645
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,550
Lower. All right...

646
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,990
Aigoo! Here...

647
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,090
One, two, three.

648
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,520
All right. There, there.

649
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,080
Hey, hey, hey.

650
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,470
But are you sure we're digging a well here?

651
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:54,710
Why are we digging sideways when we're supposedly digging a well?

652
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,100
One nyang per day. Do not ask any questions.

653
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,020
You said you have to buy a paulownia chest.

654
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,010
- But still...
- What are you doing?

655
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,200
Hurry up and dig.

656
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,970
Ah, yes...

657
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,960
All right. Move, move.

658
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,500
What are you talking about?

659
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,170
The prohibition has been in place for ten years?

660
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,640
Why?

661
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,650
Don't know. They just said so.

662
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,710
Geez.

663
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,180
Try the prohibition for 100 years and see if liquor dries up.

664
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,520
Oh, yeah!

665
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,160
I have a great idea!

666
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,470
Illegal distillery.

667
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,130
We can run an illegal distillery.

668
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,330
We can make tons of money.

669
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,170
We did.

670
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:35,030
- We did?
- Yes.

671
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,810
I have a distillery?

672
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:37,900
Yes.

673
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,510
Then why am I doing this here?

674
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,960
Because you lost the business.

675
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,810
- I lost it?
- Yeah.

676
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,270
- Why?
- You have no liquor.

677
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,540
- No liquor?
- No.

678
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,640
We can distill alcohol. You idiots.

679
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,970
Move!

680
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,600
Why do I feel suffocated whenever I see that noble girl?

681
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,650
Did I...

682
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,610
like that woman?

683
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,830
You did hate her quite a lot.

684
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,480
You didn't like her...

685
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,940
Why did I hate her?

686
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,640
I didn't pretend to hate her?

687
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,840
I don't think you could pretend like that.

688
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,270
You can't.

689
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,720
Move. Out of the way.

690
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,620
I have to check her out.

691
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,060
Maiden Ro Seo gave that to me?

692
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,530
Before that...

693
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,590
please take a look at this first.

694
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,040
What brings such a shabby person to this important place?

695
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,270
What brings such an important person to this shabby place?

696
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,820
I reviewed the appeal for reinvestigation that Inspector Nam wrote.

697
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,150
I heard it takes a week for His Majesty to approve?

698
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,600
Yes, that is right, Your Highness.

699
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,830
We have no time to wait for that.

700
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,750
Do not make any fuss over it.

701
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,710
Let us quietly resolve it among ourselves.

702
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,630
What do you mean, quietly?

703
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,080
Nam Young, what did you say before?

704
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,210
Geez.

705
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,090
If you cannot fight,

706
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,050
you must deceive.

707
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,110

708
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,780
 Crown Prince enters!

709
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,940
Your Highness!

710
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:22,430
I heard there are many incidents where the prisoners die of illnesses.

711
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,040
So...

712
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,680
His Majesty, whose heart is full of compassion for his people,

713
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,570
has sent you a physician.

714
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,420
The energy that needs to come up to the stomach is stuck on the bottom.

715
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,610
Well...

716
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,400
well, you keep farting.

717
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,850
That's right, sir.

718
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:50,170
You get a sudden surge of energy.

719
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,700
It is a stroke.

720
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,120
Pardon?

721
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,540
Oh, my! This man's lips!

722
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,470
Look at his lips!

723
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,940
They're pale and flipping out.

724
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,070
It's a sign that he'll die soon!

725
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,840
- Me?
- That's right.

726
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,080
The brother-in-law of my father’s second cousin’s wife’s nephew-in-law

727
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,340
and the second cousin's wife's husband's second brother's lips flipped out all white.

728
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,650
He died in three days.

729
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,570
What?

730
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,990
- Who?
- My father's second cousin...

731
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,550
I think he'll definitely die.

732
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,990
Bring out all the patients!

733
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,490
The inspector?

734
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,090
What?

735
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,040
Why does the alcohol smell like flowers?

736
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:06,430
It's your first time drinking such a drink, right?

737
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,100
Where is Doyenne?

738
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,950
Aigoo.

739
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,350
No wonder Woon Sim desires it so much.

740
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,030
Where did you learn to brew liquor like this?

741
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,140
From my father.

742
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,350
 He was very talented in many things.

743
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,760
When did he pass away?

744
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,420
Ten years ago.

745
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,240
I have no idea...

746
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,720
who killed him and why.

747
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,460
Without any witnesses,

748
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,310
ten years have passed.

749
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,770
I wondered why a noble lady was living like this.

750
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,860
I cannot forget it even after ten years.

751
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,680
The pain of losing a family member...

752
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,310
cuts through your stomach...

753
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,070
and it aches.

754
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,110
And then you get used to it.

755
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,130
Doyenne, I hope you find him before that happens.

756
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,370
As Woon Sim said while doing this line of work,

757
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,100
I'm sure I'd ultimately get to meet him.

758
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,280
When that time comes,

759
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,230
you should quit this work.

760
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,140
For a noble lady like you to get involved...

761
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,280
it will be too rough.

762
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,130
I lived the last ten years like this.

763
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,160
Doing work that is not suited for a noble lady.

764
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,360
Besides, it's offensive.

765
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,550
Why should they be the only ones to brew alcohol?

766
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,520
The king does not even permit it.

767
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,860
Why do I need their permission?

768
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,400
My father said this.

769
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,550
A drink is...

770
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,720
tastier when you share it with others.

771
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,250
Chi-Chief Royal Secretary.

772
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,800
Where are you coming from?

773
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,290
What brings you here, Uncle?

774
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,840
I asked, where are you coming from!

775
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,680
I went to get some fresh air.

776
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,030
When it comes to a certain position,

777
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,760
you either take it away or get taken.

778
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,580
There is no position that you get to keep just sitting around. Moreover...

779
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,040
if the owner of the position keeps leaving the spot empty,

780
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,050
it would be that much easier to take that position away from him.

781
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:42,240
Come to your senses and stay alert.

782
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,010
Your position over there means Eunuch Officer Kim's life, my life,

783
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,830
and your mother...

784
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,210
Royal Consort Gyeongbin's life.

785
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,460
You experienced the loss of Crown Prince Sunghyun.

786
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,450
So you know full well how torturous...

787
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,040
that is.

788
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,460

789
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,180

790
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,850
 Let's go now.

791
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,050
The military provisions and supplies go to the defense department every ten days.

792
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,860
The weapons go in once a month.

793
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,880
You can go through if you show a pass with a defense department official's seal.

794
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,170
How many jars could fit into a cart?

795
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,960
Well, around ten or so?

796
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,360
We can squeeze in a couple more there.

797
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,000
As for weapons...

798
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,420
We will prepare the rifles disguised to be delivered to the defense department.

799
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,490
In case of any problems,

800
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,550
we'll prepare the rifles to use.

801
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,410
 If anything happens, we'll shoot.

802
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,840
 So, run right away.

803
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,310

804
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,040
The checkpoint patrols are so picky today.

805
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,820
I heard it's because there are more firearms than usual today.

806
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,280
We should be okay, right?

807
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,230
We're supposed to be defense department civil servants.

808
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,400
There is no way they will count everything.

809
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,740

810
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,830
Did you check the quantity?

811
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,320

812
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,650

813
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,210

My goodness, why are you doing this?

814
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,710
It's a ledger from a gambling house you hung around every day.

815
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:37,980
You had 500-nyang debt.

816
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:43,850
And you had told your family not to worry about this debt right before you turned yourself in.

817
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:47,830
Will you tell me the name of the person who paid off your debt

818
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,010
or will you be investigated as a murder suspect

819
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,620
by the Inspector General Office?

820
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,730
Pardon?

821
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:55,650
Murder?

822
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:58,970
You can be beheaded for murder.

823
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,580
Who is the one...

824
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:06,450
who paid off your debt for you and made you give a false confession?

825
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,800
You can never hand him over to the inspector.

826
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,530
If the inspector is about to get him, just kill him off.

827
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:12,950
Yes, Merchant Sim.

828
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,520
Sir!

829
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,870
- A prisoner is gone.
- What?

830
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,550
They said to check the faces of those who leave.

831
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,410
Close the gate on one side and restrict all pedestrians.

832
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,480
Yes, sir.

833
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,470
Please go in.

834
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,070

835
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,220

836
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,790
 There are only two suspicious men.

837
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,780
 They must still be inside the capital.

838
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,690
 You'll be in big trouble at this rate!

839
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,670
 I'll be in huge trouble if they get caught, too!

840
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,880
 Where are you going?

841
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,400
 Your life may be in danger.

842
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,560
 You can be dismissed for real at this rate.

843
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,000
 You'll have to come with us, Inspector.

844
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,960
 Do you remember what I said as a child?

845
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,860
 About a tiger rescuing me.

846
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:40,670
 I have a secret I have kept from you all this time, Maiden.

847
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:43,410
 But I do not wish to hide it any longer.

848
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:47,020
 Wherever your heart is, the fate to become man and wife

849
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,930
 is set aside.

850
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,790
♫  Once again...  ♫
