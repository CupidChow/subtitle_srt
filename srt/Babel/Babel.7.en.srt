1
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,359
Russell

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,799
Old Lu.

3
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,400
Thank you.

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,760
Small token of kindly feelings

5
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,400
The video is ready.

6
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm coming.

7
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's start.

8
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,280
Put the bun on.

9
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,239
Stop.

10
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,000
amplification

11
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,919
This black tennis shirt.

12
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,360
The pants and shoes he was wearing

13
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,919
It's the same as a gray hoodie.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,199
And has the same figure.

15
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,800
It should be the same person.

16
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:29,919
The next paragraph.

17
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,240
We're on the surveillance.

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,759
And found Yiran's figure.

19
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,879
She once bumped into the man in black.

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,479
In front of the Water Pavilion,

21
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,960
And the man in the black tennis shirt

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,879
I bumped my shoulder.

23
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
She looked at him.

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,520
You should remember his appearance.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,960
When you were fighting with a man in black,

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,000
Took off his mask.

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,360
You should have seen his face.

28
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,960
Before she died,

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
I used all my strength

30
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,439
To the witness.

31
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,759
Aqua

32
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,800
I think he wants to give us

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,120
A very important clue.

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
The man in black

35
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,759
With Yi Ran in front of the Water Pavilion.

36
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,759
The man in the black tennis shirt.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
It should be the same person.

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,840
Old Xu.

39
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,759
You and Liang Zi go to the Central Trade Zone.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,000
Check August 1st.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
Of all the entrances that day.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,479
Focus on investigation.

43
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,159
The figure of a man in a black tennis shirt

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,800
good

45
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,360
Let's go.

46
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's go to the Water Pavilion later.

47
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
Contact the property management here.

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
See if you can ask.

49
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,599
The addresses of Shui and Li Mao.

50
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,520
And contact information.

51
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,240
a row

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,079
You're so desperate.

53
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,959
North of the Northern Ranges Road.

54
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,839
There will be no surveillance.

55
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,319
Black SUV with no license plate

56
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,759
Finally disappeared

57
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,680
On the road leading to the northern mountains,

58
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,480
Are you saying that

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,240
The man driving the black SUV

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,920
Is probably related to the murderer of Jiang Yi Ran.

61
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,480
There is a certain connection.

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,199
I think the murderer of Yi Ran

63
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,079
Should have escaped by water.

64
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,560
The terrain of the whole Harbour City

65
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
It's higher in the north and lower in the south.

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,399
And all the Hucheng River is from the northern mountains.

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,319
It goes from north to south.

68
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,399
Around the whole harbour city.

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,399
There are many tributaries.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,279
And there is a tributary.

71
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,399
Just passed by.

72
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,240
Along the Northern Mountains Highway,

73
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,240
To escape by water.

74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Your speculation is bold.

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,879
But I have a problem.

76
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,600
This is not a fish.

77
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,279
How could he swim so far?

78
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,279
Take a look at this.

79
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:38,959
captain

80
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,560
captain

81
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,040
The driving recorder is too dark.

82
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,279
So we can't see it clearly.

83
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,439
But according to our technical department,

84
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,560
He was wearing

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,079
Clothes similar to a diving suit.

86
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes, Chief.

87
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,000
From the material,

88
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
This should be neoprene.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,759
It's more high-end in the diving suit.

90
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,120
And before that,

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
We ran down the gray hoodie on the center line.

92
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,800
He was eventually sent to Nanqi Middle Road Station

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,120
He might have escaped by diving along the Hucheng River.

94
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,399
According to these clues,

95
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,959
I have a more bold speculation.

96
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,600
say

97
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
This is the water ghost I simulated.

98
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,680
This is frogman.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,319
Yes

100
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,399
Look at this file again.

101
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,959
This is similar to the water ghost that night.

102
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,480
All the places

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,360
Can't be separated from the Hucheng River.

104
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,519
And we have enough evidence to prove that

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,519
This suspect was found

106
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,399
There's a street full of snacks in the Central Line Shopping District.

107
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,079
At the door of Water Pavilion.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
What about the Water Pavilion?

109
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,000
It's another

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
A southern restaurant with a Southeast Asian style.

111
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,800
Lu Xiao's speculation is very bold.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,240
But I think it's not unreasonable.

113
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,240
in short

114
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,360
In any case

115
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,079
We can't let such a murderer

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
At large

117
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,480
Running away is futile.

118
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Do as I say.

119
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,960
otherwise

120
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,960
You will never go out.

121
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,120
feed

122
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm at your downstairs.

123
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,600
It's probably early.

124
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,519
I just want to ask if it's convenient for you.

125
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,840
If it's inconvenient,

126
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,600
I'll wait in the cafe downstairs.

127
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,279
I'll go up when it's a bit late.

128
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,440
Mr.Yu

129
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,000
Please come up.

130
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,360
Then I'll start.

131
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,440
My friend said that when he was 16,

132
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,919
Grandpa is getting worse and worse.

133
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,879
I can't work anymore.

134
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,919
He won't be a student anymore.

135
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,120
He rides a tricycle to replace his grandfather every day.

136
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,519
From where they live,

137
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
An hour's ride.

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,360
To collect garbage in the city.

139
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,759
He said it was his first time

140
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,639
See the color beyond black and white.

141
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,759
He said the touch of red made him addicted.

142
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,440
From then on, he always went to the field.

143
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,679
I really want to ask.

144
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,399
A child who has been color-blind since childhood.

145
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,320
You'll be

146
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
Do you see any other colors?

147
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,600
In theory,

148
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,679
It's not possible.

149
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,200
But he was sure

150
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,440
Your friend is saying that

151
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,639
He can only see the red.

152
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,399
I don't know.

153
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,320
He said he didn't want to eat for her.

154
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,000
And began to take risks.

155
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,559
Rush into danger

156
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,440
He said picking up garbage was done separately in those days.

157
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,480
It's a

158
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,519
A small society divided by different forces.

159
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,519
There's a man named Huang Dawei.

160
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,679
They have many brothers.

161
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,879
A lot of garbage in Baiyang City.

162
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,320
It's a powerful place.

163
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,000
The garbage collected by the Huang family

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,519
In his yard.

165
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,039
And then sort them.

166
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,159
And then sell it to the recycling center.

167
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,320
Because the Huang family

168
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
The garbage in most areas.

169
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,320
So their garbage heap

170
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,120
There are always some interesting things.

171
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,039
It's you.

172
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,399
Go after him.

173
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,399
Let's go.

174
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,679
Go after him.

175
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
Let's go.

176
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,919
Don't run. Hurry up.

177
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,879
Hurry up! Stop!

178
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,840
Get him! Stop!

179
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,720
Don't run.

180
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,559
Hurry up.

181
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,080
Catch him!

182
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,480
Catch up with him. Catch him.

183
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,840
Drive faster. Hurry up. Catch him.

184
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,440
Don't run.

185
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,440
Don't run. Stop.

186
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,799
Hurry up.

187
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,360
stop

188
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,320
Come down.

189
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,840
I told you to run.

190
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Kill him.

191
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,360
I told you to run.

192
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,240
I told you to run.

193
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,840
Run!

194
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:35,720
Run!

195
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,039
I know you're stubborn.

196
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,360
You're more stubborn than your grandfather.

197
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,519
I'm telling you,

198
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,320
I will let you off today.

199
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,360
Next time you come to steal from my house,

200
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,480
I will kill you.

201
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:48,720
go

202
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:49,279
go

203
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,080
Drive a car

204
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,000
Drive a car

205
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,240
That's it.

206
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,919
For that telescope, my friend

207
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,039
Was severely beaten.

208
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,480
But he said it was worth it.

209
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,879
When he risked his life

210
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,360
After I got this treasure,

211
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,879
He thought they were closer.

212
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,879
No matter it's windy or rainy,

213
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,759
He could sit there for hours.

214
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Just to

215
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,879
Look at that girl.

216
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,399
Yes

217
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,039
As an aside,

218
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,080
Is your secretary feeling ill?

219
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,360
It must be sleepy.

220
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,679
It's already 16 years old.

221
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,559
His physical strength is not as good as before.

222
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,360
Go on.

223
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,240
How about this?

224
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,240
It's too late today. Tomorrow.

225
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,440
good

226
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,960
We'll make an appointment tomorrow.

227
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,359
Okay, thank you.

228
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,880
How can I make my friend

229
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,599
As soon as possible,

230
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,519
To get out of it.

231
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,440
Emotions are the hardest to get rid of.

232
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,599
When a person's nervous system

233
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,359
When you get into the habit of thinking,

234
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,160
Maybe there's a way.

235
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,480
Is a strong stimulus.

236
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,319
To get rid of this inertia.

237
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,279
Thank you.

238
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,200
bye-bye

239
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,599
see you tomorrow

240
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,039
good

241
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,640
Go back.

242
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:48,640
lobster

243
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,559
What's wrong with you?

244
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,880
Why are you so casual?

245
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,079
captain

246
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,240
The house rented by Li Mao and A Shui

247
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,119
I found it.

248
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,680
Captain, they should be in that room.

249
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,359
Hello, aunt.

250
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,720
We're from the Harbor City Criminal Police Bureau.

251
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,920
Do you know where this family went?

252
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,720
This family started to make troubles before dawn.

253
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,400
The child couldn't sleep.

254
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,799
I don't know if he is still at home.

255
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,079
The condom was a few hours ago.

256
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,039
I just used it.

257
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,799
I just took off my clothes.

258
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,839
There's body odor on it.

259
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,279
From the wound on the victim's neck,

260
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,240
And the handling of the scene,

261
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,680
The murderer is simple and crude.

262
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,559
Without any skills.

263
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,440
The empty slot

264
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,400
Is the same size as the meat cleaver.

265
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,920
And the other knives

266
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,160
The same design as the meat cleaver.

267
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
It means the murderer took the knife from here.

268
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,880
and

269
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,240
This kitchen hasn't been burned for a long time.

270
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,519
There's a layer of dust on the top of the pan.

271
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
Including this knife case.

272
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,279
But it's so weird.

273
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,480
The couple has lived here for so long.

274
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,400
How could you not fire?

275
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,839
Do you think it's because they run a restaurant?

276
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,839
So I'm eating three meals a day in the hotel.

277
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,519
The Harbour City doesn't have as much dust as the north.

278
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,559
The weather here is humid and windy.

279
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,119
To accumulate so much floating dust,

280
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,160
You need a long time.

281
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,480
Do you have a tissue?

282
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,119
Yes

283
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,160
There's no floating dust in the slot.

284
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,839
It means that the knife

285
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,359
Out of the slot.

286
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,119
Hold on.

287
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,799
Wait for the result of the fingerprint test on the knife.

288
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,599
captain

289
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,000
I doubt that Li Mao was killed by Water.

290
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
If this is the case,

291
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,440
The relationship between Water and the Man in Black is very delicate.

292
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,160
Hello, Xia.

293
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,359
Is everything ready?

294
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,039
I'll get it now.

295
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,839
Xiao Xia has everything ready.

296
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,079
I'm going to fetch it now.

297
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,559
How are you going?

298
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,839
The subway and the blue car.

299
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,200
Do you have your license?

300
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:13,519
I brought it.

301
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,519
Slow down.

302
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:22,599
Thank you

303
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,000
captain

304
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,200
I

305
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:33,759
What's up

306
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:36,640
let it be

307
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,720
It's okay. I'm leaving.

308
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,319
feed

309
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,319
Lu, when are you going back to the station?

310
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,839
Have you got the result?

311
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,359
These videos

312
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,039
It's in the monitoring room of the center line.

313
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:04,880
I transferred it back.

314
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,279
His name is Zhang Jian.

315
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,039
He's blind.

316
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
It's on the west side of Central Line Pedestrian Street.

317
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,400
Opened a blind massage parlor.

318
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,680
The gray hoodie is the same.

319
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,880
The pants are different from the shoes.

320
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,920
Liang Zi and I have made a statement.

321
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,079
Please.

322
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,599
Tell us about that day.

323
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,279
On the morning of August 1st,

324
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,160
I just served a customer.

325
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:37,640
good

326
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,519
You're at the clock.

327
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,880
Take a rest.

328
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,960
urinary urgency

329
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,519
So I rushed to the bathroom.

330
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,519
That man is very strong.

331
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,319
He quickly stripped me naked

332
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,480
The police are here.

333
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,319
Pull up the surveillance of the bathroom.

334
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,359
He said he only saw me in and out.

335
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,519
I didn't see that person at all.

336
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,359
The suspect has strong anti-reconnaissance ability.

337
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,960
His walking route

338
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,200
Walked in the blind spot of the surveillance.

339
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,680
So the suspect didn't stay.

340
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,079
Any surveillance clues

341
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,000
Mom, is the lobster sick?

342
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,039
Is it uncomfortable?

343
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,319
Seems to be in a bad condition.

344
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,319
Let's go and have a look.

345
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,039
It seems a little uncomfortable.

346
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:28,640
What can we do

347
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,839
I have to take it to the hospital.

348
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,079
I'm going too.

349
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,000
Don't go.

350
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,880
Otherwise, I have to take care of you two.

351
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,640
No, I'm going with the lobster.

352
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I want to be with you forever.

353
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,640
Are we there?

354
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,599
Yes, it's time.

355
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,119
lobster

356
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
Is it hungry?

357
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:03,240
Stay here.

358
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,039
I'll go in and ask for help.

359
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,880
Don't move.

360
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,319
I hope you can get better soon.

361
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Are you all right?

362
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,960
It's been a little uncomfortable since the afternoon.

363
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:20,680
This is it.

364
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,839
For the rest of my life.

365
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,799
Why are you here?

366
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,759
I was just passing by.

367
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,039
It seems to be your dog.

368
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,319
I wanted to take the dog down.

369
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,240
What's up

370
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,240
Go and have a look.

371
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,359
Mom

372
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,799
I promised it yesterday.

373
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,400
To catch erflies in the Rainbow Bridge Park.

374
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,440
I can't break my word.

375
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,759
It won't leave, right?

376
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,799
We are good friends for life.

377
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,039
It won't leave, right?

378
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,599
Right?

379
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,200
to peep

380
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,720
Yi Bing was suspected of illegal live-streaming last year.

381
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,119
She started to cut off.

382
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,400
Until February this year.

383
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
So I went back to live.

384
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,920
But the content of her live stream

385
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,599
Is still illegal.

386
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,160
No wonder when Xiao Xia gave me the hard disk,

387
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I've been emphasizing that

388
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,519
She's only responsible for Yi Bing.

389
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,519
The management of graphic models.

390
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,200
I don't know.

391
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,839
According to Bing's live content,

392
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,599
I think she already knows

393
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,480
Yi Bing is suspected of illegal live-streaming.

394
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,160
I just don't want to take any responsibility.

395
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,559
But the captain

396
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,240
From the content of these videos,

397
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,319
I can only see that Yi Bing is suspected of illegal live-streaming.

398
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,519
Can we find any other clues?

399
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,440
Let's find it.

400
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,000
Is this a car shock?

401
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,400
Has she changed?

402
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,839
Now you're shooting the scenery.

403
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,920
So you started taking photos of women bathing.

404
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,039
But this woman is also strange.

405
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,480
To take a shower in this place.

406
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,359
this

407
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,079
This is Water.
