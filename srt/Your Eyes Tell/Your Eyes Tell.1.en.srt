00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,616
Good work.

2
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,619
Thank you!

3
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,693
Umm..

4
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,360
I applied for a part-time job...

5
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,728
if you're gonna be late then give me a call. I applied for a part-time job...

6
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,630
If you're gonna be late then give me a call!

7
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,700
Sorry, i don't have a phone...

8
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,141
Over here.

9
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,912
The parking lot is open from 5 am to 11pm on weekdays.

10
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:32,584
After that, you just have to go around the venue.

11
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,559
An old man used to live here before but you can use it.

12
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,267
He just ran away in the night time.

13
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,469
There's a lot of scams right?

14
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,805
He was a nice old man though.

15
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,772
Has it started yet?

16
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,077
Here! This is an orange and a steamed bun.

17
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:41,820
And this is mine!

18
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:49,061
And this is your favorite bread! The ugly bread!

19
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,768
And here's your dinner-time Japanese drink!

20
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:21,093
Who are you?

21
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,862
Where's the old man?

22
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,900
It seems like the person before me quit.

23
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,671
Then..

24
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,174
Why did you accept those?

25
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,779
you gave them to me...

26
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,424
There was a drama that i would always watch with the old man.

27
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,598
Did the old man get sick?

28
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,136
I don't think that was the reason he quit...

29
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,848
Thank you..

30
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,384
Sorry about that.

31
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,285
Umm..

32
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,723
Seems like it's raining...

33
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,226
If you wanna watch something then go ahead.

34
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,805
This one!

35
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,280
He's not coming!

36
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,652
Why are you here?

37
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,857
He asked to come

38
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,792
No...

39
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,661
I saw him

40
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,398
At his wife's place

42
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,001
Thank you!

43
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,737
That's right!

44
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,140
Would you like to eat this?

45
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,479
It might look bad though...

46
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,789
Be sure to give water to the Kinmokusei plant!

47
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,958
Don't let it die

48
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,129
Later!

49
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,212
Thanks for the food!

50
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,189
I'm off!

51
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:30,502
If the staff visits then the initial charge is 2800 yen. How does that sound?

52
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,370
I'm not talking about money!

53
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,040
I'm asking if someone can come by the end of the day!

54
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,310
I'm deeply sorry. Let me confirm it immediately!

55
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,383
If you use this address you can visit us after the beginning of the week on Monday.

56
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,053
There's no meaning if i can't do it today!

57
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,156
We're just flapping our gums back and forth...

58
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,524
Whatever!

59
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,825
I'm deeply sorry!

60
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,728
This won't happen in the future...

61
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,931
Hello?

62
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,438
That person is a regular claimer so you don't have to worry!

63
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:11,076
I told him not to add to our stress!

64
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:16,081
It's not a claim. It's an offer from a customer.

65
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:23,822
Our job is to gratefully accept it.

66
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,663
Once he's open go for it!

67
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,331
Find his weak spot!

68
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,201
Hey! Go for the gut! The gut!

69
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,203
You're leaving yourself open damn it!

70
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,743
You don't understand a damn thing! It's simple!

71
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,556
I came here to apologize...

72
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,094
I'm sorry...

73
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,564
No, I'm totally fine!

74
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,301
Right? Chief?

75
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,039
Why did you come back with your face down?

76
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,108
It’s fine! It happened a long time ago...

77
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,010
You shut your mouth!

78
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:19,811
Listen up!

79
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:25,083
Who picked your dumbass up and gave you a proper life?

80
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:30,889
You're the one who was supposed to teach him everything Jin!

81
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,928
You just fluttered away...

82
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,766
Don't just come back here when you want!

83
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,340
Alright everyone! Stop real quick!

84
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,244
We have a guy you don't know!

85
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,947
He's your senpai...
Jin-san...

86
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,417
I just came here today to apologize...

87
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,189
Wind your bandages.

88
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,732
Show me whether you made it or not.

89
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,485
Sorry..

90
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,489
If you're not getting in the ring then go home.

91
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:58,209
Things have finally started getting peaceful for us.

92
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,112
You've already apologized.

93
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,183
Please don't involve us anymore.

94
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,919
Umm...

95
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,009
Old man?

96
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,447
Yes..

97
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,850
Umm..

98
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,152
Here.

99
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,997
It was yummy.

100
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,499
It didn't look bad either.

101
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,244
Didn't the Kinmokusei bloom?

102
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,431
Can i open up the window?

103
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,045
Did you exercise today or something?

104
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,132
You can tell huh?

105
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,834
My senses other than seeing are good!

106
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,672
I understood what kind of person the old man was!

107
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,707
Their was his voice..

108
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,710
But he had a very exhausted atmosphere to him.

109
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,846
He had a lot of hardships!

110
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,749
What year were you born in?

111
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,551
Year of the rat.

112
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,253
Year of the rat...

113
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,989
Then that means..

114
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,191
You're 48!

115
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,063
Or maybe 36!

116
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,538
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

117
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,541
A cotton t-shirt.

118
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:24,115
Not you, but the drama's heroine.

119
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,519
A skirt.

120
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,355
And her shoes?

121
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,990
What is that?

122
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,592
I'm wearing them...

123
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,328
Of course

124
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,696
Then..

125
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,199
What about earrings?

126
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,170
The sames ones as you.

127
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,172
Really?

128
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,476
Really?

129
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,668
Hey!

130
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,177
Here

131
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,917
I got them from the cleaning lady.

132
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,385
Peaches..

133
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,323
Are they washed?

134
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,860
Yes!

135
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,262
You can't!

136
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:48,266
I heard that after you wash them they start losing their flavor!

137
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,234
Alright, I won't refrain!

138
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,236
Thanks for the food!

139
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,674
Also, my name isn't "Hey"...

140
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,876
It's Kashiwagi Akari!

141
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,263
It's so hard

142
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,467
What kind of job makes your hands like this?

143
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,341
Thank you!

144
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,744
It makes me relieved to have someone to watch things with!

145
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,880
Later!

146
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,026
Can I come again next week?

147
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,264
Yes!

148
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,016
Did you buy shoes?

149
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,757
It smells like new shoes.

150
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,861
Well..

151
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,565
You don't regret it?

152
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,435
There's no way i would

153
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,437
Ren-kun..

154
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,476
I'm glad that i feel in love with you.

155
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,314
"I'm glad that i feel in love with you."

156
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,483
Hmm...

157
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,922
Is he handsome?

158
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,859
He's handsome but..

159
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,863
He's a playboy with pink hair.

160
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,866
I'm talking about you!

161
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,803
I can't see so no lying!

162
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,613
So that means you're not that handsome?

163
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,782
But it's okay!

164
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,017
Men aren't just looks!

165
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,586
It's about heart

166
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,767
See you again next week!

167
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,071
Okay!

168
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,962
Are you okay?

169
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,104
I'm sorry... I'm fine!

170
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,272
Ouch!

171
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,708
Ouch!

172
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,879
You need to go to the hospital...

173
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,892
Hey, what's your name?

174
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,535
Hey..

175
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,470
Hey?

176
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,442
It's embarrasing...

177
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,512
Why are you embarrassed about your own name?

178
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,481
Then what should i call you?

179
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,720
Well..

180
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,189
What do you mean?

181
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,062
Hold on..

182
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,965
Break time..

183
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,979
Get on my back.

184
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,417
You'll regret it...

185
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,919
It's okay.

186
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,855
You'll really regret it!

187
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,027
Get on.

188
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,650
Know where your house is?

189
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,655
Turn right then go straight up.

190
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,933
See? You regret it don't you?

191
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,821
You regret it!

192
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,097
We're here..

193
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,971
Are you tired?

194
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,540
I'm totally fine!

195
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:24,815
I have another request for you...is that okay?

196
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,796
What was clogging it?

197
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,103
Panties..

198
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,772
Hey..

199
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,212
Thanks..

200
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,587
Later..

201
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,024
Hold on a second

202
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,161
Hey old man...

203
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,132
Do you like music?

204
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,136
I don't listen to it much..

205
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,672
Have this gift!

206
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,477
Concert tickets

207
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,048
No, but...

208
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,052
I'm giving it to you, so invite a friend.

209
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,760
You don't have any friends old man?

210
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,700
Then wanna go together?

211
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,489
Welcome Akari-chan

212
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,159
Wanna do the usual? I should trim the dead ends.

213
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,796
I wanna change things up a little bit today...

214
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,799
A little huh?

215
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,534
Did you get a man?

216
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,271
Pink is..

217
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,017
Thanks for waiting!

218
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,402
How does the violinist look like?

219
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,943
Her hair is long and she's in a red one piece.

220
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,646
She's playing with a lot of feeling.

221
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,927
It's been a while since Vue seen a concert!

222
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,562
What about you?

223
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:36,533
It's my first time going, But I'm glad.

224
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,435
Really?

225
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,571
Really.

226
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,774
Also..

227
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,375
I'm starving...

228
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,945
Me too..

229
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,348
Then... I have a spot i wanna go to. Sounds good?

230
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,891
So yummy!

231
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,260
I've always wanted to come here!

232
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:07,164
I mean, I can't grill by myself!

233
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,768
Here.

234
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,670
Thanks

235
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,264
Hey!

236
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,733
Do you know The Thinker?

237
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,570
It's a sculpture made by a man named Rodin!

238
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:51,541
His toenails were super short and his toes stubby!

239
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:58,415
When I was in college, I majored in sculpting and observed them for a while so l remember it!

240
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,887
But..

241
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:12,062
The things that I saw everyday seemed to vanish.

242
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,735
Like what were the flowers that bloomed in front of my house...

243
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,739
Or what my Mom smiling face looked like...

244
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,611
Or how my Father drank his sake...

245
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,587
I came to this restaurant often with my parents...

246
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,560
I took our time together for granted...

247
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:49,399
I didn't think of it as precious memories to remember.

248
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,938
I didn't think there was a need to remember it...

249
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,433
What do you do besides parking things?

250
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:32,509
I help out with liquor delivery and stuff like that.

251
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,012
Then what did you do before that?

252
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,714
Did you work before this?

253
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,752
Or are you divorced with children?

254
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:46,256
Or did you have an affair and your wife stopped loving you?

255
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,362
You're not laughing?

256
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,268
What are you going to do if you know about my past?

257
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:03,073
I still don't know anything about you!

258
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,042
If you don't talk about it, I won't know...

259
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:09,312
Even if you don't say anything, you can tell that you ate yakiniku by looking at your clothes.

260
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,089
That's true..

261
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:28,498
I show everyone what i eat every day.

262
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,042
I'm gonna use the restroom real quick.

263
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:07,070
You were exhausted today because of me right?

264
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,872
Later!

265
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,341
Good night!

266
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,147
Antonio.

267
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,055
My name is...

268
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,825
Antonio Shinozaki Rui.

269
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,898
Your nickname?

270
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,568
That is my real name.

271
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,041
I did kickboxing.

272
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,447
I'm 24 years old.

273
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,852
I did a lot of bad things...

274
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,225
But that's not the case now!

275
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,804
That's why...

276
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:19,109
I'm not good at talking about myself...

277
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:26,149
Then i acted like that earlier...

278
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:27,250
Umm..

279
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,252
Is that so?

280
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,392
I'm sorry about asking you unpleasant things.

281
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,861
Or rather...

282
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,898
You're not an old man huh?

283
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,607
Thanks for taking me home.

284
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,443
See you later.

285
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,166
Yes! Yes!

286
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,869
Alright. I accepted your offer.

287
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,672
Thank you for the cooperation.

288
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,581
Kashiwagi-san. Do you have a second?

289
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,817
Yes!

290
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,621
Pardon me.

291
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,257
Have a seat.

292
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,738
You can have this.

293
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,705
What is it?

294
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,808
It's a birthday present of course!

295
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:02,679
Didn't you give me those concert tickets last week?

296
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,917
Didn't those go to waste because you don’t really listen to music?

297
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,086
That's why i got you something else!

298
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,823
It's a necklace that would look good on you!

299
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,294
Why don't you put this on and have a nice meal?

300
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:21,231
A girl that i know, recommends this good French restaurant...

301
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,999
Pardon me

302
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,871
Excuse me! A customer from yesterday is on line 3!

303
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,606
Okay!

304
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,942
Pardon me

305
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,998
What is this?

306
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,466
Is this a patience tournament?

307
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,768
If you speak then you lose?

308
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,339
Hey Rui!

309
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,576
The chief came out of his way to see you!

310
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,878
Come back to the gym

311
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:11,448
Let's start over again okay?

312
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,387
I'm sorry...

313
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,460
Let me ask you one thing.

314
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,829
Where have you been until now?

315
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,472
Rui!

316
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:41,911
I thought of this when i found you in the underground martial arts ring!

317
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,814
This guy isn't from the underworld!

318
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:48,118
He's a guy that should be a world champion!

319
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,389
I'm not saying that the building keeper is bad!

320
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,391
But

321
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,160
Are you okay with doing that forever?

322
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,772
I understand very well.

323
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,341
If you aren't gonna talk then I'm leaving!

324
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,142
Chief!

325
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:18,081
I went to prison.

326
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:28,825
I was imprisoned for 3 years and 5 months.

327
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,988
During those times...

328
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:08,465
The Coach who picked me up taught me about the underground games.

329
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:17,040
Oh, i changed my phone. My name is Machi from the Yokohama Station.

330
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,843
There was an incident involving your son...

331
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,947
I'll hand the phone over to your lawyer.

332
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,555
Hello?

333
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:36,593
He switched over to me. My name is Kaneko the lawyer.

334
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,239
Sakamoto!

335
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,409
Where are you planning on going with all that money?

336
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,145
I was like a bodyguard.

337
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,485
Hey Antonio!

338
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:05,622
Tell him about the rules of the Ouroboros.

339
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:14,230
Betrayal will result in severe punishment.

340
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,073
Give me a break!

341
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,578
If you do this then you'll get caught someday!

342
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,749
If you don't want to help Shinogi then give back the borrowed money!

343
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,853
If not then would you like your wife and child who ran away to give it back?

344
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,227
Alright, I'll leave it to you!

345
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,596
Be sure to discipline him properly!

346
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,009
It's not like I betrayed you...

347
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,211
It's just...

348
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,950
I wanted to start things over with my family.

349
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,188
Hey...

350
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,891
I'm begging you...

351
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,559
I'm begging you!

352
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,662
Please let me go!

353
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:26,235
If you have a family then you understand right?

354
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:40,350
I... don't have a family!

355
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,821
Open up!

356
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,023
This is the police!

357
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:59,102
I did unforgivable things...

358
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,699
Antonio?

359
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,103
I'm happy that you're doing well.

360
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,107
But haven't you gotten pretty thin?

361
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:48,217
Doesn't this bring back the memories?

362
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,656
Oh, wow. That looks good!

363
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,725
Be careful with your fingers.

364
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,905
You're not with those guys anymore?

365
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:21,651
In that case you should smile more openly!

366
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,422
You look more wonderful when you smile!

367
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,226
Like that! Like that!

368
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:34,297
Don't forget that smile!

369
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,507
Sister..

370
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,278
Are you able to change your baptismal name once you decided it?

371
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:52,582
Oh,my! Isn't it a strong and good name?

372
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,351
If I have the vitality I can do anything!

373
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,353
Right?

374
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:04,594
The children made this right here.

375
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:08,731
Give this to a good person you encounter.

376
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,054
It hurts!

377
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,464
Don't plead guilty.

378
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,400
Good guys just look at idiots.

379
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,058
Is this your house?

380
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,828
Boss?

381
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,298
Umm... why?

382
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:19,101
I have some important work matters to discuss with you.

383
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:24,640
Then... there's a coffee shop in front of the train station if you'd like...

384
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,443
Don't worry about it. It'll be quick.

385
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,047
But...

386
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:43,726
Umm... are we going to talk about work?

387
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:46,329
It must be tough living alone right?

388
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,799
Did you graduate university without your eye sight?

389
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,336
You must have been popular during university.

390
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,377
You haven't opened it...

391
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:06,883
If you can talk about this at work, can you go home for today?

392
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,825
Sit down.

393
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:38,014
Just as i thought. It looks really good on you.

394
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,192
Stop!

395
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,499
Damn you!

396
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:02,705
Why do you have to be so scared?

397
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,144
Listen to me

398
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,379
I'm talking to you!

399
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,650
Stop that right now!

400
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:18,054
I'm talking to you!

401
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,056
Stop it!

402
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,727
Please forgive me...

403
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:28,564
You don't like pain either do you?

404
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,368
Stop it! Stop it!

405
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,740
Who the hell are you?

406
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,242
Stop it...

407
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,178
Old man?

408
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,590
Stop it!

409
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:58,828
I'm...I'm...her boss

410
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,100
I'm begging you!

411
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,170
I'm telling you to stop!

412
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,950
Look into my eyes.

413
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,519
The next time..

414
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,188
I'll kill you.

415
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,545
Are you okay?

416
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,819
Why didn't you listen to me?

417
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,826
Will you take responsibility for me being fired?

418
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:10,399
Something like this happened and you still want to go back to the company?

419
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:17,006
Do you understand how tough it is for me to find a job?

420
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,080
That's why...

421
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:32,988
I'll go into work tomorrow like nothing happened...

422
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,826
Then do my job with a smile.

423
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:45,935
It's so i can live..

424
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:58,047
I'll take the responsibility...

425
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,919
What do you mean responsibility?

426
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:08,124
Why are you taking responsibility?

427
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:18,734
Because... i saved you Akari-san!

428
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,811
That's...

429
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:35,384
Do you know that makes me miserable?

430
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,527
Just go home...

431
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,277
I just reported my retirement.

432
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,483
But that didn't feel good enough.

433
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:52,655
If you have some time during the weekend, can you take me somewhere?

434
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,464
Why aren't you saying anything?

435
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:08,304
you said you're taking responsibility, so you can at least do that right?

436
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,108
Sure.

437
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,777
Sure.

438
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,523
Feels so good!

439
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,395
This place...

440
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:11,333
Is the place with my oldest memories.

441
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,640
I don't remember my Mother face.

442
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,310
But...

443
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:25,080
I remember us being together.

444
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:31,186
We walked on this beach.

445
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:39,628
She would hold on...

446
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,032
And slowly went into the ocean.

447
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:02,151
I think she was trying to kill us.

448
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,389
But..

449
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,128
I was the only one who survived.

450
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,838
I think sometimes...

451
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:30,345
Why didn't i die with her then?

452
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,961
Hey...

453
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,430
Look for sea glass.

454
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,966
Sea glass?

455
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:55,771
It's a colorful stone that has cracked and rounded corners.

456
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,220
Here.

457
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:30,939
If the glass is scraped enough right here then nobody will get hurt.

458
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:40,048
People who have been hurt become kind.

459
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,421
That's why...

460
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:51,260
I'm sure that something as painful as that has a meaning.

461
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,231
Don't you want to think that?

462
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,477
This sea glass...

463
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:12,881
Is the charm that holds us together.

464
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,751
Okay?

465
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:32,100
Hey, hey... what kind of wind is blowing around?

466
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,069
It's fine!

467
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,071
Yes! Yes! Like that!

468
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,674
Yes! Yes!

469
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,509
Come on! Like that

470
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,611
Over here!

471
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,479
Okay! Okay! Okay!

472
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,548
Break time

473
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,565
Welcome home!

474
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,435
I'm home!

475
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,154
What is that?

476
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:28,323
A bodyguard.

477
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,160
Come here.

478
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,363
Over here.

479
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,732
There he is!

480
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,400
He's biting it!

481
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,470
He's so strong!

482
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,907
Hey..

483
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,710
Think of a name.

484
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,245
Me?

485
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,082
It's the responsibility of the Godfather.

486
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,022
Then..

487
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,590
Suku.

488
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,358
Suku?

489
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,861
It seems like he'll grow up fast.

490
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,031
What the heck?

491
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,266
Okay!

492
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,037
Right Suku?

493
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,790
What is it?

494
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,595
The threshold is gone

495
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,299
Over here too.

496
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,239
Is that a window?

497
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,476
I made a new one for the sunlight to come in.

498
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,671
Thanks.

499
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:37,919
What is written on there?

500
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,590
The braille on your laptop.

501
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:49,231
It's my favorite line from Romeo and Juliet.

502
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,367
"Her eye discourses."

503
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,170
"I will answer it."

504
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,520
What is it?

505
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,623
I want to see your face.

506
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,928
Look into my eyes.

507
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,868
Are you looking?

508
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,038
I'm looking.

509
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,076
You liar.

510
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,590
From within! From within! That's right!

511
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,569
You wanna read too Suku?

512
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,307
That's right! That's right! Keep dodging like that!

513
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,097
Rui! Keep your guard up!

514
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,099
Go around! Go around!

515
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,420
I used to like winter but...

516
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,723
Now I hate it.

517
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,227
Why?

518
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,765
It seems like you have to bring along an important person.

519
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,444
Turn on your stomach.

520
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:13,895
Use your thumbs to massage the muscles near the spine.

521
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:22,971
Oh, does it hurt?

522
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,106
No, it feels good.

523
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:37,786
Did you get burned?

524
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,124
Yeah.

525
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,630
Why are you studying massaging?

526
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,167
I can't just laze around all day.

527
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,936
And you want me to do it right?

528
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,209
Akari.

529
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,479
I'm winning games and making money.

530
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,182
And i have a small workshop.

531
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:13,321
You've made vessels and vases.

532
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,426
You can do what you want.

533
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,932
I'll deliver it.

534
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,544
Sit down

535
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,846
Water!

536
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,614
How's your eyes? Okay?

537
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,049
Yes!

538
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,818
Listen up. I hate your opponents punches.

539
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,820
Just swing and get him good.

540
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,891
This is the last round! Qiue it to him!

541
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:05,940
Keep your guard up!

542
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,223
Round!

543
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:50,652
That was pretty good but you got em!

544
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,454
Jin-san!

545
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,757
Can you fix my eye?

546
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:57,559
It'll heal on it's own

547
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,594
She'll get mad.

548
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,464
She doesn't want your face to be all beat up on Christmas Eve?

549
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:06,267
You're gonna die of happiness!

550
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,870
Alright! I got it!

551
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:13,007
Listen up and remember this well.

552
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:22,116
When a person becomes love-struck, it's like a scalpel gets put into them.

553
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:23,084
Okay...

554
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,890
Shit! It's okay! It's okay!

555
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:29,724
Are you okay?

556
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,092
Yeah..

557
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,328
Well, it's like a medal.

558
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,799
Shall we drink with the Chief?

559
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,900
Yeah.

560
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,171
Way to go Antonio!

561
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,642
There's no opponents on the table huh?

562
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:50,278
It's so watery.

563
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,248
You should have called me when you got out.

564
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,750
You can't make any fight money with this guy anyways.

565
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,618
You!

566
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,353
Jin-san!

567
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,261
I decided never to go back again...

568
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:10,865
Let's go.

569
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,667
Yeah.

570
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:18,273
See you again.

571
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,889
Welcome home.
I'm home.

572
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,862
Let me check you.

573
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,507
It's not that swollen.

574
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,544
Are you going out somewhere?

575
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,713
Yeah!

576
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:02,417
Tomorrow is a special day after all.

577
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:26,107
You sing that often.

578
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:32,347
It's a song about having somewhere to return to.

579
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:07,215
It's my Mom and Dad.

580
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,889
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.

581
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:21,896
I brought back an important person like i promised.

582
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:24,799
Sorry about being late.

583
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:33,875
You thought that I'd bring someone more handsome?

584
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:43,084
4 years ago on Christmas...

585
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,187
I went on a trip with my family.

586
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:53,294
I just got my license but they made me drive instead of them.

587
01:13:55,964 --> 01:14:01,969
I thought that I'd take them to many more places.

588
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:41,576
I... don't have a family.

589
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,680
Hey open up!

590
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,181
This is the police!

591
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,083
We got a report!

592
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,696
Hurry up!

593
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:08,102
Please..

594
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:15,409
Just spare my family...

595
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,045
Stop it...

596
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:15,436
I feel like they are protecting me.

597
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:20,274
That's why I was able to meet a good person like you Rui.

598
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,937
Yo.

599
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,192
Suku!

600
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:14,161
Behave yourself!

601
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:39,253
Next month there will be a rivalry against the Kokuryu union.

602
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:45,459
People all over Kanto will gather there so there will be a big money prize.

603
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,830
Wanna give us a hand?

604
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:55,436
Kyosuke-san.

605
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,705
I'm already...

606
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:59,407
Don't say anything wrong damn it!

607
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,409
Kuji!

608
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,412
Sorry...

609
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:14,355
I can tell that there are people who died because of you.

610
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:24,131
It's hard to live by just going out during the day.

611
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:33,941
We are comrades who have been crowded out.

612
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:39,513
Let's get along and help each other live in the shade.

613
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,480
I'm home.

614
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:17,752
Akari?

615
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,741
Rui?

616
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:44,845
Sorry... i blacked out a little bit...

617
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:53,087
There are cracks in her ribs but...

618
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:57,024
It should heal if she gets some rest for a few weeks.

619
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,861
ls that right?

620
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,931
However...

621
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,567
There is a different problem.

622
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,806
It's about her eyes.

623
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:15,376
Apart from the aftereffects of the accident...

624
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:20,181
I found out that she had retinal detachment.

625
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:27,087
If we leave it alone, there's a big chance that she'll become completely blind.

626
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,862
It'll warm you up!

627
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,130
Tom made it.

628
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:11,665
Eat up!

629
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:18,172
That's right, everyone is making a music box this time.

630
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:20,708
We'll make it for you.

631
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,410
Is there a song that you like?
Sister...

632
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:36,290
How do i get my past sins forgiven?

633
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:39,260
I already told you.

634
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:44,832
you have to get atonement for it.

635
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:52,439
I haven't been atoned.

636
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:57,511
I haven't been atoned at all.

637
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:10,090
And on the contrary, there should be other people happy instead of me.

638
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:19,466
I always bring misfortune to everyone around me.

639
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:35,249
You have someone important to you right now right?

640
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:41,322
You can't change the past.

641
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,891
In that case..

642
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:51,632
You should support the things you need to support right now.

643
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,503
But...

644
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:01,175
Don't forget this Antonio!

645
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,479
The only person who hasn't forgiven you...

646
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,482
Is yourself.

647
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:38,112
Why didn't you say anything?

648
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:50,491
There's still time to get surgery and fix this.

649
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:59,500
Why don't you get surgery?

650
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,213
I'm fine like this!

651
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:16,216
You're here.

652
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,419
Furthermore...

653
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,789
It'll cost money...
I'll do something about the money!

654
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:27,361
This is your last chance to return back to normal.

655
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,164
I won't return back to normal.

656
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:35,502
I mean... my parents won't come back.

657
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:50,717
I remember how it was my fault that they died in the accident and it makes me frustrated....

658
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:57,157
That's why being like this is easier for me!

659
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,527
Sorry..

660
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,541
In the future...

661
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:17,644
When you have children...

662
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,915
Don't you wanna see their faces?

663
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:26,386
You'll get married...

664
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,790
And move into a new house.

665
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:40,134
I want you to see your happiness with your own eyes!

666
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,843
Are you okay?

667
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:53,280
I wonder if I'll get better soon?

668
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,756
What's wrong

669
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:06,493
It's nothing...

670
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,929
I broke up with her.

671
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:47,234
So promise me that you won't get her involved anymore!

672
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:04,318
How heroic.

673
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:11,124
I understand.

674
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,828
One match is fine.

675
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,964
If you win it then I'll set you free.

676
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,632
The fight money.

677
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:19,933
Of course. I'll pay you.

678
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:21,368
Right now!

679
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,837
Kuji!

680
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,552
It's advance payment for right now.

681
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,964
Are you crazy?

682
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:53,900
You won't be able to come back to this world anymore!

683
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:55,702
I know..

684
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:57,304
Why?

685
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,906
You just have one more match in the tournament!

686
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:03,210
Weren't you going to be the champion?

687
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:07,314
With your talent you can be

688
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,668
Do what you want.

689
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:35,042
Also...

690
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,245
I have one more favor to ask of you.

691
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:41,281
Ask whatever.

692
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:46,687
I don't have money!

693
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,600
I'm off.

694
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,740
It's just like you said.

695
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:12,145
The place where I get married, and the new house I move into.

696
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:16,383
I want to see it together and choose together.

697
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,986
The faces of our children too!

698
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:25,025
I want to see our future together!

699
01:29:27,628 --> 01:29:30,163
And your face too of course!

700
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:34,501
I want to confirm whether you're handsome or not.

701
01:29:38,172 --> 01:29:41,274
I'm way uglier than you think.

702
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,744
So prepare yourself.

703
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:20,847
Shall we go now?

704
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,816
Okay!

705
01:30:50,511 --> 01:30:52,446
Hang in there.

706
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:59,679
Are you ready?

707
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:05,619
Will this really be it?

708
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:09,556
If you win that is.

709
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:16,630
It should be easy for you now right?

710
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:24,104
Nothing has changed.

711
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:27,340
No gloves or referees.

712
01:32:27,475 --> 01:32:30,610
It doesn't end until the opponent faints or dies.

713
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:33,813
It's complete KO settlement rules.

714
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,354
Oh, that's right.

715
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:45,892
I forget to tell you this but your opponent changed.

716
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,970
Complete punishment for betrayal huh?

717
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:14,654
You okay with this?

718
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:18,825
This means becoming someone's acquaintance right?

719
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:24,531
Conflict isn't popular these days right?

720
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:28,401
Let's get along okay?

721
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:10,456
It's a terrible farce huh?

722
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:49,796
I'm taking them off.

723
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,969
Please open your eyes slowly.

724
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:53,092
Just like you said, i gave half of the reward money to Akari-chan.

725
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:57,563
Then i gave the other half to the person called Sakamoto Maiko-san.

726
01:38:57,998 --> 01:38:59,499
Thank you.

727
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:03,503
Who is that? Are you two-timing?

728
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:09,876
It's the wife of someone who died because of me.

729
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,849
I heard that Akari-chan's surgery went well.

730
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:19,919
The postoperative transition was good too.

731
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:23,389
Thank goodness...

732
01:39:23,691 --> 01:39:25,892
I'm really glad...

733
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:28,328
Where are you?

734
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,330
Hurry and come home!

735
01:39:30,331 --> 01:39:32,332
Okay?

736
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:35,969
I'm going to bet again.

737
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:38,204
Rui?

738
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,312
Kashiwagi-san?

739
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:57,717
Can you move out already?

740
01:40:57,818 --> 01:41:00,319
You're the only one left.

741
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:06,893
A request to tnoue out of Casa Bianca.

742
01:41:28,348 --> 01:41:30,950
Are you moving

743
01:41:32,152 --> 01:41:34,987
I'm glad we made it in time!

744
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:39,092
This is from Antonio Shinozaki Rui-san!

745
01:42:18,932 --> 01:42:22,602
Thanks for waiting.

746
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:33,179
It's you....

747
01:42:34,882 --> 01:42:39,051
I heard from Antonio.

748
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:44,891
He was able to meet a precious person.

749
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:49,295
But..

750
01:42:49,763 --> 01:42:56,469
He told me he has no right to be by your side.

751
01:42:57,471 --> 01:43:03,042
He caused the accident to happen that day...

752
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:21,661
Antonio has always been blaming himself.

753
01:44:49,716 --> 01:44:52,551
2 years later

754
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:02,161
Hey, come, here!

755
01:45:02,162 --> 01:45:04,497
Hold on.

756
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,068
Good work!
Good work!

757
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,370
Here! This is this week's delivery!

758
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,374
You made it just in time boss!

759
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:21,280
The mugs sold out, so please give me 20 more by the end of the month.

760
01:45:21,281 --> 01:45:22,948
Understood!

761
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,786
The shop will be open on Sunday but can you do something for me?

762
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:28,154
Sure

763
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:30,523
Are you going to volunteer again?

764
01:45:32,192 --> 01:45:35,328
You're waiting like a good boy!

765
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,028
Good afternoon

766
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:37,096
Good afternoon

767
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,764
Good afternoon!

768
01:45:38,765 --> 01:45:40,766
I'm going out.

769
01:45:44,638 --> 01:45:46,806
It doesn't hurt?

770
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:51,377
Good afternoon!

771
01:45:51,411 --> 01:45:53,145
Are you doing well Saito-san?

772
01:45:53,146 --> 01:45:57,049
I'm not well! My body is stiff and frail!

773
01:45:57,918 --> 01:46:00,853
This is the promised item that I made!

774
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:04,323
This is the homemade cup?

775
01:46:09,329 --> 01:46:11,530
This is the real deal!

776
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:13,666
Did you make this Akari-chan?
Yep!

777
01:46:14,901 --> 01:46:18,771
You're not just good at massages huh?

778
01:46:18,772 --> 01:46:21,440
This is my main business!

779
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:24,510
There's a shop in front of the station so when you get better let's go to it!

780
01:46:24,544 --> 01:46:26,746
I'll go! I'll go! I'll go right away!

781
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:29,048
Then should we start?

782
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:31,684
Does it hurt?

783
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,252
It doesn't hurt! Feels good!

784
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:35,221
Are you doing your rehab properly?

785
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:37,656
I'm doing my best.

786
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,365
Good afternoon.

787
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,301
You're new huh?

788
01:46:51,705 --> 01:46:53,706
It looks like he doesn't talk.

789
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:58,778
He hasn't said a word since he came here 2 weeks ago.

790
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:20,099
I'm a volunteer named Kashiwagi.

791
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:23,169
Will you let me massage you?

792
01:47:29,476 --> 01:47:32,912
Pardon me.

793
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:38,851
It doesn't hurt?

794
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:00,739
Yuudai Takahashi-san.

795
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,934
You'll get better.

796
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:30,936
Please do your best

797
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:37,543
Saito-san, please use the hot water!

798
01:48:37,544 --> 01:48:38,978
Sure!

799
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,213
I'll come again!

800
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:52,685
Alright, I'm gonna go buy some lunch!

801
01:49:52,686 --> 01:49:53,919
See you later!

802
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,488
I'll leave you in charge of the delivery!

803
01:49:56,489 --> 01:49:57,590
I'm off!

804
01:49:57,791 --> 01:50:00,960
Let's go! Let's go! Over here!

805
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:30,456
Welcome.

806
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:59,351
That's a Kinmokusei.

807
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:03,255
When the flowers bloom it smells really good.

808
01:51:05,392 --> 01:51:07,993
Do you want this one?

809
01:51:35,121 --> 01:51:40,759
Oh, I'm sorry! That's not for sell.

810
01:52:05,518 --> 01:52:10,089
It's a song about having a place to return back to.

811
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:27,039
Thanks for waiting!

812
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:30,242
Are you okay?

813
01:52:51,865 --> 01:52:54,833
Suku!

814
01:52:54,834 --> 01:52:56,468
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

815
01:52:56,469 --> 01:52:58,904
Hey! Come over here!

816
01:52:58,905 --> 01:53:01,039
I'm sorry! He's always well-behaved!

817
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,041
Are you hurt?

818
01:53:05,111 --> 01:53:07,379
Wait..

819
01:53:09,182 --> 01:53:12,084
Are you the person i massaged in the hospital before?

820
01:53:12,685 --> 01:53:16,088
Where are you going? I'll take you!

821
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:25,564
Suku! Geez..

822
01:53:25,865 --> 01:53:27,900
What's wrong

823
01:53:30,103 --> 01:53:32,237
Over here

824
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:34,239
Suku!

825
01:53:34,607 --> 01:53:36,909
Geez! What's wrong?

826
01:53:39,712 --> 01:53:42,214
Sorry for being late!

827
01:53:42,282 --> 01:53:43,715
Huh?

828
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,585
We sold a Kinmokusei

829
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:47,786
Is that so?

830
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:52,558
But like... is this song really that moving?

831
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:58,463
A customer earlier started crying when he heard this song.

832
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:14,580
Did that person have a crutch?

833
01:54:15,181 --> 01:54:17,583
Yes he did...

834
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:23,355
Sorry, can you take care of Suku?

835
01:54:26,559 --> 01:54:27,326
Boss?

836
01:54:27,327 --> 01:54:28,493
Boss?

837
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:49,508
I don't even know their name.

838
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:56,281
They're from a distant island...

839
01:55:56,950 --> 01:56:09,361
One of the flowing palm trees...

840
01:56:12,665 --> 01:56:21,974
Away from the shore of of my hometown...

841
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:30,282
Thou shalt be in the waves..

842
01:56:30,283 --> 01:56:32,050
Rui!

843
01:57:09,422 --> 01:57:14,860
This isn't the place you return to.

844
01:57:21,267 --> 01:57:24,469
Let's go back together!

845
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:45,090
Look into my eyes.

846
01:58:01,707 --> 01:58:04,843
Welcome home!

847
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:13,985
I'm home!

848
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,301
I'm home...
