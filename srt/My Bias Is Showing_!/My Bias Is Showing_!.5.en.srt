[4 hours before the incident]

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,440
Have you considered

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,540
I mentioned to you?

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,690
I'm very interested in you,

10
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,090
Mr. Na.

11
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,550
If you already have

12
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,260
a partner...

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,020
Well... I don't...

14
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,030

15
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,590
[How shameless.]

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,730
That's great.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,530
Oh.

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,130
Don't pick up

19

the wine glass.

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,289
Like this.

21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,710
Okay.

22
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,290
M-Mr. Na.

23
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,430
Are you okay?

24
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,660
[I guess]

25
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,340
[I should end here for today.]

Let's go.

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,120
I'll send you home.

28

Okay.

29
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,140
Let's go.

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,420
Thank you.

31
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,680
[I didn't know there was a construction,
so I took a detour.]

32

[Could you give me five more minutes?]

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,950
Okay, got it.

34
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,410
Okay.

35
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,070
Mr. Na.

36
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,020
Mr. Na Aejoon?

37
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,500
-Mr. Na. Where do you live?
-What?

38
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,540
Why do you keep calling me mister?

39
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,870
Huh?

40
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,520
I mean.

41
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,640
You flirted with me.

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,720
Are you being serious?

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Seriously?

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,570
Yes, well... I'm serious.

45
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,940
Then you shouldn't keep calling me that.

46
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,800
It feels so distant.

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,140
You keep calling me Mr. Na.

48
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,210
You're like a fantasy,
yet you keep appearing around me.

49
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,040
I can't even tell

50
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,080
whether this is a dream or reality.

51
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,250
I can't believe you'd come to me.

52
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,080
I'm so unbelievably...

53
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,060
happy.

54
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,060
I hope you won't disappear

55
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,560
when I open my eyes tomorrow.

56
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,420
Then,

57
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,010
do you want to be with me today?

58
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,170
When you open your eyes tomorrow,

59
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,240
I'll be there too.

60
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,960
[Episode 5: I was the one who
was pulling him in, but why...]

61
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,360

62
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,820
when I open my eyes tomorrow.

63
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,520
Then,

64
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,330
do you want to be with me today?

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,620
I'm dreaming again.

66
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,220
Why do you keep showing up?

67
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,770
Making me so flustered.

68
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,530
Why do you always...

69
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,030
And then I completely blacked out.

70
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,600
Die, Na Aejoon.

71
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,170
Just die!

72
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,260
How dare I kiss Siyeol when I couldn't

73
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,160
differentiate between real life and dream?

74
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,720
I know you're awake.

75
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,290
Wash up and eat.

76
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,250
I...

77
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,600
am at Siyeol's place.

78
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,980
I've only seen this place on livestreams.

79
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,600
My manager said he's coming up now.

80
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,880
N-N-Now?

81
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,720
I got a call from him at the door.

82
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,920
And?

83
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,890
I made him leave by saying
I'd be down in 10 minutes.

84
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,470
Ah...

85
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,880
Th-Thank god.

86
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,960
Have a seat.

87
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,400
You have to eat and go to work.

88
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,230
Oh, I'm fine.

89
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,290
I feel like I keep causing you trouble...

90
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,730
I'll get going.

91
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,670
Mr. Siyeol, a-about yesterday...

92
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,170
Just Siyeol.

93
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,790
What?

94
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,540
You called me just Siyeol yesterday.

95
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,130
What have you done,

96
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,910
Na Aejoon?

97
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,000
Was I... that rude?

98
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,270
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,460
Why?

100
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,030
I prefer it when you call me that.

101
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,670
There's still time,
so just eat before going to work.

102
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,790
You know we're shooting today, right?

103
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,650
See you at school.

104
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,050
Thank you.

105
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,110
I'm leaving.

106
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,660
By the way,

107
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,330
someone saved as "Kyukyu"

108
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,370
called you.

109
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,710
Oh...

110
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,380
He kept calling.
He's probably worried.

111
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,110
I was thinking if I should pick it up,
but I didn't.

112
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,660
Who is... he?

113
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,760
Since you saved his contact
under a nickname,

114
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,330
I guess he's quite close to you.

115
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,420
In this situation,

116
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,450
if I were to tell him everything...

117
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,790
He's my roommate.

118
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,860
You know him too. His name is Ji Kyusung.

119
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,820
Ji Kyusung?

120
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,900
You mean the Chief Manager?

121
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,890
Yes.

122
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,080
He's my cousin.

123
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm actually
living under someone else's roof.

124
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,560
So you've been hiding it from me?

125
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,520
I didn't hide it–

126
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,220
I mean,

127
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,040
if you know Mr. Ji,
there's no way you don't know A-One.

128
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,070
Wait.

129
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,320
You saying you didn't know me at school
was all a lie?

130
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,320
It wasn't...

131
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,340
Well...

132
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,610
I'm actually your fan...

133
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,540
You're even my fan?

134
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,370
Wait.

135
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,070
Then you got drunk

136
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,470
and came into my house
to get close to me?

137
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,570
It's not like that.

138
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,010
No, it's not like that.

139
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,600
Wh-Where are you touching me?

140
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,590
You're pissing me off!

141
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,070
This is making me very flustered
and annoyed.

142
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,230
I'm sorry, Siyeol.

143
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,450
Wait, listen to me.

144
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,260
S-Stay away from me.

145
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,310

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,650
He's my nephew.

148
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,060
He keeps asking me for pocket money.

149
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,260
I see.

150
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,800
I'm leaving.

151
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,510
See you later.

153
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,820
Right.

Siyeol, my favorite.

155
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,840
I saw this on Siyeol's live.

156
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,830
I shouldn't touch it.

157
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,290
How can he be so sexy both inside and out?

158
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,620
And so gentle and kind too?

159
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,290
I get to look around his house?

160
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,710

Okay. Do well.

See you.

197

Take care.

Yes.

203
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,960
He said "see you" to me.

204
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,400
I don't think it's for you but me.

205
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,900
But he's so tall...

206
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,420
This tall?

207
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,020
Shush! Come over.

Do you want to watch the news?

210
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,990
There's news about the follow-up song.

-Already?
-Yeah.

212

-Can I touch it once? Please.
-Sorry.

232
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,190
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,690
Just let me have a look.

234
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,990

238
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,730
Really?

239

Never mind. We're late.

243
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,290
Do they have any manners?

244
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,220
Just ignore them.

It's cold, right?

Hey, how can you make such a joke?

266

It's not a joke.

267

Are you afraid I'm just all talk?

I'll let some lines introducing
the school uniforms to the script.

So don't tell anyone
that we live together.

375
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,790
Do you want to
come to my house after work?

376
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,430
It was quite a pity you left in a rush.

377
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,870
Can you handle it today?
