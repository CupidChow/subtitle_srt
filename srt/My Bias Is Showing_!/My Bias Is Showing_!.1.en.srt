[*Cosplaying as a nonfan]

181
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,130
Why did I...

182
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,010
[Principal's Office]

183
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,250
I'm Choi Siyeol, a member of A-One.

184
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,470
Please take care of me.

185
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,140
Siyeol...

186
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,540
Why are you here?

187
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,720
Well, as we discussed over the phone,

188
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,740
we're going to film a video of Siyeol

189
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,180
experiencing campus life for two months.

190
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,890
The recording will only be
in the afternoon on working days.

191
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,190
-We'll do our best...
-My heart is going to explode.

192
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,740
-To not affect the school.
-This doesn't feel real...

193
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,850
Thank you so much for
cooperating with us on our filming.

194
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,850
Of course.

195
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,090
Applause.

196
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,100
Well...

197
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,940
Our cafeteria has been renovated.

198
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,150
We can promote that too, right?

199
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,900
Of course.

200
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,270
Don't worry, sir.

201
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,250
We will film them beautifully for you.

202
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,400
Thank you.

203
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,710
We'll give you thorough introductions.

204
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,710
-So, let us know if you need anything.
-Sure.

205
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,300
Oh.

206
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,660
By the way,

207
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,560
we need a teacher who could guide Siyeol.

208
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,940
-I hope you could...
-Of course.

209
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,980
Well,

210
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,330
we have Mr. Kim Hyungjoo here–

211
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,490
I want Mr. Na Aejoon to guide me.

212
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,640
Mr. Na

213
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,600
Aejoon.

214
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,950
Mr. Na

215
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,100
Aejoon.

216
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,940
M-M-Me?

217
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,320
Me? You want me?

218
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,900
You don't want to?

219
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,410
How could I not?

220
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,900
But...

221
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,640
I just wanted to see him from afar...

222
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,470
B-But...

223
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,160
Since this is going all going
to be on a show,

224
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,930
-shouldn't we choose a someone who's...
-Yes.

225
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,860
-More natural and experienced...
-Yes.

226
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,660
O-O-Of course.

227
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,620
I just became a teacher.

228
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,380
I'm sure Mr. Kim Hyungjoo
would do a better job at this.

229
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,220
Yes, yes.

230
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,420
No.

231
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,870
I want to work with Mr. Na Aejoon.

232
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,960
Mr. Na Aejoon

233
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,510
is my...

234
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,630
type.

235
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,460
After all, I'm a variety show newbie.

236
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,170
And Mr. Na also
just recently became a teacher.

237
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,370
I think we'd get along well.

238
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,030
Ms. Han. We have a recording,
so we gotta go.

239
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,620
Shall we wrap this up for today then?

240
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,460
Okay.

241
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,260
I'll take it as that's set.

242
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,540
Please take care of me.

243
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,150
Bye.

244
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,780
Sir, let's go eat.

245
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,610
Sure.

246
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,480
He's so good looking in person.

247
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,540
He's born to be an artist.

248
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,150
Right?

249
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,760
Oh my, Mr. Na.

250
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,840
Are you okay?

251
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,330
You don't look well.

252
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,380
Y-Yes.

253
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm allergic to sunlight.

254
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,860
I'm fine.

255
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,670
I'm fine...

256
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,440
-Oh gosh!
-Are you okay?

257
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,660
What do I do?

258
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,590
Ji Kyusung!

259
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,260
Why didn't you tell me Siyeol
is coming to our school?

260
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
Why!

261
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,920
Ah... He's going to film it?

262
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,350
What kind of nonsense is this?

263
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,410
Tell me everything!

264
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,810
I didn't know either.

265
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,290
He rejected this previously.
Who'd know he'd pick it up again.

266
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,860
You're A-One's manager,
who else would know other than you?

267
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,530
You should have told me in advance.

268
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,900
No?

269
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,840
It's not like I know everything
about Choi Siyeol's schedules.

270
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,110
This is what I get
for cooking for you every day?

271
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,460
No more!

272
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,930
Food for you!

273
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,470
Never!

274
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,800
Then don't.

275
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,329
What's wrong with him?

276
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,500
Well... What can I do
when I don't own a place.

277
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,410
Here.

278
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,700
The landlord's son, please go ahead

279
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,099
and enjoy.

280
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,870
By the way,

281
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,420
your mum called me this afternoon.

282
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,390
She was worried she couldn't reach you.

283
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,340
My heart had too much to take
cause someone didn't warn me beforehand.

284
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,980
So I had no time to look at the phone.

285
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,510
Hello, I'm JJ.

286
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,150
Hello, I'm Choi Siyeol.

287
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,580
Hello, I'm Kyutae.

288
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,870
-Speaking of...
-We're here to practice.

289
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,580
Weren't you wailing all day long

290
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,770
cause you couldn't go for the concert
and fanmeet because you had exams?

291
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,330
You should be happy that

292
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,330
Choi Siyeol is going to your school.

293
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,630
You're right.

294
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,830
What's with that lukewarm reaction?

295
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:09,560
Normally you'd go, "Our Siyeol likes
sausage stir-fry."

296
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,360
"I'm so happy Siyeol came."

297
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,090
You should be making a bigger fuss
than this.

298
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,490
I'm happy. But...

299
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,660
Somehow I'm kinda scared.

300
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,860
Of what?

301
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,010
Well, it just feels like

302
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,820
a person I've been looking at from afar
is suddenly too close to me.

303
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm scared that I'd be too obvious
in school too.

304
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
I can't explain. It feels weird.

305
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,900
Speaking of...

306
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,290
What's Siyeol's type?

307
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,690
Someone pure?

308
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,340
Cute?

309
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,250
Or...

310
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,400
someone like me?

311
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,990
Sit down.

312
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,240
I said sit down.

313
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,050
What I'm saying is
I saw staff walking around just now.

314
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,540
It could be true.

315
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,330
-Really?
-Yeah.

316
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,510
I can't believe I can see Choi Siyeol
in my lifetype.

317
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,340
In that case, let me see my bias too.

318
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,880
Mr. Na, is that true?

319
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,430
Choi Siyeol–

320
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,130
Oh, my.

321
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,460
Mr. Na, are you going to a wedding?

322
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,670
Why are you dressed so...

323
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,220
I usually dress like this. Why?

324
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,860
I sleep like this sometimes too.

325
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,670
Let's start the class. Open the book.

326
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,460
-Yes.
-Yes.

327
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,730
Is this too much?

328
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,560
Should I take it off?

329
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,690
But this is the highlight.

330
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,430
It's better to take it off.

331
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,250
Good morning.

332
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,940
Mr. Na Aejoon.

333
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,680
S-Siyeol. You're here.

334
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,170
It's real.

335
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,920
It's real...

336
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,870
Siyeol...

337
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,560
is right in front of me.

338
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,990
You're on the way to the recording,
right?

339
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,370
Shall we go together?

340
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,950
I've never thought that I could be
walking around campus with Siyeol...

341
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,460
Wake up, Na Aejoon.

342
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,280
You need to come to your senses.

343
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,500
Buy my heart...

344
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,150
It's pretty.

345
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,960
Huh?

346
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,580
What is?

347
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,590
Oh, the school?

348
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,580
Y-Yes, it is.

349
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,300
Mr. Na.

350
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,420
Why do you keep avoiding my eyes?

351
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,430
You don't look into my eyes too.

352
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,960
Well...

353
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,280
I mean...

354
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,830
Did I upset you cause

355
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,070
I picked you?

356
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,880
No, i-it's not like that.

357
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,810
I'm just...

358
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,440
a little nervous.

359
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,050
Well, it's not too late yet.
Why not you request for another teacher...

360
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,890
No.

361
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,500
I said this.

362
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,350
You're my type.

363
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,180
Of course, I know, I'm your age,

364
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,420
and as a variety show newbie,
I'd be a good partner,

365
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,030
but if there could be
someone who's better at it...

366
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,270
I already said... you're my type.

367
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,560
What?

368
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,820
This is bad.

369
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,270
It's nothing about the variety show.

370
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,650
But Mr. Na Aejun...

371
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,850
No matter how I look at it...
My bias is...

372
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,450
Is my ideal type.

373
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,020
Flirting with me.

374
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,260
[In the next episode]

375
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,220
Have you thought about me?

376
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,300
How do I respond to that...

377
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,370
-I like it.
-What?

378
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,530
Do you want to eat
instant noodles with me?

379
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,650
Huh?

380
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,880
I don't know how I should respond.

381
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,680
Gosh. I'm so happy.

382
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,170
Shall we ask them to
switch Mr. Na Aejoon out?

383
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,280
Let it as it is.

384
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,760
He's cute, isn't he?

385
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,480
Shall we fulfil each other's wishes?

386
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,210
Is there nothing you want me to do?
