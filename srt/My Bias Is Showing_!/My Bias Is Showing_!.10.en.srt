Since when did it begin?

7
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,610
I hope our first kiss

8
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,370
will linger on

9
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,460
in your memory.

10
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,720
Was it when we had our first kiss?

11
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,280
I was listening to your song.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,890
Your lyrics are, how should I put it...

13
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,180
They're rich and resonate with me.

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,450
Really comforting.

15
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,580
Or when you said you liked my song

16
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,870

Are you... okay?

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,220
Maybe it started when

22
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,990
I first met you.

23
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,510
Since then, I've been spending every day

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,350
and every moment in my life...

25
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,520

I've liked you for a long time.

What?

56

You broke up with me
because you found someone new.

Okay.

80
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,080
I told you before, didn't I?

81
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,520
If you don't make it clear
and try to gloss over it, I'll kill you.

has been stalking me.

What?

85
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,780
He asked me if I broke up
with the guy I was seeing

86
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,990
and why we broke up.

87
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,820
Damn it. I thought
I'd gotten him off your tail.

88
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,200
So? What did you say?

89
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,300
Why?

90
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,760
Scared that I said we were still dating?

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,950
You're just about to
begin a major project.

92
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,550
If this scandal hinders your career—

93
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,070
I...

94
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,060
I thought you'd...
really found someone new.

95
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,970
I thought you'd really abandoned me.

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,010
Oh? Isn't that Yeon Jooha?

97
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,400
Yeon Jooha?

98
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,380
I've always hated this about you.

99
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,180
You never talk things out with me
and come to conclusions on your own.

100
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,290
This pissed me off so much
that I wanted to just forget about it...

101
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,190
but I just can't get over
how ridiculous this is.

102
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,940
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,880
I was wrong.

104
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,410

Speaking of which,
it's such a pity, Mr. Na.

109
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,980
Aren't there just three sessions
of my internship left?

110
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,860
That's right.

111
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,960
But you have to return to your actual job,

112
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,610
so it can't be helped.

113
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,710
So, for the students who finished
the college entrance exam,

114
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,240
I've prepared a huge gift today.

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,790
Let's go present it to them together!

116
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,250
I'm looking forward to it.

117
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,940
It's the last of "Go! School Teacher."

118
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,750
Let's get started right now!

119
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,010
Cut!

120
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,290
Time for the slate.

121
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,180
Take a break while we make adjustments.

122
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,330
Is the footage okay?

123
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,610
Okay.

127
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,420
Yes.

128
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,010
I'll be right back.

129
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,590
-What's wrong?
-Well...

130
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,320
Can we switch these two dates?

131
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,660
I told you we can't.

132
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,710
Please show up on the day
of the school festival.

133
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,140
Isn't the whole period the festival?

134
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,270
What,

135
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,870
I have to return to my actual job,

136
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,580
so it can't be helped?

137
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,780
Pfft.

138
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,010
Why are you acting like
we'll never meet again?

139
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,920
That hurt my feelings.

140
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,220
I told you

141
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,390
I haven't forgiven you yet.

142
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,920
Even if you haven't,

143
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,230
you'll give me a pass, won't you?

144
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,100
Am I wrong?

145
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,270
The stars of the show, please come here.

146
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,110
-This way.
-Yes, okay.

147
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,950
Well...

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,440
Mr. Na, you're so handsome.

149
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,780
Tell us your IG handle!

150
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,620
What's with that response?

151
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,600
Also, he's getting way too popular.

152
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,070
This is worrying.

153
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,100
Thank you so much, really.

154
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,980
When you agreed to stay on until the end,

155
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,310
I didn't show it,

156
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,010
but I was really happy.

157
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,180
Don't mention it.

158
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,350
I should be apologizing.

159
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,090
Now I know why workplace romance is taboo.

160
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,640
There aren't many days left.

161
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,990
I'll do my best until the end.

162
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,680
Thank you.

163
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,750
So, have you thought about
what I asked you last time?

164
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,700
About what?

165
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,920
About the reality dating show.

166
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,470
Oh... that?

167
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,590
-The date has changed.
-Yeah.

168
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,590
What's the shooting schedule like?

169
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,510
-The schedule?
-Yes.

170
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,280
I'll find out.

171
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,130
Okay.

172
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,720
I think it's the following month.

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,380
The following month?

174
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,050
Yes.

175
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,980
It's the school holidays.

176
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,110
That's right.

177
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,370
Oh?

What's the shooting schedule like?

179
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,370
Seriously, how can a person
suddenly change so much?

180
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,240
Anyway,

181
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,550
don't even think about

182
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,160

183
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,370
you hear me?

184
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,450
I kind of want to see you cry again.

185
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,950
Hey.

186
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,160
Why aren't you answering me?

187
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,860
Got it.

188
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,600
Nobody would catch my eye anyway,

189
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
when you're right by my side.

190
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,410
I was scared for a moment.

191
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,450
No matter how I look at it,
you totally have the upper hand now.

192
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,160
You think so too, right?

193
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,360
What?

194
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,860
Why are you laughing?

195
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,060
Well, I've been a longtime fan of A-One,

196
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,570
but I don't think
I've ever seen you like this.

197
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,380
It's surprising.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,700
I find it surprising too.

199
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,900
Not to sound too cocky,

200
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,710
but I've never been the clingy one
in a relationship.

201
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,800
But now I'm screwed.

202
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,430
I'm so obsessed with you.

203
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,970
You're all I can think about, Na Aejoon.

204
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,580
That's a good thing.

205
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,450
Keep it up.

206
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,730
Oh!

207
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,610
What is this?

208
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,140
Oh, that? A present for you.

209
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,410
It's new merch.

210
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,200
I didn't want to ruin mine,
so I've never worn it.

211
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,970
Awesome. I love it.

212
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,560
So you already have one.

213
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,820
You know what,

214
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,410
I think you like idol Choi Siyeol
more than you like me.

215
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,790
Didn't I hear this line

216
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,200
in one of my dreams?

217
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,570
Oh, of course not.

218
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,780
See?

219
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,790
You can't even answer.

220
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,640
Are you jealous?

221
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,390
This is also you, though.

222
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,470
So,

223
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,570
I want you to like me more.

224
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,540
Oh, come on, how can I
like you more than I do now?

225
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,760
Why can't you?

226
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,840
My love for you keeps growing by the day.

227
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,920
How about you just... move in with me?

228
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,560
Move in?

229
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,820
Who's that?

230
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,690
Did you order takeout?

231
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,810
Hey, Choi Siyeol.

232
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,780
Why are you both here?

233
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,770
I'm hungry.

234
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,220
We bought champagne.

235
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,160
Here.

236
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,880
It's super expensive.

237
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,800
Here.

238
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,580
Thank you.

239
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,370
You said you weren't coming
after that day.

240
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,730
What happened?

241
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,950
Now that you're in a relationship,
you've become so cold to me.

242
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,600
Pfft.

243
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,550
I mentioned I was coming today
ahead of time.

244
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,860
You did?

245
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,940
To whom?

246
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,930
To Aejoon.

247
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,100
Ae... Aejoon?

248
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,710
I heard they met outside,

249
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,240
and they exchanged numbers.

250
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,960
Wait, you've

251
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,730
already dropped honorifics with him?

252
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,190
That's because

253
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,760
we're the same age.

254
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,200
We both understand give and take,

255
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
so we got close very quickly.

256
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,720
Give and...

257
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,770
take?

258
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,650
These are really rare!

259
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,700
I was so depressed when I didn't win it.

260
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,010
Thank you so much!

261
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,990
Just let me know if you need anything.

262
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,060
So, were you close to Ji Kyusung
since childhood?

263
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,370
Yeah, of course!

264
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,130
I have a photo of him in kindergarten.

265
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:38,740
Do you want it?

266
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,030
Do you have to ask? Come on!

267
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,070
Tada.

268
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,860
Wait,

269
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,230
why did he look like a troublemaker?

270
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,520
Right?

271
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,770
So cute!

272
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,640
Is that cute?

273
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,710
I also have a photo of Choi Siyeol
waking up when he was a trainee.

274
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,210
Is it wrong to show you this?

275
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,140
Of course not!

276
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,310
Wait. I'll look for more photos.

277
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,180
What is it?

278
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,990
Tell me.

279
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,240
Well...

280
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,560
I thought Jooha was a nice guy,

281
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,360
but he's far better than I expected.

282
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,660
I was wondering

283
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,910
who my dear Siyeol
became so obsessed over.

284
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,130
You have a good eye for people.

285
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,160
What's wrong with you two?

286
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,520
What are you two up to?

287
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,570
Enough about that.

288
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,870
Let's toast!

289
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,700
Raise your glasses.

290
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,530
You too.

291
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,190
The people I like are all here.

292
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,900
Wait, wait.

293
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,810
People?

294
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,300
Am I not the only one you like?

295
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,540
The public should see this side of Siyeol.

296
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,110
Well, Ji Kyusung is annoying sometimes,

297
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,600
but he's still family
that I can't live without,

298
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,850
and the other's Jooha,
a great friend I met thanks to Ji Kyusung.

299
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,090
And...

300
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,180
I still can't believe it,

301
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,140
but the Siyeol whom
I'd been fantasizing about.

302
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,660
I'm unbelievably happy

303
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,600
that we're all gathered here together.

304
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,690
You're right.

305
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,350
It's great.

306
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,160
Cheers.

307
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,630
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

308
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,480
Do you have more champagne?

309
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,130
No. Go home.

310
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,530
We're planning to stay until dawn.

311
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,730
Seriously, why are you
intruding on our date?

312
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,980
Don't you have shoots tomorrow?

313
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,910
No.

314
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,260
Why do you think I'm here?

315
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,970
Jooha.

316
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,120
We're still in the honeymoon phase.

317
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,580
Gosh.

318
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,780
Sometimes,

319
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,460
life takes you to unexpected places.

320
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,400
What time did you get here?

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,339
Aren't you cold?

322
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,760
Yeah.

323
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,140
Give me your hand.

324
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,960
When I'm done with the movie,
want to go on a trip?

325
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,770
Hmm... Where do you want to go?

326
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,050
Good job today.

327
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,400
Good job today.

328
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,260
See you at the dinner.

329
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,050
Let's go.

330
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,860
Okay.

331
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,600
Protecting something

332
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,890
requires a lot of resolve

333
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,500
and determination.

334
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,450
Oh... A contract-based position?

335
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,650
Yes.

336
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,220
Just for another year,

337
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,780
and then we'll consider
a permanent position for you.

338
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,670
Just do as you've done so far,

339
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,480
keeping a low profile
and focusing on classes.

340
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,050
You've been doing well,
haven't you, Mr. Na?

341
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,280
[One-Year Extension of
Fixed-Term Teacher Contract]

342
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,110
For responsibilities,

343
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,820
you have to make a lot of sacrifices.

344
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,090
Okay.

345
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,160
I'll do my best.

346
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,700
[Mom]
[Don't send me any more money, Aejoon.]

347
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,370
[Mom]
[Your siblings have grown up.]

348
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,830
[Mom]
[I'm grateful for all you've done so far.]

349
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,750
[Mom]
[I just want you to be happy.]

350
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,090
Be happy?

351
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,730
Principal.

352
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,620
Yes?

353
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,930
I'm sorry, but...

354
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,950
I'm quitting after the next semester.

355
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,130
W-What did you say?

356
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,690
I don't want to keep a low profile.

357
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,440
I want to teach kids in an institute

358
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,670
that needs me more.

359
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,810
Mr. Na Aejoon...

360
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,290
To seek what you want,

361
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,380
how much time and hardship
will it take?

362
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,450
Wait.

363
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,290
Mr. Na.

364
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,010
Mr. Na!

365
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,190
Is Siyeol busy
for the second half of the year?

366
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,200
Is he interested in hosting a music show?

367
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,610
A music show?

368
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,830
I thought he only had his looks to offer,

369
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,530
but he's also musically talented.

370
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll get back to you
once I check his schedule.

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,460
Ready.

372
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,280
Action.

373
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,570
You never know what your hard work

374
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,570
might amount to;

375
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,200
if any good comes out of it...

376
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,750
It's so good.

377
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,110
Insane.

378
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,020
Yes, it's his turn now!

379
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,770
This concept is so insanely good.

380
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,550
His agency didn't disappoint.

381
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,530
But sometimes...

382
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,250
luck also works in your favor.

383
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,860
Amid the banality and frustrations
of everyday life,

384
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,420
like my bias who suddenly
came into my life,

385
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,460
I hope everyone can be blessed with

386
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,390
a welcome

387
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,160
surprise.

388
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,780
Your performance today was so cool.

389
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,890
I watched it ten times!

390
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,280
Did you come right after the show?

391
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,310
Yeah.

392
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,350
I missed you so much,
so I came straight after.

393
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,060
Coming home to the one you love

394
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,590
is awesome.

395
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,270
I just stayed home,
and the one I love showed up.

396
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,770
Na Aejoon!

397
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,270
How about I lock you up in my house
for the rest of my life?

398
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,770
What?

399
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,390
Thank you for showing up in my life.

400
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,110
Thank you for coming into my world.

401
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,470
Oh, right!

402
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,840
["Go! School Teacher" Season 2]

403
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,340
Nice to meet you again.

404
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,420
Let's have a great time.

405
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,420
"Go! School Teacher" was well received
and scheduled to be aired on TV.

406
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,450
And my bias whom
I'm in a secret relationship with...

407
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,070
is still always flirting with me.

408
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,190
Let's take a group photo.

409
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,100
Okay.

410
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,440
Okay. Come on.

411
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Everyone, squeeze in.

412
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,840
Squeeze in.
Hyunji, hunch a little more.

413
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,510
Minjin and Joonseo, squeeze in.

414
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,530
Okay.

415
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,330
Here we go.

416
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,670
One, two, three!
