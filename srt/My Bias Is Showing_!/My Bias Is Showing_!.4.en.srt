I'm not rushing you to give me an answer.

98
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,690

I would have done something already.

Yeah.

112
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,270

-Your next film is very important to you–
-Did you

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,320
Yeah.

116
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,130
I'm not doing it.

117
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,900
Tell the CEO that too.

118
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,500
Even if Director Baek
comes to persuade me personally,

119
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,980
I won't change my answer.

120
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,140
Why did you change your mind now?

121
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,770
You attended the meeting
because you wanted to do it, didn’t you?

122
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,620
I did.

123
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,970
Back then, you,
Ji Kyusung, were still by my side.

124
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,420
If we wanted to meet all the time
while avoiding the public,

125
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,160
I had to work more frequently.

126
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,410
But I don't need to do that anymore.

127
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,110
I want to rest.

128
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,390
When this drama ends.

129
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,220
So,

130
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,630
just tell the CEO that too.

131
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,600
Jooha.

132
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,900
I still can't help liking you.

133
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,110
So I hope you don't
show up in front of me.

134
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,710
You should at least be considerate
about that.

135
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,010
I'm leaving.

136
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,390

138
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,350
I will not lose my greenness,

139
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,950
not even in the winter snow.

140

Hey, what's with Mr. Na?

145
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,450
I guess this is coming out in the exam.

146
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,010
Jot it down.

147
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,880
The winter snow...

148
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,480
Since the first time I met you,

149
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,970
I've been interested

in you.

151
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,900
[This fantasy-like situation
that no one would believe.]

152
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,110
[It's a situation that could
disappear anytime, just like mist.]

153
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,040
But just for a moment,

154
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,380
I wanted to put aside my worries

155
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,400
about reality and the future.

156
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,070
It has your scent now,
so I can't return it to the sponsor.

157
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,790
[It has your scent now,
so I can't return it to the sponsor.]

158
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,980
Oh no.

159
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,480
[Oh no. I shouldn't have borrowed it...]

160
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,730
I shouldn't have borrowed it...

161
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,280
That's a good thing.

162
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,980
I'm going to keep this.

163
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,020
[That's a good thing.
I'm going to keep this.]

164
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,190
This unbelievable happiness.

165
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,040
This is crazy.

166
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,110
I'm texting my bias one-on-one...

167
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,550
That's ridiculous.

168
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,860
He's the one who sent
the first text too!

169
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,680
What if he

170
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,640
finds out that I'm a fan

171
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,460
in the future?

172
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,890
What's going on?

173
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,040
Why are you back so early?

174
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah...

175
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,320
Great.

176
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,930
I have something to discuss with you.

177
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,540
I have a serious dilemma.

178
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,320
Never mind.

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,230
Go sleep.

180
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,430
I'll talk to you after I figure it out.

181
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,520
Go ahead.

182
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,260
Get some rest.

183
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,090
I'm sure it'll be okay
to put it off for a while, right?

184
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,230
He blue‑ticked me...

185
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,660
Well,

186
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,020
I met Kyusung.

187
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,150
I think he's seeing someone else.

188
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,190
Are you okay?

189
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,010
I thought it'd be a lot easier
for me to give up

190
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,200
after hearing him say that himself.

191
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,990
But I regret it.

192
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,820
Those words kept pricking my heart.

193
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,680
The more I think about it,
the worse it feels.

194
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,180
What should I do?

195
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,230
I think this will take a while.

196
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,340
I won't,

197
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,420
Jooha.

198
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,990
I will never

199
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,190
let you go.

200
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,230
I promise you.

201
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,290
Thanks.

202
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,760
Should I give you the dry‑cleaning fee?

203
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,490
[Mr. Na Aejoon:
Should I give you the dry‑cleaning fee?]

204
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,030
Can I have your account number?

205
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,060
[Mr. Na Aejoon:
Can I have your account number?]

206
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,950
Dry‑cleaning fee?

207
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,740
Forget the dry‑cleaning fee.
Buy me a meal.

208
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,480
[Forget the dry‑cleaning fee.
Buy me a meal.]

209
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,000
Do you want to meet today?

210
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,080
[Do you want to meet today?]

211
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,880
Do you have a reservation?

212
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,350
Well...

213
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,170
Sir?

214
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,110
Ah, yes.

215
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,970
Well...

216
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,670
Name...

217
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,470
I have a reservation.

218
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,160
Under Choi Siyeol.

219
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,130
This way, please.

220
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,650
Let's go.

221
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,030
I never thought I could ever see Siyeol
in his personal clothes with my own eyes.

222
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,160
This may be a bit rude
to the sacred Siyeol,

223
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,540
but I really want to...

224
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,670
touch his neck just once.

225
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,700
What do you want to eat?

226
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,170
Neck... What am I saying?

227
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,080
I-I...

228
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,180
I want pork neck.

229
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,990
Excuse me.

230
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,580
Please give me this and this.

231
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,340
A bottle of this, too.

232
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,080
Yes, sir.

233
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,420
Since I chose the restaurant
and the dishes,

234
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,910
it's on me today.

235
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,720
As for Mr. Na,

236
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,570
you can treat me next time.

237
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,840
No, I can't...

238
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,680
This is the only way I can make sure

239
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,380
we meet again next time.

240
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,710
How do you like the food?

241
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,100
I like it.

242
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,450
I always eat at the school cafeteria.

243
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,750
It's thanks to you I got to eat
at such a nice restaurant.

244
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,740
I'll make you something better next time.

245
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,140
Come hang out at my place.

246
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,060
What?

247
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,250
Well... I'm pretty good at cooking.

248
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,890
Oh, so you're good at cooking.

249
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,750
You must be busy with work.
How did you have time to learn to cook?

250
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,349
There's nothing you can't do–I mean–

251
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,750
well...

252
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,300
When is your next recording?

253
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,010
After your album promotions
and variety show filming,

254
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,030
you must be tired.

255
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,770
It's fun.

256
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,200
After all,
I can see the person I want to see

257
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,630
in the guise of recording.

258
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,600
What?

259
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,750
Is he talking about me?

260
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,390
Is he really flirting with me?

261
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,120
Am I not making hallucinating?

262
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,760
So,

263
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,890
are you considering what I told you?

264
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,660
I'm very interested

265
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,930
in you.

266
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,420
If you already have

267
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,450
a partner...

268
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,370
Well... I don't...

269
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,460
have a partner.

270
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,470
That's good.

271
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,490
Without picking up the glass–

272
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,420
just like this.

273
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,360
Okay.

274
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:39,150
[In the next episode]

275
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,930
I can't even tell
if it's a dream or reality.

276
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,920
How dare I kiss Siyeol?

277
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,150
What?

278
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,080
A hickey?

279
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,460
As you get older,
you become more worthless.

280
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,030
Yet you're still acting all arrogant.

281
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,460
Hey, everyone can hear you.

282
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,630
If you have other clothes aside,

283
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,160
I guess this is all you have today.

284
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
I have a reason for dressing like this...

285
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,260
Shall we take this chance
to go for a couple look?

286
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,680
Are you

287
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,730
interested in me too now?
