Mr. Na!

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,300
Why are you taking the bus today?

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,280
None of your business.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,420
Don't wander around and go home.

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,130
Got it?

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,770
We have to go to cram school anyway.

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,380
By the way, are you going somewhere nice?

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,060
Huh?

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,840
You've been smiling a lot lately.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,480
I've never seen you this happy before.

16
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,440
We'll get going, Mr. Na.

17
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,390
Yes, I'm happy.

18

Siyeol,

19
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,500
if I

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,490
tell you that I've liked you

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,690
since a long, long time ago,

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,850
how would you react?

23
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,820
Honestly, I'm more objective

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,660
because I'm not a fan.

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,200
His ankle injury was also

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,220
just a fake excuse to stop the backlash,

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,390
wasn't it?

28
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,770
A fake excuse to stop the backlash?

29
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,960
Sorry, due to time constraints—

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,030
So, are you saying

31
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,410
you'd risk your life
to cover up something like that?

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,110
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

33
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,400
This is the first time
I'm mentioning this to the public.

34
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,770
Yeon Jooha's leg injury...

35
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,340
was because of me.

36
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,500
At the time of the incident,

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,710
it was only revealed that

38
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,860
Yeon Jooha, a debut-group trainee,
injured his leg.

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,600
Since he wasn't famous back then,

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,520
news reports were all
based on our agency's statement.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,840
So, please don't ever
make such careless judgements again.

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,090
If anyone tries to slander Yeon Jooha,

43
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,860
I'll take corresponding measures

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,410
to rectify the situation.

45
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,380
Yeah, yeah, okay.

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,640
Seriously... So melodramatic.

I still like you a lot...

This is what you're concerned with, huh?

Hey, Choi Siyeol!

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,760
I've been meaning to ask you this.

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,700
Do you like Yeon Jooha?

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,010
I wonder if you'll feel the same way

55
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,010
as I do.

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,360
Yes.

Why are you dating him?

59
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:43,380
You knew your boyfriend was
dating someone else, but you...

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,510
you were just condoning it?

61

Boyfriend?

62
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,480
So, are you saying...

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,550
you hit on Na Aejoon because you think

64
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,390
he and I are dating?

65
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah.

commit to one person.

feeling guilty about
not telling you that we're relatives,

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,610
but you...

76
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,590
Forget it.

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,970
Okay.

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,480
If you're struggling...

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,430
I'm okay.

You don't want to?

95

Mr. Na Aejoon

96
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,440
is my ideal type.

97
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,630
I should've known that something was off.

111
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,039
I heard Siyeol is nearby.

112
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,429
I'm going to give him the concept plan.

113
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,720
I see.

114
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,799
How's the public reception?

115
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,539
Did it cause any trouble?

116
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,080
The reception is
more positive than we expected.

117
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,550
But after the talk with Mr. Ji,

118
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,960
Siyeol's been looking quite listless.

119
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,840
Where is he? I'll go with you.

120
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,550
Sure, let's go.

121
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,550
Jooha?

122
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,940
What brings you here?

123
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,960
He was shooting something nearby.

124
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,040
Do you want some food or drinks?

125
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,590
No, I'm good.

126
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,340
I'll go order our drinks
and make a call first.

127
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,650
Okay.

128
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,280
It's rare that you end so early.
You should go home and rest.

129
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,610
Why did you come here?

130
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,060
Hyeonwoo's worried about you.

131
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,960
About me?

132
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,560
He's worried that fans would blame him

133
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,020
for how listless and down you've been.

134
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,740
Hah. So he's not really worried about me.

135
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,730
What did you talk about with Ji Kyusung?

136
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,720
Is it because of
what you said on the radio?

137
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,060
I told him I like you.

138
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,200
What?

139
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,710
But I'm sure he already knew.

140
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,310
I was mad that someone I like is hurt,

141
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,230
so I tried to steal the man
Kyusung was supposedly seeing.

142
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,000
You mean...

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,040
that guy?

144
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,390
Yes,

145
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,790
Na Aejoon.

146
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,320
But I was mistaken.

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,310
He's not his boyfriend or anything else,

148
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,470
but just a relative.

149
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,600
We'd spent quite a lot of time together,

150
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,210
and a lot of things happened between us.

151
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
I know

152
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,280
I was being very reckless and stupid.

153
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,710
So, if you get the chance,
you should talk to Kyusung.

154
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,420
He might have his reasons too.

155
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,720
What about you?

156
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,740
Huh?

157
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,430
Are you okay?

158
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,700
Jooha.

159
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,760
Of course I'm okay.

160
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,290
I just want you to be happy.

161
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,210
That's always been only wish.

162
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,240
It's true.

163
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,210
Nothing's changed.

164
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,640
Jooha!

165
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,800
Bye.

166
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,750
He says he's okay,

167
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,120
but he clearly seemed

168
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,700
very flustered that day.

169
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,400
And what's really going on
with Ji Kyusung?

170
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,500
Aren't you a reporter?

171
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,190
Hello, Jooha.

172
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,520
What are you doing here?

173
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,420
Do you meet Choi Siyeol often in private?

174
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,320
You two seem especially close.

175
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,500
Have you broken up with
the guy you were seeing?

176
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,290
I love you.

177
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,690
How much?

178
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,020
I'm hungry.

179
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,420
Sorry?

180
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,200
Nothing has changed.

181
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,750
I approached him with an ulterior motive.

182
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,960
The only person I had to protect

183
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,690
was Jooha.

184
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,050
Here.

185
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,280
A formal housewarming gift.

186
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,040
It's a bit late,

187
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,210
but Jooha's finally vindicated.

188
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,530
Everything just came back to normal.

189
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,690
I'll make you delicious salad
tomorrow morning then.

190
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,740
It's true...

191
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,660
It's true that nothing has changed.

192
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,850
So why?

193
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,450
[Hey, here's the arranged version
you mentioned.]

194
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,510
Your lyrics are, how should I put it...

195
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,780
They're rich and resonate with me.

196
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,970
Really comforting.

197
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,740
Thank you

198
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,330
for making such a great song.

199
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,910
Why...

200
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,010
Why can't I...

201
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,010
Why can't I forget him?

202
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,720
[Nabit High School]

203
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,990
My goodness, Mr. Na.

204
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,330
What happened to your face?

205
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,070
Did you cry?

206
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,840
No.

207
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,960
I didn't sleep well last night,

208
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,780
so my face is swollen.

209
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,910
That doesn't look like it.

210
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,880
Wait.

211
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,260
You've been covering your neck
because of tonsil stones,

212
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,650
and today you come to work
with a swollen face.

213
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,340
Mr. Na,

214
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,670
are you...

215
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,560
diabetic?

216
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,000
Be careful!

217
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,510
You need to take care of yourself
while you're still young!

218
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,300
It's because you always eat sweets.

219
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,400
Diabetes is serious, you know?

220
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,880
Oh...

221
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,390
Okay, thank you.

222
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,000
Take care of yourself!

223
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,390
Mr. Na.

224
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,680
You've received the schedule
for today's shoot, right?

225
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,780
See you in the evening.

226
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,640
The two will enter the classroom
and make the timetable together.

227
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,680
You have the scissors,
glue, and tape, right?

228
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,319
Yes.

229
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,950
Today's focus is the bromance,

230
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,599
so look for ways to
highlight their bromance.

231
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,020
Okay, that's about it.

232
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,119
-Okay.
-Okay.

233
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,010
Siyeol, are you ready?

234
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,700
Yes.

235
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,060
Let's start then.

236
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,880
-Okay.
-Okay.

237
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,470
Usually, the timetable is
updated on the app,

238
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,780
but we also make one
and paste it at one end of the board.

239
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,640
Am I doing it right?

240
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,410
As long as you can see it clearly.

241
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,380
Likewise, for the day's notices,

242
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,040
aside from app notifications,
we'll also write them on the board.

243
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,780
On the upper right corner.

244
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,520
We'll post competition posters

245
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,210
on the notice board in this hallway.

246
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,330
Please follow me.

247
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,260
Please don't get too close.

248
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,120
Let me carry it.

249
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,080
No.

250
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,540
This isn't part of the shoot.

251
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,380
I'll do it myself.

252
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,040
What? All of a sudden?

253
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,060
What do you mean you have to drop out

254
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,960
of this project, Mr. Na?

255
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,960
I don't mean I'm dropping out right now.

256
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,140
Until you find a replacement,

257
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,390
I'll stay on the project.

258
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,290
Did we do something to offend you?

259
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,380
Oh, no.

260
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,510
That's not it.

261
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,550
Well, since I'm not a celebrity,

262
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,590
it's a bit stressful to be on TV
as a teacher.

263
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,840
Okay, I get what you mean.

264
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,930
I'll discuss it with the staff
and get back to you.

265
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,710
We'll pack up and leave now.

266
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,120
Take your time.

267
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,770
Why are you dropping out?

268
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,530
Because of me?

269
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,820
Do you hate me so much that

270
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,260
you can't stand being around me?

271
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,970
You didn't apologize to me
or try to explain yourself,

272
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,550
yet you want me to explain myself?

273
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,820
I'll do it now.

274
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
Hear me out—

275
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,740
apologies and excuses.

276
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,580
I'm sure you already knew

277
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,670
that Jooha and Kyusung broke up
after a long-term relationship.

278
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,520
Then I got the wrong idea
about Kyusung and you,

279
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,870
thinking you were dating—

280
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,610
So, it's all because of Jooha.

281
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,190
Okay.

282
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,030
I'll accept your apology, so...

283
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,940
I hope we never meet
outside of the shoots again.

284
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,090
Wait.

285
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,960
Let's talk it out.

286
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,970
Everything was fake anyway.

287
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,530
Just a relationship for your motive.

288
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,590
Since your motive's gone,

289
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,930
our relationship is naturally over.

290
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,820
But...

291
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,660
I don't understand why
you're not letting me go.

292
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,430
Are you afraid that
I'll tell people about this?

293
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,420
No, of course not.

294
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,770
What else is there to talk about?

295
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,040
Aejoon hyung.

296
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,040
In the time we spent together,

297
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,370
were you sincere?

298
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,220
Are you seriously
talking about sincerity at this point—

299
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,240
I...

300
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,540
I was sincere.

301
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,340
I was also confused about
why I can't let you go,

302
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,040
so I thought about it for a long time.

303
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,540
I like you.

304
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,060
I think...

305
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,050
I've fallen for you.

306
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,580
[In the next episode]

307
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,840
It may not be a big deal to you,

308
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,870
but it is to me.

309
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,770
Your love for me was

310
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,470
an obsession.

311
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,600
But too much time has passed already.

312
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,540
Then keep at it
until you get through to him.

313
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,810
Oh my goodness!

314
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,640
Choi Siyeol?

315
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,000
It's only right that

316
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,440
you pay for your mistakes.

317
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,310
I don't know what I can say
to prove my sincerity to you,

318
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,830
but you're the one I've always loved,

319
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,490
not Jooha.
