1
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,600
Well said.

2
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,000
Let you go.

3
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,360
Well said.

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,640
Death.

5
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,680
I only know that

6
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
someone sent a secret letter to Zhao Yong

7
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,400
to report your Yuwen family's rebellion.

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,440
and provided evidence.

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,080
We started to handle it impartially.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,280
But later,

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,840
Tell me.

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,240
Someone came to me later.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,360
But Yuwen family

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,760
is a respectable person.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,039
I'm afraid

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,320
it'll be hard to explain.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,240
It's really not about money.

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
You mean our butler?

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,360
Wang Tianxing?

20
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,039
Wang Tianxing.

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,600
Also,

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,360
your brother, Li Siwen's father,

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,039
The Master of Dojo.

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Li Jian Xing.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
You want to kill me?

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
It's not that easy.

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,760
So what?

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,560
Since you've escaped,

29
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,079
you should live in Nanyang for the rest of your life.

30
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,440
But now you don't have the chance.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,840
Everyone wants you to die.

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,400
You know too much.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
No one wants you to live.

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
If I kill you now,

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,079
I can redeem myself.

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,480
Choi Young.

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,320
Calm down.

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,160
Mr. Luo is a VIP from Nanyang.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,920
We have to take responsibility if anything happens.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,480
Hey.

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,120
Are you okay?

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,400
You two

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,920
are indeed in cahoots.

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,680
Sir.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,480
Your wine.

46
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
Help!

47
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
Help!

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
They colluded

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
to set me up.

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Choi Young, what are you doing?

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,640
Open the door.

52
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,840
Did you hear that?

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Leave now.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,960
Wait for someone to come in.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,839
none of you can escape.

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:18,959
Brother.

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,079
Cut the crap.

58
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,720
Do it.

59
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
Commissioner, you're here.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,440
Hurry up.

61
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,480
Take a photo.

62
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,240
Why are you here?

63
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,560
But you can't kick him off.

65
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,280
I didn't mean it.

66
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm afraid he'll run away.

67
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,200
You'll be in trouble.

68
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,760
It's more troublesome now.

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,040
Brother.

70
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,120
They're coming in.

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,040
Hit me!

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,480
Hit me, knock me out.

73
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Notify everyone.

74
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,920
Seal off the crime scene.

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,920
Commissioner Li.

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,440
Can we talk?

77
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,800
Mr. Luo.

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,440
You're awake.

79
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,880
This is...

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,800
This is the best hospital in Southern City.

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
I happen to know someone here.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,159
You can rest assured, Mr. Luo.

83
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,040
By the way,

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,920
My wife

85
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,080
made for you.

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,280
Delicious buns.

87
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,880
Try it.

88
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,320
Mr. Luo,

89
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,160
Did you just come to Shanghai?

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm really sorry.

91
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
I just got here.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,560
Choi Young.

93
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,320
He's dead.

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,120
When we went in,

95
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,720
Mr. Luo, you passed out.

96
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,880
So...

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,880
Deputy Director Wu,

98
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
I want to ask you about the details.

99
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,360
Is it convenient?

100
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,680
It tastes good.

101
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,520
The buns your wife made

102
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,600
suits my taste.

103
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,720
Please enjoy.

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,000
Mr. Na is awake.

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
I heard Choi Young died.

106
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,920
That day, Choi Young

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
took me to the lounge.

108
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,159
Then, there was a fight.

109
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,280
My hands were tied up.

110
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,159
Later,

111
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080
Then I fainted.

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Then I woke up.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,640
It's right here.

114
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,120
How did you know

115
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Choi Young died?

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,920
I saw signs of a fight at the scene.

117
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
It must be Mr. Na.

118
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,160
during the fight with Choi Young.

119
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,960
with Choi Young.

120
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,800
It's strange.

121
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,440
That waiter

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,080
hasn't been found yet.

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,040
Mr. Luo.

124
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,080
Do you know him?

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,800
We met once.

126
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,400
I heard

127
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,040
Mr. Luo

128
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,080
is back from Nanyang.

129
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
overseas Chinese.

130
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,240
Where was Mr. Luo

131
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,960
before he went abroad.

132
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,520
I grew up abroad.

133
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,600
But my parents are Chinese.

134
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,360
It seems that Mr. Luo

135
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,360
from Mr. Luo today.

136
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,280
Actually,

137
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,640
I have an old friend

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,560
is also in Nanyang.

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,920
Maybe he knows Mr. Luo.

140
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,400
Now that I think about it,

141
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
I don't think it's a coincidence.

142
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Just in time.

143
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,880
Today is

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,360
is the anniversary of his old friend's parents' death.

145
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
It was at Mount Phoenix outside the city.

146
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,600
So, I have to go now.

147
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,800
excuse me.

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,640
Let's

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,280
another day.

150
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
It's been ten years.

151
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm back.

152
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,400
Choi Young is dead.

153
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,640
Unfortunately, I couldn't

154
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,200
kneel before you to apologize.

155
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,560
Don't worry.

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,560
I will make them pay

157
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
I will make them pay.

158
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,240
Brother.

159
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,000
Who is Oh-reum?

160
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,000
Who are you?

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,080
Why did you save me?

162
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm Wu Tian.

163
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,760
Master Yuwen saved my mother's life.

164
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,920
He is a good man.

165
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,840
He won't betray the country.

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,440
My father...

167
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,160
Stay there.

168
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,240
The warden won't be here soon.

169
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,200
Find a chance

170
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,120
I'll let you out.

171
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,120
After you get out,

172
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,360
you can go to Nanyang.

173
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,480
I have friends there.

174
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,560
Remember.

175
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,560
Live well.

176
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,960
Tong.

177
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Go back first.

178
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,880
I have to go somewhere.

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,000
I sigh that no one will notice

180
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,760
The intersection is already clouded.

181
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,560
It can connect the ancient and modern times.

182
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Peach Xuxi Red Rain reports the new sun

183
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
I have a daughter.

184
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,080
If you get the money,

185
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,520
If possible,

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,560
find her for me.

187
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,720
There's a letter

188
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,400
in the bank safe.

189
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
There's a poem in it.

190
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,960
was written to my daughter

191
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
when she was three.

192
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,000
[I wrote for her.]

193
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,960
It's creative.

194
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
This missing person notice

195
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,880
will be published

196
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
