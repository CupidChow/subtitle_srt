1
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,039
What's wrong?

2
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,480
Wang Tianxing, that bastard!

3
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,840
deserved to die.

4
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,600
I shouldn't have

5
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,640
I shouldn't have left the money with him.

6
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,960
All right.

7
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,360
Forget about that.

8
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm not in the mood today.

9
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,080
Recently,

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,240
the money in the shipping company

11
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
in the shipping company?

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,680
It’s Deputy Mayor Huang

13
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,040
to take shifts.

14
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,600
I've transferred all my friends.

15
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,120
The wharf is unfamiliar.

16
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,360
It's hard to transport goods now.

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,720
It's hard.

18
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,120
Huang Da, that bastard.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,760
If you can't beat me, play dirty with me.

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,240
Also,

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,680
Rocky Lan is doing expansion.

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,040
for military pay.

23
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
If you can't handle the money,

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,680
we can't do this.

25
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,520
What do you mean?

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,240
As a woman,

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,920
for ten years

28
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,840
to make money for you.

29
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
You don't want me

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
you don't want me anymore.

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,840
Come on.

32
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,640
Ding Caier, what do you mean?

33
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,600
I can arrest you for trespassing.

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,920
I was wondering who it was.

35
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,720
It's Deputy Director Wu.

36
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,400
No wonder Mr. Luo

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,160
has been so high-profile since he came to Shanghai.

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,320
It turns out

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,920
someone is backing you up.

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
You can't smoke in my house.

41
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,440
Suit yourself.

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,960
I guess

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,680
Mr. Luo is a reasonable person.

44
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,920
Me too.

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,760
What are you?

46
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,240
Mr. Luo once saved you.

47
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
That's how you're reasonable.

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,440
You saved me to harm Wang Tianxing.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,560
and saved me.

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,640
Mr. Luo, how about we settle it?

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,720
New account?

52
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Ms Ding.

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,160
I'm a person who saved you.

54
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
He's a great man.

55
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,320
I should've visited him earlier.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,760
That's a different matter.

57
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,520
But

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,520
Mr. Luo and Wang Tianxing

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
between Mr. Luo and Wang Tianxing

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
to kill him?

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,920
Wang Tianxing is dead.

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,200
Isn't this what Mr. Luo wants?

63
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,159
He tricked Wang Tianxing into the trap

64
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,480
and spread false virus news.

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
to meet with the British medical doctor.

66
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,920
to make it look like the stock rises.

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,480
and make sure Wang Tianxing is greedy.

68
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
He will be tricked.

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,480
We'll be tricked.

70
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,000
I didn’t expect

71
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Mr. Luo knows Wang Tianxing so well.

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,960
You must have done a lot of research.

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Ms Ding.

74
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,080
You misunderstood.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,440
I've never worked with Mr. Wang.

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,560
I just invited two

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,640
two British friends

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
for a long time.

79
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,360
and drink coffee.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Can't I?

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,760
As for spreading false news,

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
it's about the newspaper.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
You should go to the newspaper.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,880
Speaking of which,

85
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,080
I happen to have

86
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,960
a friend of the deputy director of the police station.

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,360
Let me introduce him to you.

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
He's a smooth talker.

89
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,880
You are not afraid of danger.

90
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,360
No wonder Wang Tianxing fell into your hands.

91
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
You are

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
to be a rival.

93
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,840
or friends.

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
a dead person.

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
Then I choose...

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,480
Friend.

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,240
Good.

98
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
The money Wang Tianxing lost in the stock market

99
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,640
is my money.

100
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,960
Pay your debt.

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
to pay the debt.

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,080
As long as Mr. Luo signs this repayment agreement,

103
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,920
we are friends.

104
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,760
Why are you laughing?

105
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,600
Ms Ding

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,880
so rich.

107
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,120
It’s the money of two vice mayors.

108
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Green Gang.

109
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
The money bank.

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,040
Is there any money for the tram?

111
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Since you know everything,

112
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
you will know the consequences of not paying the money back.

113
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,120
or pay back the money.

114
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
and make friends.

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,040
a foothold,

116
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,520
or find a way

117
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
to live.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,720
I choose

119
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,840
not to pay back the money.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,240
Live.

121
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,360
Stand still.

122
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,920
What did you say?

123
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,360
It's getting interesting.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,159
But Mr. Luo,

125
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,640
the identity of Deputy Director Wu

126
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,720
is not useful to me.

127
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,360
I

128
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
usually

129
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,720
talking to the dead.

130
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
Mr. Luo,

131
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,640
take care of yourself.

132
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,880
Ms Ding, don't you want to hear

133
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,240
our cooperation?

134
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,320
I'll send you three big boats.

135
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
and loaded the goods.

136
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Ms Ding.

137
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,520
Let's check the goods first.

138
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,200
Am I going to die?

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,840
Brother.

140
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,880
I'll go get her.

141
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,560
Don't go.

142
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
She heard it.

143
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,080
How are you sure

144
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,600
she will cooperate after seeing the goods?

145
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,600
What goods?

146
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,320
You want to know? I'll tell you.

147
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
You don't have to tell me.

148
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,840
In case

149
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,840
I'll ruin your plan again.

150
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
About this,

151
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,480
without you.

152
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,840
Have a seat.

153
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,000
Open it.

154
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,080
What did you say?

155
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,680
Are you crazy?

156
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,960
If they don't kill you,

157
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
I'll kill you first.

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,640
Why are you panicking?

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
It's fake.

160
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,200
Fake?

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,440
If Ding Caier finds out the goods are fake,

162
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,400
you're fooling her.

163
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,880
Then you'll die sooner.

164
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Don't worry.

165
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,080
It looks real.

166
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
She can't tell.

167
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,760
Then why did she use a fake one?

168
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,560
Ding Caier

169
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
is very thoughtful.

170
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,520
She has such a good resource

171
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,880
with such good resources.

172
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
It's definitely not easy.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,440
What if she set me up?

174
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,640
she's a fake,

175
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,200
she won't do anything to me.

176
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,880
Mr. Luo.

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,760
Ms Ding has been waiting for you.

178
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,640
Please.

179
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,040
Ms Ding.

180
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,040
Three cargo ships.

181
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,640
Are you satisfied?

182
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
Three cargo ships.

183
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
are nothing

184
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,840
is nothing to me.

185
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
The most valuable

186
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,760
The most valuable

187
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,760
is not a cargo ship.

188
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
It's a document.

189
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,880
All my crew have foreign passports.

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,360
and ships in trade.

191
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,680
registered

192
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,520
are not ships.

193
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,000
You mean...

194
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,200
It's a warship.
