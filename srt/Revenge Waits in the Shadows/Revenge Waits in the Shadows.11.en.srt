1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,120
Hello? Hello?

2
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,120
Why are you here?

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,560
Do you want to

4
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,280
Should we look into it again?

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,880
The evidence is solid.

6
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,400
There's nothing to investigate.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,920
Chief.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,160
Opium smuggling is a big deal.

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,440
What if we catch the wrong person?

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,039
What?

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
Henry gave you money?

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,280
No.

13
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,600
No.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,920
Although the cargo ship

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,880
is his,

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,800
the goods on the boat may not belong to him.

17
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,680
We need to

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,920
we have to be fair and just.

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
Are you teaching me how to do things?

20
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:26,720
Not the director.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm afraid...

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,120
He...

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,720
Remember,

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,800
This police station is surnamed Zhao.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,200
It's not Wu.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,000
Director.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,080
One more word.

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,479
Get lost!

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,039
This scene...

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,320
Does it look familiar?

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
What's going on?

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,840
You said it was fake.

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,800
How could it be true?

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
It must be Ding Caier

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
to frame you.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,160
I'll go find her now.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:11,960
Wait.

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,480
The goods are real.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,520
What did you say?

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,440
The goods have always been real.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,360
I did.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,600
I lied to you.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640
I was afraid you wouldn't agree.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,840
Do you know what you are doing?

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
Ding Caier is very sinister.

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
She seduced Wang Tianxing

47
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,960
and made him make a big mistake.

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,520
The relationship between Wang Tianxing and her for so many years

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,640
She just broke up.

50
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,480
To gain her trust,

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
to gain her trust.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,160
That won't do.

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
What are you going to do?

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
Ding Caier is just a pawn.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
The Yuwen family was wiped out.

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
who makes the most profit?

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
You mean

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,800
Li Jian Xing?

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,960
Good.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,640
Jian Xing is very cautious.

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,320
He won't do anything himself.

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,680
It's hard for us to get something on him.

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Back then,

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,800
our Yuwen family was in charge of sea transportation.

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,880
We are very popular now.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,640
Li Jian Xing tried to smuggle opium,

67
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,560
So he used Ding Caier to seduce Wang Tianxing

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,320
using our ship to smuggle opium.

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,000
After the Yuwen family

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,160
was wiped out,

71
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
in order to reward Wang Tianxing,

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
he established a shipping company for him

73
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
to take charge of the shipping team.

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,480
and sell drugs for him.

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
But Wang Tianxing

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,640
ruined the stocks.

77
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,800
So,

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
he transferred the company to Ding Caier

79
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,160
and continue to sell opium for him.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,080
The vice mayor who always shouts for drug control

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,240
is the biggest drug lord in Shanghai.

82
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,120
How ironic.

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,400
Mr. Lee did such a thing.

84
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
is not only my enemy,

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
but also our enemy in China.

86
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,920
Then

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,000
what should I do?

88
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,640
Nothing.

89
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,360
It's three o'clock

90
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
What three o'clock?

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,760
My brother hasn't come back all night.

92
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,080
I have to find him.

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,400
No need.

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,000
I met your brother.

95
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,160
He's fine for now.

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,120
He told us not to act rashly.

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,160
Just wait.

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
I believe Mr. Luo has his own plan.

99
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,480
OK.

100
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,080
I'll go back to the station to inquire.

101
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,200
I'll let you know.

102
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,600
Don't act rashly.

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,240
Do you believe him?

104
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Do you really think your brother will be okay?

105
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
My brother will be fine.

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,760
will be fine.

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,680
Ding Caier is hard evidence to catch your brother.

108
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,440
Do you know

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
are?

110
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,640
Director Zhao.

111
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,040
He works for Deputy Mayor Huang.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,640
Ding Caier.

113
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,120
is Mayor Li’s man.

114
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,560
Your brother fooled them.

115
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,880
Do you think he'll be fine this time?

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,640
I don't like to hear you talk.

117
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Also,

118
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,240
my brother already has someone he likes.

119
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,760
If you have nothing to do here,

120
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
you can leave.

121
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,480
Okay.

122
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
I got the money anyway.

123
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,320
His life has nothing to do with me.

124
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm leaving now.

125
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,120
Your father asked me to give this to you.

126
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,320
With this,

127
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,000
we can open the biggest safe

128
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,280
in Huifeng Bank.

129
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,400
Remember.

130
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,880
I like Jasmine.

131
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,560
Let go of me!

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,160
Sister Yan.

133
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,160
Sister Yan.

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,520
Sister.

135
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,640
Long time no see.

136
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,520
How have you been?

137
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,840
Waiter.

138
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Hello, the menu.

139
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,600
Yan.

140
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
I invited you here

141
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,440
to ask you for a favor.

142
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,400
Just like her.

143
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,120
Okay.

144
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,960
Mo Li.

145
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
We don't usually walk around.

146
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,280
We finally get in touch.

147
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,040
You're asking me to do this right away.

148
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,960
Isn't this a bit abrupt?

149
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,640
Yan,

150
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,120
For the sake

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
for the sake

152
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
please do me this favor.

153
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,880
I've forgotten the past.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Don't mention it again.

155
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,960
There are many

156
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,080
a lot of high officials and nobles.

157
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,120
If they know

158
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
the Young Mistress of Green Gang

159
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
used to sit here,

160
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,160
Keep your voice down.

161
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Qing Zhi.

162
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,160
My sister is only showing you respect.

163
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,960
for your sake.

164
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,520
In my place,

165
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,200
in my place.

166
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,080
Let me ask you.

167
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,360
will you help me or not?

168
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,320
Keep quiet.

169
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,560
Don't worry.

170
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,440
I won't shout.

171
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,600
What is it?

172
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,240
Tell me slowly.

173
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,200
Mom.

174
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,360
You're back.

175
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,440
Shi-wol.

176
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
I'm late.

177
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,800
Why are you still up?

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,440
Who is this lady

184
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,480
She's so pretty

185
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,120

190
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,640
Yes.

191
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm afraid you'll hurt the child.

192
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
But I'm not afraid.

193
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,440
Because I think

194
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,400
you're not that kind of person.

195
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,760
My brother was arrested.

196
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,000
He was framed.

197
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,160
Your brother is...

198
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Henry.

199

Where is he now?

200
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,320
He was arrested by Director Zhao.

201
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I don't know where he is.

202
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to you.

203
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,920
Why should I help you?

204

I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.

210

211
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
A friend's sister.

212
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320

213
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,720

214
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,080
Henry who bought our old house?

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
I heard

216
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,760
Hengluo was caught by Zhao Yong

217
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,320
because of the opium.

218
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

219
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
He tried to talk to me many times.

220
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,720

Mayor Li.

222
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,080
Ding Caier's money is getting less and less.

223
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,600
I’m thinking

224
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,960
how about

225
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360

226
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,160

228
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,960
That's a good choice.

229
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,800
The identity of a foreign merchant ship

230
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,320
is

231
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
for us.

232
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll go to the police station.

233
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,440
Wait.

234
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,480
Since Henglio found Ding Caier,

235
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,520
and Ding Caier didn't mention anything to me.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,880
It means

237
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,760
she wants to work alone.

238
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,240
If Henry can

239
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,080
by himself,

240
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,200
it means he's capable.

241
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,240
We can find him again.

242
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,920

243
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Don't move anything.

244
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,000
