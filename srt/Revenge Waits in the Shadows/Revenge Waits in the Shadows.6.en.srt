1
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:53,960
Here.

2
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,560
Mr. Luo.

3
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Thank you.

4
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,480
Come on.

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,400
Together.

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,440
to Mr. Luo.

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,800
Mr. Luo, a toast to you.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,520
Come on.

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,640
Come.

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,640
Mr. Wang asked me out today

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,160
What can I do for you?

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,320
A contract.

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,840
Please have a look.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,960
What contract?

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
We agreed to cooperate last time.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,240
Cooperation?

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,360
When?

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,560
Why didn't I know?

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,640
No.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,000
What do you mean?

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,320
Mr. Luo,

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,720
Did you ask me to buy stocks?

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,880
Pudong Medicine.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
100,000 shares.

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Five yuan for one share.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Mr. Wang, you must be joking.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,680
Pudong medicine is a rotten stock.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,080
The price is only 2.3 yuan now.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,479
I'll buy it with five yuan.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,320
I'm not stupid.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
I see.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Sorry for my offence last time.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,759
Mr. Luo.

34
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,000
Sorry.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,040
Last time,

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,720
I was limited.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,760
It works this time.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,880
How about this?

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,680
Four yuan per share.

40
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,400
100,000 shares in a week.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,720
Sorry.

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,520
Mr. Luo.

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,480
I've searched several times to find this room.

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,280
It's okay.

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,040
You came at the right time.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,280
Let me introduce.

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,880
No need.

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,960
Mr. Qian.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760
Isn't this Mr. Wang?

50
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,800
Isn't this

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,720
my name in Shanghai?

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,520
You know each other?

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,440
What a coincidence.

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,079
Mr. Wang.

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,200
I have an appointment

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,680
to talk with Mr. Qian.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Would you mind

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,720
lend me your precious place?

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,720
Of course.

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,040
No.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Just kidding.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,560
Suit yourselves.

63
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,480
Help yourself.

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,160
Take your time.

65
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,920
Here, Manager Qian.

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,640
Have a seat.

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,160
Mr. Luo.

68
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,240
A toast to you.

69
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,200
Mr. Luo, a toast to you.

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,200
Here, Mr. Luo.

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,520
Cheers.

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,800
Here.

73
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,560
Here.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Mr. Luo.

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,840
Mr. Luo.

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,440
Jasmine.

77
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,880
Mr. Luo is drunk.

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,920
Please send him back.

79
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,800
Mr. Wang.

80
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,400
Let me see him off.

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,480
No need.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Let's

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,640
continue drinking.

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,400
Mr. Luo.

85
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,520
You're drunk.

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,360
Let me help you get some air.

87
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,400
Keep drinking.

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,840
Where are you taking me?

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,360
Here.

90
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Let's continue.

91
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,800
Cheers, Manager Qian.

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,240
What are you doing?

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,800
I can only touch you.

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't touch me.

95
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,120
He's gone.

96
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,800
What?

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,520
Mr. Luo,

98
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,720
I don't want to.

99
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,240
I dare not.

100
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,280
I still can't.

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm not a good person.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,800
How dare you?

103
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,400
Are you scared?

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,360
Tell me.

105
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,240
What else do you want?

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,240
You can't go in.

107
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,920
Law.

108
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,840
You really let me down.

109
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,760
I came all the way from England

110
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,040
to study

111
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,159
the special drug

112
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,160
of antivirus.

113
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,520
Explain to me what this is.

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,280
Mr. George.

115
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,200
Here.

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,520
I didn't expect

117
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,080
you released the virus.

118
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
I love making money,

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,960
I would never make that money.

120
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,880
You...

121
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,680
Don't go.

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
Listen to me.

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,960
Look.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,280
How dare you fool me?

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,520
Playing me?

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,360
Henry.

127
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,520
found a manager Qian to see me.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,800
He said he wanted to work with him.

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,560
You...

130
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,440
build a mouse warehouse

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Put all our money in and buy it yourself.

132
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,000
Go.

133
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,760
What are you doing?

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,520
Sir.

135
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
We have no money.

136
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,600
The stocks we hold for several families

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,480
So far,

138
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,360
we lost 300,000 yuan.

139
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,000
Fortunately, your reputation is outside.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,920
They dare not investigate.

141
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,600
Once they find out,

142
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
you'll be done for.

143
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
That's all the more reason.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,120
Pudong medicine.

145
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,760
will rise.

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
If it can rise to seven,

147
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,680
all our holes will be blocked.

148
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,120
How about this?

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,760
Hurry up.

150
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,680
the money from other families

151
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,880
from other families.

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,680
to buy the warehouse.

153
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,360
Then,

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
Let nature take its course.

155
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,680
We'll see.

156
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,919
No, sir.

157
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,120
It's too risky.

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,760
If we lose money,

159
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,240
we can't afford the price.

160
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,159
You're the boss, I'm the boss.

161
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,080
Manager Qian.

162
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,160
What's the sales of Pudong Pharmaceutical today?

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,800
Okay.

164
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,440
Tomorrow morning,

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
no matter what method you use,

166
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,080
regardless of the cost,

167
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Push it to six yuan.

168
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,080
Six. Six. Six.

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
Time's up.

170
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,240
Mr. Luo.

171
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,760
Why are you still here?

172
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
Mr. Luo hasn't kicked me out yet.

173
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,440
What's the hurry?

174
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,800
Mr. Luo

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
doesn't want me to leave.

176
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,400
Right?

177
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,480
Go ahead.

178
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,880
I'll prepare breakfast.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,480
Okay.

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,360
Did he poison you?

181
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,360
No.

182
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
How dare you leave her here?

183
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,960
Don't you think

184
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,960
She's interesting.

185
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,360
What?

186
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Are you jealous?

187
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,680
Why would I be jealous?

188
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,520
She's from Yingchun Fang.

189
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,240
Wang Tianxing introduced her to you.

190
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,160
You don't even know how he died.

191
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,960
That makes sense.

192
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,920
What?

193
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,280
The women of Yingchun Fang are not women?

194
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,440
I've made up my mind.

195
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
Then I followed Mr. Luo.

196
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I've fallen in love with him.

197
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,680
