1
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,720
Where did you go?

2
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm worried about you.

3
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,080
Sa-wen.

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,800
You set all this up?

5
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,480
You lied to me for ten years.

6
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,160
You went to see him?

7
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,680
Did you want to leave me

8
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,640
leave me

9
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,320
and live with Liang.

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,800
and reunite with your family

11
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,440
Simon Li

12
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,320
We've been married for ten years.

13
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,240
You're good to me and Shiyue.

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm grateful.

15
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,479
But what you did

16
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,600
has made

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,280
in the past ten years.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,039
Every step you take is full of calculations.

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
The price is those innocent people.

20
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,680
Mr. Yuwen.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,080
Mother.

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,960
And Yu Wen Liang.

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,920
You make me hate myself.

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,560
Sa-wen.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,440
I will never

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,440
forgive you.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,479
Xinyi.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,080
I did all this for you.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,520
To be with you.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,600
I love you a hundred times more than he does.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
It's all Yu Wen Liang's fault.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,960
If he hadn't taken you away from me,

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,640
we wouldn't have died.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
It's all his fault.

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,560
It's his fault.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
Sa-wen.

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
Do you know the biggest difference

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,200
between you and him?

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Even if I chose you,

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,880
Yu Wen Liang would never do such a thing.

41
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,160
Siwen.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
It's not too late.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,400
Let us go.

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
and yourself, okay?

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
We are a family.

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
I won't let you leave.

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,480
Stay at home for the time being.

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,760
Let's leave Shanghai.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,720
Li Siwen.

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,400
What did you do to Shiyue?

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,600
She's fine.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,480
In my eyes,

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
she is still my daughter.

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,040
Marshal Lan.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,960
Stop!

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,280
Commander Lan is battling in blood.

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,960
Are you afraid of a merchant like me?

58
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,320
Henry.

59
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,600
You are a trouble.

60
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,160
After all this,

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,960
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,320
Kick him out!

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Hurry!

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,680
Let's go.

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Marshal Lan.

66
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
If you don't listen to me,

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
you'll regret it.

68
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,600
Wait.

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Kid,

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,880
Don't think I dare not touch you

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,960
I dare not touch you.

72
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
In Shanghai,

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,480
I'm the only one who threatens others.

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,080
The one who threatened me

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
is not born yet.

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,440
Really?

77
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,519
What about Sa-wen?

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,680
How dare you threaten me?

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,120
Simon Lee is threatening you.

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
I know what he's threatening you.

81
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
You are the warlord commander.

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,480
You look very successful.

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,560
But behind every warlord,

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,200
behind every warlord.

85
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,680
If you help the foreigners

86
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
and help the foreigners at the same time,

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,200
and play tricks.

88
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,560
Do you think

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,760
abandon you

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,760
to train another commander.

91
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,640
Looks like

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
I was right.

93
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
There is something

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,920
has something on you.

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
I still don't get it.

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,680
How could a great marshal Lan

97
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,200
be threatened by Li Siwen?

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,040
He said

99
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
if I dare to touch him,

100
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,520
all the newspapers in Shanghai

101
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,880
will get the evidence of me fooling the Westerners.

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
What if I hurt him?

103
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Mr. Luo.

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,880
What do you mean?

105
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,520
It's inconvenient for Marshal Lan to do it.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
I'll do it.

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Okay.

108
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,360
What do you need me to do?

109
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,880
Nothing.

110
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,560
When I do it,

111
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,600
I won't help you.

112
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,560
If you need anything,

113
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,960
you can come to me anytime.

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,640
So you agree?

115
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,920
Are you sure

116
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,000
we can save the hostage?

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,840
I’m not sure.

118
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,360
But Mayor Hwang,

119
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,880
this is the most likely solution.

120
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

121
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
I trust Henry.

122
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
Just do it.

123
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,760
Remember.

124
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,520
Don't embarrass the police.

125
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,520
Sure.

126
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
Have you arranged

127
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,360
Is it ready?

128
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay.

129
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,160
I'll leave tomorrow.

130
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,720
Okay.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
Where's the boat?

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Si Wen.

133
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

134
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,800
It's you.

135
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,200
Yuwen Liang.

136
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,440
Move!

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,720
Mom!

138
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,360
Shi-wol.

139
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,240
Li Siwen

140
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,840
Are you crazy?

141
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,960
Are you threatening me with your daughter?

142
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Liang.

143
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,720
I forgot to tell you.

144
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,520
Shiyue is your child.

145
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,000
Let her go!

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,080
My turn.

147
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,400
Let me do it.

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,160
Sa-wen.

149
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,040
I'm the one you want to kill.

150
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,360
Okay.

151
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,440
Mom.

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,720
Xinyi.

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
Mom. Xinyi.

154
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,160
Xinyi.

155
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,720
Xinyi.

156
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Xinyi.

157
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,560
Xinyi.

158
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,120
Liang.

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
Sorry

160
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,120
Don't move.

161
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,840
Don't move.

162
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Don't move.

163
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,960
Put the gun down.

164
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,280
Don't move.

165
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,840
Put the gun down.

166
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,280
Put it down and grab it.

167
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,160
Let her go.

168
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,360
Let go!

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,640
Put it down.

170
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,040
Xinyi.

171
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
I once believed

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
you were still alive.

173
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,640
But I couldn't keep believing it.

174
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,000
Sorry, Liang.

175
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,800
Stop it

176
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,920
You didn't do me wrong.

177
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,160
Stop it, Xinyi.

178
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,360
Stop it.

179
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,960
