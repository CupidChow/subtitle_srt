1
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,840
imported special medicine from Pudong Pharmacy.

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,160
There are no high-profit drugs.

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,520
or big purchase orders.

4
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,600
I don't even have the qualifications to import drugs.

5
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,000
I got the job from the foreigners behind me.

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,920
It's 2.3 yuan today.

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,560
I can't see any progress.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,039
This Hyeong

9
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,080
Why does he like this stock?

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,039
Pudong medicine.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,039
100,000 shares

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,760
I don’t care how you

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,800
or how much the acquisition price is.

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,920
I'll pay you at 5 yuan per share.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,640
Two weeks.

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,520
Mr. Luo,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,880
I won’t lose this deal.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,000
But I'm curious

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
why you

20
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,160
pay me half more?

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
and make friends.

22
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,600
I never

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
never believe

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
there would be a pie in the sky.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,960
And it's so big.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,280
Mr. Wang is really cautious.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,280
It’s better than loose.

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,760
Mr. Luo.

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,760
I...

30
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,360
I'm limited.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
If there is a chance,

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,160
we can work together again.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Take it.

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Mr. Wang is really

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,400
Once bitten by a snake,

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,760
You've been afraid of the well rope for ten years.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,800
The stock disaster two years ago

38
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,000
made Mr. Wang

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
ruined.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
and lost his vigor.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,160
I couldn't even keep the woman I love.

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,680
I never thought

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
where I fell

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,720
Where to get up?

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
But it's better to be careful.

46
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,640
But

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,920
it won't be a big deal.

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,480
Beware of a millennium boat.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,440
Sir.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,080
I've calculated.

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
Pudong medicine is definitely a rotten stock.

52
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Plus the money we bought from all small investors,

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,360
we can get 100,000 shares within a week.

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,320
And it won’t exceed

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,360
Three yuan.

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,880
Do you think

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
any risk?

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,640
Because

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,880
there was no risk.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,760
I think it's strange.

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,880
I don't know

62
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,120
what Henglio is up to.

63
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,920
But

64
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,360
There must be a ghost inside.

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,400
What?

66
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,240
You gave him five yuan per share?

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,880
Isn't this giving money to others?

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,200
What's your family condition?

69
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,280
More than that.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
The point is

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,920
he was rejected by someone else.

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,520
No.

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,720
Something is wrong with his brain.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
You're crazy too.

75
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,400
Brother.

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,840
I don't understand.

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,760
Do we really have to go through all this trouble?

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Since you know who your enemy is,

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,040
why don't you just kill them?

80
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,320
Kill them.

81
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,839
It's too easy.

82
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
What do you want to do?

83
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,280
Do you know

84
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,840
what the real misfortune is?

85
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,000
Destruction.

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,520
Destroy

87
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,960
they care the most.

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,200
And

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,920
let them all live.

90
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,040
That way,

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,880
to feel all of this.

92
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,240
and pain.

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
is scarier than

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
than enduring death.

95
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,320
It's itchy.

96
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,440
Extra! Extra!

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
A plague broke out in Nanyang.

98
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,880
Come on.

99
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,480
Many Nanyang merchant ships enter Shanghai port.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,680
Pier?

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,240
What are you doing?

102
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,240
Draw the cards.

103
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,680
Hurry up.

104
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,200
East Wind, no!

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,640
No.

106
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Two Bamboos.

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,120
I'll touch it later.

108
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,280
How can you touch this? I'm so lucky today.

109
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,160
Seven. Seven.

110
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,800
Gosh.

111
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,040
Ten thousand.

112
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,520
No.

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,080
Here.

114
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,840
Six cakes.

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,480
Hurry up.

116
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
What are you doing?

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,920
Don't disturb me from making money.

118
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,480
Are you playing or not?

119
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,720
You...

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's itchy.

121
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,640
Where is the medicine Henglio gave you?

122
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,240
Give it to me.

123
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,000
I want it.

124
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,720
Wait.

125
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,200
That's it.

126
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,280
I found it.

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,720
The owner behind Pudong medicine is Anthony.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,760
He's also British.

129
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,160
Henry is from Nanyang.

130
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,560
Why does he know so many British people?

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Just say whatever you want.

132
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,560
Don't hold it back.

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,640
We also investigated Henry.

134
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,880
He's also British.

135
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,760
Ingrin.

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,360
Why are you panicking?

137
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,200
Mr. Wang.

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
You want us to follow Henry?

139
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
He's in the city now.

140
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,800
Going to the city?

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,440
Yes.

142
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,760
Get the car ready.

143
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Mr. Henry.

144
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,600
You're young and promising.

145
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,840
But

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,960
your donation

147
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,320
I always feel that

148
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,920
if you don't make a request,

149
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,040
it’ll be fake.

150
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Mayor Huang, don't worry.

151
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,480
I have no request.

152
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,320
My only request is

153
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,560
to build an orphanage

154
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,120
to build an orphanage.

155
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,080
But if...

156
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,760
I mean if something really happens to me,

157
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,000
I need your help.

158
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,480
About that...

159
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,720
I will

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,760
for you.

161
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,520
Your words are enough.

162
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,360
Then I won't waste your time.

163
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,040
Please.

164
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,440
Sorry, I'll do it.

165
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
It's okay.

166
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,840
Goodbye.

167
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:10,920
Please.

168
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Please.

169
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,800
Mr. Henry.

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,880
Bye.

171
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,240
Wait.

172
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Mayor!

173
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,880
Hello.

174
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,480
What's wrong

175
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,120
Why are you so flustered?

176
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,080
You're getting more and more unruly.

177
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,240
Sit down.

178
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,640
Actually,

179
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
nothing special.

180
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
I just

181
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,400
to visit you.

182
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,240
I want to know

183
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
of our city.

184
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,680
Planning

185
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,720
and movements.

186
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,480
so that

187
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,040
to turn the tide.

188
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,440
Yes.

189
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,440
No, no, no.

190
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,280
I just want to talk to you.

191
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,680
I want to work with you.

192
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
to do with you.

193
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,800
I...

194
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
I'll eat meat and you'll have soup.

195
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,520
I'll have soup.

196
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,440
I'll have the soup.

197
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,800
I don't have any soup.

198
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,680

200

Okay.

201
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:29,960
Thank you.

202
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you think

203
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,960
would he fall for it?

204
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,400
Wang Tianxing is suspicious.

205
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,880
Tell him.

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,520
he might not believe it.

207
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,600
But if he saw it himself,

208
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
Mr. Kim's photo

209
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,520
didn't look good.

210
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,800
My father

211
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,600
He left me when I was young.

212
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
I thought

213
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,160
I would never see him again.

214
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,720
Until one day,

215
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,800
I read in the newspaper that

216
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,000
It can master the ancient and modern times.

217
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,720

218
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,040

220
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,960
It turns out

221
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,840
I have a brother.

222
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,080
You are...

223
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes, I am.

224
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,480
What?

225
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,480
Who are you?

226
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,560
Let me tell you.

227
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,880
This is my brother.

228
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,520
Look.

229
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,160
My brother's big nose and big eye socket

230
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
is carved exactly like me.

231
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
My mom gave birth to it.

232
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,160
This is my brother.

233
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,160
My brother?

234
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
You're increasing my workload.

235
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,920
In my opinion,

236
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,280
if you publish it like this,

237
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,440
if you publish it like this.

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,880
Even if she's lucky,

239
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,480
She saw it.

240
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,040
Coming.

241
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,440
How do you distinguish her?

242
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,880
Those outside the door

243
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,640
are not.

244
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,520
How can you be sure?

245

246
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960

Hello?

248
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,120
What did he say?

249
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
He asked me out tonight.

250
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,000

251
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,560

256

You even recited poems for a family.

257
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
Is it a new trick

258
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,400
to trick those girls?

259

262
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
So generous.

263
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm willing to lie to me.

264
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,440

265
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,280
