1
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,280
Extra! Extra!

2
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
The truth of the plague is exposed.

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,480
There is no plague in Nanyang.

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
It's just a rumor.

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,760
Extra! Extra!

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Did you read the newspaper?

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Isn't this the stock?

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,600
Let me see.

9
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
I'm afraid he's going to dive.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:09,840
Throw.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,280
Yes.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,720
Throw it away.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,360
Hurry up.

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,840
Pudong medicine

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,280
Throw them all away.

16
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,600
Bad news.

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,360
Lots of stocks are sold now.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,640
The stock price keeps falling.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,360
How much?

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
I fell to ten.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,360
So fast?

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,960
When will you apply your medicine?

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,360
Mr. Wang

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,000
We're waiting for the Mayor's approval.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It’s not up to me.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,880
Who has the final say?

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,400
Crystal.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,680
Later, immediately.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,360
Log up a few articles right now.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,560
Hurry up.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,560
Thank you.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,200
It's simple.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,080
Sorry.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,280
The approval hasn't been issued yet.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,480
we won't spread the news.

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,520
Do you need money?

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,160
Thank you.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,320
Sorry.

39
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,400
Our agency

40
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,320
has principles.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,200
Okay.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
No problem.

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,280
Mayor!

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,400
Okay, go ahead.

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,120
This is a chance.

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,640
What's the matter, Wang Tianxing?

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,640
Yes.

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,120
Henry.

49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,480
Did he come to you two days ago?

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,840
Yes.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
What did you talk about?

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,120
We just

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,080
talked.

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,600
He helped the city hall

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
to build an orphanage.

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,120
Is it that simple?

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,080
What else?

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
I heard Henry is doing

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,680
Pudong medicine.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
And you approved the approval.

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,920
He has got the order from the city hall.

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,880
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,160
Last time I came here,

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,360
there was a document

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,720
on the newspaper.

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Nonsense!

67
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,240
Ridiculous!

68
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,240
Nonsense!

69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,079
What are you doing?

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,680
I'll explain to you later.

71
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,440
Hello?

72
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,280
Sir.

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,360
Go ahead.

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,160
Throw.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,920
Throw them all

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
I'm already throwing them away.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,520
But

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,680
I can't throw it out.

79
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,240
Wang Tianxing.

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
What’s going on?

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
Is it a stock?

82
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,760
Mayor!

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,000
He...

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:09,800
I...

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,520
Get lost!

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,160
Calm down.

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,240
What are you doing?

88
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,880
What are you doing?

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
What are you doing?

90
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,200
Let me ask you.

91
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,760
There is no plague in Nanyang.

92
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,520
Who told you to make it up?

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,360
Tell me.

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,159
You...

95
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,800
Calm down.

96
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,600
Calm down.

97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,880
Let's talk.

98
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,159
Your fake news made me go bankrupt.

99
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,159
You want me to talk nicely?

100
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,480
Let me talk.

101
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,159
Why didn't you publish the newspaper?

102
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,560
What business rules are you talking about?

103
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
The information is not true.

104
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,000
What is it?

105
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:56,840
This...

106
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
has been avoided.

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,760
Besides,

108
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,800
we're all following orders of our boss.

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,960
Boss.

110
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,960
Call the boss out!

111
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,760
Call him out!

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,520
Mr. Wang.

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,280
Long time no see.

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Mr. Luo, you are here.

115
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,760
Mr. Luo.

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,280
This is groundless.

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
our newspaper can’t be published randomly.

118
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,720
Mr. Luo.

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
This is not about money.

120
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,320
Buy the newspaper.

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,120
Henry.

122
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,960
Hello. Hello.

123
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,640
You...

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,960
How dare you betray me, Mo Li?

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,000
In troubled times,

126
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,720
everyone has to make plans for themselves.

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,520
Okay.

128
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,840
I really didn't...

129
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
I didn't see you.

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,080
Henry.

131
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,160
Don't be happy too soon.

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
She can betray me.

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,440
sooner or later,

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,480
You don't have to worry about it.

135
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,640
I know.

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
You lied to me together, right?

137
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,200
You are awesome.

138
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,840
Henry.

139
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,760
You tried so hard

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,360
You went through so much trouble

141
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,800
just to recruit me?

142
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,159
That's right.

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,520
We have no grudge.

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
Why?

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Why?

146
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
Why?

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,400
No grudge.

148
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,280
No injustice?

149
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,440
You are...

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,159
You go out first.

151
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
What are you doing?

152
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,800
Wang Tianxing.

153
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
Do you remember

154
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,520
who was killed by you ten years ago?

155
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,800
You smuggled opium

156
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,840
to smuggle opium.

157
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,800
and framed him with an outsider.

158
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,679
and caused the death of Yuwen’s family.

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,120
Did I

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,760
I said?

161
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,640
What...

162
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,840
Who are you?

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Who are you?

164
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,080
Yu Wen Liang.

165
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,920
Steward Wang.

166
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,400
It's been ten years.

167
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm here to get even with you.

168
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,080
Young Master.

169
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm sorry, Young Master.

171
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm sorry to your family.

172
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,880
Young master,

173
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
Please let me go.

174
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,760
Master Yuwen threw all my opium

175
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,680
into the sea.

176
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,720
If I can't hand over the opium,

177
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,560
Li Jian Xing will kill me.

178
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,320
Young Master.

179
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,640
I...

180
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,880
Please.

181
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,520
Did you tamper with the evidence

182
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,960
Did you do it?

183
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,920
Did you bribe the warden

184
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,560
to kill my family?

185
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,040
Young Master.

186
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll tell you everything.

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,320
I did it.

188
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,440
But they forced me to do it.

189
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,880
I have no choice.

190
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,360
I'm guilty.

191
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,360
I know I'm guilty.

192
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,240
Young Master.

193
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,040
I...

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,880
Can I redeem myself?

195
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,360
I'll help you deal with Li Jian Xing

196
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,160
Their opium business has been doing.

197
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,280
Ding Caier's lover.

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,200
