1
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,760
Wang Tianxing suddenly bought a lot of shares.

2
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,080
Where did he get so much money?

3
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,120
Good.

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,480
Looks like he's moving someone else's cake.

5
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,600
Wu Tian.

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
send some good news

7
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,200
some good news about the special medicine.

8
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,520
Let's give him another push.

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,680
How much is it this time?

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,160
12 yuan.

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,440
Yes.

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I drank too much.

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,160
Have some tea.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,520
Ms. Mo Li.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Have you been eavesdropping?

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm here to deliver tea to Mr. Luo.

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
Good tea!

19
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,960
Pudong medicine.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
100 stocks.

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,560
Hurry up.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,400
50 shares.

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,840
Sir,

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
The stock price has risen too fast.

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
Someone must have maliciously raised the price.

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,760
Many big families have entered.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm afraid we can't take it.

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
You know nothing.

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,560
You talk too much.

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,440
When Miss Mo Li wakes up,

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
washing and cooking.

32
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
What is he doing?

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,240
Guess

34
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,440
why I'm not leaving.

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,480
On the contrary,

36
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm guessing

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,080
will leave.

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,560
You're right.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,840
I'm leaving now.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,520
Where are you going?

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,840
Flowers.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,840
Flowers?

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
There are so many flowers in my yard.

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,120
in my yard.

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
Remember.

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,720
I like Jasmine.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,240
It's not the season for jasmine to bloom.

48
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,560
What a beautiful jasmine flower bone.

49
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,320
I thought you found a new job

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,840
after you found a new job.

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
The flowers

52
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,640
bloom brightly.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,720
And

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
in the right place.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,320
Really?

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,519
Cut the crap.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,279
Any good news?

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,519
Henglio asked Manager Qian

59
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,600
to buy

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,840
from

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
in Pudong Pharmaceuticals.

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
They said they'll take as much as they have.

63
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,400
No cost.

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,360
at any cost.

65
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
I knew it was him.

66
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,840
By the way,

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,760
One night,

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
a foreigner rushed in

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,920
and yelled at him.

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,159
What?

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,760
He poisoned

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,960
while making medicine.

73
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,760
Is that him?

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Moving Bei Nan.

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,360
This is

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,880
It's him.

77
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
No wonder.

78
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
No wonder he stayed in Henry's house.

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
There's something wrong.

80
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
I knew it.

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
You're sneaky

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,880
sneaking around

83
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
[sneaking around.]

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,200
Mr. Wang.

85
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Are you...

86
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Did you do something wrong?

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,120
Why did you invite Detective Oh?

88
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,360
Well...

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,720
Looking for a girl?

90
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,880
It's not a crime, right?

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,159
Of course not.

92
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
Then no one did it.

93
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,280
You can...

94
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,400
Please leave.

95
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,280
Thank you.

96
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,320
Don't ever think about stepping into the Henry family again.

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,640
Where were we?

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
They had a fierce fight.

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,520
Just a fight.

100
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,080
Really?

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
Pudong medicine will rise.

102
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,440
It's just that the news hasn't been released yet.

103
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,680
So you...

104
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,760
We're out of money again.

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,400
What did you say?

106
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm out of money again.

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
Why do I always have no money?

108
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,360
Did you hack money?

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,720
How about this?

110
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,280
Give me

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,840
the money

112
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,400
to the south city.

113
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Sir.

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,320
You're playing with fire.

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
If we fail,

116
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,600
both of us will die.

117
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,320
What's wrong with you?

118
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,560
You never change.

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,400
I lost hundreds of thousands because of you last time.

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,440
If you say one more word,

121
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,600
I'll sew your mouth.

122
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Get lost!

123
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,760
Come back.

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Help me.

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Contact two people.

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Where's Jasmine?

127
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
She went to buy flowers.

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,000
Flowers?

129
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,680
You believe everything she says.

130
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,640
I came to tell you where she went.

131
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,920
She went to inform Wang Tianxing.

132
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,040
What?

133
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,360
That's it.

134
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,800
Luo,

135
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
What are you doing?

136
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,640
Wang Tianxing.

137
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,840
I asked you to work with me before.

138
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,480
and gave you a chance to make money.

139
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,920
Now you secretly built the mouse warehouse

140
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
and bought all my stocks.

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,680
I paid for it.

142
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,200
and made an article with the newspaper.

143
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,600
But you made all the money.

144
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,960
Is this appropriate?

145
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,680
The plague is coming.

146
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,360
There are many people in Shanghai.

147
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,400
Luo,

148
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,480
This is your fault.

149
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,240
You didn't cooperate with me back then.

150
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,120
But I'm not like you.

151
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,960
I'll let bygones be bygones.

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,400
I want to introduce some old friends to you.

153
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,360
George.

154
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,840
Anthony.

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:01,960
Come in.

156
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,400
Come in.

157
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,280
Mr. Wang.

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,200
Thank you.

159
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,800
Please.

160
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,240
You...

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,600
You know each other?

162
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I don't need to introduce you.

163
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,680
Interesting.

164
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,520
You think my money is dirty?

165
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,720
What?

166
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
his money is clean?

167
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,360
Luo,

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,760
They are

169
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,080
are my advisors.

170
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,240
Now,

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,400
The plague is rampant.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
The newspaper is very interested

173
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
in Pudong Pharmaceuticals.

174
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,080
So,

175
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,400
I invited them here

176
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
to help you.

177
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,840
Wang Tianxing.

178
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,640
Don't go too far.

179
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,760
Me?

180
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,080
You make medicine

181
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,160
while making drugs.

182
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,680
You said I went too far.

183
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,560
You used dirty tricks.

184
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,520
You raise the stock price.

185
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,680
You said I went too far.

186
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,080
Speaking of going too far,

187
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,480
The same goes for you.

188
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,040
have their own lives.

189
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,680
You know everything?

190
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,720
Of course.

191
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,320
Since you chose not to cooperate with me,

192
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,160
I have to find my own way out.

193
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
The road is facing the sky.

194
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,200
and go half way.

195
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's see what we can do.

196
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,960
Don't report me in the future.

199

200
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,960
Don't do it.

201
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,080

202
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,480

205
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,520

206

209

Henglio used drugs to make medicine.

210
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,640
It's unpardonable.

211

You're welcome, Mr. Wang.

212
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,360
It's not just about money.

213
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,240
Most importantly,

214
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,920
is Mr. Wang's character.

215
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,520
You're right.

216
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,960
I am a noble person.

217
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,160
A person

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,600
who is out of the low-class fun.

219
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,240
As the old saying goes,

220
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,400
the world is full of joy

221
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,640

222
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,680
The world

223
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960

224
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,840
We businessmen

225
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
should be profitable.

226
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,600
But

227
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,560
in life,

228
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,480
you can't go against your will.

229
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,480
You can't go against your will.

230
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,440
You can't go against your will.

231
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,640

232
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,960
will be punished.

233
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
Do you think

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Pudong.

235
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,960
Tell me.

236
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,080
how much

237
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,720
How much can it go up?

238
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,960
I think

239
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
at least 15.

240
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:52,960
No.

241

No.

242
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,480
Once Pudong medicine is published,

243
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,840
at least

244
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,920
This amount.

245
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,360
Twenty.

246
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,600

262
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,200
Ms. Mo Li,

263
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,920
is this a spy?

264
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Why do you say so?

265
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,240
Wu Tian told me

266
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,600
you went to see Wang Tianxing today.

267
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,200

271

272
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,280

273
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,160

274
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,400

275
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,240
I can save you?

276
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,800
I believe

277
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,120
you have the ability.

278
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,360
I'm going to throw away all the medicine for Pudong.

279
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
Me too.

280
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
Did you throw them away?

281
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,680
No, it's still covered.

282
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Throw it now.

283
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,600

284
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,280

14.8 yuan.

288
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,000

289

290
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,440

291

Now

292
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800

293
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,040
It's a little unstable.

294
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
Many small investors have been discarded.

295
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,160
Why don't we just give up?

296
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,480

300

301
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,520
