1
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,680
Don't shoot.

2
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
I knew there was no bullet in the gun.

3
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,519
Long time no see.

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Long time no see.

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,240
Yuwen Liang.

6
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,360
Mr. Wang is here.

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,000
Long time no see.

8
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,039
Vice Mayor Li,

9
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,640
I’m flattered.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,320
Cui Rong said

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,240
Wang Tianxing killed the Yuwen family.

12
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,360
He said

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,960
someone reported

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,520
the Yuwen family colluded with the enemy and betrayed our country.

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,080
In the prison,

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,720
someone asked Wang Tianxing to send him a letter

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,360
to kill my whole family.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,000
The person who asked Wang Tianxing to deliver the letter

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,640
is the current Mayor Li.

20
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,479
Li...

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,320
Jane.

22
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,360
Okay.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,680
Impossible.

24
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,160
Vice Mayor Li.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,720
was your father’s best friend.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,039
After you were arrested,

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,640
he asked his connections to save you.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Please save Yu Wen Liang.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
What can I do?

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,480
After I saved you,

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,120
I wanted to find another chance to let you go.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,680
But then,

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,640
suddenly transferred me and Choi Young.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
I had no chance to go back.

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,079
Then I heard there was a fire.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,240
I thought

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
you died in that fire.

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,360
Thank you.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
for your kindness

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,640
for the Yuwen family

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,240
for many years.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,160
Today is my son.

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,960
Yuwen Liang.

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
and Xinyi Lan.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,320
[and Lan Xinyi.]

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,079
To remember this moment,

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,400
Please

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,760
take a picture together.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,920
Everyone, look at me.

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
Three, two, one.

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
Hurray!

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
Hurray!

53
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,600
All these years,

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,079
I've been investigating in secret.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
to help you find out the truth.

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,560
I heard

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
when Wang Tianxing was your butler,

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
he made a mistake.

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,720
and got scolded by your father.

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
But considering our years of friendship,

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
I didn't kick him out.

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,760
Master.

63
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,760
Please calm down.

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,040
Wang Tianxing

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,000
was close to a girl.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,680
That girl

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,040
is Ding Caier.

69
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,120
much younger than him.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,040
They must have had a past.

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,320
Wang Tianxing has established an investment bank.

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
He has the funds of several big families.

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,480
A few years ago,

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
he lost all his money to scramble rubber.

75
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,600
Ding Caier helped him.

76
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,000
He made a lot of money

77
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,840
in the past two years.

78
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,200
That's right.

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
and got the favor of two vice mayors.

80
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,600
But now,

81
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,240
suddenly become extremely cautious.

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
especially to strangers.

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
I heard Ding Caier

84
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
helped him

85
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
I left him.

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,960
That's right.

87
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
He soon took over a shipping company.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,720
And

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040
this company

90
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,800
has something to do

91
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,680
with Mayor Li.

92
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,000
That's amazing.

93
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
A dinner party

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,000
at a dinner party.

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
It's much faster than making money with stocks.

96
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,360
We can't have dinner every day.

97
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,720
Only with Mr. Wang's money

98
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,640
can produce more money.

99
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,280
Yes.

100
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,200
Thanks to

101
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,080
your cultivation.

102
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,520
The construction of the train...

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,520
What's the rush?

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
Five years later,

105
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,440
in five years.

106
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,680
We don't know what world we'll live in.

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
Just keep your mouth shut.

108
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,159
Don't forget

109
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,240
how you made a comeback.

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,680
I understand.

111
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,560
Yes, sir.

112
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,680
By the way, Mayor,

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,280
I heard that

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,440
a rich businessman

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,760
from Nanyang.

116
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,040
He donated 800,000 yuan in one go.

117
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,520
You

118
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
stay away from him.

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,760
A complete stranger

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,200
donated so much all of a sudden.

121
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,160
I don't want anything in return.

122
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,320
I can't see it through.

123
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,720
You'd better stay away from him.

124
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,200
Got it.

125
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,720
What if Lee Kan Seong is the real culprit?

126
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,920
what would you do?

127
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,240
After all,

128
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,400
Sa-wen is also your good friend.

129
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,440
If that's the case,

130
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,200
I believe

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
he will understand me.

132
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,840
Father.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,720
Why didn't you let Wang Tianxing get close to Henry?

134
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,720
He's just a merchant in Nanyang.

135
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,880
It's good for us

136
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
might be good for us.

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
It's not the time yet.

138
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,680
Check his background first.

139
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,040
and see

140
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,440
What is he doing?

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,320
Don't forget

142
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
how you made a comeback.

143
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,440
Wang Tianxing.

144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,520
You don't even know what rubber is.

145
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,520
How dare you invest so much?

146
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,960
How dare you touch the money of the shipping company?

147
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
Mayor Li is willing to let you go

148
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
for old times' sake.

149
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,360
However,

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,520
the shipping company.

151
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Give it to me.

152
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,200
Also,

153
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,760
let's not get involved anymore.

154
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,200
Vice Mayor Lee will be unhappy.

155
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,720
Bye.

156
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,760
Hello.

157
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,840
Mr. Wang.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,720
A businessman from Nanyang

159
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,600
wants to invite you to dinner.

160
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,040
No.

161
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,200
Miss.

162
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,320
What's wrong?

163
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,680
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

164
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,400
Your medicine is very effective.

165
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,120
However,

166
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
I've never seen

167
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,600
in Shanghai.

168
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,520
That's right.

169
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,160
We work with a foreign pharmaceutical company.

170
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,080
This is a new special drug.

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,440
It works

172
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
some special bacteria.

173
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
Mr. Luo is really

174
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,680
young and promising.

175
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,000
I just came to Shanghai.

176
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,360
I want to do

177
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
in investment.

178
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,720
But

179
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm not familiar with the place.

180
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,240
Cheers.

181
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,040
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

182
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,760
I

183
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,880
It's an honor.

184
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,360
It's my honor too.

185
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,120
I won't beat around the bush.

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,120
Let's get straight to the point.

187
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Mr. Wang,

188
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,600
to buy some stocks for me.

189
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,520
Business?

190
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,520
You guys talk.

191
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,000
I just want to introduce him to you.

192
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,280
Excuse me.

193
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,120
Ms Ding.

194
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,840
Mr. Luo.

195
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
I’ve

196
