00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,710
-Dojin. -Yes?

5
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,930
I saw a cockroach earlier.

6
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,479
-You saw one? -Yes.

7
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,200
So I went up to it and immediately sprayed at it for 5 seconds,

8
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,060
You have changed.

9
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,560
But it's a little small.

10
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,760
It's almost done.

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,780
Yoon Dojin.

12
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,120
Yes?

13
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,680
It's a gift.

14
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,220
What's going on?

15
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,040
Do Won!

16
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,950
It's what I saw last time.

17
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,750
It's cool.

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,280
Just like this trip's El Nido,

20
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,700
don't forget your brightness that shines as bright as the sun.

21
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,390
I hope what you want will come true.

22
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,340
Let's wrap up our fun and go home.

23
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,190
How do I do this?

24
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,620
Should I paste it on my suitcase?

25
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,770
Are you touched?

26
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,780
Are you shy?

27
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,540
Where should I put this up on?

28
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,430
How about this?

29
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,310
Let's make a photo frame.

Shy Sunglasses.

31
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,520
That gives it that vibe, right?

32
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,000
It would be nice to put this in a photo frame.

33
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,610
Let's go.

34
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,560
Okay, okay. Let's go.

Poster.

36
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,660
It's a poster to store memory again.

37
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,160
But it's a pity.

38
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,370
The cockroach is coming out again.

39
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll take care of it.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,860

41
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,930
Eating it with mushrooms is really tasty.

Let's take a photo.

43
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,160
A photo?

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,149
Wow, how did we get to El Nido?

45
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,470
It feels like we're in Palawan.

46
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,740
How can you give the fish to the cat?

47
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,980
Why am I a cat?

52

It's lively and I really liked it.

53

The nice is really good. It was really nice.

54
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,410

57

58
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,750
Hello.

Good afternoon. Welcome to Nacpan Beach Glamping.

-Do you need help? -Glaming.

61
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,730
Thank you.

62
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,120
Could you check my, our reservation?

63
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,110
Yes, sure, sir. Please have a seat, please.

64
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,960
Okay.

It's good that it's raining.

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,410
You know when you're drenched, your tension will go up, right?

75
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,860
If I get wet in the rain, I take off my clothes.

76
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,240
I don't like my clothes getting wet.

77
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,010
Do you have experience riding a ATV?

78
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,110
I do.

79
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,410
What about your license?

80
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,500
License... I-I have it.

81
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,190
Got it.

82
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,800
I-I have it.

83
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,290
But it's the Do Won license that hasn't been officiated yet.

84
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,250
Do you have one?

85
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,750
For me,

86
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,190
I can ride things with wheels very well.

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,510
I saw you drive a truck.

88
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,610
Wasn't that amazing? Right?

89
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,360
Yes. That's right.

90
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,540
Possible?

91
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,670
All right. Let's go.

92

-Let's go. -Let's go to the ATV.

93
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,760
But... I feel...

94
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,000
You know when you're drenched, your tension will go up, right?

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,810
Is that it?

96
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,420

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,570
The person in front will ride standing

99
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,160
while the person at the back will sit.

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,810
Go forward.

101
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,690
How can I use this ATV?

102
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,510
-Yes sir. -Yeah.

103
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,900
Is this okay?

104
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,270
Thank you, sir.

105
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,750
Thank you. Thank you.

106
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,090
Where are you going? Slow down.

107
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,030
Where are you going?

108
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,180
This way.

109
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,460
This is a little...

110
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,700
Tell me if you feel uncomfortable.

111
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,020
I want to get off.

112
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,610

113
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,880
Come on, come on

114
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:21,100
Eh, eh!

115
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,380
It hurts! Stop!

116
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,710
This is fun.

117
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,670
It's so scary.

118
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,970
Just stay still.

119
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,309
Okay.

120
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,780
Payment now. Payment now.

121
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,659
Okay.

122
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,820
Payment now.

123
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,940
Yeah, let's go.

124
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,690
Do you want to ride it too?

125
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,320
Of course, I'll ride it.

126
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,420
Show us.

127
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,010
-It's here. -It's nice.

128
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,690
Let's get it! Let's go!

129
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,070
These waves, this speed, El Nido!

130
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,380
Let's go, let's go!

131
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,960
No!

132
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,590
No!

133
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,520
It hurts.

134
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,960
-Did it splash on you? -Yeah.

135
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,270
-The back seat is uncomfortable, right? -Yeah.

136
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,880
When we return you can ride it.

137
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,880
Get in the water.

138
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,700
-Go! -Go in!

139
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,430
No, no, no.

140
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,340
It's so cooling.

141
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,580
It's cooling?

142
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,600
Is the water cold?

143
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,180
This place is perfect for swimming too.

144
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,060
The beach surrounded by fog.

145
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,650
It's really so beautiful.

146
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,080
Tell us a little about how you feel.

147
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,890
No, give us a paragraph on how you feel.

148
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,230
The sea... is nice.

149
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,420
Shall we go now?

150
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,150
Do Won.

151
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,390
How do I open this?

152
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,080
Down there.

153
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,710
So it's this.

154
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,140
Do you know why?

155
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,870
-Why? -Mosquitoes would fly in.

156
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,530
Are you going to spray mosquito repellent?

157
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,650
No, no, after spraying that,

158
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,360
the mosquitoes ignore me and I will get upset.

159
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,610
I'm kidding. I'll spray some.

160
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,640
You want it?

161
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,630
But I don't feel well in this outfit.

162
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,410
I'm wearing it again.

163
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,750
Change into something else.

164
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,260
Something else? Do I have something else? I don't think so.

165
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,060
Dojin.

166
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,460
I have one.

167
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,280
That one? Does it fit me?

168
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,630
Yes, I think so. This one is a little bigger.

169
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,230
I don't think it'd suit me.

170
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,580
It smells like new clothes.

171
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,960
How is it?

172
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,460
It's totally like mine though?

173
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,980
-It's like from the beginning... -I made it according to your size.

174
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,390
Are you giving it to me?

175
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,030
Not really. Just...

176
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,470
I told you last time.

177
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,260
That you're making a T-shirt?

178
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:49,350
Do Won said he wanted to bring clothes he made himself.

179
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,770
Can you make one for me too?

180
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,870
I thought about it earlier, but because the size is different...

181
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,840
Muscles are the trend nowadays.

182
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,660
You need to use the dryer and dry it once or twice.

183
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,170
Yes, sir. I'm going to print it tomorrow.

184
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,240
If I want it in black...

185
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,220
I've made the clothes I designed

186
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,970
that I'm being to El Nido.

187
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,950
I'll wear it well.

188
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,320
Okay, wear it well.

189
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,840
The fabric is quite thick. Not bad.

190
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
It's quite thick. Not bad.

191
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,990
It's quite thick?

192
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,490
-Is that lip balm? -Yeah.

193
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,700
I've been using this lip balm for three years.

194
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,070
I wanted to give this to Do Won.

195
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,710
Although it's just a small gift.

196
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,500
You really use lip balm a lot.

197
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,510
You put it on from time to time, so...

198
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,290
I kept thinking, should I have given this to you earlier? But...

199
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,910
Thank you so much.

200
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,430
This one is very good.

201
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,650
I only give this to people I like around me.

202
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,820
Oh yeah!

203
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,450
It's really moisturizing.

204
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:15,010
It's big and easy to apply.

205
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,610
I really like it.

206
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,650
-Thanks bro. -And...

207
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,220
There's one more thing.

208
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:27,870
This is...

209
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,470
Wait.

210
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,630
Wait, I'm not taking the bracelet.

211
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,730
-It's not the bracelet. -I won't take it.

212
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,160
Ring, bracelet, necklace, things like this.

213
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,770
It's nothing like that.

214
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,460
-An amulet. -Earrings.

215
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,970
This is an amulet I made myself.

216
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,960
I really sewed it myself.

217
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,500
Is there a place you can make this yourself?

218
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,670
You said you saw a ghost.

219
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,210
I really have a weak aura.

220
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,950
When I was a kid, I used to get sleep paralysis.

221
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,170
I made with the thought of helping you

222
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,760
ward off those bad spirits.

223
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,810
It's an amulet then, right?

224
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,010
You got it?

225
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,660
I don't know if the size is suitable.

226
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,040
I made it based on my wrist size.

227
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,390
-It suits well. -Yeah.

228
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,440
Thanks.

229
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,160
It's really hot.

230
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,450
-Would it be cooler outside? -Let's go get a drink.

231
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,830
Let's go for another beer.

232
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,950
I don't want beer.

233
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,810
Then what?

234
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,610
I'm going to have a drink while immersed in these waves.

235
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,130
What is this?

236
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,120
What is this?

237
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,330
The sound of firewood burning.

238
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,990
Tick tick.

239
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,230
But it's slightly drizzling.

240
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,250
A rain as light as this. It's more like a mist.

241
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,700
I want to eat quickly. I'm hungry.

242
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,080
-I asked them to get us a fork. -Oh.

243
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,200
Grill it to around this level.

244
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,270
Here.

245
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,660
It's really delicious.

246
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,150
It's really tender.

247
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,350
I'm going to fish.

248
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,040
Thank you.

249
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,930
I got it! I got it!

250
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,180
Mine, mine too!

251
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,410
Finally!

252
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,250
I got it!

253
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,130
It's hot. It's dangerous. Be careful.

254
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,190
A human must always be hot-blooded inside their body.

255
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,520
This is unbelievable.

256
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,170
What is this chicken?

257
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,819
It's hot.

258
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,040
What is this? Who made this?

259
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,230
Try this.

260
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,170
Thank you.

261
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,630
It's crazy.

262
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,470
It's really good.

263
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,030
-What is this? -Have a drink.

264
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,900
-Who made this? -Have a drink.

265
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,530
Why is it so refreshing?

266
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:27,410
The rain... It's raining.... It's a pity.

267
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,320
But there are good things about rainy days too, right?

268
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,230
-We had too much fun, right? -That's true.

269
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:42,070
Today's ATV. I really want to ride that home.

270
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,560
Let's go.

271
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,630
-I think it was the most fun. -Me too.

272
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,770
It was the most fun.

273
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,240
It's the most exciting when I rode the ATV.

274
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,250
When can I fly by the sea like that again?

275
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,110
Do you want to come to El Nido again?

276
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:09,810
Till when I miss it again. This air, this relationship, and this closeness,

277
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,410
I would want to come back again.

278
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,220
-I'm so shy. -Right?

279
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,160
Everyone was so nice to us.

280
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,220
-But I think, if we can go back to our first day... -Yeah?

281
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,140
I should've enjoyed it more. It's a pity.

282
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,260
In places with many people...

283
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:42,770
Because I'm an introvert, so it was quite tiring, honestly.

284
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,980
I'm starting to be worried now.

285
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,170
But I'm always worried when I go on trips.

286
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,420
-Worried? -Yeah.

287
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,220
I'm the type who worries about everything.

288
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,020
Seeing how you're so bright on this trip,

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,490
I thought if I could travel like that,

290
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,950
I would have so much fun.

291
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,460
It's a pity, but it's not a big deal.

292
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,070
Okay, that's good.

293
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,630
I had so much fun.

294
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,520
I had no regrets playing.

295
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,430
We should have some regrets. to look forward to the next trip.

296
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,210
That's right.

297
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,360
Because I've only been overseas alone.

298
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,260
Yes, this is my first time.

299
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,230
It's my first time going abroad with someone.

300
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,250
I don't really know Do Won's style yet.

301
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,490
It was last year.

302
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,240
Is it good?

303
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,980
Well...

304
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,440
Let's try first. We have to try before we know.

305
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,470
-I need. -What are you ordering?

306
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,110
I need frappe iced.

307
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,840
But I feel secure when we're together.

308
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,490
Yes, that's right.

309
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,620
Ah, but it was like a dream, El Nido.

310
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,870
El Nido.

311
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,800
I heard that El Nido is so beautiful it's like paradise.

312
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,260
It's paradise.

313
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,660
-Left, right. -Left, right.

314
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,660
Wow.

315
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,140
I feel like I'm really in El Nido.

316
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,070
It's okay. I can do it myself.

317
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,530
Don't can't force yourself.

318
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,250
Mahal, mahal. Mahal.

319
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,590
It's too expensive.

320
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,870
I'm sure you like it. Wait.

321
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,930
What are you filming?

322
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,540
This is the best healing.

323
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,350
Without Dojin here...

324
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,080
I think Do Won...

325
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,210
Oysters, cheers.

326
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,400
Cheers.

327
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,520
One shot.

328
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,910
Can I?

329
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,600
Do you remember when we talked about coming here at first

330
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,700
on KakaoTalk?

331
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,730
You said you wanted to have fun.

332
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,350
I think everything went as I hoped.

333
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,180
I had fun without any accident.

334
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,240
Next. Where do you want to go next?

335
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,700
Me?

336
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,640
You have to say it like this.

337
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
-Oh, the prologue? -That's how you say it.

338
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,020
Next season.

339
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,760
-Next season. -Please.

340
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,560
-Let's move on to the next season. -Please.

341
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,050
Considering something more realistic,

342
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,130
would it be better to go to Switzerland?

343
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,620
Switzerland. Going to Switzerland and doing skydiving.

344
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,030
-Paragliding. -That'd be great.

345
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,820
About this level. Take a look here.

346
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,240
-Could it be? -Could it be?

347
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,910
Maybe.

348
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,440
Watch football, walk around,

349
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,050
and see the Eiffel Tower in France.

350
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,990
Let's work hard.

351
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,200
Go for it.

352
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,040
Let me make an acrostic poem.

353
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,870
El.

354
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,160
In El Nido...

355
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,700
Ni.

356
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,890
Because I have you...

357
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,480
Do.

358
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,020
It was nice.

359
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,970
It was nice.

360
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,490
We have to work harder. Work hard and...

361
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,610
I have to do my best.

362
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,930
Work hard and... Let's work hard!

363
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,860
-Work hard studying. -Let's work hard.

364
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,020
Go for it.
