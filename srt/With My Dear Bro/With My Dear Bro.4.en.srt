00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,020
[With My Dear Bro]

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,570
We're probably going to take that.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,820
Left, right.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,880
Left, right.

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,950
Let's go, let's go.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,300
It feels like we're really in El Nido.

9
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,100
What should we do

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,910
tomorrow morning?

11
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,140
Charge at home.

12
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,020
Give me a 1,000 Peso note.

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,260
Okay. Here.

14
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,120
I'll make you something simple.

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,620
It's more portable. Something you can eat quickly.

16
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,200
They sell strawberry jam here too.

17
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,570
-Strawberry jam?
-Yeah, they sell it here.

18
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,040
Do you like banana strawberry jam?

19
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,590
-I've never had it before.
-You've never had it before?

20
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,800
Tissues.

21
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,580
[Eat well, bro.
Come to Lio Beach at 1400]

22
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,660
Although I'm not good at drawing now,

23
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,850
recently, I've been preparing to draw.

24
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,200
I hope I can draw when I have time.

25
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,930
For example, when making a poster,

26
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,190
I can draw it with an iPad.

27
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,450
Like this,

28
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,200
add in the color.

29
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,680
I need to print my own clothes too.

30
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,940
Can I order a basil mojito. No alcohol.

31
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,120
-Basil mojito, no alcohol.
-Yes.

32
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,730
Sorry. Do you have scissors?

33
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,550
Okay, can I borrow it?

34
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,420
Thank you.

35
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,350
Thank you.

36
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,370
The view is beautiful.

37
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,330
Hello.

38
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,450
Okay, thank you.

39
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,540
Bye.

40
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,760
Thank you.

41
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,970
Before I came here,

42
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,820
Dowon and I made a promise to give each other a surprise.

43
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,600
I've prepared it. I prepared it in Korea.

44
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,020
Something that reminds me of that place.

45
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,880
I bought one in every place.

46
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,620
It's all done.

47
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,770
Like this. The bracelet, is done.

48
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,760
It suits the wrist.

49
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,160
Brother's wrist is thinner. This is definitely his size.

50
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,510
When I give him this present,

51
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,490
I'm going to give this to him secretly.

52
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,670
Yes. Now, mojito, basil mojito.

53
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,660
I can finally taste it.

54
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,190
The ice has already melted.

55
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,190
I'm going to give him a poster as a gift.

56
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,490
I'll put it up in his place with a small letter

57
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,640
and send it to him together.

58
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,290
This one.

59
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,780
[Dojin, this trip...]

60
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,680
This trip...

61
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,140
I chose this poster because

62
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,720
this image,

63
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,250
even so, are you able to get what you want

64
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,720
in your life

65
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,880
and to feel that you're loved?

66
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,650
Something that conveys that.

67
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,110
Because a lot of locals in El Nido love Dojin,

68
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,910
I hope you keep this memory, and become a better actor.

69
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,730
I hope you can trust yourself more and move forward.

70
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,490
I don't know if Dojin can find this.

71
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,630
Then I'll put it on the most obvious sofa in the living room.

72
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,160
Bye.

73
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,100
If I let you join together,

74
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,020
what kind of competition do you want to take part in?

75
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,360
I like basketball.

76
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,310
You can go play with them.

77
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,760
What?

78
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,770
Nice!

80
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,220
Nice!

81
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,620
What?

82
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,930
One more point! One more point! Just wait a little.

83
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,900
Nice!

84
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,670
Just cross the net.

85
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,090
See you again, bro.

86
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,020
Thank you. Thank you. Bye bye.

87
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,340
Let's go. You saw that, right?

88
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,000
With the spirit of DODRAM.

89
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,600
DODRAM?

90
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,420
The name of the volleyball league is DODRAM.

91
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,060
-We have to go that way.
-Pick up the ball.

92
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,380
-When did you get here?
I... About 30 minutes ago.

93
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,800
Let's go. Where? Over there?

94
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,080
Here, this way.

95
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,680
Yoga.

96
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,380
Have you ever done yoga?

97
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,070
I did that, pilates.

98
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,480
Pilates. How was Pilates? Could you do it?

99
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,460
Of course, I'm flexible.

100
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,550
-I want to try.
I want to learn it.

101
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,740

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,530
Oh, that's right.

I'll teach you.

105
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,490
I just have to stay still, right?

106
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,820
-Of course. Just follow me.
-Okay.

107
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,510

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,130

-You're a yoga class teacher, right?
-Yes.

114
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,590
Okay.

115
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,990
When will we start yoga class?

116
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,120
And then we're gonna do the yoga at the end of the bridge.

117
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,160
-Here?
-Yeah. During sunset.

118
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,070
It must be beautiful.

119
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,810
-That's good. -That's good.

120
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,400
I need to use the toilet. Prepare, and like change clothes.

121
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,500
-Okay. Toilet's over there.
-Thank you.

122
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,810
-Go ahead. -Okay.

123
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,600
The toast is good.

124
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,710
I spread some banana strawberry jam. How is it?

125
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,590
It's delicious.

126
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,300
The plane flew over.

127
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,710
I really like the sea.

128
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,930
-The sea?
-In travel destinations.

129
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,070
I like everything. Cause it's traveling.

130
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,090
If I don't have to do yoga today,

131
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,850
I would just rush in.

132
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,230
You can go ahead. I'll wait for you.

133
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:37,910
I'll talk to the teacher.

134
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,960
No, it's already scheduled.

135
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,210
What do you take a schedule for?

136
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,350
The teacher is here.

137
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,550
-Hi. -Hi.

141
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,550
-You can take one each.
-Okay.

142
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,120
-You got it? -Yeah.

143
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,880
Wait. I'm already getting tired already.

144
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,100
Give it to me.

145
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,160
-Give it to me.
-No.

146
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,180
-Do you need help? -No, no, no. I'm strong.

147
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,750
-He's pilates master.
-Yeah.

148
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,150
-Pilates master.
-Yeah.

149
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,050
Yoga class... Is hard?

150
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,540
We can do hard

151
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,930
we can do easy, it's really up to you.

152
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,400
What do you want today?

153
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:23,990
-Very very easy.
-Okay, no problem.

154
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,760
Thank you.

155
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,980
How many minutes do you want?

156
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,230
-He's master.
-Yeah.

157
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,240
He's only hard, hard course. I'm easy.

158
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,460
-Okay.
-Yeah.

159
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,300
Put your arms by your sides.

160
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,180
As you inhale, reach your arms up.

161
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,540
Look at your hands.

162
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,930
As you exhale, slowly fold forward.

163
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,780
And then step your feet back to a plank pose.

164
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,570
All right. Now look forward again. Inhale, to the tip of your toes.

165
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,560
Lift your chest up, open the front body, maybe look up.

166
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,720
And then exhale. Send your hip back. Tuck your toes.

167
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,100
Lift the hips, downward facing dog.

168
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,800
Last two breaths here.

169
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,900
And then inhale, start to walk or step your feet forward.

170
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,390
And exhale, release your ar,s.

171
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,000
This time, bend your knees into a squat.

172
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,660
And then inhale, find your chair pose.

173
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,360
Imagine you're sitting down on a chair.

174
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,180
Go ahead. Bend your knees.

175
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,130
Bend your knees, reach your arms up.

176
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,760
And then start to look up towards the sky.

177
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,180
Start to do the same thing you did on the other side.

178
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,380
Okay, look at one spot again.

179
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,070
Look at one spot again.

180
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,000
Focus there, take your hands to your chest.

181
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,670
Four.

182
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,420
Three.

183
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,610
Left foot steps back, plank pose.

184
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,040
Look forward, inhale, and then start to look up towards the sky.

185
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,620
But at the same time, you're stretching up higher.

186
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,280
This time we're going to step only the left footback.

187
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,360
-Two.
-One.

188
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,120
Left heel down.

189
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,780
Extend your arms out.

190
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,170
Rest your other ear, relax and breathe.

191
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,520
Okay, let's do round two.

192
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,480
Look forward, take your hands forward this time.

193
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,020
Okay. When you're ready, inhale, lift the chest.

194
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,320
Maybe lift the arms.

195
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,910
You can stay here if you want or lift your feet.

196
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,200
Five. Maybe look up.

197
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,660
Four.

198
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,350
Keep breathing. Three.

199
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,630
It should be the last step.

200
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,650
-And exhale back to where you came from.
-There should be another 10 minutes.

201
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,030
-I don't think so.
-From here, straighten your front leg.

202
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,010
Exhale there. How are you feeling?

203
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,560
Feel so good.

204
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,650
Keep going. Balancing pose. We're going to do three poses.

205
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,520
Start to walk your shoulders. Closer to the ground.

206
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,620
Make a bridge pose.

207
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,760
Look, isn't this a zombie?

208
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,350
Four, hold it up. Three.

209
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,200
Put your shoulders in. Put it in more.

210
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,050
Put what in?

211
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,670
I told you to put it inside.

212
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,290
What more?

213
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,310
That's it.

214
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,990
You can do it.

215
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,680
All the way back down.

216
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,270
Back down.

217
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,500
Oh, okay.

218
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,440
We'll do one more round.

219
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,680
-O-one more?
-One more?

220
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,700
Okay, one more.

221
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, one round.

222
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,370
Exhale everything out. And when you're ready,

223
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,460
start to reach your right leg up to the sky.

224
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,550
Right leg up.

225
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,820
Two, three.

226
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,650
Hang in there.

227
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,230
Four.

228
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,460
My...

229
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,450
Two, three.

230
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,090
If I hadn't had surgery.

231
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,070
If I'm not this tall.

232
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,590
Let's slow down the breath.

233
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,290
We're here for five.

234
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,610
This is our final pose.

235
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,080
It's called the shavasana or corpse pose.

236
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,120
Where we allow the body to completely relax.

237
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,080
Good relax but

238
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,480
my body is dead.

239
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,220
I'm hungry.

240
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,980
-Hello. -Hello, guys.

241
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,670
Hello.

242
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,600
This is our food menu.

243
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,460
Good evening.

244
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,830
-Thank you. -I also have some drinks here.

245
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,470
-Really? -So many dishes.

246
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,330
Here also.

247
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,400
Thank you.

248
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,100
How are you? My name is Marcos.

249
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,930
-Marcos. -Marcos.

250
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,450
How are you?

251
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,180
I'm Dojin.

252
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,630
Welcome to the Philippines.

253
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,660
-Thank you. -First time here?

254
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,190
Yeah.

255
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,060
-My first time here.
-All right.

256
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,020
Should we ask him to recommend it?

257
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,520
-Can you recommend best menu?
-Yes, okay.

258
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
Since you're two,

259
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
I'd recommend our paella.

260
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,880
This is very good. Very famous in Spain.

261
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,010
We make it really good. You will try.

262
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,790
-Okay. And for two. -Okay.

263
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,110
Croquette and gambas.

264
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,430
Croquette and gambas. Yes.

265
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,460
Two sangrias.

266
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,160
One each?

267
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,870
-Yeah. -Okay.

268
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,590
Perfect.

269
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,170
Thank you.

270
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,720
-Thank you. -Thank you very much.

271
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,660
Thank you.

272
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,830
It's so pretty.

273
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,910
You said you liked this kind of bread.

274
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,580
This kind of bread is delicious.

275
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,940
It looks really delicious.

276
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,570
-Thank you. -Thank you.

277
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,830
Enjoy, thank you guys.

278
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,380
It's so beautiful.

279
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,810
Aren't you going to cheers?

280
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm not drinking.

281
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,540
No, who would cheers for sangria?

282
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,560
I'm not drinking.

283
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,620
You're Korean. What are you talking about?

284
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,210
-As long as you're Korean... -Okay.

285
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,680
I just pretended to drink.

286
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,230
-You didn't drink, did you?
-I didn't.

287
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,180
Is this a toast?

288
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,630
-I think I hit it hard. -Hold on.

289
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,100
You need to say a toast.

290
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,750
Go ahead.

291
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,030
An acrostic poem with El Nido?

292
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,830
-An acrostic poem with El Nido? -Yeah.

293
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,140
-El.
-In El Nido.

294
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,720
Ni.

295
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,840
Three, two.

296
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,330
In Nido.

297
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,030
Do.

298
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,610
With Dojin.

299
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,070
I'll give you 3.7 points.

300
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,650
-Okay. -3.7 points.

301
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,260
How was the yoga today?

302
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,540
I think it was great.

303
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,990
To be able to see the sea while practicing yoga.

304
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,620
How many more times can there be in my life?

305
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,860
That's right.

306
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,950
It's really nice. Like you said. Seeing the sea.

307
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,930
I pretended I couldn't do it.

308
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,630
Two.

309
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,850
Right? You said you did pilates.

310
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,230
I was a little flustered.

311
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,680
I've done pilates about five times now.

312
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,260
-Five times? -Five times.

313
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,010
You're a master at this level.

314
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,560
That's right.

315
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,930
That's right.

316
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,820
It's here.

317
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,100
Here, the platter selection.

318
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,900
Thank you.

319
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,520
-It looks delicious. -It looks delicious.

320
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,950
Let's eat.

321
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,220
What's wrong?

322
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,160
Is it hot?

323
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,490
It's too hot, so I can't taste it.

324
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
I think so.

325
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,920
How is it?

326
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,230
Tasty?

327
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,390
It's really good.

328
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,360
I recommend this place. It's a good restaurant.

329
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,230
A good restaurant?

330
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,160
Trip advisor? 999 points?

331
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,210
Yeah.

332
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,750
It's really delicious.

333
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,030
Delicious.

334
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,010
It's really delicious.

335
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,010
Great.

336
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,060
But I won't forget today.

337
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,760
I had a tiring day today too. I had a good time.

338
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,240
I...

339
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,770
Say "Dojin, you worked hard."

340
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,980
-Today is really.
-It's so good.

341
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,000
No need to say anything.

342
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,170
I just want to enjoy today.

343
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,500
Let's enjoy the food now.

344
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,570
Okay, let's have a drink.

345
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,300
Cheers to the third night on El Nido.

346
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,560
El Nido!

347
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,870
Let's get it.

348
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,660
-Why didn't you finish it?
-It's really good.

349
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,280
Okay. It's really good.

350
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,300
Hurry up and eat.

351
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,730
Is this how you do it?

352
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,100
[Enjoy, brother.
Come to the Lio Beach at 1400]

353
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,630
Brother!

354
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,100
This is the best healing.

355
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,980
Cheers.

356
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,560
This is our last shopping day.

357
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,520
Let's do a mission.

358
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,010
Buy clothes and put them on within the time limit.

359
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,650
He's not here.

360
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,430
We can't buy anything at this rate, can we?

361
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,850
Oh no!
