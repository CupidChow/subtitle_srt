151
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,820
You've to ask the locals for famous local restaurants.

160
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,550

165
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,750
Kind of.

This place is so nice.

168
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,650
I know, right?

169
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,830
Since you travel often, you must be used to such views.

170
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:18,170
But such sea views... I've never been to Southeast Asia.

It's hard to choose.

186
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,690
Yeah. There are too many options in the same category.

187
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,850
Let's order a meat dish.

188
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,960
-Meat.
-Meat.

189
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,910
Sounds good.

190
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,310
One pork grilled...

191
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,350
One chicken dish?

192
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,560
-Teriyaki?
-Yeah.

193
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,860
And...

194
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,020
How about just these two dishes?

195
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,620
Two dishes?

196
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
You want more, right?

197
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,890
Yes, I want more.

198
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,500
Order one more that you want. I'll...

199
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,510
Okay. What is this?

200
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,020
This is Pinakbet.
[Vegetable dish made with the special Filipino shrimp paste]

201
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,290
Pinakbet?

202
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,090
It's a Filipino dish.

203
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,090
-Filipino dish?
-Yeah.

204
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,990
-Okay. I'm try that.
-Yeah.

205
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,590
I'll repeat your order, sir.

206
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,120
-Grilled pork, and one chicken teriyaki.
-Yup.

207
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,910
-And two coke.
-Yup.

208
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,100
-And one Pinakbet.
-Yeah.

209
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,900
It's good?

210
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,290
-Yeah.
-It's good.

211
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,560
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

212
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm looking forward to the food here.

213
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,370
I'm not tired anymore.

214
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,690
Because I have high expectations for the food.

215
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,970
I'm really hungry.

216
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,310
-Huh?
-I'm really hungry.

217
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,870
This is a famous restaurant, right?

218
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,880
A famous restaurant.

219
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,430
This is our first meal here.

220
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,790
So we need to find what suits our taste.

221
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,280
There are too many kinds of dishes on the menu.

222
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,450
Right, I didn't know what to choose.

223
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,850
Let's challenge ourselves first,

224
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,440
and then we can try the dishes we like at other restaurants too.

225
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,760
But can we eat whatever we want?

226
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,330
-Huh?
-Can we eat whatever we want?

227
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,830
We have a budget.

228
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,020
Yes.

229
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,940
We can't eat whatever we want.

230
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,570
We'll just get groceries and cook if we run out of money.

231
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,590
Let's eat as much as we want here.

232
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,260
Do you want to go to the supermarket after this meal?

233
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,740
The local market.

234
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,730
Is this a wine glass... or is it a water glass?

235
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,170
I majored in hotel management.

236
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,540
First of all, this is a fork.

237
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,580
Really? This is a fork?

238
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,360
Yes, and this is a knife.

239
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,190
Knife.

240
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,330
And these are the soup spoon and the rice spoon.

241
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,310
Which one is the water glass? This...

242
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,540
Hotel management major.

243
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,480
That's right. This should be the glass for water

244
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,290
and other drinks.

245
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,010
A glass for drinks.

246
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,250
Because this glass is longer.

247
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,140
The temperature will rise, so the longer one is the wine glass.

248
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,700
To prevent the alcohol from evaporating?

249
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,970
No, the taste will change.

250
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,180
The taste will change?

251
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,430
-Yeah.
-Okay.

252
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,630
Let's have a glass of wine.

253
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,720
Wine? When we've just begun?

254
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,170
No, not now.

255
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm really hungry.

256
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,460
-Huh?
-I'm really hungry.

257
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,780
When we go to a restaurant in Korea,

258
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,030
they'll already have placed a lot of side dishes on our table.

259
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,110
Now, how should I put it?

260
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,050
The art of slowness.

261
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,870
The art of slowness.

262
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,380
It can be a bit tough for Koreans to adapt to.

263
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm used to the dishes being served immediately.

264
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,770
But what did we order?

265
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,620
-Huh?
-What did we order?

266
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,150
Chicken takoya...

267
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,260
Chicken takoyaki?

268
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,190
What was it again? Wait, what was it?

269
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,700
Oh, it's...

270
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,840
Tadaki?

271
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,350
Beef Tadaki?

272
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,110
-What's it called, really?
-Chicken.

273
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,710
Teriyaki.

274
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,180
Teriyaki. Chicken teriyaki...

275
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,920
-Yes, that...
-And grilled pork.

276
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,640
You said you wanted to challenge yourself with a dish.

277
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,590
Oh, right.

278
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,330
The Filipino dish. The Filipino dish.

279
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,030
The food is here.

280
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,990
-Thank you.
-Hello.

281
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,400
Here don't have Zero Coke?

282
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,740
-No.
-Oh, just...

283
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,610
She can speak Korean.

284
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,430
-Excuse me...
-Hello.

285
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,760
-Hello.
-What's going on?

286
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
She's Korean.

287
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,780
I didn't expect to meet a Korean.

288
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,940
Sorry, sir, I don't understand Korean.

289
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,110
-Okay.
-Okay. It's okay.

290
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,010
Thank you.

291
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,130
Cheers.

292
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,090
-Bottoms up?
-Can you do it?

293
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,800
It's refreshing. Thank you for the food.

294
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,370
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

295
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,220
Is it your treat? Thank you.

296
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,650
Yeah, eat up.

297
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,870
Yeah, eat up.

298
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,810
Is it good?

299
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,180
I like vegetables.

300
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,140
Is it zucchini?

301
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,450
-Sweet pumpkin.
-Okay.

302
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,710
Yeah, sweet pumpkin.

303
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,180
Mm, it's delicious. This is really good.

304
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,570
Out of the three dishes, you haven't tried the chicken yet, right?

305
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,910
This is good too.

306
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,170
It tastes like Korean soy sauce fried chicken.

307
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,820
What do you think? Did it meet your expectations?

308
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,770
Yes, it's really good.

309
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,860
It's like...

310
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,120
What are you doing? Are you appreciating it?

311
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,690
I'm thinking about how to describe the taste.

312
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,320
How to describe the taste? Okay.

313
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,350
It's kind of like being abroad

314
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,050
and running into a Korean passerby.

315
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,350
Oh, are you describing it like a novel?

316
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,140
It's not bad.

317
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,619
Isn't it good?

318
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,900
-It's like running into a Korean person abroad...
-And?

319
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,569
And being so pleased to meet them

320
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,770
that I patted their back.

321
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,640
To that extent?

322
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,630
Try this.

323
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,730
Hold it down for me.

324
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,970
Try it. It really feels like an encounter with a Korean person.

325
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,630
Delicious.

326
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,990
Yeah, it's delicious.

327
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,360
I think this one suits my taste the best.

328
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
Yes, it's delicious.

329
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,690
Is this lime?

330
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes, lime. They usually squeeze the lime on it.

331
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,690
It tastes like kumquats.

332
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,900
What are kumquats?

333
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,570
Don't you know?

334
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,460
What are kumquats?

335
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,380
Kumquat!

336
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,460
Wh-What are kumquats?

337
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,280
Kumquats are kumquats, obviously. What kind of question is that?

338
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,590
-Are you Korean?
-Yes.

339
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,660
Kumquat?

340
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,110
Haven't you eaten kumquats before?

341
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,830
I've never heard of it even though I really like mandarins.

342
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,330
You're making a mistake.

343
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,670
You don't know kumquats?

344
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,010
Search for kumquats on Naver.

345
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,270
Search "kumquats".

346
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,290
Search for the meaning of kumquats.

347
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,560
There are kumquat trees.

348
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,230
Really?

349
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,950
But you're British, so I'll search in English.

350
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,570
-What are you talking about?
-I'll let you hear it.

351
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,020
They really exist?

352
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,550
Of course, Papago's telling us what

353
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,340
kumquats are.

354
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,800
Oh, there it is. Kumquats are little mandarins.

355
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,070
Oh, they're golden oranges.

356
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,490
Oh, they're golden oranges.

357
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,430
The term I used is actually Japanese.

358
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,140
But I want to go to someplace more local now. Right now...

359
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,810
I think it'll feel like we're abroad after we head there.

360
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,280
It feels sort of unbelievable right now. We came here so suddenly...

361
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,640
It feels like the view's just a video and I'm eating in Korea.

362
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,200
Are you done eating?

363
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,850
Shall we continue on with our journey?

364
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,130
To the market?

365
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,100
Let's go.

366
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,520
I had a great meal.

367
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
It felt like a light meal.

368
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,010
The rain is sporadic.

369
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,880
Yeah.

370
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,930
-This is also part of the experience.
-It's actually raining now, though it's not visible.

371
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,310
It's face mist.

372
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,630
Natural face mist.

373
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,260
-Let's exchange the money first.
-Yes, we've to exchange the money.

374
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,380
-Currency exchange...
-Yeah, I've already found it.

375
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,860
We're on our way there now.

376
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,180
I've also planned everything in my head.

377
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,380
Wow, there are yachts over there.

378
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,380
These are so beautiful.

379
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,940
Souvenirs?

380
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,200
There's bread.

381
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,090
Yeah.

382
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,070
It's around here.

383
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,780
-This way.
-We just need to go a little further.

384
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,630
It's this way.

385
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,050
Here it is, the money changer.

386
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,490
-It's here.
-Money changer.

387
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,110
One dollar is 58 pesos. The price is fixed.

388
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,590
I think it's a better rate than the airport's.

389
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,550
Hi.

390
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,240
Hello.

391
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,700
Money changer.

392
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,000
How much do we have now?

393
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,210
Wait. I got it.

394
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,390
Our travel expenses.

395
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,200
We have 700 dollars.

396
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,740
-700 dollars?
-Yeah.

397
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,060
-700 dollars.
-Exchange 700 dollars.

398
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,910
Just exchange everything.

399
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:33,100
This is 700 dollars. Yup, check... check please.

400
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,070
Okay, wait a minute. Okay, check... check 7 dollars.

401
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,420
Make sure it's accurate. Handle money matters seriously.

402
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,470
Okay, okay.

403
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,490
Make sure it's accurate.

404
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,750
Okay, okay.

405
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,470
You're good at managing money.

406
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,190
No.

407
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,560
You were a natural science major, so you should be good at calculating.

408
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,660
I was a liberal arts major.

409
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,050
Really?

410
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,820
I-I'd better be in charge.

411
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,850
Are the fruits cheap there?

412
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,730
I love fruits.

413
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,490
But we can't eat whatever we want,

414
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,610
since we have a budget.

415
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,610
That's right.

416
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,710
But one pineapple's not going to make a difference, will it?

417
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,060
-It will.
-Really?

418
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,780
You need to calculate it accurately.

419
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,990
It's right.

420
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,990
-You sure?
-Yeah.

421
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,360
Sure.

422
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,100
Make sure it's accurate.

423
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,170
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

424
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,580
Thank you. Wait a minute.

425
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,040
One, two, three, four, five, six.

426
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,010
Give it to me.

427
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,140
1,000?

428
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,780
Six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

429
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,120
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

430
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,980
Okay, sir, thank you.

431
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,160
-Thank you.
-See you. Catch you later.

432
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,230
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

433
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,960
Have a good day.

434
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,230
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

435
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,700
Then, since

436
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,480
we've exchanged the money,

437
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,670
let's go buy a wallet.

438
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,460
Let's buy one at a place that sells small accessories.

439
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,950
Is there anything else you need to buy?

440
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,030
-Something I need to buy?
-Yeah.

441
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,350
I want to buy slippers.

442
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,620
My slippers are made of cork, I think,

443
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,570
so it cracks when it gets wet.

444
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,420
What should I do?

445
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,840
Then let's buy slippers and a wallet.

446
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,450
What should I do?

447
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,600
A wallet.

448
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,740
Slippers and a wallet.

449
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,140
Slippers and a wallet.

450
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,670
By the way, we should really haggle over the price here.

451
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,950
Haggling is key.

452
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,040
Oh! Okay.

453
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,150
Hello.

454
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,290
-Hello.
-Hello, hello, hello.

455
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,470
How much is this?

456
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,620
Three for 100.

457
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,050
-Three for...
-100.

458
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,000
-Three for 100.
-Yes.

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,070
-Three for 100.
-Yes.

460
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,620
Three for 100?

461
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,380
31,000... 3,100?

462
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,140
3,100?

463
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,930
-Three for 100.
-Three for...

464
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,890
100.

465
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,040
3,100?

466
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,390
100, three pieces.

467
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,620
-Oh... 300.
-300.

468
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,210
Hold on. I have this.

469
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,750
The intonation is quite difficult.

470
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,940
I think we just need to know this word, "mahal".

471
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,900
Mahal, mahal.

472
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,820
-Mahal, mahal.
-Mahal, mahal.

473
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,210
Mahal. Expensive.

474
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,110
Mahal! Too much... too much expensive.

475
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,640
Mahal. Expensive.

476
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,800
Three, yes. This one. Three and 100.

477
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,390
Yeah, um, this...

478
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,320
Oh, three...

479
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,180
I think it's the price of three.

480
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,340
Oh... we almost caused trouble

481
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,060
from the beginning.

482
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,350
Okay.

483
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,080
This looks nice too.

484
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,000
It looks like it attracts wealth.

485
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,960
The gold one?

486
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,280
-Let's take this one.
-Let's take this one.

487
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,070
This one, yeah, this one.

488
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,830
-How much is it?
-50.

489
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,770
-50?
-Yes.

490
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,890
40.

491
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,010
-Yes.
-Okay.

492
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,960
-Yes.
-Okay.

493
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,080
-No, wait.
-Why?

494
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,660
More, more.

495
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,580
35?

496
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,590
35, sir?

497
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,000
40.

498
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,560
400 pesos?

499
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,980
10,000 won? No, so expensive.

500
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,450
40. 400 pesos?

501
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,620
-It's still...
-No, so expensive.

502
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,360
One plus one.

503
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,590
One plus one.

504
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,910
Let's... give her 1,000 pesos first.

505
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,580
Wait, 1,000 pesos.

506
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,060
No, no. This 50 pesos.

507
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,170
It's really cheap

508
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,250
if it's 50 pesos.

509
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,920
50. This one.

510
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,070
Yes.

511
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,650
40.

512
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,810
More, more.

513
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,830
35?

514
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,210
No, so expensive.

515
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,950
One plus one.

516
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,880
Shall we buy one more?

517
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,950
Shall we buy one more?

518
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,380
How about two?

519
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,870
How about we buy two and use one for coins?

520
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,920
One for coins?

521
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,010
The black one just now?

522
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,070
Yup, and one more please.

523
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,410
One more?

524
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,990
Give her one more bill.

525
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,560
Here.

526
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,160
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

527
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,840
-Bye bye.
-Bye.

528
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,460
From the beginning...

529
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,730
But we haggled to 40 pesos,

530
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,960
and yet it ended up like this.

531
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,450
-40.
-Yes.

532
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,090
Okay.

533
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,410
50. This one, yes.

534
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,130
Do Won. Dojin.

535
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,440
Oh my god.

536
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,730
I'm really shy right now.

537
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,960
So I need to at least cover my eyes.

538
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,580
Awesome.

539
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,140
Should we just buy one first?

540
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,060
Yes, let's buy one first.

541
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,550
This is all I have left.

542
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,120
20? Hey, boss.

543
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,500
Thank you.

544
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,160
I wonder if we're buying everything at the right price.
