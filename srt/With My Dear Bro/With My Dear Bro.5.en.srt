00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,510
Today.

5
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,640
We are shooting morning vlog for Do wWon.

6
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,230
-Hello. -Hello.

7
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,170
What are you doing?

8
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,770
What brings you here?

9
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,740
I'm from the filming team.

10
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,090
I see.

11
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,130
Hold on.

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,520
Can I go to the bathroom?

13
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,070
Hold on.

14
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,310
You're pretty shy.

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,979
Hold on.

16
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,930
Are you a parrot?

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,440
Hold on.

18
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,440
Come in.

19
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,039
Okay, got it.

20
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,820
What are you spraying?

21
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,840
A mist.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,100
A mist?

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,880
Thank you.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,090
I'm going to pick my sunglasses.

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,620
This is a prop for someone shy.

26
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,759
Yes.

27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,550
I want to choose one of these two.

28
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,110
Which one should I choose?

29
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,100
For me, not this one.

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,840
It's the same color as the shirt.

31
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,990
It looks good on you.

32
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,810
-I can't see.
-It's Korean style. Someone on the front.

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,060
I can't see anything.

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,470
Let me light up your road ahead.

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,510
-Which one is better? -Brown.

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,700
Brown.

37
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,640
I'll wear this then.

38
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,970
I'll pick this.

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,579
Do you want to check your luggage again?

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,070
Someone stole my phone.

41
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,510
Did you leave it downstairs?

42
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,870
-Ah... Mr. Cockroach -Mr. Cockroach.

43
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,770
Mr. Cockroah, where's the phone?

44
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,070
Mr. Cockroach?

45
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,630
Give me my phone.

46
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,400
Weren't you playing a song?

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,170
Oh, that's right.

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,390
Thank you, sir.

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,920
Let's get it

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,720
The weather is nice.

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,950
You said the weather is good?

52
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,900
Weather is good.

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,120
-Weather is good. -Yeah.

54
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,640
-We're have to go eat seafood. -Seafood.

55
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,000
You said you wanted seafood.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,320
-I want seafood too. -I really want it.

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,930
Do Won said he wanted to eat seafood.

58
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,190
Seafood?

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,430
I found a restaurant he'll like.

60
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,000
A restaurant that specializes in seafood.

61
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,200
There's seafood here, right?

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,260
There is indeed seafood here.

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,500
Check the menu.

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,540
There are all kinds of prawns.

65
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,900
Prawn dishes.

66
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,270
Squid dishes.

67
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,880
Lobster.

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,060
Shall we eat here?

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,960
What should we eat?

70
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,370
-What a happy worry. -Yeah.

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,920
I'm drooling.

72
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,140
-Lobster. -Lobster?

73
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,450
-Grilled. -Let's get it grilled, shall we?

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,560
This one?

75
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,370
Okay.

76
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,470
Let's have a prawn, shall we?

77
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,790
Prawn.

78
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,720
Is this garlic pepper?

79
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,610
-Garlic? -Yes garlic pepper.

80
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,089
-This one. -Okay.

81
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,800
And for drinks, Coke Zero.

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,470
-Okay. -As usual.

83
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,050
One grilled lobster.

84
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,440
And then, one garlic pepper prawn.

85
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,790
And steamed oysters and baked clams.

86
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,090
One more dish of this.

87
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,180
And this soup.

88
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,909
-Thank you. -Thank you.

89
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,860
It's our last shopping today, right?

91
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,980
-Almost. -That's right.

92
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,590
It's like a mission. Giving each other a fixed time.

93
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,340
And wear the clothes we bought for each other.

94
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,320
We need to finish in quickly an hour. Right?

95
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,040
I've never worn a Hawaii shirt before.

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,100
Choose a cold tone one for me.

97
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,630
Cool tone?

98
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,250
And flip flops that's very local.

99
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,110
Flip flops that's very local.

100
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,430
I'll leave it to you. Okay. Got it.

101
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,110
I trust your feeling.

102
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,400
You.

103
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,940
It's real.

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,350
Thank you.

105
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,700
This is soup. This is the grilled oysters we ordered.

106
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,800
Thank you.

107
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,740
-We don't need to dip this in sauce, right? -Cheers.

108
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,130
Cheers, oysters.

109
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,820
There's that seafood vibe.

110
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,000
There's that seafood vibe.

111
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,510
It's fresh.

112
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,220
Delicious.

113
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,840
Prawn cheers.

114
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,450
Cheers, prawn.

115
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,100
Cheers.

116
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,590
It's really delicious.

117
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,570
It's really delicious.

118
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,730
I really ate a lot.

119
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,610
The prawns?

120
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,770
I've never missed a college festival--

121
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,200
Does it want it?

122
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,580
What should I give it?

123
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,960
We can't let it eat.

124
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,340
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,350
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,180
Thank you.

127
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,520
-Steamed fish with lemongrass. -Thank you.

128
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,460
It's kind of...

129
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,570
-What? -It's really salty.

130
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,530
It feels like eating fish sauce.

131
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,600
It seems to be the problem.

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,060
We have to remove this and it'll be fine if we eat it like this.

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,310
Something like this.

134
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,020
Thank you.

135
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,600
Very tender.

136
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,330
Thank you.

137
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,600
Have you eaten lobsters?

138
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,080
I really had it a long time ago.

139
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,030
It's my first time.

140
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,960
Really?

141
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,260
I'll do a drone shoot.

142
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,130
A drone shot?

143
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,900
Try it.

144
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,190
Thank you.

145
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,360
How is it?

146
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,310
This is what lobsters taste like.

147
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,400
The forehead that shows the truth.

148
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,890
A new palette to my taste buds.

149
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,950
Lobster.

150
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,700
Thank you.

151
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,230
Is it good?

152
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,150
The Spanish restaurant was really good too.

153
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,720
This is really delicious too.

154
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,030
This is the best healing.

155
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,500
I'm eating a lot.

156
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's go.

157
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,890
-Let's go. -Let's go.

158
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,890
Thank you, sir.

159
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,059
-Bye bye. -Thank you.

160
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,530
One hour. Shop for an hour.

161
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,980
Okay, one hour shopping.

162
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,500
Don't buy weird clothes.

163
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,460
-I'll work really hard. I will be serious. -That's good.

164
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,260
-Something taht we both will look good in. -A little.

165
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,820
Okay.

166
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,730
Let's do that.

167
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,260
-I'll go this way. -I was going to go this way.

168
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,640
-Then I'll go this way. -I'll think about it.

169
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
-I think I should go this way. I'm going. -Okay.

170
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,600
Extreme introvert starts again.

171
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,200
This is bad.

172
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,830
It's because Dojin isn't here.

173
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,670
So this is what it feels like.

174
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,710
Hi.

175
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,160
There are a lot of pants here.

176
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,420
Can I buy three? 20?

177
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,660
If I look for it, there should be other areas.

178
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,050
I think there's a performance there.

179
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,660
Lady.

180
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,160
Won't you leave me.

181
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,720
They're singing a song I know. How interesting.

182
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,560
-Hello. -Hello.

183
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,970
The doggy is taking the car like this.

184
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,120
It's amazing. The police cars here in El Nido

185
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,740
are like trucks.

186
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,660
They're so passionate. I-I

187
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,720
couldn't even lift my head.

188
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,120
Hello.

189
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,130
I'm going to sort out my schedule for today.

190
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,330
With this friend.

191
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,270
First...

192
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,130
First...

193
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,240
First...

194
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,330
Okay.

195
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,020
With Papago. Hello, I'm shooting right now.

196
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:23,080
Hello. If you don't mind, can I film?

197
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,420
Hello. If you don't mind, can I take a picture for a while?

198
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,940
Okay, let's go.

199
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,920
Let's go somewhere else.

200
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,330
-Hello. -Hi.

201
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,880
Hello.

202
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,120
Wait.

203
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,280
If I'm shy I have my sunglasses. I can just wear them.

204
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,720
Okay.

205
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,210
Okay.

206
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,740
I'm confident now.

207
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,760
I'm going in for a bit.

208
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,180
Hello. If you don't mind, can I take a picture for a while?

209
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,430
-Hi. -Hello, sir.

210
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,100
Hello. Hello.

211
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,020
If you don't mind, can I take a picture for a while?

212
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,020
-Yeah, sure. -Sure.

213
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,360
Thank you.

214
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,640
How much is it? So this place is expensive.

215
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,400
Thank you.

216
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,130
-Thank you. -Thank you.

217
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,960
At this rate, I won't be able to buy anything, right?

218
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,510
I got here first.

219
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,650
I think, Do Won is probably still wandering around now.

220
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,810
What time is it?

221
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,460
This is bad.

222
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,230
I'm here, but he's not here yet. That's it!

223
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,230
Where was it?

224
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,170
Oh it's here. I'm here, I'm here.

225
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,500
What time is it?

226
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,440
-What time is it? -Did you buy something?

227
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,680
What time is it?

228
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,300
I arrived at 50, just now.

229
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,860
What do you take a promise for?

230
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,960
-Let's go. -Back home?

231
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,270
-Yes, let's go home. -Okay.

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,300
Buy some vegetables along the way, then go home.

233
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,070
-Okay. -Let's go.

234
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,390
What did you buy?

235
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,680
But it's much cooler inside.

236
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,940
I'll put it here.

237
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,450
Here?

238
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,370
Don't you need to take a shower?

239
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,070
I'm going to marinate the chicken first.

240
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,590
-I'm going to marinate the chicken first. -Okay.

241
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,960
Add some oil.

242
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,970
He really eats a lot.

243
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm really confident now. In terms of eating,

244
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,380
-Now my weight... -Weight management.

245
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,870
What did you eat to lose weight?

246
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,710
Chicken breast, rice, kimchi.

247
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,960
-Really? -Yes.

248
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,450
Can I eat two whole fried chicken?

249
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,810
Two whole fried chicken. Two.

250
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,340
At least two.

251
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,050
-Are you going out? -Yes.

252
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,160
Go ahead.

253
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,360
What are you going to take?

254
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,960
Me? The motorbike.

255
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,910
Take care on your way. Safety first. Safety.

256
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,710
I'll be back.

257
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,670
Is there really nothing you want to buy?

258
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,880
Melona?

259
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,260
To get Melona when I return?

260
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,520
-Yes. -Okay.

261
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,130
Oh, right.

262
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,850
If a cockroach shows up, call me.

263
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,520
Don't say that.

264
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,450
Be careful. It might even appear on the ceiling.

265
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,910
I can smell the chicken already.

266
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,540
Let's cut it with a knife to make it marinate better.

267
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,260
Add some salt.

268
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,580
What is this?

269
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,590
Put some curry powder.

270
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,560
I need to get changed.

271
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,030
While Do Won makes the fried chicken,

272
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,630
I'm going to buy some fruits and food that he likes to eat.

273
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,730
And also Melona.

274
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,910
I'm at the market.

275
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,950
Hello, hello.

276
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,090
Do you remember me?

277
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,940
-Yeah. -Sure.

278
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,560
I remember you.

279
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,080
Do you want to get one for free?

280
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,380
Yes, because so many.

281
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,950
You want one free because you buy a lot.

282
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,100
Yeah, a lot.

283
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,330
-Yeah this is all really, really. -Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,260
Nice.

285
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,859
-All of? -All?

286
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,770
Yeah.

287
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,230
Let me try if it's the right flavour first.

288
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,170
Can I try this?

289
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,630
-Yeah. -Yeah?

290
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,240
It's right.

291
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,800
It's right. I'm going to cry cause it's so good.

292
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,420
This is it.

293
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,619
I found it.

294
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,310
Discount.

295
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,360
Discount.

296
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,160
Discount.

297
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,930
-So how much is it? -620 pesos.

298
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,160
-600 only. -600 only.

299
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,690
-600? -Yes.

300
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,390
-Thank you. -Thank you.

301
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,950
You have a cute smile.

302
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,360
-Me? -Yeah.

303
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,000
We, together.

304
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,270
Saying that we are both cute.

305
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,830
Put fried powder on the outside.

306
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,100
I think it'll work if we fry it for eight minutes.

307
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,880
Dojin will enjoy it anyway.

308
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,770
It's going well.

309
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,980
Dojin is here.

310
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,180
Do Won should be taking this with me.

311
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,050
The weather is nice.

312
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,810
The view is nice.

313
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,400
There's a feel to it.

314
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,330
It reminds me of the past.

315
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,780
Nice.

316
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,590
You bought a lot. Gosh.

317
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,330
It's really delicious.

318
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,240
It's really delicious. It's really delicious.

319
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,730
-It's sweet. -The staff should try this too.

320
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,760
-Right. -Really.

321
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,180
Shouldn't we buy some?

322
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,580
It's so sweet it's basically a fraud.

323
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,900
All of?

324
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,940
-All? -Yeah, yeah.

325
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,510
Four pineapples. Thank you.

326
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,030
This must be delicious.

327
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,430
Is the fried chicken successful?

328
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,860
The pineapple cutting was successful.

329
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,320
What?

330
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,300
The pineapple cutting was successful.

331
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,470
You cut a lot.

332
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,090
Right? If I put my mind to it, I can do it really quickly.

333
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,470
It looks delicious.

334
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,530
Oh, no.

335
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,290
It dropped.

336
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,560
I will eat well.

337
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,650
It feels like you know,

338
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,520
when I go to my grandma's,

339
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,010
The vibe of the chicken sold in the countryside?

340
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,310
The size are similar.

341
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,800
The legs are really big.

342
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,120
It's not bad.

343
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,770
It doesn't really stick on your teeth.

344
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,070
It's good.

345
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,060
But I don't really like fried chicken.

346
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,060
But I like this kind.

347
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,790
It smells nice too.

348
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,870
I have to try the pineapple.

349
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,340
The plate you're using.

350
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,780
It's like minimalism.

351
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,020
It's like the chicken from the countryside.

352
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,450
Why is it so cooling?

353
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,080
The pineapple will probably appear in my dreams.

354
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,410
It's the clothes that you want to see the most.

355
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,540
Okay.

356
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,140
First of all, this hat is the first one.

357
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,460
What do you think?

358
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,620
It's kind of like during the Rehabilitation period...

359
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,160
How should I put it?

360
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,760
Like what Nietzsche wore.

361
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,770
Give it to me. I'll try them on one by one.

362
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,690
It's really good.

363
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,950
Okay, next.

364
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,560
Next.

365
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,000
And these shoes.

366
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,570
Sun... Sunny shoes.

367
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,260
Sunny... Sunny shoes.

368
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,950
What's this? Aquashoes?

369
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,090
Aquashoes? Yeah, aquashoes.

370
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,670
There has to be a highlight in fashion.

371
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,210
It'd be perfect if I wear this in the water.

372
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,500
You have to wear it in summer or in the water.

373
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,980
Okay, next.

374
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,360
Next.

375
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,000
Next is...

376
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,690
Shirt.

377
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,550
Get me a cool tone one.

378
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,690
I've never worn a Hawaii shirt.

379
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,000
How should I put it? Traditional Hawaiian vibe?

380
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,050
Shit.

381
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,250
It feels like traditional Hawaii.

382
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,180
But isn't it nice?

383
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,080
Well...

384
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,300
It's very comfortable,

385
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,890
-the shirt -Yeah, very comfortable.

386
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,730
They said it's 100% pure cotton.

387
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,680
-The silky smooth touch to it is nice, right? -That's right. This is good.

388
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,170
Okay, next.

389
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,470
But the pants...

390
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,570
-There were really no pants. -There weren't pants.

391
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,250
There weren't any, but even among those,

392
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,530
I chose the best one.

393
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,450
I'll pretend I didn't see it.

394
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,440
This pyramid vibe, El Nido vibe.

395
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,700
El Nido pants. Do Won, aren't you an elephant?

396
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,100
But I like them.

397
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,840
I actually like this kind of pants.

398
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,310
This is pretty.

399
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,900
I found it.

400
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,210
But I like them.

401
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,930
I actually like pants like this.

402
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,450
It's like ice pants.

403
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,550
I bought them given I don't have other choice.

404
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,000
Fine, I agree with this pair of pants.

405
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,180
Thank you anyway.

406
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,550
But for me, I tend to like

407
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:26,070
wearing clothes according to the atmosphere and the mood.

408
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,160
But this mood is a bit hard for me.

409
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,170
-I'm an introvert after all. -Okay.

410
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,960
This is really loud.

411
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,040
I don't know what there is.

412
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,170
First of all, because you said your feet is not feeling comfortable.

413
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,850
First, sandals.

414
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,530
I do want to buy slippers.

415
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,900
Okay. They said they don't have my size.

416
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,450
I'm touched.

417
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,800
Try it on.

418
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,870
Your feet are 280. I bought 280.

419
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,350
No, Do Won, if this is 270,

420
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,830
my feet will change automatically when it goes in.

421
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,300
It really suits you.

422
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,430
Right?

423
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,660
But it's really good, isn't it?

424
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,140
It's nice. I really like it.

425
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,430
Next.

426
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,800
Hawaii shirt.

427
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,670
This is a stretch.

428
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,760
Plastic. Is real plastic.

429
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,300
It's not bad.

430
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,020
And, wait, wait, wait.

431
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,110
What else?

432
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,930
What else?

433
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,330
These is real sunglass.

434
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,210
-Real sunglass. -Yup.

435
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,140
You don't have sunglasses, do you?

436
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,670
It's a nice day, but it's really sunny.

437
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,950
Holy!

438
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,880
Sunglasses. I really don't have sunglasses.

439
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,200
Thank you. I will wear it thankfully.

440
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,760
Okay, I'll take a shower first.

441
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,440
Okay, go ahead.

442
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,080
Go take a shower.

443
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,800
The sunglasses are really good. I'm going to wear them tomorrow.

444
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,050
I'll keep wearing them when I get back to Korea.

445
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,190
Of course. I'll wear them when I get back to Korea.

446
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,480
I'm turning the lights off.

447
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,700
Okay.

448
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,800
I'm already sleepy.

449
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,910
I'm sleeping with my shoes on.

450
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,200
When I bought that shirt,

451
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,670
I said it was for my friend.

452
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,050
I said you are a big man.

453
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,530
My friend, gift.

454
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,090
Not me.

455
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,560
He... He is big man.

456
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,150
Big man?

457
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,610
Yeah. big man.

458
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,270
The last large size was on the mannequin.

459
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,620
So I bought it and they took it off.

460
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:28,720
I walked around with my instinct.

461
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,730
I need to see how to match it.

462
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,410
Like this design and this color.

463
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,230
There were places that seem branded too.

464
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,190
It was too expensive, so I just left.

465
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,950
It looks like a brand store in El Nido.

466
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,270
This shop is an expensive place.

467
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,960
Thank you.

468
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,190
Even if it's expensive, since it's a gift for you,

469
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,540
so I didn't...

470
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,370
So you didn't feel like it's a waste of money.

471
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,070
Yeah, I didn't. I just felt like you have to wear this.

472
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,710
Whoa. I will become someone who can live up to these presents.

473
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,820
Dojin said his feet hurt. I think I should buy him this.

474
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,460
I mean it.

475
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,250
If someone asks me for it, I won't give it to them.

476
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,310
This is really good.

477
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,730
Thank you, friend.

478
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,820
Hello.

479
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,650
Let's go.

480
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,470
I had so much fun.

481
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,720
I had fun with no regrets.

482
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,090
Until I miss it again.

483
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,520
When I miss this air, this relationship, this closeness,

484
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,540
I would want to come back again.
