00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,480
Wow.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,840
It's really nice.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,180
-We need to take a photo.
-A photo?

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,960
-We need to eat something.
-Yes, we...

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,910
The temperature, humidity, El Nido.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,080
What good vibes.

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,470
-It's like running into a Korean person abroad...
-And?

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,720
And being so pleased to meet them that I patted their back.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,310
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

13
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,700
-Bye.
-Bye.

14
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,890
Oh!

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,580
Okay.

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,440
Hello.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,810
400 pesos?

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,640
Now...

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,960
10,000 won?

20
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,200
Mahal. Mahal. Mahal.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,890
It's too much. Too much expensive.

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,470
So expensive. One plus one.

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,440
50, this one.

24
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,590
Yes.

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,020
Oh, take a picture?

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,770
The girl who plays the flute.

27
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,700
The girl who plays the flute.

28
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,860
It's like The Ring.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,830
Do Won. Dojin.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,470
Oh my god.

31
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,390
They're very interested in Korean actors filming there.

32
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,030
-I'm so shy.
-I know, right?

33
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,130
I'm too shy right now.

34
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,270
So I have to at least cover my eyes.

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,710
We've to get used to this kind of thing.

36
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,980
-We should get used to it.
-Of course.

37
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,900
I want to become an extrovert through this trip.

38
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,510
-But you should buy your slippers now.
-Slippers?

39
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,680
Let's go and check it out.

40
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,810
I want to understand this language.

41
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,900
Me too.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,550
Should I try the slippers on?

43
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,910
Try them on if there are slippers.

44
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,860
Sir, uh, sir, can I ask you something?

45
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,160
Is for guy or woman?

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,450
-For woman.
-For woman?

47
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,260
No, no guys?

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,310
-No for guys.
-I told you there are none for men.

49
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,540
It's okay.

50
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,800
It can't be helped.

51
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,380
Shall I buy a tank top?

52
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,760
Buy one.

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,770
I need more big size. This is, um, I'm look so really small.

54
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,720
What size?

55
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,290
Like, um, XXL? Yeah.

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,950
Thank you.

57
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,970
-She said she'd get me an XXL one.
-Oh, okay.

58
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,680
-This is one plus one.
-This one?

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,850
Wait, no.

60
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,380
-It's cute.
-Yeah.

61
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,720
-I can put my phone in it...
-Oh, sounds good.

62
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,079
Let's pay for the tank top and that first.

63
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,800
I think she went to get it.

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,550
She's there.

65
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,840
So she cuts it herself.

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,829
-Awesome.
-It's handmade.

67
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,510
This is handmade, right?

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,390
Awesome.

69
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,730
1,450 pesos.

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,630
I think we can't haggle here since the prices are keyed into the system.

71
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,840
1,450?

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,890
Then let's do this.

73
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,790
-Let's go to the local market....
-The local market.

74
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,060
And do some grocery shopping.

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,959
Choose your favorite tricycle.

76
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,590
-Look around first.
-Okay.

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,620
Let's ask for their name first

78
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,870
and tell them our names.

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,370
After we become friends,

80
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,310
-we can...
-We can haggle over the price.

81
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,940
Let's give it a try.

82
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
This one?

83
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,230
Give it a try.

84
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,280
Hello.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,620
Hello.

86
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,190
My name is Do Won.

87
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,260
What's your name?

88
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,010
Aljun.

89
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,710
Nice to meet you.

90
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,880
I wanna go, um, do you know, um, Caltex?

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Front local market?

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,720
100 pesos.

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,850
100?

94
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,800
90 is possible?

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,460
90?

96
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,930
Thank you.

97
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,320
Bro, let's get in.

98
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,770
I'll get in first.

99
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,080
It feels like I'm on a theme park ride.

100
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, let's go.

101
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,940
Let's go, Aljun.

102
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,990
Dojin, look at the unspoiled nature.

103
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,750
And there's no trash at all in the streets.

104
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,030
There are some over there.

105
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,480
Gosh, who did that? I should pick that up.

106
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,240
The shops and streets we visited

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,920
felt very authentic.

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,640
But after getting on the tricycle,

109
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,040
I feel more... more... how should I put it?

110
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,520
Should I say, immersed in the local atmosphere?

111
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,290
-You're right.
-The local atmosphere.

112
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,930
It's over there.

113
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,960
Thank you.

114
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,980
Thank you, Aljun.

115
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,390
90 is possible?

116
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,890
90?

117
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,340
No, no, just ask our crew to...

118
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,780
We'll ask the crew to...

119
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,150
50 pesos?

120
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,340
My friends give you more, okay?

121
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,470
Situation, situation.

122
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,610
-Yeah, thank you.
-Yeah, thank you.

123
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,940
Goodbye, Aljun.

124
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,300
Have a good day.

125
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,450
First of all, we saved 50 pesos.

126
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,310
-Thank you.
-We saved 50 pesos.

127
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,510
-We're at the local market.
-Yeah.

128
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,280
There's a lot of seafood here like the sea.

129
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,960
What's that?

130
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,720
Woodworm.

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,400
Sorry?

132
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,360
Woodworm from the mangrove.

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,050
I think it's something like that.

134
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,660
The clams... how should I put it? Eggs?

135
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,570
Oh, clam eggs?

136
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,910
I don't know anything about these, so I don't know what to do.

137
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,750
Actually, it's not easy for us to make seafood dishes.

138
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,680
Let's go to the butcher.

139
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,950
Meat?

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,190
This is the same as Korea.

141
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,040
The size of the drumsticks is similar too.

142
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,720
Pig's trotters? Pig's trotters?

143
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,300
How about some pig's trotters?

144
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,950
You want to cook pig's trotters?

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,510
Today is only our first day.

146
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,890
-Why don't we check out some fruits here?
-Okay.

147
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,250
What is this?

148
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:53,890
This?

149
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,530
Isn't it corn? What is this?

150
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,640
Banana heart.

151
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Heart banana?

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,250
Banana heart.

153
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,660
How much?

154
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,320
40 per kilogram.

155
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,630
40?

156
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,370
But I don't know what this is.

157
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,460
Shall we buy one and try it?

158
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,260
Shall we just buy one?

159
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,790
Let's buy one first.

160
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,500
This one.

161
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,180
One.

162
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,080
I think it's right.

163
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,970
Thank you, sir.

164
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,180
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

165
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,260
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

166
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,240
Mangoes! We have to buy mangoes.

167
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,400
Pineapples, mangoes, and lemons.

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,020
That's right. Pineapples and mangoes.

169
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,429
I want to buy pineapple. One pineapple, how much?

170
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,039
60 per kilo, sir.

171
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,179
Don't we have to knock on it?

172
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,160
Knock on it and listen to the sound.

173
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,950
There's... a method for this...

174
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,910
Best pineapple, which one?

175
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,820
The best pineapple.

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,810
The best one?

177
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,270
-Yeah, best, best.
-Best pineapple.

178
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,050
This one.

179
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,650
Okay.

180
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,300
-And then... and then...
-Best mango.

181
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,440
-Yeah, that's the mango.
-Two best mango.

182
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,240
Four, four, four.

183
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,470
-Four?
-Yeah, four.

184
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,180
Four.

185
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,060
-Four?
-Yeah.

186
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,260
And...

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,180
these mandarins look really delicious.

188
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,620
Let's buy some mandarins too then.

189
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,210
Let's ask her to give us the mandarins for free.

190
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,000
What do you think?

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,550
-Nice.
-My strategy.

192
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,100
Pick the most delicious-looking ones.

193
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,590
Let's take one each.

194
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,320
-This one.
-Okay.

195
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,970
I'm always 99 percent successful with haggling.

196
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,330
Two...

197
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,510
You want it free?

198
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,140
Because, uh, so many...

199
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,790
Because you buy a lot?

200
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah, a lot.

201
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,880
You can ask my boss.

202
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,940
-Yeah, she's the boss.
-Your boss?

203
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,760
Hey boss, please.

204
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,330
Okay.

205
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,490
Hey boss.

206
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,370
-She's the boss.
-Thank you.

207
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,710
Thank you.

208
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,270
Thank you.

209
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,780
We did it!

210
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,150
Good job.

211
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,170
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

212
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,460
Bye bye.

213
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,800
Let's go to the supermarket.

214
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,820
-Yeah, let's go.
-The indoor supermarket.

215
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,620
Is it good?

216
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,760
My hands are dirty so I can't peel yours for you.

217
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,350
-Put it in here.
-Have the mandarin.

218
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,510
It's amazing.

219
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,160
Unparalleled.

220
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,470
Really?

221
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,010
The sweetness is also unparalleled.

222
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,950
What is this right now?

223
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,390
This is the mandarin that Dojin went to great lengths to get.

224
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,620
How much was it?

225
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,740
It was free.

226
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,800
Of course.

227
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,240
Let me try it.

228
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,850
Your reaction is crucial.

229
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,570
Very crucial.

230
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,240
Just tell the truth. Really.

231
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,800
Just tell the truth.

232
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,200
-El Nido.
-El Nido.

233
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,550
Temperature, humidity...

234
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,450
-El Nido.
-El Nido.

235
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,910
-But it's really good.
-It's really good. So good.

236
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,880
-It's really delicious.
-Yeah, really.

237
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,030
There's a reason I asked for it.

238
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,800
But it might taste even better because it was free.

239
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,420
That's right.

240
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,230
Free food is the best.

241
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,660
I wonder if we're buying things at the right price.

242
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,740
Well...

243
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,870
-But...
-We should be haggling over the price.

244
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,730
It's too expensive.

245
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,930
90 is possible?

246
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,650
Hey boss, please.

247
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,740
It's only our first day...

248
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,860
-So this is fine.
-We're doing fine.

249
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,850
When we become more experienced...

250
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,210
At this rate...

251
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,830
What is this?

252
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,440
I think it's that...

253
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,990
Hold on. Let me film it.

254
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,420
-What is it? What is it?
-This is...

255
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,190
It's one of the challenging local foods that foreigners should try out.

256
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,480
What should we do?

257
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,790
Try it.

258
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,840
Dojin.

259
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,090
Shall I just try one bite?

260
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,780
Do you want to try it?

261
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,830
Yes, I should at least have one bite.

262
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,930
How much?

263
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,120
25 pesos.

264
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,660
25?

265
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,780
But this is all we have left.

266
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,430
But this is all we have left.

267
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,100
This one is possible? 20?

268
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,930
20?

269
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,720
Thank you.

270
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,070
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

271
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,300
-Thank you, bro.
-Thank you so much.

272
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,970
Let me choose one for you.

273
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,440
I'll try it in your stead.

274
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,590
You're not the one eating it, but you're choosing it.

275
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,870
P, what's it mean?

276
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,560
P, what's it mean?

277
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,770
Why are you smelling it?

278
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,240
Why are you listening to the sound?

279
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,740
Okay.

280
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,390
This one?

281
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,820
But this one looks fine.

282
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,410
Right?

283
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,450
No, I can already feel the claws.

284
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,960
I can feel the claws.

285
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,750
There are wings too.

286
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,150
-But when we're on a trip...
-Okay.

287
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,690
Such challenges are also what makes for a special experience.

288
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,480
What do you think? Should we each have a bite?

289
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,790
I'm full.

290
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,520
But I'm hungry again.

291
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,660
Is it good?

292
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,210
-Hey.
-Yeah?

293
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,280
Are you really not eating it?

294
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,280
-Yeah, I'm full.
-You're full?

295
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,280
I'll be honest. It tastes like a hard roasted egg.

296
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,990
-Really?
-It's delicious.

297
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,530
Let me have a look.

298
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,380
Okay.

299
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,300
Although it looks like this...

300
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,910
It tastes like Korean stuffed squid.

301
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,540
Oh, that... Okay.

302
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,190
It tastes like Korean stuffed squid.

303
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,730
Sleep, yeah, sleep.

304
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,790
That's how I experienced it by myself.

305
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,800
You won't have any memories about this.

306
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,460
Yeah.

307
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,500
You won't have any memories.

308
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,930
Yes!

309
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,600
Hold on, I'll get a shopping cart.

310
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,510
Okay.

311
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,350
Let's put these down.

312
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,940
Put the bags down.

313
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,680
Now, you're in my world.

314
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,300
You like cooking, right?

315
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,940
I really like cooking.

316
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,510
Will you cook what I want to eat?

317
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,970
Is there anything you want to eat?

318
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,420
I want pasta.

319
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,130
Let's take this one.

320
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,960
Okay, the one in the middle?

321
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,470
Yeah.

322
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,930
Do you want to get a cold one instead?

323
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,030
I'm not drinking it now anyway, so it'll be left in the fridge.

324
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,240
Okay.

325
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,870
I don't want to waste your energy for nothing.

326
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,880
-I'll buy a loaf of bread too.
-Okay.

327
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,750
When did you put the chocolate in?

328
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,470
-Let's go. Bye.
-Thank you, sir.

329
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,980
Let's go.

330
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,150
Let's go.

331
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,230
Hand it over, I'll carry it.

332
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,730
It's fine, I'll carry it.

333
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,900
What's the point of conserving energy? I should use it when necessary.

334
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,200
Let's walk this way...

335
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,890
And travel from there.

336
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,290
Yeah, if we go ahead...

337
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,970
We're home.

338
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,520
I'm home.

339
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,690
What pasta are you making?

340
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,520
Pink sauce pasta.

341
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,300
-Pink sauce pasta?
-Yeah.

342
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,570
Can you peel the garlic for me?

343
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,090
Just help me take out the garlic and olive oil.

344
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,610
Okay. The things necessary for making pasta?

345
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,400
Yes.

346
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,810
Olive oil.

347
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,180
Do you need butter to make pasta?

348
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,910
Yes.

349
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,840
You need butter.

350
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,620
Do you need mango marshmallows?

351
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,250
Got it.

352
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,350
What about this?

353
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,770
Put that in...

354
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,580
This one?

355
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,700
Into my mouth.

356
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,740
What is it? Why?

357
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,440
Is something wrong with the fire?

358
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,150
What's going on?

359
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,940
It's a mandarin.

360
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,270
Bro.

361
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,270
Hurry up with the garlic!

362
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,950
What are you doing?

363
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,990
Garlic!

364
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,780
Okay, okay. You've quite a patriarchal attitude...

365
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,700
Garlic!

366
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,080
Okay.

367
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,970
It's this big...

368
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,480
Gosh, you spilled it.

369
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,680
This is a chef's splendor.

370
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,430
-By spilling it?
-Yeah.

371
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,540
As expected, you're different since you have experience as a chef.

372
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,090
That's enough.

373
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,500
-Is this enough?
-Yeah.

374
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,710
Thank you. Thank you.

375
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,230
Let me help out a bit more. I'll peel them.

376
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,460
Okay.

377
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,349
This is too much.

378
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,339
Now that we're back, it seems like we've also bought a lot of fruits.

379
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,270
Do you want some?

380
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,780
What is it? Garlic?

381
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,359
So that I can become a human?

382
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,200
Thank you for the food.

383
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,250
Let's eat.

384
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,240
Okay.

385
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,970
Let me have a big first bite.

386
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,470
What's your score?

387
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,470
What's your score?

388
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,300
Should I have seasoned it more?

389
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,150
I didn't want to eat too salty foods.

390
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,320
No, this is just right.

391
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,480
This is what I usually eat.

392
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,420
It's really good with the mushrooms.

393
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,210
I knew it.

394
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,820
Eat up.

395
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,040
You don't like mushrooms?

396
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,230
I do.

397
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,230
But I generally don't like strong-smelling foods.

398
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,600
So the food I cook are on the blander side.

399
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,420
I told you

400
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,090
that I even eat wheat bread as it is, without jam or sauce.

401
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,200
That's great.

402
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm curious about this big banana.

403
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,320
I know.

404
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,180
What's inside? Is it fur?

405
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,340
Huh?

406
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,440
Don't tell me we have keep peeling?

407
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,150
-Wait.
-Neverending peeling.

408
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,570
Aren't we supposed to eat this?

409
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,120
Try it.

410
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,620
But it does smell like bananas.

411
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,490
Really? Oh yeah, they do.

412
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,950
I think something's wrong with this.

413
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,760
Let me try it.

414
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,350
-It's really good.
-Really?

415
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,730
Yeah.

416
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,610
Like honey?

417
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,820
What is this?

418
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,540
It seems like it'll taste weird.

419
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,230
Wait, it's really good.

420
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
This is a crime.

421
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,650
What is this?

422
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
Heart banana?

423
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,640
What's inside?

424
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,530
Seriously.

425
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,720
I was trying to deceive you, so I ended up eating too much of it.

426
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,270
But it's a waste.

427
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,980
Eat it then.

428
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,080
We don't know what it is, so we can't use it.

429
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,030
But this...

430
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,280
This part looks delicious, right? In the middle.

431
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,240
I think this part's fine.

432
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,470
Then you can eat that. I don't want to eat it anymore.

433
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,860
Let's just clean up and go to bed.

434
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,290
You chose it.

435
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,000
Isn't that a beetle?

436
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,250
What should we do? Catch it!

437
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,190
No, this...

438
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,570
Hurry up!

439
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,010
But this should be fun.

440
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,710
Hurry and catch it.

441
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,740
It'll go there, won't it?

442
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,590
Hurry up. Hurry up!

443
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,570
Hurry and catch it! Hurry!

444
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,620
Catch it for real. Don't joke around.

445
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,730
Okay, okay.

446
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,920
You're good at catching it.

447
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,430
Don't joke around. I'm serious.

448
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,880
I think it moved.

449
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,490
Dojin! Dojin!

450
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,070
Do you want to wash up first?

451
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,260
No.

452
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,370
There are bugs!

453
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,220
I'm almost done.

454
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,580
This is refreshing.

455
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,950
I only took five minutes, right?

456
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,670
It went up there.

457
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,500
Isn't that a moth?

458
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,190
Catch it.

459
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,660
I caught it. What should I do with it?

460
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,540
But it's a bit... How should I put it...

461
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,590
It's not symmetrical.

462
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,830
What?

463
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,700
Is it not symmetrical?

464
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,640
-She did it in such a rush.
-Yeah.

465
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,120
But it's also cool in its own way.

466
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,270
Bro!

467
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,190
Are you done washing up?

468
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,090
Bro! Bro!

469
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,840
-Bro!
-What?

470
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,690
Do you want some beer?

471
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,060
Shall we have some beer?

472
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,070
I'll go buy some.

473
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:22,280
Okay, Dojin. But I don't like drinking just a bit.

474
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,120
Yeah, I'm talking about one box.

475
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,010
Yes, that's right.

476
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,190
One box.

477
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,360
I'll be right back.

478
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,180
Put the towel here...

479
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,040
Bro, what are you doing?

480
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,020
Let's have a drink.

481
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,080
We made it safely to El Nido.

482
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,650
This is how I feel right now.

483
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,860
I don't remember anything in the middle, when we were traveling around.

484
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,330
It was quite tiring indeed.

485
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,100
I'm here, tada! And then it was over.

486
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,230
But we did a lot today.

487
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,340
We really did a lot.

488
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,380
So it felt like time flew by.

489
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,870
We ate at the restaurant with the nice view.

490
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,110
We went to the local market, tried the egg and went to the supermarket.

491
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,220
You also made dinner for us.

492
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,170
We did a lot of things.

493
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,970
Have you planned anything for tomorrow's schedule?

494
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,330
I'm going to stalk you secretly.

495
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,560
Left, right, left, right.

496
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,090
Where we went today...

497
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,990
I've become very introverted lately,

498
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,260
so it was actually a bit draining for me.

499
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,880
They showed us so much love.

500
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,340
Yeah.

501
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,630
I don't know if I deserve all that.

502
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,860
I suddenly felt like I became a baby.

503
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,650
From a certain perspective,

504
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,500
what I do could affect the image of Koreans.

505
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,820
That's why it was exhausting.

506
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,620
But now that I think about it, it's really memorable.

507
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,680
I told you.

508
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,380
I think that memory will last a long time.

509
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,600
Let's sleep.

510
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,110
Can I turn off the lights now?

511
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,810
Turn off the lights.

512
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,050
But I really cant see anything at all.

513
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,730
We're lucky the weather's good today.

514
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,010
If it rained, it'd be a disaster.

515
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,790
Left, right.

516
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,270
-Okay.
-Okay.

517
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,790
This place is really a well-kept secret.

518
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,700
I really feel like I'm at El Nido now.
