[With My Dear Bro]

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,700
You can jump into the sea.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,920
The sea is so beautiful.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,170
The sea is great.

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,820
I don't know when I'll jump into the sea.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,090
Swimming in the sea every day.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,180
There's a sea.

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,740
If you jump in there, it's the sea.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,100
If i sweat, I can just jump into the sea again.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,330
Just live in the sea.

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,430
Are you fully awake now?

14
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,590
Not quite, but I'll be energized by looking at the sea.

15
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,960
Freedom in its true essence.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,580
Hello, good morning.

17
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,060
I think everyone's so friendly.

18
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,000
Sorry.

19
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,060
Gosh, please.

20
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,930
Sleeping... Dogs are sleeping too.

21
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:41,950
It told us not to mess with it.

22
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,310
It's still early in the morning.

23
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,259
Will you show us how you're the Prince of the Sea today?

24
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,229
I'm practically a seal.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,740
I think it's here.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,539
Bye, bro.

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,010
I think we can take this.

28
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,110
Bye.

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,430
Hurry up and come over.

30
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,360
The view is beautiful.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,590
Gracias.

32
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,650
It's wonderful.

33
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,600
I think we're setting off.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
We're setting off.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,480
We're setting off!

36
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,079
Thankfully, the weather's good.

37
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,590
-If it rained...
-If it rained, we'd be doomed.

38
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,340
[Feeling great]

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
I feel better

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,900
now that we're in the middle.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,400
Do you want me to catch some fish for you?

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,060
Now?

43
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,350
What if I catch a shark?

44
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,470
Baby shark?

45
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,820
What if I catch a whale?

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,320
Then just catch it.

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,280
Didn't you say you'll respond eagerly to everything I say?

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,450
Okay, I'll respond eagerly for today.

49
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,920
-For today, you'll...
-Okay, okay.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,960
I'll respond eagerly to everything, okay?

51
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,290
The air, the waves...

52
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,650
The smell of the sea, the sound of the water,

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,740
and the flow of the air.

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,090
How'd you rate that?

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,270
El Nido,

56
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,780
waves,

57
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,610
and you.

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Okay.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,160
Wait, I think you changed your sunglasses.

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,390
Yes, I did.

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,460
If I really find what you say funny,

62
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,350
I'll do this.

63
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,880
I'll do this and say, "Wow!"

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,620
If it's a fake smile, it's just...

65
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,660
Yes, like this.

66
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,140
This is how I'll express my intent.

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,290
Take it off.

68
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,410
As someone who often travels,

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,610
to not have any regrets,

70
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,050
what should we do on trips?

71
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,450
Traveling is also a challenge.

72
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,390
Since you're in a new environment.

73
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,900
It's actually about stepping out of your comfort zone.

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,080
Even if you're introverted, try to challenge yourself.

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,110
But as an extreme introvert, inside I'm already

76
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,310
hollering and exclaiming...

77
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,770
Inside, you're doing the Tecktonik dance...

78
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,770
"Woohoo!" like this.

79
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,140
But you like to stay still quietly.

80
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,110
Like this.

81
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,290
It's better to do it when you feel the urge.

82
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,450
That way, you won't regret it.

83
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,750
This extent.

84
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,070
-You mean it?
-Yes.

85
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,780
Should I take a picture for you?

86
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,830
But I'm a little scared.

87
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,350
Take it quickly.

88
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,320
Hurry up.

89
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,730
What do you think?

90
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,340
Awesome.

91
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,150
Are you really taking pictures?

92
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,540
Yes, I've been taking them all along.

93
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,990
I think we're going to ride that now.

94
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,760
Let's go.

95
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,710
-Okay.
-Show us your skills.

96
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,750
-Show us your skills!
-Show us your skills!

97
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,920
Marine Corps!

98
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,970
The seal's spirit.

99
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,520
What's the seal's spirit?

100
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,610
Salamat po.

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,890
Let's go?

102
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,460
Let's try it.

103
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,370
Okay.

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,240
Where to?

105
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
Let's turn right.

106
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,980
I turned my head.

107
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,430
Where are you going?

108
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,850
I need to look forward, but...

109
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,500
We should go over there.

110
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,410
Let's go.

111
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,860
Right.

112
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,250
Again, forward.

113
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,970
-Left, right.
-Left, right.

114
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,090
-Left, right.
-Left, right.

115
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,800
-Left, right.
-Left, right.

116
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,920
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

117
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,400
Where?

118
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,390
Fish! Fish! A school of fish.

119
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,650
The colors of the fish are so beautiful.

120
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,300
I love this place right now.

121
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,310
Yeah. To an unknown world.

122
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,270
It feels a little like a treasure hunt.

123
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,590
Let's go!

124
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Left, right.

125
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,690
Left, right.

126
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,570
-Left, right.
-Nice.

127
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,370
-Left, right.
-Nice.

128
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,700
-Left, right.
-Speed up.

129
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,540
Wait.

130
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,950
Wait, I need to see this.

131
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,470
You need to make this sound here.

132
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,300
What sound?

133
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,600
Cuckoo!

134
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,620
There's an echo.

135
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,010
Cuckoo!

136
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,170
Everything echoes here.

137
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,100
Should just one person row?

138
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,240
Okay.

139
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,330
Rock...

140
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,240
Rock, paper, scissors!

141
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,490
You can row it.

142
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,740
Okay. Let's do it again.

143
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,170
-No.
-Really.

144
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,770
-No.
-I'll do it properly this time.

145
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,280
I'll do it properly this time.

146
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,020
Rock, paper, scissors.

147
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,230
It's really a tie.

148
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,620
Rock, paper, scissors.

149
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,270
Let's go.

150
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,420
You're lying.

151
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,050
Let's go.

152
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,970
Are you trying to show everyone how you break promises?

153
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,810
Okay, let's go.

154
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,530
I'm turning around. We're going now.

155
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,150
This is nice.

156
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,900
I'll speed up.

157
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,970
Let's go.

158
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,470
Let's speed up, Dojin.

159
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,390
-Let's go. Let's start from the left.
-Ready...

160
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,059
Left, right.

161
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,919
Right, left.

162
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,890
-Right, right.
-Turn around.

163
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,679
Left, right.

164
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,060
El Nido!

165
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,340
Wait, let's slow down now.

166
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,270
This speed, these waves, El Nido.

167
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,260
It's okay.

168
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,830
It's okay.

169
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,230
It's okay.

170
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,130
It's okay.

171
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,210
You need to steer meticulously.

172
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,440
Be careful, Dojin.

173
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,110
This place is really a well-kept secret.

174
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,530
It's so amazing.

175
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,400
-It feels like...
-I really want to swim.

176
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,780
I can relax without a care in the world.

177
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,300
I really feel like I'm in El Nido now.

178
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,730
El Nido can be described as a paradise

179
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,330
because it's so beautiful.

180
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,300
It's a paradise.

181
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,780
How does it feel to be here?

182
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,940
How does it feel to be here?

183
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,820
It really feels like getting home after a sweaty game

184
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,960
of football,

185
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,070
and my mom has prepared cut watermelon.

186
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,850
That's a great feeling, for sure.

187
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,650
-I want to play soccer.
-So exciting.

188
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,280
Your oar!

189
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,330
Pick up your oar.

190
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,170
Get some rest. I'll row it myself.

191
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,820
Let's go quickly.

192
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,380
Okay, let's go!

193
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,140
Can we cross through

194
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,730
in one go without rowing?

195
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,330
-Without rowing?
-Okay.

196
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,230
Let's do it together.

197
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,240
Hold on. Stop now.

198
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,450
-Adjust the direction.
-Yes.

199
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,380
-To the left.
-It's good now.

200
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,040
It's perfect now.

201
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,780
-Here we go.
-Lie down.

202
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,510
In one go.

203
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,800
It really works!

204
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,370
Wow, we did it!

205
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,800
I knew it'd work.

206
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,850
-A challenge?
-Challenge cleared.

207
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,890
We're here.

208
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,920
Okay.

209
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,020
Help me.

210
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,130
Thank you.

211
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,260
Thank you.

212
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,030
After getting some exercise from rowing,

213
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,490
how should I put it? I feel relieved.

214
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,680
I know.

215
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,370
I think we've arrived.

216
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,410
You said you like water.

217
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,650
I heard you like it even more.

218
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,240
Have you ever learned swimming, Marine?

219
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,170
Not all marines are good at swimming.

220
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,370
That's an assumption.

221
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,550
Dojin.

222
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,360
You startled me.

223
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,500
Let's go swimming.

224
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,250
What?

225
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,990
Okay.

226
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,330
Dojin, back tumbling?

227
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,420
Hey.

228
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,740
This vibe.

229
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,490
What's wrong?

230
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,170
Why are you moving?

231
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,080
Gosh.

232
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,860
Wait.

233
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,040
One, two, three.

234
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,880
Success!

235
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,070
Swimming with Dojin.

236
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,560
El Nido.

237
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,510
Where are we?

238
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,280
El Nido.

239
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,840
Where of El Nido?

240
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,460
Raccoon.

241
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,400
Raccoon?

242
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,650
I'm hungry.

243
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,660
Of course.

244
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,670
Then let's use our travel budget.

245
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,540
Let's have the delicious Dowon pink sauce pasta.

246
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,570
Instant noodles?

247
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,320
No, not that.

248
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,530
Let's find out if there's any good food.

249
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,800
If not, let's have cup noodles.

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,080
Okay.

251
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,350
Let's go.

252
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,190
What are we going to do?

253
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,370
To eat. I'm hungry.

254
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,460
Then let's go eat something delicious.

255
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,660
What's that?

256
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,100
This? My tail.

257
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,240
I have one too.

258
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,940
Let's go.

259
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,480
What was it again?

260
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,440
I'll just go like this.

261
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,550
Can a tricycle come here?

262
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,070
The tricycle? Yes.

263
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,530
But you have to pay 200 pesos.

264
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,470
Let's pay as much as they want.

265
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,300
Give them all of our 700 dollars.

266
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:38,810
Let's go.

267
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,630
Let's go.

268
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,470
Pull.

269
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,470
Why did you get off?

270
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,990
Where are you going?

271
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,960
Let's go.

272
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,450
What should we eat?

273
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,740
Let's look around and get takeout?

274
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,990
Okay, let's get takeout and eat simply.

275
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,420
I want some bread and coffee.

276
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,700
That sounds good too.

277
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,060
Baker... That's a bakery, right?

278
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,740
Yes, El Nido Bakery. Let's go there.

279
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,600
Let's go.

280
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,550
Hello.

281
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,850
Do you want anything here?

282
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,800
There's so many.

283
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,060
So many?

284
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,420
There's so many that I want to eat.

285
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,560
Donuts? These donuts?

286
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,030
Okay, buy this one and this one.

287
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,660
Okay.

288
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,560
This one, and this one.

289
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,150
This one, and this one.

290
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,740
I love bread, so I'm really looking forward to it.

291
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,980
What kind of flour do they use and how will it taste?

292
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,190
One brownie, two baguette.

293
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,900
That's a lot.

294
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,580
-Yes.
-Should we just get these?

295
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,870
Those over there look delicious.

296
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,859
-Buy everything you want.
-One more of that.

297
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,849
And... this one. Just fine.

298
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,050
We bought a lot.

299
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,650
We bought too much. We don't have to finish them.

300
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:17,710
Sorry?

301
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,569
-230 all.
-200...

302
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,089
-230. 
-Oh, 230.

303
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

304
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,890
-Thank you, bye.
-Thank you, bye bye.

305
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,720
-770...
-Bye!

306
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,810
Thank you.

307
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,740
Shall we buy some coffee?

308
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,390
-Coffee? Okay.
-Yeah.

309
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,780
Let's go to KOPI BAKE over there.

310
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,170
Americano.

311
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,950
Yes, I want an Americano.

312
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,820
What about this? You don't want it?

313
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,250
Bread?

314
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,620
And then, what is this?

315
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,590
Okay, um, this one?

316
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,400
You really do love bread.

317
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,690
I love bread.

318
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,210
One banana bread, and then...

319
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,390
two Americano, large.

320
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,870
Okay, 380.

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,730
-3... sorry?
-380.

322
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,770
There are a lot of sandwiches and whatnot too.

323
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,560
-I should've chosen something sweet.
-I know.

324
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,270
-Shall we get one and share?
-Share? Okay.

325
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,890
-Try it yourself.
-Okay.

326
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,730
Do Won's check-out challenge.

327
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,840
It's my first challenge.

328
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,010
What are you going to get?

329
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,440
Frappe, ice blend and medium.

330
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,020
Just face it head-on.

331
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,990
Just face it head-on.

I need... yeah, thank you, okay.

333
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,960
The first thing you say's the most important.

Excuse me...

335
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,740
Excuse me in korean!

I need a Frappe, medium.

00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,070
Caramel.

340
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,520
-Caramel?
-Yeah.

341
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,890

00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,550
Sorry?

343
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,600

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,470

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,190
Let's go.

354
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,390
-Thank you, bye bye.
-Thank you.

355
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,440
Bye.

356
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,170
Wow.

357
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,530
-Does it taste good?
-Yes.

358
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,130
Wow.

359
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,060
It's sweet.

360
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:44,940
Delicious.

361
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,060
We're finally going home.

362
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,210
Let's go. Let's eat first.

363
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,960
Let's eat.

364
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,850
I'm hungry.

365
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,480
Yeah, let's eat. Wait.

366
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,590
Oh, nice.

367
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,360
I'll eat it with juice.

368
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,380
Do you want some juice?

369
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,800
Coffee's enough for me.

370
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,990
You're wearing your shy glasses this time.

371
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,240
No, these are glasses for calculating expenses.

372
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,740
I've to calculate it. I think we spent recklessly today,

373
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,360
so I want to check it out.

374
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,370
There were two things.

375
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,720
There were two.

376
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,050
Yes, this one.

377
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,580
It's good.

378
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,920
Oh, this looks good.

379
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,180
There's something inside.

380
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,330
I think this will be about five stars.

381
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,630
-Wow.
-You can have it all.

382
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,280
This is really good.

383
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,370
You can have it all.

384
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,200
It's really good.

385
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,090
So you can have it.

386
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,770
-I'm holding a knife.
-Am I...

387
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,090
Am I kidnapped by you now?

388
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:21,670
It's really delicious.

389
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,190
Don't tell me there's garlic and whatnot in it?

390
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,560
No, seriously, try it.

391
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,840
It's really good, right?

392
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,550
It's good.

393
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,470
Yes, but I think we spent too much today.

394
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,050
Sorry?

395
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,430
230 all.

396
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,610
380.

397
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,590
160.

398
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,150
Oh yeah.

399
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,500
What should we do tomorrow?

400
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,450
Is there anything you want to do?

401
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,710
Take a rest at home.

402
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,600
What about you?

403
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,510
-Me?
-Yeah.

404
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,870
Give me a thousand-peso bill.

405
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,250
Okay. Here.

406
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,060
Everyone can tell that it's a twenty-peso bill.

407
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,290
But no matter how much I think about it...

408
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,520
Is this the maximum you can give me?

409
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,350
Then use this too.

410
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,710
Instead, I won't spend a penny tomorrow. You can spend my share too.

411
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,900
7... 70?

412
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,510
Well, okay, that's it.

413
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,650
This is for tomorrow...

414
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,410
Wait.

415
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,670
Then do I have to walk to my destination?

416
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh, right. Then this is for within the city.

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,100
-It's for the city.
-And...

418
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,170
Cafés? Okay. Have some coffee.

419
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,070
-A cup of coffee.
-You bought coffee today, so you should know.

420
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,720
A large cup of coffee is 140 pesos.

421
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,370
Really? It's a bit expensive.

422
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,670
Just give me a thousand-peso bill, and I'll...

423
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,580
Goodness.

424
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,650
I'm not here to...

425
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,420
How can I give the fish to a cat?

426
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,600
Why am I a cat? Why am I a cat?

427
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,780
Why am I a cat?

428
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,290
Well, of course, it's important to spend on a trip.

429
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,430
Okay, let's settle with this. 220 pesos.

430
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,180
Fine. If you give me this much, I should accept it gratefully.

431
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,790
Wait, wait.

432
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,230
Don't do that. Look.

433
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,370
You gave me a lot of small bills.

434
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,490
It'll be hard for us to calculate later.

435
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,580
Why don't I go out and buy some snacks or something?

436
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,930
Give me a thousand-peso bill. I'll break the bill.

437
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll think about it. I have to.

438
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,320
-We need some smaller bills.
-As the General Affairs manager...

439
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
-I'll have to think about it.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

440
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,410
I'll draft out the budget. The money stays with me.

441
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,570
-Manager?
-Yeah?

442
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,750
I'll break the bill, and if you

443
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,270
have qualms about me taking... We have too many thousand-peso bills.

444
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,000
In fact, many people don't bring smaller bills when taking the tricycle

445
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,240
and it's an inconvenience.

446
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,960
Wow, it's delicious.

447
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,680
It's good, isn't it? It's good...

448
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:50,770
Fine, then, today... since your feet hurt... You've done good...

449
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,530
But don't spend it all, and tell me what you spend on.

450
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,930
Okay.

451
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,420
It's all stuck here, so I'm...

452
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,030
Gosh, there's a cockroach again! Wow, look at that!

453
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,220
What's that? It went into...

454
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,540
It's too big.

455
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,920
I'll do it.

456
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,030
Yoon-SCO.
[*Yoon Dojin + CESCO Pest Control]

457
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,580
Help me, please.

458
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,830
It'll come out if I stamp here. Are you ready?

459
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,030
Dojin, thank you.

460
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,650
Why?

461
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,850
You don't mind doing the dirty work...

462
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,860
Hey, you stepped on that!

463
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,010
You don't mind doing the dirty work...

464
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,590
Hey, you stepped on that!

465
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,160
I'll help you catch it when it comes out.

466
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,320
It's really big.

467
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,360
Is there a cockroach family here?

468
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,320
But how does it always appear whenever we're in the living room?

469
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,960
You're a bit like the Pied Piper.

470
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,620
No, I think our staff might have released them.

471
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,190
Then I'll really hand it to them.

472
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,630
Where did it go, really?

473
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,180
I didn't see where it came out from.

474
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,110
I'll cheer for you.

475
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,360
-You're not afraid of cockroaches anyway.
-Over there!

476
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,420
Over there!

477
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,270
You're not afraid of cockroaches, right?

478
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,680
I see them often.

479
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,370
Tell me if you can't catch it, and I'll catch it...

480
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,820
-Be a man of your word.
-No, no, no.

481
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,010
Thank you, sir.

482
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,450
Or I'll block the gap with tissues.

483
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,710
Then the cockroaches won't come out.

484
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,390
If we seal it like a barrier,

485
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,260
they won't be able to get out.

486
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,740
-That's it.
-That's it?

487
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,310
Dojin.

488
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,160
But now...

489
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,150
No, Dojin, that's it.

490
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,670
Move aside.

491
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,620
Let me do it. Move aside.

492
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,670
No, in here...

493
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,920
Should we just drench the area with insect repellent?

494
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,680
We might as well just set a fire.

495
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,620
So, are you going to set a fire?

496
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,920
To be safe, I'll keep this with me first.

497
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,050
Don't put it in your pocket. Put it here.

498
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,800
No, just in case.
If it comes out while I'm sleeping, I can spray it right away.

499
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,940
I'm done eating.

500
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,680
I need some sleep.

501
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,570
Your memories in the Philippines with cockroaches.

502
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,620
What a vibe.

503
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,220
Okay, thank you. Bye bye.

504
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,540
Have you done yoga before?

505
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,720
Hello.

506
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,350
Hello.

507
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,720
He... He's master. He's only...

508
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,680
Four.

509
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,590
We'll do one more round.

510
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,770
O-One more?
