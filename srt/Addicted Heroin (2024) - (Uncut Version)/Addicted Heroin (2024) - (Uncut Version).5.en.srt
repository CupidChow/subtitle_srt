1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,560
Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,800
Why the hell did you kidnap me?

3
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,120
Let me go now, you bastards!

4
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,120
Who the hell are you?

5
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,280
You idiot, Hero! Are you out of your mind?

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,480
What the hell are you doing? Let me go right now!

7
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,680
Well, who told you not to want to be with me anymore?

8
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,200
Look at how you're acting! Who would want to stay around you?

9
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,960
Pop, ever since my mom died,

10
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,200
I’ve never cried for anyone, you know that.

11
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,240
Don’t touch me, you bastard.

12
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
Let me go!

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
Don't touch me!

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,480
I said let me go!

15
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,400
I never wanted to be just friends with you.

16
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,360
I wanted to share a bed with you,

17
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,560
do all sorts of things with you,

18
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,360
because I love you.

19
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,200
You made yourself so likable. Were you flirting with me or what?

20
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,880
You know that I really like you too.

21
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,160
I've never done anything wrong to you.

22
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,480
Why do you have to hate me for something I didn’t do?

23
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,400
It's so unfair.

24
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,040
I know, I was wrong to push you away.

25
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
I came to apologize.

26
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,480
I even brought grilled bananas for you, and look at what you're doing!

27
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,000
I don’t believe

28
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,840
you’re saying this just because you want me to let you go, right?

29
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,640
What’s your problem?

30
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,880
Hello, Uncle Hanchai.

31
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,640
Dad, Dad, Hero...

32
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,680
Quiet, or I’ll kiss you!

33
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes

34
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,720
How's it going, son? Did you talk to Poppy yet?

35
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,960
He had been out for a while.

36
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,120
Yeah, we talked.

37
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,160
Poppy is still a child. He was just afraid that it would cause suffering.

38
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,320
But I'm okay, hero.

39
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,760
Yes.

40
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,080
Poppy should care more about the hero's feelings.

41
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,360
Is it crazy to kick a friend out of the house?

42
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Has he apologized to you yet?

43
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,360
If not, I will go and scold him myself.

44
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,040
Don’t worry,

45
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,160
I'd rather talk to him myself.

46
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,120
Alright then. Come home for dinner tonight.

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,480
Ehh. Yes, Dad. Goodbye.

48
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,960
So, can you untie me now?

49
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Hurry up and let me go.

50
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,560
What are you smiling about? Untie me, quick!

51
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,800
Hey Pop, please wait. I'm sorry.

52
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
Pop! please wait. Sorry.

53
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,760
Pop! Listen, you can punish me if you want

54
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
Okay? Then you won’t be mad at me anymore.

55
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,000
My ass! Who punishes like that?

56
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,800
My dad does. Whenever I mess up,

57
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,360
he punishes me. Okay? Just do it.

58
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,680
But I messed up with you, and you messed up with me.

59
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,440
So, we’re even, right?

60
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,120
If we’re even, then I can sleep in your room, right?

61
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,120
No, you can't sleep in my room.

62
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
what?

63
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
You're crossing the line.

64
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,520
I only think of you as a friend.

65
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,960
If you don't want it, I won’t do anything to you.

66
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,320
And why would I want that?

67
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,920
Oh.

68
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,080
You’re afraid you can’t control yourself,

69
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,920
right? Got it now, I see.

70
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,640
Well,

71
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
my dad won’t let me come home unless I bring you back too.

72
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,400
I thought so.

73
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,760
Wait, Pop! Pop!

74
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,880
Here, take the plate.

75
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
Hey, Pop, do you remember why an omelet is yellow?

76
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Because chickens eat...

77
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,320
Hey, that’s disgusting!

78
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,360
By the way, how's Hero's dad and Poppy's mom doing?

79
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
They’re happy, you know?

80
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,480
When they found out Pop and I are close,

81
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,240
they bought me a watch and even got me a house,

82
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,120
without me even asking.

83
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
That's good. Now you have a place to stay,

84
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,440
so you don’t have to wander around my house.

85
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Poppy, don’t talk to your friend like that.

86
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,520
Hero, stay wherever you feel comfortable.

87
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,840
But don't go too far, alright?

88
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes.

89
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,600
Big omelet.

90
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
Thank you, son.

91
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,920
Why didn’t you divide it equally? Didn’t you study fractions?

92
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I studied extra fractions.

93
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,960
You’re the extra one.

94
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,040
Poppy, don’t talk to your friend like that.

95
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Thanks.

96
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,000
You always have to win, don’t you?

97
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,680
So childish, little Poppy.

98
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
Who are you calling little?

99
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,560
Well, we’re practically siblings now, right?

100
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,200
And why do I have to be the little one?

101
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,440
Alright, who’s older between us?

102
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,160
I’m definitely older. I’m bigger.

103
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,440
What? No way. We need to check our birthdates.

104
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Show me your ID card!

105
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:06,880
Fine, here you go. I’m definitely older.

106
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,040
See? I was born first!

107
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
By just two days. That doesn’t count.

108
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
Same month too. Done.

109
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,040
It's over.

110
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,440
Doesn’t count. Days don’t count.

111
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,000
Snatching the omelet, huh?

112
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,320
Eat your own!

113
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,800
Hey!

114
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,560
Get out!

115
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,080
What?

116
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,800
I can’t let you into my bedroom.

117
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,840
Hey, I thought you weren't going to punish me!

118
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,040
Well, your behavior is suspicious. Go.

119
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,240
Is it my behavior or your emotions?

120
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,000
Look at you, all covered up now.

121
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,200
Dripping water can eventually wear down stone.

122
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,880
The stone says we’re just siblings. Out!

123
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,280
Good night, little brother.

124
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Hey!

125
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,920
Big brother. Wait, are you serious?

126
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,200
Pop?

127
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,000
What's up, crocodile?

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Today there's just the two of us. The bed is very wide.

129
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,640
No one to crowd the bed anymore.

130
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,680
Pop

131
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,760
Pop! Look at this.

132
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,880
Do you see it?

133
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,000
How’s my face?

134
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,040
Look!

135
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,200
It’s rough.

136
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,160
This neck massager turns on here.

137
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,440
Umm.

138
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,400
They say it improves blood circulation.

139
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,160
How’s that? Comfortable?

140
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,240
It’s very nice

141
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,920
Okey.

142
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
I love it. But why’d you buy this?

143
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,960
You’ll just end up in debt.

144
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,400
Don’t worry about it.

145
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,440
I like it.

146
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,680
Just accept it, Grandma. He probably got the money from his dad.

147
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,520
His dad is rich.

148
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,760
Hey, I sold my own stuff!

149
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,680
Hero, if that’s the case, Grandma can’t accept it.

150
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,200
But I’ve eaten and slept here so many times. I feel bad.

151
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,360
I’m also thinking about installing an air conditioner.

152
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,280
No, Hero. Use that money for yourself.

153
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,360
Buy something useful, like books or something for school. Not this.

154
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,680
But I already bought it

155
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,880
Uncle. And I got you these shoes too. Try them on.

156
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,040
Give them a try,Very good, this one.

157
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,440
I’m a craftsman. How could I wear these without getting them dirty?

158
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,600
Oh!

159
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
It’s okay, Just wear them and get them dirty.

160
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
What’s going on here?

161
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Oh, Aunt Jeab.

162
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:13,840
An early New Year’s gift. Here, a hair styling set.

163
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,920
A hair styling set? Are you sure?

164
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,160
Just take it. When was the last time you took care of yourself?

165
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,360
I don’t even know why I would. I just sell stuff.

166
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,800
You have to look good while selling, Aunt Jeab.

167
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,880
Here, little Thien. A stationery set.

168
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,040
How is it? Oh...

169
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,240
Big brother Hero is the best in the world!

170
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,920
Thank you!

171
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,160
It's for you.

172
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,360
I know you’re trying to win over the people around me.

173
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,960
These are just early New Year’s gifts.

174
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Here, take this too. You’ll need it.

175
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,000
Now you won’t have to use the school’s computer.

176
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,200
Now you won’t have to use the school’s computer.

177
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,080
Come on...

178
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,360
I can tell you’re going to ask me for something in return.

179
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,040
No way.

180
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,000
Just let me sleep in your room.

181
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:04,320
It’s cold outside. I promise I’ll behave.

182
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,760
Are you sure?

183
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,800
Of course! If I don’t behave,

184
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,760
you can do whatever you want to me.

185
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,320
You said you'd behave yourself, right?

186
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,240
Um.

187
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,880
When you feel aroused, how should you handle it?

188
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,280
Well, uh, 'slide the worm,' I guess.

189
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,640
Oh, really slapped?

190
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,120
Invite a friend to play football.

191
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,560
Wait, really?

192
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,760
Next question: How should you express love in a way that respects Thai traditions?

193
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,920
Hmm... let's see.

194
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,840
Getting it on during the Loy Krathong festival?

195
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,600
Yeah...

196
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,600
Come on, be serious.

197
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,400
Look at the question. You’re telling me to be serious?

198
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
This is ridiculous.

199
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,280
Okay, next one.

200
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,680
Which of these isn’t a factor in Thai law?

201
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,200
Hmm...

202
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,400
a Thai person committing a crime in Thailand but being someone powerful?

203
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah, you don’t need to try hard.

204
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,240
You’re the child of someone important, after all.

205
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,760
What's wrong?

206
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,280
Hmph, well, yeah. You’re the child of someone powerful.

207
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,600
You don’t need to study hard to succeed.

208
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,640
You can just use connections to get into the military.

209
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,720
Hey, I’m not going into the military.

210
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,680
I want to be a startup entrepreneur,

211
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,080
you know.

212
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,480
You can do that too. Your family’s rich,

213
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,360
you have connections, and lots of influence.

214
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,360
And you think if I don’t follow the plan and avoid the military,

215
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
they’ll still support me?

216
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
Then you need to study hard, right?

217
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
So, what do you want to be?

218
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,400
I want to start a business.

219
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh, wow. So, we’ll be competitors, huh?

220
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,160
Yeah, come on, I’ll compete with you. I’ll make sure you fail.

221
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,440
The teacher asks: If a Thai insults another Thai in Japan..

222
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
The teacher asks: If a Thai insults another Thai in Japan..

223
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,720
Ugh, what is this? I answered correctly, right?

224
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,040
Yeah, so why are you messing around?

225
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,800
Oh, come on!

226
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,880
You need to be punished.

227
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,600
Messing around too much, huh?

228
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,520
That’s it for today, class. But I have a special assignment.

229
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,920
I’ll have you pair up and choose a project topic.

230
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,400
After you’ve paired up,submit your names and project topic to me.

231
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,560
We’ll present it next week.

232
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:14,240
That’s all for today. See you next week, ready to present.

233
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,920
Students all together.

234
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,800
Thank you, teacher.

235
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,320
Pop, work on the project with me.

236
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
I’m working with Pop.

237
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,960
But now we have an odd number.

238
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,880
You’ve paired with him so often. Let’s change it up.

239
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,040
You’ve worked with Tiger plenty of times too. Go on, pair up.

240
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,200
Why are you trying to keep Pop for yourself? Not confident, huh?

241
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,680
If you’re so confident, go pair with him.

242
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,120
Then you go with Tiger.

243
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,520
I don’t want to work with him.

244
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,960
Neither do I.

245
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,160
Am I really that bad?

246
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
Why don't you guys want to work with me?

247
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,720
Okay, okay, I’ll work with Tiger.

248
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,520
What about me?

249
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,120
Pair up then. Let’s go, Tiger.

250
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,520
Hero, you can work with me.

251
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,480
Only, I’m free too.

252
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,960
I have an idea. Um, Tiger, do you have any ideas?

253
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,720
Um, Tiger, do you have any ideas?

254
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:04,560
Uh, are you sure? I’m afraid my idea isn’t good.

255
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,400
Oh, come on, how would you know? Just say it.

256
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:21,120
I was thinking of making nose strips that help you breathe easier,

257
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,600
made from local onions.

258
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Wow, that’s a great idea.

259
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,520
You won’t need to hold your inhaler anymore once you stick the strip on.

260
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,720
Yeah, cool, right?

261
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,560
I’ve done some research too.

262
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Whoa.

263
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,440
What are you working on?

264
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,520
I’m making a food-serving robot.

265
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,760
What? Can you really do that?

266
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,120
I made a line-following robot back in middle school, using sensors.

267
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,440
It’s simple.

268
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,640
If you can do that, you don’t need Pop’s help.

269
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
I’m not asking for Pop’s help.

270
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,880
I just want to pair with him because we’re a team.

271
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,240
Stop it.

272
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,520
You’re going to go in there and tell him you’ll pair with Tiger.

273
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,920
Now!

274
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,840
I’ll go in, but I’m pairing with Pop.

275
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,680
What?

276
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Ogh!

277
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,360
Say that again.

278
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,560
Is it good?

279
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,280
Uh, let’s do another shot.

280
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,880
Shot? What kind of shot?

281
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Maybe espresso?

282
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Huh!

283
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,520
No, I mean another angle. Just follow along.

284
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,720
What are you smiling about?

285
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,800
Nothing.

286
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,040
The flowers are pretty.

287
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,880
You’re good with the camera. You handle it really well.

288
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,160
Out of all the projects, why did you choose onion nose strips?

289
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:29,320
Well, I always see you with your inhaler, so I got inspired.

290
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Wait, are you saying I’m your inspiration?

291
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,520
Peppermint Field is my inspiration, actually.

292
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,600
Peppermint Field, huh? That’s good."

293
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,640
Yeah. Have you seen the clip

294
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,800
'Inhale Good, Get Good; Inhale Bad, Get Bad' by Note Udom?

295
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,200
Oh, I guess I’ll have to watch it now.

296
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,880
I might need to hear feedback from a real user like you.

297
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,760
Did you really make these onion strips just for me?

298
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,040
Yeah.

299
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,880
Really?

300
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
Really.

301
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,520
Are you sure?

302
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,840
Yeah.

303
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,400
Do you have feelings for me or something?

304
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,640
Feelings... like wanting to stop hearing you sneeze.

305
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Feelings... like wanting to stop hearing you sneeze.

306
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,080
Come on, let’s go home.

307
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,720
Where?

308
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,480
Home, of course.

309
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,760
This is an herbal plaster that we made at home.

310
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,000
The purpose is for people who sneeze often.

311
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,040
It helps you breathe easier, clears your nose, and is super convenient.

312
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,280
You just stick it on like this.

313
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
I designed these plasters myself.

314
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,680
How do they look? Cute, right?

315
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,520
Very cute! So cute.

316
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,200
What’s this?

317
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,600
Let me introduce this – the flashlight that magnifies men.

318
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,120
Wow, handsome, handsome Hero

319
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,360
What’s that, kid?

320
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
A model of a space car.

321
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,640
Oh,What inspired you to make it?

322
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
You answer the teacher.

323
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,400
Just regular cars, actually.

324
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,880
Wow, Hero so cool!

325
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,080
Excuse me, may I pass through, please?

326
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,920
Your food is on the second row.

327
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
Hey, that's not yours.

328
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,920
Enjoy your meal.

329
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,240
Your food is on the second tray.

330
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,600
Enjoy your meal.

331
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,160
The beautiful teacher's food is on the first tray.

332
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,040
Enjoy your meal, beautiful teacher.

333
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,200
And what’s the name of this robot?

334
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,320
Hero Pop.

335
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,520
What does that mean?

336
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,880
It’s the child of Hero and Pop.

337
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,640
Wow!

338
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,800
Please give them a round of applause!

339
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,280
The highest scores go to Lersin and Rahus team

340
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,240
and the team of Navamont and Yongchayut! cheers

341
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,680
Only is very talented.

342
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,280
Yay, success.

343
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,320
Hey, what about my prize? May I ask for a prize?

344
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,040
Didn’t you say you wanted to be a businessman?

345
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,280
If you use high-tech like this, you’ll go far, man.

346
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,040
That’s for the future. Right now, I want my prize!

347
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,200
Where’s the prize?

348
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,120
Please.

349
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,360
Teacher, can I go to the bathroom?

350
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,960
Bathroom, huh? Teacher, I need to go too.

351
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,680
Wow, it’s so beautiful.

352
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,280
Seriously, Yongchayut,

353
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,560
did Ionely really draw something this amazing?

354
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Let me see, Yongchayut.

355
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,760
Hey, what are you doing?

356
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,640
Damn!

357
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,640
Ah.

358
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
What are you up to?

359
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,440
Nothing.

360
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,600
What are you stuffing in your shirt?

361
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,040
So lame.

362
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,120
And your hair doesn’t even match your face.

363
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,640
busy!

364
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,000
Your watch is so girly. Are you even a guy?

365
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,920
Hey, what are you looking at?

366
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,640
And why are you standing like that? All bent over. One kick and you'd be down.

367
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,120
If you hate it so much, just leave me alone

368
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,800
Come over to my house this Saturday.

369
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,360
You were just insulting me.

370
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,320
No, I won't come to your home.

371
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,280
and what are you doing with me?

372
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,480
So what? You’re coming over,

373
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,800
or I’ll follow you around like a ghost from the movie Shutter.

374
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,480
Whoa, you’re going to ride on my shoulders?

375
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,880
Your choice, kitty cat.

376
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,800
Screw you, mucus king! You think you’re so cool?

377
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,840
Come have lunch at my home

378
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,320
What the heck?

379
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:47,040
Come have lunch at my home.

380
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,720
Damn!

381
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,320
Oh, what are you playing at?

382
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Come have lunch at my home.

383
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,080
You’re not tired, but I’m exhausted.

384
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,160
If you don’t go to my house,

385
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,640
then I’ll go to yours.

386
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
I’m not letting you!

387
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,080
If you’re going back, you have to take me with you.

388
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,920
No way!

389
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,680
Pop! Pop! Pop!

390
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,520
What?

391
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,640
Help me out! Ion’s harassing me!

392
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Harassing you?

393
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah, he’s watched me now.

394
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,480
He's been eyeing me up and down, all over.

395
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,800
And he follows me home.

396
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,000
When I come to school,he’s there waiting at the gate.

397
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,440
I’m losing my mind!

398
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,600
Hold it together.

399
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,320
There he is!

400
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,240
You guys buying some coconut pancakes?

401
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,920
See? He didn’t even do anything.

402
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,040
Maybe it’s because you’re around. You’re like a ghost repellent.

403
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,600
Pop, Pop, Pop!

404
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,280
What now?

405
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,560
Are the coconut pancakes good?

406
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,640
I haven’t eaten them yet.

407
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,560
Come on, let me try one.

408
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,320
Mmm, delicious.

409
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,920
Wait, in your neighborhood, “try” means eat?

410
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,000
Let's go first

411
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,920
Pop, let’s go.

412
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,080
Wait a minute.

413
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,560
I’ll be back soon.

414
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,680
I'll take a pink milk with pearls, but not too many pearls.

415
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,960
I’m already loaded with them.

416
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,240
Hey, do you have a problem with Tiger?

417
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,760
Tiger says you’ve been following him after school, messing with him.

418
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,200
Me? No way. I get annoyed easily.

419
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,840
Even now, with all the girls chasing me,

420
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,960
I don’t even bother talking to them.

421
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,480
So you didn’t mess with him?

422
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,440
Yes.

423
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,040
Are you done talking yet? Let’s go.

424
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,440
Let’s go.

425
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,960
Pop, can you walk me home today?

426
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,200
Please.

427
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,240
When you’re around, Ion doesn’t dare mess with me.

428
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,120
But I asked Only already. He said he didn’t follow Tiger.

429
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,480
We’ve been friends since we were kids.

430
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,800
Are you going to believe him over me?

431
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,480
Alright, I’ll walk you home too, and see if Ion really follows.

432
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,520
Really? Thanks, man.

433
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,800
Hey, what about me?

434
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,600
You can come along with us to take Tiger home.

435
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,080
What if I don’t want to go?

436
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,840
Then go wherever you want.

437
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,000
So I have to go home alone, huh?

438
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,560
Well, what do you want me to do?

439
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,520
Fine, you two go. I’ll go alone.

440
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,720
What’s up with Hero?

441
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,960
Forget about him. He’s just being silly. Let’s go.

442
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Aren’t you going inside?

443
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,000
You’re just going to ditch me?

444
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,120
Hey, aren’t you going inside?

445
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,640
You jerk! Old man!

446
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
Whatever.

447
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,960
Hey, not even gonna ask me to come in?

448
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,760
Poppy, why are you fighting with Hero?

449
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,880
Why is he standing outside in the rain, not going inside?

450
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,520
If he wants to stand there, let him.

451
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,360
You’re being childish, Poppy.

452
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,840
Then you go talk to him, Dad.

453
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,520
I did, but he wouldn’t come in.

454
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,000
Then just leave him alone.

455
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,680
What’s the point of winning like this, huh?

456
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,240
When are you going to apologize?

457
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,680
What the hell? Why are you sitting in the rain wearing a raincoat?

458
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,960
What’s the point of beating me?

459
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Come inside.

460
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,440
You’re not coming, right? Then just sit there.

461
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Hey, I’m just going to the bathroom.

462
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,240
Wait here.

463
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,600
Is Pop in the bathroom?

464
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,680
Yeah.

465
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,360
Where are you going?

466
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,200
I’m going to ask Pop to walk me home.

467
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,720
Are you a man or what?

468
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,960
Why are you such a wimp? So weak.

469
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,160
Of course I’m a man!

470
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,360
If you’re a man,deal with the people who mess with you yourself.

471
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,800
Otherwise, you’ll just keep getting bullied. Or are you too scared?

472
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,880
If you’re scared, call your mom to come pick you up, little kitten.

473
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,800
I’m not scared! Not scared!

474
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,200
Don’t look down on me.

475
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,880
I’ll figure it out myself!

476
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,160
Hey, Tiger, are you coming home with us?

477
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:18,280
No, I’m a man. I can stand on my own.

478
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,200
Humph!

479
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,680
Let's go.

480
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,480
The sign’s too tilted. Adjust it a bit.

481
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,960
Tilt it a little more... Okay, that’s good.

482
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,760
Come on, come down here.

483
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,520
It’s kinda cute, you know? Watching old people flirt.

484
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,880
You’re so nosy.

485
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,880
Are you jealous?

486
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,000
Not really.Honestly,

487
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,560
I’d rather she marries Aunt Jeab than goes back to my mom.

488
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,680
Aunt Jeab? Her kid is here, right? Where’s her husband?

489
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:36,240
It’s complicated. Aunt Jeab’s husband cheated on her,

490
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,640
so she cut ties with him and decided to raise Tien by herself.

491
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:52,800
But he’s still around, bothering her whenever he’s broke.

492
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,560
Even when there’s no one else, he’s still messing around?

493
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,960
It’s in his nature.

494
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,000
So if Aunt Jeab gets married again,

495
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,600
wouldn’t that end things more clearly?

496
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,880
I guess so. But my dad’s indifferent,

497
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,840
so his marriage fell apart, and now he’s just taking a break.

498
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,280
Your dad doesn’t seem like he’s failed at anything.

499
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,400
I think he cares about your feelings.

500
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,200
Kankuai elephant, I wish Mom could see this.

501
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,880
Her shop closes late, Tien. Watch it with Pop first

502
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,040
okay.

503
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:17,560
Look at this... Yeah, that’s the one.

504
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,600
Tien, are you cold?

505
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,520
Let me be your blanket.

506
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,560
It’s chilly, right?

507
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,760
It’s chilly

508
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,840
Let’s warm you up.

509
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,200
Smooth move.

510
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,960
Just a little bit.

511
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,440
Hey, who’s upstairs?

512
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,000
Aunt Jeab’s back?

513
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,640
It shouldn't be.

514
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,040
Didn’t you say only kids are left in this house, and the rest are out selling stuff? Who’s that?

515
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,160
I have no idea.

516
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,840
Then let’s go.

517
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,840
Hey, a thief? Get back here!

518
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,880
Daddy!

519
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,960
Hey, Tien!

520
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,840
Decha, you’re even taking your kid’s piggy bank? Really?

521
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,280
Decha! What the hell are you doing?

522
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,800
Calm down.

523
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,440
Decha! What the hell are you doing?

524
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,200
Your kid lives in this house,

525
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,240
and you bring thieves here? Why are you like this?

526
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,080
Calm down.

527
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,720
I’m not going to hurt my kid.

528
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,040
I just came to get some money.

529
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,960
It’s your fault for not giving me any.

530
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,800
And why should I give you anything?

531
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,560
Our relationship ended when you ran off with another woman.

532
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,120
I’m still their father.

533
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,240
You still call yourself a father? You’re pathetic.

534
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,200
If anything happens to my kid, I’ll kill you.

535
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,360
You won’t dare. Do you want your kid to be fatherless?

536
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,680
Or have a dad in jail?

537
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,800
I’ll teach my kid that people end up in jail because of what they do.

538
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,320
How will I teach my kid if I let you go today?

539
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,040
Arrest him, officer.

540
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,720
Get up.

541
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,560
Aunt Jeab, let me be honest.

542
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,640
Thieves target houses without men to protect them.

543
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,440
How will small women and children survive?

544
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,400
Anyway, I have to go now. I’ll take the criminal to the station.

545
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,560
Goodbye.

546
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,400
Hurry up!

547
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,560
Oh, wow!

548
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,920
Again?

549
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,280
Tien, let's go shower.

550
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,000
Tell Uncle Han, “Can I use the bathroom first?”

551
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,000
Can I use the bathroom first?

552
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,960
Sure, you’re going to shower, right? Go ahead.

553
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,040
Thanks.

554
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,280
Thank you.

555
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,840
Wow, such a polite bow.

556
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,720
okay?

557
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,120
You go with your mom

558
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,600
Dad

559
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,840
What’s up, Pop? Something on your mind?

560
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:58,680
Dad, Aunt Jeab and Tien need someone to take care of them.

561
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,880
I think you should marry Aunt Jeab.

562
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,400
Pop,

563
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,360
what’s gotten into you? Did someone say something to you?

564
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,880
No

565
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,200
I’ve thought about it.

566
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,640
It’s better if Aunt Jeab moves in with us.

567
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,920
I mean, if Hero’s not around.

568
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,440
Why are you talking like this, Pop?

569
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,840
I’m not trying to get rid of him, Dad.

570
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,040
I mean,

571
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:49,760
we’re all going to move out soon anyway. We’ll rent a dorm near school.

572
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,920
We’re growing up, Dad.

573
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,000
Sometimes, we need space to be teenagers.

574
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,840
I want to grow up too.

575
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,800
You won’t need to do everything for me anymore.

576
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:19,840
Aren’t you going to feel like you’re losing your dad?

577
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,480
I mean, when your mom got remarried, you were mad at Hero.

578
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,640
But I’ve grown up now.

579
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,520
Mom has her own life now, Dad.

580
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,200
You deserve to be happy too.

581
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,120
I’m happy if you’re happy, Pop.

582
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,120
And I’m happy if you’re happy, Dad.

583
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,040
So, whatever you’re going to do, just do it.

584
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,480
I’m starting to lose my hair, you know.

585
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,000
You know, Pop,

586
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,960
I love you so much. More than anything.

587
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,800
Jeab

588
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,640
Can I call you Grandma now?

589
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,000
Or should I call you Mom?

590
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,640
Mom, it is!

591
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,280
(Kids cheering)

592
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,280
Kiss! Kiss!

593
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,360
(Clapping)

594
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,640
Let’s celebrate!

595
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,640
Oh, wow...

596
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,920
Cheers!

597
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,600
Pop...

598
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,880
You’re here.

599
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,160
You okay?

600
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,920
Yeah, I’m fine.

601
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,720
Are you really okay?

602
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,120
I’m fine.

603
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,800
He’s still your dad, you know.

604
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,520
Don’t overthink it.

605
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,200
It’s all good.

606
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,120
Now no one will ruin my clothes with bad laundry.

607
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,640
No one will put athlete’s foot cream on my pimples.

608
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,680
No one will cook food that tastes like dog food.

609
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,040
and...

610
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,280
Wow, all good things, huh?

611
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,600
I thought Dad would always love just me.

612
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,720
Hey, Pop,

613
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,160
if you want terrible-tasting food, just tell me.

614
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,760
I’ll make it for you.

615
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:20,800
Other than your dad, I’m the best you’ve got in this world.

616
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,000
I thought Dad would always be mine alone.

617
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,600
From now on,

618
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,280
I’ll be your whole world.

619
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,200
And the love I have for you?

620
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,520
It’ll never be shared with anyone else.

621
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,200
What are you standing there for?

622
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,200
Twisting and turning like that.

623
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,040
I could knock you down with one kick.

624
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,160
If you don’t like me, then stay out of it.

625
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,120
This is Pailin, Pop's ex-girlfriend.

626
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,640
You’ve kept her stuff so well.

627
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,480
Still attached, huh?

628
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,320
I can give in to you on everything,

629
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,760
but one thing I can’t accept is you having someone new.

630
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,240
Pailin.

631
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,560
How did she come back?

632
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,680
I came back to bring Pop good luck for his exams.
