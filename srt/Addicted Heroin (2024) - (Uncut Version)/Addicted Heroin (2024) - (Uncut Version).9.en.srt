1
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,560
Rahus! Fighting!

2
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,120
Teacher, could you please be quiet? You're distracting me.

3
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
What's going on?

4
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,200
On your marks, get set...

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,840
Hey!

6
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,880
How are we going to walk without hugging me?

7
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,440
(Whistle blows)

8
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,200
Come here.

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,160
Faster! Come on, faster!

10
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,920
Do you want to walk like this? That’s not gonna work!

11
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,840
Cheer! Cheer!

12
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
What's the chocolate?

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,080
Chocolate, what?
Red's already gone far away. Blue’s still moving too.

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
Oh, are you jealous? Just admit it.
Red's already gone far away. Blue’s still moving too.

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, are you jealous? Just admit it.
Stop! Stop! Orange! Why are you walking like an old person again?

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,280
Yeah, well, whatever I feel is my problem!
Stop! Stop! Orange! Why are you walking like an old person again?

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,120
Use the third leg to run!

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,920
Well, athletes need dark chocolate, right?

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Just a little extra motivation.

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,400
You're the only one in the team! aren't you?

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,440
Why are you yelling at the teacher?

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,000
She’s pregnant!

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Huh? Pregnant with who?

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,840
Ow!

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,560
Hey... ow!

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,080
ow!

27
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,760
I asked, who’s she pregnant with?

28
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,040
With her husband, duh.

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,920
But soon, you'll be pregnant with me. Get up!

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,080
Come on, get up.

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,160
Up! Up!

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,400
Fast! Fast! Fast! Fast!

33
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,200
Hero Pop Hero Pop Hero Pop.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,640
Focus on winning first.

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,480
Hug me!

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,880
Go Orange!

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:03:02,880
(Crowd cheers)

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:12,040
Hero Pop Hero Pop Hero Pop.

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:21,080
(Crowd cheers)

40
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,440
Woohoo!

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,480
Yay!

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,760
Hey, aren’t you happy?

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,080
You’re not even smiling!

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,920
I got us first place!

45
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
You’re still upset?

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
Please, teacher has her own husband already.

47
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,640
But me? I’m all yours.

48
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Smile for me!

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,280
There you go, cute!

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,600
I'll buy you a gift when I go to America.

51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
What do you want?

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,920
Who’s going to America?

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,360
I promised Seal, my brother, I’d go to America.

54
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,200
Ouch, hey!

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,000
Careful!

56
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,920
What's wrong?

57
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
You're not well thinking,

58
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,920
there's an outbreak abroad and exams are coming up!

59
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,720
But my brother’s in trouble!

60
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,080
Come on, don’t be mad.

61
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,680
I’ll call you every day, okay?

62
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,200
But you must no flirting with anyone, okay?

63
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,920
Cause you're mine, got it?

64
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,600
Who would I flirt with?

65
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,680
So cute. Guess I’ll give you a reward.

66
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
Get out!

67
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,400
Hey, what's wrong?

68
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,480
Why are you blushing? Embarrassed in front of people?

69
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,240
These information here,

70
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,880
try to check it!

71
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,560
Hmm.

72
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,320
So, your job is about fixing the bank account statement?

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Just like in mafia series, right?

74
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,880
Is this some shady business?

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,760
That’s why I don’t trust anyone except you.

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,120
Bro, I don’t know how to do this. I’m still in high school.

77
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,280
I’m not asking you to fix the bank account statement,

78
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,200
Even a high schooler can handle that.

79
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,240
Getting a high school kid to do this?

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,640
Aren’t you afraid the company will go under?

81
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,680
By the time anyone knows, I’ll be back in Thailand.

82
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,320
And your university?

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,960
Just need to submit the project.

84
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,280
Does Dad know about this?

85
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,440
If I can't handle it, I'll tell him know.

86
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,800
We might have to use our family to get me out of jail.

87
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,560
Why are you risking this when our family is already rich?

88
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
If I don’t do it, there will be some trouble.

89
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,720
But let’s keep that to ourselves for now.

90
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Man, this is such a mess. I'm out of here.

91
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,960
Wait, I’ve got money for you.

92
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,320
If you want to study something other than the military.

93
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,080
I think your dad shouldn't support that.

94
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,640
How much are we talking?

95
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,920
Six figures.

96
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,960
Six figures?!

97
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,280
Just manage some sort of the documents.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
Just match the numbers?

99
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,960
Yeah, just match the numbers and check the headings.

100
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,320
Well, easy on me.

101
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,880
Oh, I haven’t called Pop yet.

102
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,280
(Open a phone)

103
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,480
Do you have Wi-Fi here?

104
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,160
Give me your phone.

105
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,520
Hey, what are you doing?

106
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,640
Right now, I don’t want you to contact anyone.

107
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,760
I can't risk letting this matter out.

108
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,840
Are you crazy?

109
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,160
I’m just talking to my friends!

110
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Friends or me, who’s more important?

111
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
(Sighs)

112
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,440
Do you want the real answer or just to flatter you?

113
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,240
If you want to leave early, finish it up quickly.

114
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,640
(Sighs)

115
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,760
(Sighs)

116
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,840
Hey, hit it! Oh!

117
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,680
Hit it! Oh, yes!

118
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,080
Oh no.

119
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,720
We lost to Korea again.

120
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,200
Annoying.

121
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,960
Oh.

122
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,680
Guys,

123
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,960
I brought this from home.

124
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,040
My dad made this liquor himself.

125
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,880
Answer me,

126
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,560
old geezer,

127
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,280
banana seller!

128
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,400
Ignoring my texts?

129
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,760
(Upset)

130
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,360
(Text message sound)

131
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,720
Hey.

132
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,440
Get up!

133
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,520
My mom just texted me, saying Dad’s liquor is missing.

134
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,280
Take a picture of me and send it to your parents,

135
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,880
tell them the liquor is with me.

136
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,000
I’m leaving.

137
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,440
Hey, wait,

138
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,880
you forgot your bag.

139
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,400
Ugh.

140
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,160
Pop, are you going back home?

141
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,560
Pop, are you staying here tonight?

142
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,240
What's this warm thing?

143
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,560
Oh, no. All over me.

144
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,120
(Chopping sounds)

145
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,120
Are you really my brother?

146
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,640
When did you learn to cook?

147
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,760
Been practice cooking for a year.

148
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,320
It’s gonna be delicious.

149
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,000
I worked hard on this.

150
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,760
Try it.

151
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,120
How is it?

152
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,720
Good, right?

153
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,240
If you like it, finish it all!

154
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,360
When I get back to Thailand, I will cook Thai food for you.

155
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,280
And you won’t join with this dish?

156
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,480
Well, I tasted it while cooking, so I’m full already.

157
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,800
Go ahead, eat up.

158
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,960
(Phone ringing)

159
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Hello.

160
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,720
Hey.

161
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,880
Are you hitting on me?

162
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
What? Why are you calling?

163
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,600
Come on, don’t be mad.

164
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,680
My brother’s scared

165
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,560
the FBI, CIA, MI6, and KFC are tapping our phones,

166
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,440
so I couldn’t call you.

167
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,480
Are you crazy?

168
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
Who would believe that?

169
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,240
Where are you?

170
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,640
In my room, duh.

171
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,640
Alone, huh?

172
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,000
Secretly jacking off?

173
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,040
Hey, I’m not like you.

174
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,720
Mmm.

175
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,640
Ahhh.

176
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,920
What’s wrong with you?

177
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,760
Ahhh.

178
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,280
You're crazy! People can hear you!

179
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,000
Who’s around?

180
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,320
It’s still morning, are you insane?

181
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,120
So, if I call you at night, you’ll moan for me?

182
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,400
No.

183
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,720
Ah, where are you?

184
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,800
You really shouldn’t have gone shopping, I warned you.

185
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,680
The police will catch you.

186
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,560
What for?

187
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,080
For Poppy.

188
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,880
This is Poppy’s.

189
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,960
This one too,

190
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,320
for Poppy.

191
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:22,520
Your gift better be as good as the one with the little elephant in the sock!

192
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,480
Hey, how do you know about that?

193
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,720
Did you plant cameras?

194
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,880
Where?

195
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
Did you put cameras in here?

196
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,440
Did you put cameras in here?

197
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,200
I know you too well,

198
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
so I planted spyware on your phone.

199
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,760
You creep! Are you a criminal?

200
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,040
Hand it over!

201
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,520
Which button can delete?

202
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,600
You can’t delete everything. I’ve backed it all up.

203
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,560
What would uncle  Worathee say about this?

204
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,680
(Hangs up)

205
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,920
Your boyfriend is pretty hot.

206
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,120
Mind your business.

207
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,320
Let’s go inside my home.

208
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,600
Hi, my son!

209
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,920
Come here and give mommy a hug.

210
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Wow, it’s been so long!

211
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,240
I missed you, son.

212
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,560
Pop, this is my mom.

213
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,920
Come on!

214
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,920
Oops.

215
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,440
Pop, I will kiss you too.

216
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,160
(Kisses)

217
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,200
Let’s go inside, son.

218
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,760
Kids, the red melons are served!

219
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,400
No thanks, my stomach can’t handle any more.

220
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,320
If I eat somemore, it'll come out of my ears!

221
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,080
Alright,

222
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,760
but I’ll leave it here in case you're hungry.

223
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,240
I won’t disturb you anymore.

224
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,040
Take your time, relax.

225
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,520
You must be lonely without Hero here.

226
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,360
Nah, I’m not lonely.

227
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,560
Your eyes say otherwise.

228
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,440
What?

229
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
Come on, I’ll help you.

230
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,680
My mom taught me how to massage.

231
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,320
What?

232
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,520
Turn around.

233
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm fine now.

234
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,600
I'm ok, Hero.

235
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,880
Wait, what did you just call me?

236
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,840
Sorry, I called you the wrong name.

237
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
You miss him, don’t you?

238
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
No.

239
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,400
When did you learn to play the guitar?

240
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,880
I watched “SuckSeed” and thought it looked cool,

241
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,560
so I started playing a guitar.

242
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,240
Do you want to sing? I’ll play guitar for you.

243
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,760
What song?

244
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,840
Pick a song whatever reflects how you feel right now.

245
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:19,640
(Singing)

246
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,320
This song wasn’t for me.

247
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:06,920
But remember, as the movie “Love of Siam” said "When there is love, there is always hope.

248
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,600
Hey, are those two dating?

249
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,840
Whoa, my heart almost stopped!

250
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,240
I thought Only was just shipping with Tiger.

251
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,400
You remember, diving on school sport day?

252
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Only ran and hugged Tiger right away.

253
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,120
By the way, how long have Tiger and Pop been friends?

254
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,280
Love triangle.

255
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,520
it's like SuckSeed movie.

256
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,880
What’s that, Sai? Who are you gossiping about?

257
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,720
I’m not gossiping, just sharing stories.

258
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,080
Really?

259
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,000
Are you okay?

260
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,160
Yeah, why wouldn’t I be okay?

261
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,960
Look over there.

262
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,160
So sweet and cute.

263
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,600
You feeling it?

264
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,600
I don’t see the big deal.

265
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,640
Shouldn't we focus on our admission exams instead?

266
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,560
Oh, come on!

267
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,680
I’m trying to get into faculty of Mass Comm, remember?

268
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,600
Instead of taking me home, you brought me to Ratchaburi?

269
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,200
What? It's my car. You can drive back yourself.

270
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,360
Hmm…

271
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,480
Wait, why are you following me?

272
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,480
Well, I’ve been studying for exams, and I tend to fall asleep.

273
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,480
It’d be nice to have someone study with me.

274
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,600
Uh-huh.

275
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,240
Wait a sec,

276
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,400
this isn’t the way to your home.

277
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,640
Did you move?

278
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,080
Yeah, I’m staying with a friend now.

279
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,280
Which friend?

280
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,400
Hey, Pop.

281
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,760
Pop.

282
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,040
Pop.

283
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Pop.

284
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,640
Hmm? Where the hell have you been?

285
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,840
You didn't reply to my messages or answer my calls.

286
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,400
Oh, I'm sorry!

287
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,720
I got you something special.

288
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,000
Come on, let’s go check it out.

289
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,480
I missed you.

290
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,200
You’re gonna love it, I swear.

291
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,240
I’ll give it to you.

292
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,480
What the hell’s been up with you?

293
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,440
I couldn’t get in touch with you for days.

294
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,840
My brother wouldn’t let me talk to anyone.

295
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,960
My brother is acting crazy or something. I'm frustrated too.

296
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,680
I couldn’t sleep, you know that?

297
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,680
And my shirt,

298
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,360
Hero! I was looking everywhere for it!

299
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
I’m worried that I won’t be able to sleep, too.

300
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,040
So I took your shirt,

301
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:09,160
hugged it, smelled it, pretending you were with me.

302
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,600
Do you know what?

303
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,720
Your shirt didn’t work. Cause your shirt isn’t the real you.

304
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,800
I’m not going anywhere again

305
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,040
Or if I do,

306
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,480
you’re coming with me.

307
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,240
Ahem!

308
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,040
Are you back to being my stalker now?

309
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,440
What's wrong? You've been sulking all day.

310
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,320
I’m heartbroken.

311
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,600
When did you fall in love?

312
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,880
Last week.

313
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,040
With who?

314
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,000
Pop.

315
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Then just date me.

316
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,040
Huh?

317
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,080
You ditched me for some fling, got your heart broken,

318
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,560
now you can come back to date me.

319
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,840
Hey, don’t worry.

320
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:07,640
I won’t hold a grudge. I get it. Guys cheat on their partners all the time.

321
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,080
I’m serious.

322
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,280
So am I.

323
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,520
I really like Pop.

324
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,400
I really like you.

325
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,080
Are you for real?

326
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,240
Of course.

327
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,680
Friend Zone’s about to end.

328
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,320
But… heartbroken because…?

329
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,080
Pop and Hero… there’s something going on.

330
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,120
They just moved in together.

331
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,480
But Pop and Hero are brothers.

332
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,440
Hero’s dad married Pop’s mom.

333
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,960
In 32 December movie, the main actor and actress were siblings too, you know?

334
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,120
Pop had a girlfriend, and so did Hero.

335
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,560
In Brokeback Mountain movie, both of them had wives.

336
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,240
Alright, guess we need a test of love then.

337
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:32,000
A test? How?

338
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,640
Beware your drive!

339
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,520
Hey, brake!

340
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,720
Did going to America mess up your biking skills or what?

341
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,440
Pop,

342
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,600
here’s your jacket.

343
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,640
Huh? How did it end up with you?

344
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,960
Remember that night?

345
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,080
You got drunk and stayed at my home.

346
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,920
You forgot ito bring your jacket back in morning.

347
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,400
Oh, right. Thanks.

348
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,360
I even washed it and sprayed some cologne on it for you.

349
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,760
Oh, my mom was asking about you.

350
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,000
If you wanna change study spots, you can come study at my place.

351
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,120
It’s cold there, perfect for someone like you.

352
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,720
You won’t have to take off your jacket to sleep.

353
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Hey, why’d you say that?

354
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
Let’s head to class.

355
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,160
Why aren’t they jealous?

356
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,240
Maybe they’re not really dating.

357
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,800
(Achoo!)

358
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,080
Sword-fighting class.

359
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,840
Twelve postures.

360
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,520
Step close, lift, thrust. Step close, lift.

361
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,720
Beautiful but fierce.

362
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,800
How’s your heart test going?

363
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,840
Hero’s been quiet.

364
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,520
That means they’re not together.

365
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,200
Really?

366
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,840
Alright, we’re about to have our exams.

367
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,360
I need two volunteers to refresh your memory before the test.

368
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,800
First one, who’s up?

369
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,880
Only! Only! Only!

370
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,280
Okey, Yongchaiyut.

371
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,400
Yongchaiyut, get up!

372
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,760
(Crowd cheering)

373
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,000
(Clapping)

374
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,480
For the second volunteer, any takers?

375
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,080
Rahus! Come here!

376
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,600
Hero! Hero! Hero!

377
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,400
Get ready.

378
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,280
Drop your weapons.

379
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,960
Ready.

380
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,760
Begin!

381
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,920
(Clapping)

382
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:03,360
Hero!

383
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,960
Hey,

384
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,680
Where do you guys study together?

385
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,480
Huh?

386
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,960
You've slept together before, right?

387
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,400
(Crowd cheering)

388
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,280
Where?

389
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,960
Hey, hey!

390
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,280
Be strong, guys.

391
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,080
You've slept naked together before, right?

392
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,360
Help me, teacher, please help me!

393
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
Aargh!

394
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,960
So are you gonna talk or not?

395
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,280
What do you want to hear?

396
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,160
I want the truth. Just tell me.

397
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,320
The truth is, there’s nothing to tell.

398
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,040
Nothing?

399
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,000
I watched the tape again.

400
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,320
It’s not our room. It’s that smug Only's room, isn’t it?

401
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,920
Look.

402
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,800
Hey, wait! Why were you recording me?

403
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,120
I wasn’t.

404
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,280
So what’s going on? Why didn’t you tell me?

405
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,000
Because there’s nothing going on! What do you want me to say?

406
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,240
How many nights were you together?

407
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,280
Can you stop being dramatic?

408
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,840
Dramatic?

409
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,080
I’ve been in the States, totally in the dark. How about a little empathy?

410
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,800
And what about you?

411
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,520
You never answered my texts or calls.

412
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,640
How am I supposed to know you’re not off doing something with someone else?

413
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Hey, that’s my brother!

414
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,320
I’m your brother too.

415
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,240
Are you insulting me?

416
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,160
You disrespected me first.

417
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,160
Me caring about you is such a problem?

418
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,960
It means you don’t trust me.

419
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,960
Well, maybe we need to clear things up.

420
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,280
Do you think this approach will work?

421
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,560
If opening up doesn’t work, we’ll have to try something else.

422
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,920
(Kiss)

423
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,280
(Camera clicks)

424
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,800
Your brother!

425
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,800
Hey, what the hell!

426
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,480
Don’t mind me. Act like I’m not here.

427
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,440
What the hell are you doing here? Get out.

428
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,800
Oh, come on.

429
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,800
I saw all your videos.

430
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,240
Wait a minute!

431
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,120
Why’d you record it and show your brother?

432
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,000
Are you crazy? You psychopath.

433
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,200
Hey, No! He broke SIM card,

434
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,520
so I had to use his phone.

435
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
Turns out he secretly installed spyware.

436
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,360
Can I really trust you?

437
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,320
You’re just the same.

438
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,120
How many times have you doubted me?

439
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,080
Do whatever you want.

440
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,320
I’m not coming back tonight.

441
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,760
Is this stir-fry Thai basil or some suffering menu?

442
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,000
I just want to eat.

443
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,440
Just eat it. Stop complaining.

444
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
Why are you here?

445
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,200
Maybe I wanted to taste your cooking.

446
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,680
Ever since I had it, I can't eat anything else.

447
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,840
Seriously though, what's wrong?

448
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,440
I came to give you the money from work.

449
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,880
Why didn't you just transfer it?

450
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,160
Why come all the way here? It's weird.

451
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,720
You used to cry every time I left.

452
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,040
But now, when I visit, there has to be a reason for everything?

453
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,680
To be honest,

454
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,320
it's all your fault.

455
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,160
What do you mean?

456
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,720
You dragged me to America,

457
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,440
took away my phone,

458
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,280
banned me from using the internet,

459
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,640
recorded me, blackmailed me,

460
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,760
and barged into my room when I was at my lowest.

461
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,800
So, you're blaming me?

462
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,040
Damn right I am.

463
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,920
And what now?

464
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,520
I'm just frustrated.

465
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,280
(message notification sound)

466
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,600
Hey, can I borrow your car keys?

467
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,360
Where are you going?

468
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,760
Just give them to me, quick.

469
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,800
Alright, I'm leaving. I miss him already. Oh, and wash the dishes for me.

470
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:44,880
(phone rings)

471
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,480
Hello, uncle Vor.

472
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,560
Is that Seal? Why are you answering his phone?

473
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,920
He left it with me by accident.

474
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,880
Why’s he heading to America right now?

475
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,360
I haven’t prepared any documents for this.

476
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,680
Maybe he's skipping school for a trip?

477
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,400
He’ll be attending the military academy soon.

478
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,920
You really think he's that kind of person?

479
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:20,480
Skipping town before boot camp or looking for a way out to the U.S.?

480
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,680
I'd bet on the latter.

481
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,920
Why would you think that?

482
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,680
You’re closest to him. He didn’t say anything to you?

483
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,880
No, ever since he got a new big brother,

484
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,960
he stopped sharing secrets with me.

485
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,040
Where is he now?

486
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,280
He just stepped out.

487
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,840
Probably heading to the new house where his new big brother is waiting.

488
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,920
Sang, get the car ready.

489
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,560
I taught you how to drive, but you drive off to see him and leave me behind?

490
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,760
Why don't you go wait inside?

491
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,400
The mosquitoes will bite. Who are you waiting for?

492
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,040
Just like the text said.

493
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,880
Text?

494
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,680
Damn!

495
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,200
I left my phone at my brother’s house.

496
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,920
Then just tell me now.

497
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,800
I said I was hungry.

498
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,320
Is that the message? Just three words?

499
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,280
Or do you want me to say something else?

500
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,960
I can give you anything.

501
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,120
You…

502
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,800
Let’s just go eat. I’ll cook for you. Come on.

503
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,400
How could you leave me like that?

504
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,640
Pop

505
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,840
From now on, no matter how much we fight, I’ll never push you away.

506
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,000
And I’ll never let you be alone again.

507
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,600
Understand?

508
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,480
Ok?

509
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,720
Do you know that when you disappear,

510
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,920
I can’t reach you? You just vanish.

511
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,520
I never know if you’re okay or not.

512
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:18,600
Pop, I'm sorry. It’s just... I get jealous of you.

513
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,680
And when I'm jealous, I act like an idiot.

514
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,880
But I won’t ask about it, okay? I trust you. Is that alright?

515
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,440
How am I supposed to believe you?

516
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,880
Uncle…

517
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,040
Whoa.

518
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,120
Touch him if you dare.

519
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,400
What did you say!

520
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,520
(kicks)

521
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,120
Hero!

522
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,680
Beat me all you want, I don’t care.

523
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,200
But if you hurt Pop, I’ll never see you as my father.

524
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,320
You think I care if you call me father?

525
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,880
I don’t have a son like you.

526
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,800
It's too late to put on a condom.

527
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,120
You little—

528
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,680
Don’t hurt him.

529
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,000
Calm down, they’re still young.

530
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,600
(kicks)

531
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,320
P’San!

532
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,440
Don’t worry about me.

533
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,760
You're just a crazy power-hungry guy.

534
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,400
Do you think you're cool?

535
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,160
Hero.

536
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,600
Do you want to know what a power-hungry guy is like?

537
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,120
Pop.

538
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,840
Does it hurt?

539
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,520
I told you not to hurt him! Hey!

540
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,440
Are you challenging me?

541
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,160
You little—

542
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,680
Hero.

543
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,400
Please don't be too violent, uncle. We're family.

544
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,200
Family?

545
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,440
(kicks)

546
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,720
You guys are siblings.

547
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,560
We're just playing around. It's nothing serious.

548
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,240
Are you crazy, Pop? Don't undermine our love.

549
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,160
Hero!

550
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,480
Stop lying.

551
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,760
You two have girlfriends, right?

552
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,720
And how did that happen?

553
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,960
Pop.

554
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,240
Well, we love each other.

555
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,760
We love each other so much that we don't care about gender,

556
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,080
and we're not ashamed either.

557
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,440
So what do you want?

558
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:03,480
You little—

559
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,920
(kicks)

560
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,920
Don't get cocky

561
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,160
Hero.

562
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:18,720
I'll give you a chance to say it again. Say that what happened is not love.

563
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,240
Hero. Stop being stubborn. I was just teasing you.

564
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,720
You're misunderstanding. Don't go and die stupidly like this.

565
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,520
Hero,  just shut up.

566
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,240
I'm not shutting up! We love each other, so what are you gonna do about it?

567
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,800
Hero.
