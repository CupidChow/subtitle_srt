1
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,560
Here,

2
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,680
try this.

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,840
You really want me to eat this?

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,760
Yeah, I put a lot of effort into making it.

5
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,720
How is it?

6
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Tastes terrible, just like my dad’s cooking.

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,720
But hey.

8
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,240
It’s a good sign, right? First attempt.

9
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,360
Eat it... Didn’t you say you made it with effort?

10
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
Yeah, I did.
Effort...

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
(Laughs)

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,840
From now on, I’ll improve my cooking skills.

13
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,280
Hey.

14
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,480
Holding hands.

15
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,760
(Laughs)

16
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,720
Cute, huh?

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,440
Pop

18
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,480
When am I going to be your boyfriend?

19
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Love in school can ruin you, like a drug addiction.

20
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,800
Well, I guess I’m addicted to you and there’s no cure.

21
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,680
You might be half-human, half-elephant,

22
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,800
but you’re a giant.

23
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,280
If you can fall in love with a ghost,

24
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,720
vampire, werewolf, or even AI,

25
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
then what’s wrong with two humans,

26
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,440
even if they’re the same gender?

27
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,760
Can we frame it like this?

28
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,200
The bottom part needs more shading.

29
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,160
Here?

30
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,640
Got it, thanks, friend.

31
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,080
Hey, Tiger.

32
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,120
Let’s go eat.

33
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,120
No, if you wanna go, go by yourself.

34
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,160
Why?

35
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,880
I just don’t feel like going.

36
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Do you always have to invite me because you think you can?

37
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,080
Are you standing up to me now?

38
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,640
I’ve grown up. I can do what I want.

39
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,080
really?

40
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,120
So, you wanna fight?

41
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,480
I’m gonna punch you like Hero punched Phone our friends.

42
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,840
You want a busted lip?

43
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,400
Don’t test me, you’ll regret it.

44
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,320
Bring it on!

45
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
Whoa!

46
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,000
Fine, I’ll go alone.

47
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,800
This is such a thrill.

48
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,600
So much fan service here.

49
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,240
Hey, no.

50
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Sarai, don’t gossip about us the wrong way.

51
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,840
So what’s the right way, then? Tell me, it’s 2018 now.

52
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,320
I like girls.

53
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,880
Ally likes girls too.

54
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,760
You’ve seen him flirting with them. Every girl in school watches him.

55
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,320
No way. I’ve seen girls sending Ally letters.

56
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,800
But she’s never written back to anyone.

57
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Written back?

58
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,680
Written back... He’ll write back soon.

59
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Ow!

60
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,800
What are you guys doing?

61
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,520
Just because you’re handsome doesn’t mean you’re off the hook.

62
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,080
If my face gets ruined, you’ll have to take responsibility.

63
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,560
This is my brother Seal.

64
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,760
My personal ATM.

65
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Pop, eat as much as you want.

66
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,480
Seal’s always been my ATM.

67
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,640
Whoa, why’re you looking at my brother like he’s some escort?

68
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
He’s my real brother, cousin actually.

69
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,960
Oh, do people say you look alike?

70
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,880
I don’t think so.

71
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,400
I’m all-natural. My brother... botoxed face, a lot of it.

72
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,480
Old now.

73
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Just kidding.

74
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,120
Not really. I’m the chill type

75
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,480
He’s super gentle with me. I ask for anything, I get it.

76
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,840
Right, Seal?

77
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,520
Go ahead, eat.

78
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
Want me to teach you table manners?

79
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,760
Nah, anything that fits in your mouth.

80
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,560
Just eat it. Relax.

81
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,920
Let me cut a steak for you.

82
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,320
You’ve got a new brother now, guess you won’t be cuddling with me anymore.

83
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,280
You’ll always be my sibling, Seal.

84
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,240
You’ve never joked like this in front of others.

85
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,560
What I mean is, all of us here have water-related names.

86
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,960
The codes have to do with oceans, mountains, right?

87
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,200
Even Seal... obviously a hero. Born to be a soldier.

88
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,520
Can’t do anything else.

89
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,600
Be bored

90
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,280
And you and I, we’re like a drug duo.

91
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
Drug duo, what?

92
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,640
This guy’s real name is Poppy, which means opium.

93
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,720
And Hero... well, heroin, get it?

94
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,400
You’re really stretching it.

95
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Just making stuff up as I go.

96
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,520
Here, take a bite.

97
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,080
Nah, I’ll eat it myself.

98
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Let me cut it for you.

99
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,160
Just one bite.

100
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,240
Okay?

101
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,800
One bite.

102
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,360
Good?

103
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,280
Aren’t you gonna ask me how things were abroad?

104
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,320
Doesn’t feel like we’re siblings who care for each other.

105
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,120
Oh, don’t get all upset now.

106
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
Good?

107
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,760
I think I’ll check out the bookstore across the street.

108
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,720
Why? You should socialize more instead of just reading.

109
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,600
To be honest, the soup filled me up earlier.

110
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,680
Just stay and chat with your brother. I’m off.

111
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,720
You sure?

112
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,560
Cut some meat for me too.

113
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,840
You can cut it yourself.

114
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,480
My bro definitely likes you, don’t worry.

115
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,840
How do you know?

116
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Well, he loves me, and I love you, so of course he’ll look after his little brother.

117
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,400
Hero’s in the shower. Come in first.

118
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,920
You all live together?

119
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,920
What’s that picture? Gross.

120
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,680
It doesn’t match the house at all.

121
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,920
The table too, it’s so big and bulky.

122
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,040
It might be low quality, but at least it matches the curtains.

123
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,520
Even if the curtains are low-quality too.

124
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Pop, pass me the shampoo we just bought.

125
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,520
Come and get it yourself.

126
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,560
Ugh.

127
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
Fine, I’ll get it.

128
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,160
Hey! How did you get here?

129
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,040
Uh...

130
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,160
You can strip in front of others, but you hide from your brother?

131
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,200
Oh, please. He’s always so perfectly dressed. Who wouldn’t be intimidated?

132
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,240
If you can’t be bold with him, then no one else should see you either.

133
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,240
Learn some modesty.

134
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,160
He’s here and didn’t even tell me.

135
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Ugh.

136
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,720
Why did you leave Bangkok and follow me here?

137
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,320
The PM 2.5 dust was too much, so I came here instead.

138
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,200
How are you going to stay here?

139
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,720
The bed only fits two.

140
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,320
Who said I’d sleep with you two?

141
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,560
I’m staying at a hotel.

142
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,880
No need to kick me out like this. What are you planning to do?

143
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,520
Nothing! After a shower, I’m just going to...

144
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,920
Oh.

145
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,040
Read a book.

146
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,640
I’m heading to the US soon. Not much time left.

147
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh, okay.

148
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,880
So we won’t see each other for a while? I get it.

149
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,520
You can stay a bit longer then.

150
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,040
When will you visit me in the US?

151
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,000
You got your visa, right? Don’t flake on me.

152
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,080
I’m just busy right now. I’ll visit when I can.

153
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,760
Ok

154
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,440
Promise me. I’ll be waiting.

155
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,400
Yeah.

156
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,280
I’m heading out.

157
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,080
Let him study.

158
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,400
It’s cold now, so don’t sleep naked. You’ll catch a cold.

159
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,920
Pop, are you messing with me?

160
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,560
What are you talking about?

161
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,680
I didn’t do anything.

162
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,520
You’re so busted.

163
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,240
Just go take a proper shower.

164
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,080
Hero’s making a mess.

165
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,240
Help me solve this problem.

166
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,840
Mine’s way bigger.

167
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,960
Hey, anyone free to help Dad move the plants?

168
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,600
I’ll go help.

169
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,560
(panting)

170
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
Message: Certificate for Mr. Lesilpi Pantarak.

171
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:25,040
Two movie tickets. Two movie tickets. Two movie tickets.

172
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:32,880
Damn, how many times are you watching movies?

173
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,680
Got too much free time?

174
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,920
Poppin.

175
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Who names their kid “Pin”?

176
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
(Phone ringing)

177
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,720
Pailin?

178
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,520
Hello?

179
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,440
Hello, where’s Pop?

180
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
Who’s this?

181
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
I’m his girlfriend.

182
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,920
Girlfriend.

183
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,800
Pop’s boyfriend is talking right now.

184
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,720
Who are you?

185
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,360
My name’s Pailin.

186
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,880
Who are you talking to?

187
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,120
Hello

188
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
Hello

189
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
Your girlfriend.

190
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,560
Hello

191
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
Wait, that’s really your boyfriend?

192
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,360
Who picked up? They said they’re Pop’s girlfriend.

193
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,800
Don’t worry about them.

194
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,520
What? So I’m not important either?

195
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
Who is this?

196
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,680
Pailin, stop messing with me. We’re over.

197
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,440
Pailin, do you miss him?

198
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,720
So what? Can’t we be friends? I called as a friend.

199
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,040
To me, breaking up means we’re strangers.

200
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,480
Don’t listen to him. He’s just a little brother.

201
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,440
Don’t call me anymore.

202
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,920
Pailin, you’re the only one he loves.

203
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,440
Just like the name engraved on this watch.

204
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,960
Hope we never part, not even for a second.

205
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,640
Break it.

206
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,080
If you can’t be friends after a breakup, either you still hate them.

207
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,320
Or you can’t let go.

208
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,880
I like someone else now. That’s all.

209
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,240
So, never apart for even a second?

210
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,320
What the hell?

211
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,720
What’s this?

212
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,760
Bought something for you.

213
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,800
Sit down.

214
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,120
Here, open it.

215
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,160
How is it?

216
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,080
Pretty, right? Let me put it on for you. Come here.

217
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,040
Wait.

218
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,160
You were gone all day just to buy this stuff?

219
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,360
Look, couple rings.

220
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,120
And these matching watches.

221
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,800
Towels, glasses—look.

222
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,160
Little elephants touching trunks.

223
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,600
Couple fans, cotton buds, toothbrushes.

224
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,240
And nail clippers with our names engraved.

225
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,800
Herofin, Heroin.

226
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,760
These are all things you’ll need.

227
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,200
Why “Heroin”?

228
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Because I’m Hero and you’re Poppy.

229
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,200
Poppy means opium. Herofin, Heroin.

230
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,160
Why not Hero-Pop, like that food-serving robot?

231
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,960
What's the point?

232
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,160
Oh, come on!

233
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,080
You named something “Popplit” and didn’t complain.

234
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,240
You’re so attached to stuff.

235
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,680
Are you jealous?

236
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:58,960
I’m not jealous; I just want things to be neat and tidy so the room looks clean.

237
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,560
And your movie tickets?

238
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
Throw them away if you want.

239
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
Seriously?

240
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,040
Really?

241
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,080
But why’d you buy so much stuff? You’re crazy.

242
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,800
Use the money on more important things. You’ve got exams soon.

243
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,280
Yeah, I know, but I needed this stuff. I’m not even sorry.

244
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,120
You need a beating.

245
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,400
Why? Hey, do you know?

246
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,680
People these days sell their kidneys to buy rings for their partners.

247
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,040
How does that even relate?

248
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,840
I’m just saying.

249
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640
When you love someone, you’ll do crazy things.

250
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,360
Why are you nibbling my ear? You’re giving me goosebumps.

251
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,920
What, does it turn you on?

252
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,640
Hero!

253
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,320
Hero, stop! Cut it out!

254
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,440
Pop, I’ll give you anything.

255
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,200
But one thing I won’t tolerate is if you start having feelings for someone else.

256
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,840
Hey!

257
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,000
Let’s grab some lunch.

258
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
Are you free today?

259
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,440
You better juggle those relationships first.

260
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
(sighs)

261
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,920
Your letter trick is so outdated.

262
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,200
But they still believe you, huh?

263
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,280
So, did it work?

264
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,160
(laughs)

265
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,640
Give me my glasses back

266
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,520
Pop, let's go eat.

267
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,600
(groggy)

268
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,560
How’d the exam go?

269
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,240
I didn’t study last night. I’m sure I’ll fail.

270
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
But you always get first place anyway.

271
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,600
I’ll go buy us lunch then, okay?

272
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,760
Wait here.

273
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,320
Hey, Palin.

274
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,080
Who’s Palin?

275
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,840
You know, Palin—Pop’s ex. Fair-skinned.

276
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:31,680
Pretty, rich, the daughter of the Phetai family.

277
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,400
(sneezes)

278
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,560
Ugh, whose perfume is that?

279
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:18,520
Pop, someone’s here to see you.

280
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:32,000
What’s up? Are you so shocked you can't believe I'm back?

281
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,400
How did Pailin come back?

282
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,720
I’m here to bring you good luck for your exams, just like always.

283
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,280
Hmm, still tastes just as good as always.

284
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,960
Just like when we used to come here.

285
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,960
Mmm.

286
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,240
Oh, I brought you a gift.

287
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,920
Here, Pop. I know you’ll like it.

288
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,840
Thanks.

289
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,040
And here, this is for you.

290
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,080
Why’d you buy me something? Do we even know each other?

291
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,600
Hero, the guy who was messing with me on the phone. Right?

292
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,240
Just kidding.

293
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Hero, Visnupong's nephew. He knows my dad.

294
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:22,000
Also, he’s the son of General Vorathep, now married to Pop’s mom.

295
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,160
You two are adorable. Your parents got married.

296
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,720
and now you’re step-siblings.

297
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,640
Usually, Pop doesn’t like people with status.

298
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,280
But you seem close like real brothers.

299
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,640
Did you tell her everything?

300
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,040
No.

301
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
Oh.

302
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,600
Pop?

303
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,600
Tiger!

304
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,080
Oh, Pop. You came to invite me to lunch? Let’s go.

305
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,960
Wait.

306
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,640
What?

307
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,120
Have you talked to Pailin?

308
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,160
Well, not really. I don’t know. I didn’t do anything.

309
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,200
Are you going to talk or not?

310
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,840
Ugh... Fine.

311
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,040
Pailin wanted to know about you, and she kept bugging me.

312
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:15,320
So, I thought if you two got back together, what’s so bad about that?

313
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,200
Pop

314
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,840
Oh. So you’re not coming to lunch with me?

315
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,440
Whoa, man! That girl with Hero is crazy beautiful.

316
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,400
Like she’s straight out of an NBK concert or something.

317
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,240
I don’t think she’s with that group.

318
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,880
That guy though, even after getting roughed up once, he still hasn’t learned.

319
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,240
Dude's way too cocky, messing with Hero’s girl again. Insane, right?

320
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,600
Hey Pop.

321
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,080
Wanna hang out after exams?

322
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,040
I heard there’s a new mall opening up, Iconsiam.

323
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,360
Pailin, did you just come here to visit?

324
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,640
Mmm... elections are coming up.

325
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,760
But I still choose you.

326
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,480
Um, can we switch seats?

327
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,680
Sure.

328
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,240
Hey, how do you even eat like that? Spilled water everywhere.

329
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Hey, could you come clean this up?

330
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,360
The table’s soaked, Be more careful next time.

331
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,960
Geez.

332
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,840
It’s okay, I’ll clean the table for you.

333
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,280
Hey, can we change tables?

334
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,440
Sure, this way please.

335
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,840
Next time, be more careful.

336
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,920
Take your glass with you.

337
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,560
Everything’s wet now.

338
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,680
This table’s better.
Yeah.

339
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,440
Pop.

340
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,840
I never really thought we broke up, you know?

341
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,400
I just thought we were taking a break.

342
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,640
I still believe, Pop, that you haven’t lost passion for us.

343
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,680
I told Pailin not to come back because of us.

344
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,960
The reason I came back to you, Pop, is because you said you had someone else.

345
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,720
If I see that person, I’ll buy a ticket and leave immediately.

346
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,000
Pop.

347
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,520
I know you’re just lying. Can we not break up?

348
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,280
Don’t tell anyone, man. If you push too hard, Hero will lose her.

349
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,240
Yeah, they say it’s okay if guys chase girls, but...

350
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,560
When I cut, it’s cut. When it’s over, it’s over. Move on means move on.

351
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,160
Fine.

352
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,920
If you won’t give me the real reason we broke up.

353
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,880
I’ll just keep moving in circles.

354
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,440
Man.

355
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,200
Girls who don’t give up are just shameless.

356
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,040
Girls who don’t give up are just shameless.

357
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,280
I doubt she’s that desperate. She’s still young.

358
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,120
(Laughs)

359
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,720
She’ll end up a teen mom.

360
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,000
Shut up!

361
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,200
Hey!

362
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,240
This kid...

363
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,120
Using our tax money and still causing trouble.

364
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,280
Save your energy and go wash a general’s underwear, old man.

365
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,960
Hey!

366
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,480
(Punch sound)

367
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,120
(Screams)

368
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,680
Kid, if you don’t know, don’t talk.

369
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
(Punch sound)

370
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,400
Yeah, if you don’t know anything, don’t insult others.

371
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,160
Let’s go, trust me.

372
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,240
That kid just punched him in the face.
Let’s go.

373
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,400
Pop, are you okay?

374
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,960
I’m fine.

375
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Hey!

376
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,240
(Laughs)

377
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,000
That’s hilarious!

378
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,120
Yeah, I like it.

379
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,520
Whoa, man, that’s...

380
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,960
(Laughs)

381
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,480
Where are you going? Home?

382
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,960
How am I supposed to go home like this? Look at my face!

383
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,640
What will my dad say?

384
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,560
Hey.

385
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,120
What happened to you? Pop.

386
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,240
Can you even walk?

387
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,720
Ask the guy you sent after me.

388
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,160
Hey, I didn’t send him to beat you up.

389
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,640
So, you admit you sent someone after me.

390
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,320
I didn’t trust you. You told her everything.

391
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,640
So how can I trust you?

392
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,240
You think I told her?

393
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,720
You’re lying. You’re still with her, aren’t you?

394
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,640
Yeah, I haven’t broken up with her. I miss her. I’ve never forgotten her.

395
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,200
I had her come here so I could be with her all the time

396
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,600
Not apart for a single second.

397
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,760
(Blinks)

398
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,240
Are you moving in with her? Packing your stuff?

399
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,400
If I told you I was sleeping alone, you wouldn’t believe me anyway.

400
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,000
Hold on a sec.

401
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,400
Move

402
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,840
1...

403
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,720
What the hell, punching him like that?

404
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,920
Auntie Jeab, hello!

405
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,680
Hello there! Looking for Pop?

406
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,560
He’s not here. Haven’t seen you in ages, you’ve gotten so pretty!

407
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,720
Come on in, come on in. Want anything to eat? Order whatever you like.

408
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,240
Where did Pop go?

409
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,320
He’s not with you?

410
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,560
Nope.

411
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,400
Doesn’t he live here with you?

412
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,880
Auntie Jeab, is Pop home?

413
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,680
Oh, Pop came here?

414
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,880
Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

415
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,520
Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

416
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,040
Is something going on?

417
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,000
So where did Pop go?

418
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,960
Why do you keep asking? He’s not here. What do you want?

419
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,320
What’s your problem? Why do you act like you hate me so much?

420
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,120
You walked out on me the other day, and now you’re snapping at me.

421
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,640
What’s going on?

422
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,560
Can’t say I like you or dislike you, let’s call it indifference.

423
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Hmm. I’ll make you change your mind one day.

424
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,080
If there’s nothing else, you should go.

425
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,480
There are plenty of people here. There’s even someone behind you.

426
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,040
(Sighs)

427
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,120
Help me get back together with Pop, will you?

428
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,680
No, because he doesn’t like you anymore.

429
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,280
Why? Does he have someone else?

430
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,920
Yes.

431
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,640
Pop likes the person sitting right in front of you.

432
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,080
What are you looking for?

433
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,520
He likes the person sitting right in front of you.

434
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,360
Pop likes you?

435
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,480
Really?

436
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,000
I don’t think so.

437
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,880
If Pop really liked you, why would he run away from you.

438
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:00,440
I think Pop is just heartbroken that he’s not with me.

439
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,000
He’s confused.

440
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,040
He talks to you because he’s upset.

441
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:17,240
One day, when he sees the light, he’ll kick you out, just like now.

442
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,640
Wow, you really did change me.

443
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,080
You made me hate you.

444
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,720
You’ll never beat me.

445
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,080
Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

446
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,080
What’s wrong with me?

447
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,760
Why am I acting so dumb?

448
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,440
You’re still out there hooking up with others.

449
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,240
If you want to throw away my phone, go ahead.

450
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,120
Did you tell them everything about me?

451
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,320
No.

452
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,760
I haven’t broken up with him yet.

453
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,920
I still miss Pailin. I’ve never forgotten her.

454
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,640
I asked her to come back,

455
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,520
so we can be together all the time.

456
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,920
Not even a second apart.

457
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,280
Are you moving in with her? Is that why you're packing?

458
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,800
Even if I told you I’d sleep alone,

459
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,560
you wouldn’t believe me anyway.

460
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,680
Can you help me talk to Pop? I really want him back.

461
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,520
Please, I’m begging you.

462
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,200
No.

463
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,440
I’m sorry, Pop, for not trusting you.

464
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,920
San, I can’t find Pop.

465
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,480
Can we track him using his phone signal?

466
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,760
Huh? Wait, Hero.

467
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,400
You can’t just track someone like that.

468
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,760
It’s a big deal, and besides, it’s not easy to do.

469
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,160
Then what should we do?

470
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,000
Calm down, we’ll figure something out.

471
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,480
(Bike brake sound)

472
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,720
Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop!

473
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,480
Hey Hero, I found Pop.

474
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,520
(sighs)

475
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,680
Pop

476
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,160
When am I going to be your boyfriend?

477
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:11,440
Love in school can ruin you, like a drug addiction.

478
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:21,920
Well, I guess I’m addicted to you and there’s no cure.

479
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,320
Hey, Pop! Look at this.

480
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,560
Do you see it?

481
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,760
How’s my face?

482
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,720
Look!

483
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,120
It’s rough.

484
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,760
No, my skin is dry! See?

485
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,640
You made me sleep outside your room, and it was freezing.

486
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,240
Do you have any cream I can use?

487
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,560
Do you?

488
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,200
Do you have any cream I can use?

489
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,720
What are you doing?

490
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,960
Are you even paying attention? What are you doing?

491
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,480
What are you doing?

492
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,040
Here, eat this.

493
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,080
What is it?

494
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,520
Well, you complained about dry skin, right? Just eat it.

495
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,120
Wait, did you put sleeping pills in this?

496
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,240
Are you trying to do something to me? Be honest.

497
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,560
Oh, please. I’m not you.

498
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,000
This is it.

499
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,720
This is Joji,

500
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,360
a skincare supplement with Astaxanthin Q10 plus, mixed berry flavor.

501
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,040
It helps moisturize your skin and reduces wrinkles.

502
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,280
So, your face won’t look rough and old like this.

503
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,360
Ouch, that hurts! Wow,

504
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,160
is it really that good?

505
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,280
They taste good.

506
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,720
Sure, if you like them, eat a lot.

507
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,960
Your skin will look even younger.

508
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,640
So, if my skin looks younger,

509
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,520
can I sleep in your bedroom again? Right?

510
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,560
No.

511
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,160
Why not?

512
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,040
I only kissed you!

513
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,440
I’ll let you kiss me back—twice, even!

514
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,520
Hey, what are you staring at?

515
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,280
What are you looking at?
