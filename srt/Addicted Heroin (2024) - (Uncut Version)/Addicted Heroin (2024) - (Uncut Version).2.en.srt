1
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
If Mom were here instead of Dad,

2
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,520
this mess wouldn’t have happened…

3
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,120
I swear, this family gives me such a headache.

4
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,600
And I’m not taking sides here, okay? I'm staying out of it.

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,600
But Auntie, you're still going to accept this essay, right?

6
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,800
Please,

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,960
Auntie?

8
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,280
Fine, fine.

9
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,120
I’m doing this for Lersilp, alright?

10
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,400
He’s a good student,

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,680
after all, and his family’s going through a tough time… His mom, well…

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
his mom…

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,360
Look at this,

14
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,320
I bought the latest iPad for you. And an iPhone too! See ?

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,840
See ?

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,400
I don’t want them.

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,080
What’s the big deal?

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,720
What,

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,920
do you want to end up like your father?

20
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,200
I mean, look at your uncles—they all made something of themselves.

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
And what’s wrong with being like Dad?

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,040
What’s so shameful about it?

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,120
Dad never did anything wrong to anyone,

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
and he never abandoned anyone either.

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Have any of my uncles taken care of Grandma the way Dad has?

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Dad worked hard, both at his job and at home, just for me.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
"Well, can’t you give me a chance?

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,160
I can give you so much more than that.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,160
And you don’t want me coming back to your house, do you?

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,600
Fine, just take all my stuff.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,280
I’ve already bought it.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Take it, Poppy, take it.

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:03,480
Poppy

34
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,840
"No matter what, Poppy, you’re still my son.

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,520
Mr. W even said he’d be happy to welcome you as his own son.

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:38,280
He wants to send you to a top school where alumni go on to big things in government, politics, and business.

37
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,720
Dad, this isn’t white anymore—it’s blue!

38
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,160
Let’s get you a new one.

39
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,000
Did Dad’s salary come in?

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,680
I bought you some new clothes. They’re brand name—real trendy.

41
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,240
If it means leeching off someone else,

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,520
I don’t want them.

43
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,600
It’s embarrassing.

44
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,640
Hey, that’s my cup!

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,320
Are you hurt, son?

46
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,720
They took my ice.

47
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,200
Bring that ice back right now! Don’t your parents teach you any manners?

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,480
What’s going on, son?

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,960
Why are you so upset?

50
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Your kid took my ice!

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
Well, I back now

52
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
No need to come back.

53
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
We’ve been living without her just fine.

54
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,720
Whether you're here or not, it makes no difference.

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,040
Grandma, why are you up so early?

56
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
Oh, you’re back already?

57
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,440
Uh, Grandma…

58
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,560
I knew you were out late last night, Poppy.

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,960
Were you working like your dad?

60
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,960
Didn't you think I might sneak out to have some fun?

61
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,320
You're a good boy.

62
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,320
And don’t worry, I won’t tell your dad.

63
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,840
You don’t need to worry about me—I can take care of myself.

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,400
Thank you, Grandma.

65
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,760
Hey Pop, can I borrow some white-out?

66
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
Pop,

67
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
lend me some white-out.

68
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,480
Whoa, you’re really

69
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,920
(Sneezes) "Ouch."

70
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,840
Why are you so focused in this class?

71
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,080
Because our teacher’s pretty.

72
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,080
If you wore makeup, you’d be prettier than the teacher.

73
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,600
Mind your own business.

74
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,120
Is everyone okay with what I just taught?

75
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,880
Yes, teacher.

76
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,800
Alright, if everyone’s good, let’s move on to the next lesson.

77
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,880
But before that, let’s review a bit. I’ll randomly pick a number.

78
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,720
What’s today’s date?

79
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,880
The 21st, right?

80
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,320
Let’s go with number 21.

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,720
Lersilp.

82
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,080
The question is:

83
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,360
What were the key points of the Bowring Treaty, and how did it impact Thailand?

84
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,000
Thailand abolished monopolies and allowed free trade.

85
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,040
They switched to collecting import taxes, capped at 3%.

86
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,960
Free trade led to more foreign businesses,

87
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,800
especially Chinese, coming into Thailand to meet global economic demands.

88
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,160
Correct! You’ve earned a one-question homework reduction.

89
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
Yay!

90
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,480
Awesome!

91
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
Let’s move on to the next question.

92
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,000
Alright,

93
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,960
I’ll pick someone from the back. You seem eager to answer.

94
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,360
What was the turning point for the abolition of slavery?

95
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,640
I was born after 2000. Do I really need to know this stuff?

96
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Well… the mainstream discourse…

97
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,640
the alternative discourse…

98
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,240
The Bowring Treaty was a turning point.

99
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,000
Rice became a major export commodity,

100
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,520
requiring more free labor.

101
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,320
The abolition of slavery became a key driver for the growing economy.

102
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,080
Alternative discourse.

103
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,520
Correct! That’s a two-question homework reduction!

104
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,640
So, was he really asleep, or was he just pretending?

105
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,880
Hero, did you know Pop has a spirit?

106
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
A dick…?

107
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,480
Don’t all guys have a dick?

108
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,160
No I mean spirit,

109
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,880
when Pop falls asleep, someone else takes over and learns for him.

110
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,240
What should we eat today?

111
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
I don’t know, let’s go check it out.

112
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,560
Alright, let’s call Pop.

113
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,520
Pop! Pop! Pop!

114
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Let’s get lunch,

115
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,400
Pop. Hurry up!

116
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,800
You’re burning up; you feel like you have a fever.

117
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,960
Hey, Pop, Pop!

118
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,640
Let’s take you to the nurse. Come on, Pop!

119
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,680
Ouch, my back, my back!

120
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,600
Move out of the way.

121
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,080
Pop! Pop! Pop!

122
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,680
Are you okay?

123
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,840
Pop, are you alright?

124
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,320
Watch your step.

125
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,160
What happened?

126
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,160
My friend’s asleep and won’t wake up. He seems to have a fever.

127
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240
Yongchayut Kusun…

128
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
Only, the school star, right?

129
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,560
Yes, that’s him.

130
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,440
I thought so.

131
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,600
The other day, a student from class two came to ask for medicine.

132
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,560
Do you know what they asked for?

133
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
They wanted something to stop them from daydreaming about Only.

134
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
If you don’t stop obsessing over boys,

135
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,240
I’m going to report you to the principal.

136
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
So, what’s wrong with him?

137
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,560
Well, he took two fever pills,

138
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,320
and now he won’t wake up.

139
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,040
Those fever pills were expired.

140
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,040
What? Will he be okay, teacher?

141
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,840
He’ll be fine; it’s just that the medicine’s effectiveness has decreased.

142
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,880
But taking two fever pills shouldn’t make him sleep this deeply…

143
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,680
Looks like there were several allergy pills too.

144
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,880
Water…

145
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,520
Can I have some water?

146
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,280
That's enough, that's enough,

147
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,440
Dad.

148
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,120
Dad?

149
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:33,240
Do you want more water, son?

150
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
Want more water, son?

151
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,880
Hey!

152
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,280
What are you doing here?

153
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
And why am I here?

154
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,880
Talk nicely to your dad, son. Speak politely.

155
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,320
Your dad.

156
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,360
Okay, I’m not messing around anymore. Just go to sleep.

157
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,720
Why am I here?

158
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,000
You were completely out cold.

159
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,840
You weren’t responding to me at all,

160
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,640
so I had to carry you here.

161
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:29,000
I think the allergy meds mixed with the fever meds and knocked you out like a horse tranquilizer.

162
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,520
Wait,

163
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,360
I took fever meds. What do allergy meds have to do with this?

164
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,720
I crushed them and mixed them in with your water.

165
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,600
Not you again!

166
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
Hey, calm down!

167
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,600
You’re still sick, and now you want to punch me?

168
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,760
Look,

169
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,160
I didn’t mean any harm;

170
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,760
the nurse said you had a fever and weren’t getting enough rest.

171
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,040
What does the allergy medicine have to do with anything?

172
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,560
In class,

173
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
I was talking to you, and you weren’t responding at all.

174
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,360
But then when the teacher asked you questions,  you answered everything perfectly.

175
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,360
They said it was like you had a spirit attending class for you while you were asleep.

176
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,040
I was just curious, that’s all.

177
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,200
Are you serious?

178
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,520
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.

179
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,440
Your logic is completely messed up.

180
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
Did you take the wrong meds or something?

181
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,640
Yeah, I’m sick,

182
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:43,320
so I’ve got to take a lot of meds… love meds, too.

183
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,280
So, where’s my sweetheart

184
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,480
gone off to?

185
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,920
I’m going to class.

186
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,920
I’m sorry, okay?

187
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,080
But you should rest.

188
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
I already called in to get you excused from your afternoon classes.

189
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,960
What?

190
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,200
Why did you do that?

191
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,880
You’re really sick, you know.

192
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,480
Yeah, I’m sick, so I’ve got to take lots of meds…

193
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,960
and you’re my medicine.

194
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
I think I’m starting to get addicted to teasing you.

195
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
Hang in there, sweetheart.

196
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,360
You’ve lost your mind.

197
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,680
Just go, go wherever you want.

198
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,760
Actually, I think I’m coming down with something too. I’ll just sleep here with you.

199
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Go sleep somewhere else. There are plenty of beds

200
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,680
Yeah, I’m sick. (coughs) Pass me a blanket, will you?

201
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,440
Are you coming in or going out? Stop being annoying.

202
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,520
Oh, so you’ve already read ahead.

203
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,360
That’s why you were able to sleep in class.

204
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah, sorry about that, no spirits or anything.

205
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,960
Man, I thought I’d see you sleeping while a spirit took over and paid the bill for you.

206
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,560
What a letdown.

207
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:34,640
Okay, you paid, so you can go now. Don’t be such a pain.

208
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:42,320
Is there any hot water here? Oh, there it is.

209
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,360
Hey, Pop, I read somewhere about a technique to press a pressure point to wake you up.

210
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,760
What? Are you planning to mess with me again?

211
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,920
No, seriously. I can help keep you alert all the time. Come here.

212
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,440
The noodles are soggy now.

213
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,160
You press here, and the noodles become soggy?

214
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,320
I meant your instant noodles; they’re all mushy now.

215
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,560
Let me slurp these noodles first.

216
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,160
You’re disgusting.

217
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,000
Ugh, so annoying.

218
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,360
Quiet in the library, please.

219
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,720
He sneezed, didn’t say anything ?

220
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:56,360
Hey, you, come back and throw that tissue away.

221
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,560
Little one.

222
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,440
So, you’re close with Only now? Even helping each other pick up trash?

223
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,760
Do you know what Only likes?

224
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,720
Tissues, maybe?

225
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,520
What kind of tissues—boxed or in a pack?

226
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,040
Whatever, as long as they’re big.

227
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:39,200
Big tissues? What size—12, 24, 36, 48?

228
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,400
Let’s just buy them all.

229
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,800
Am I going to be able to read this book? Ugh

230
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:15,720
To Only, did Tongneng really mean it?

231
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,160
I doubt she’ll use up all those tissues in one semester.

232
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,680
But whatever.

233
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:41,000
Kitty, did you buy those tissues for me because you like me or something?"

234
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,480
I didn’t buy you any tissues, seriously.

235
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah, right. Not convincing.

236
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,840
It was Tongneng from class two who bought them for you because she likes…

237
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:07,160
Stop blaming others. If you like me, just say it.

238
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:28,360
Ugh, always buying weird stuff like it’s out of Eternal Sunshine.

239
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,960
So, you’re saying I should have been the one to buy them for you? Fine, forget it then.

240
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,120
Wait, thanks anyway.

241
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,360
You complain like you don’t want them.

242
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,000
Lersil, did you post something? Why did the military come to pick you up?

243
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,400
Ugh?

244
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,400
Right there

245
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,240
I already told them I’m not going and I won’t accept anything from them.

246
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:19,360
I know Gen Z kids are confident and don’t want to rely on anyone. My son’s stubborn too.

247
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,040
I’m not like him.

248
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,920
I’m not here to force you into anything. I’m just giving you advice as someone older.

249
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,480
You think that just being talented is enough to succeed?

250
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,840
As long as you’re in this country, no matter how talented you are, you’re still going to hit a ceiling you can’t break through."

251
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,840
Because those with better profiles and connections won’t let you rise.

252
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,080
I know.

253
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,560
We’re both men, and a man must have his dignity.

254
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:15,440
But this isn’t about pity. You’re your mother’s son; it’s your right to receive what you deserve.

255
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,560
I don’t see her as my mother.

256
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,960
If there’s nothing else, I’d like to go back to my studies.

257
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,600
Whether you see her as your mother or not, only you can decide that.

258
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:45,560
But if you do achieve success one day, it won’t be me or your mother who benefits—it’ll be you.

259
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,800
Whether it’s ego, innocence, or naivety, I don’t know. But I believe I can succeed on my own merits.

260
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,280
Wait.

261
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,560
Your mother left something for your grandmother.

262
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:27,600
Kids these days, what’s wrong with them? They’re all brainwashed by the West. (Sighs)

263
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,280
Can’t even find good coffee in this countryside.

264
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,680
Is there anyone else who wants to challenge?

265
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,080
Anyone up for it? Any other challengers?

266
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,840
Really?

267
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,520
It's me.

268
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,200
Are you sure?

269
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,160
Sure?

270
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,320
1, 2, 3!

271
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,680
What do you think about Mother’s Day this year?

272
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,880
Oh, it’s beautiful. The kids did a wonderful job today.

273
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:41,320
Bowing to one’s mother is a display of gratitude from a child to the one who gave them life and raised them with love

274
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,160
It’s also a way to seek blessings from the mother, so the child can receive good fortune.

275
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,680
Are you done with your work? Do you want me to wait for you?

276
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,600
Yes, Mom.

277
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,800
Hey, what are you doing here?

278
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,400
Help set up in Mother's Day event.

279
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,200
Pop must have been a hassle.

280
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,520
So, did Jeab or Grandma come this year?

281
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,840
They’re both sick.

282
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,920
Get well soon, do you want me to be your mom for today?

283
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,560
Do you need it?

284
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,840
Can I join in too?

285
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,960
Why are you here?

286
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,120
Eh!

287
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,280
My mom works at a resort out of town, and on Mother’s Day, it’s always super busy with customers.

288
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,640
It’s fine, I’ll be the mom for everyone today. How about you?

289
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,400
I’m cool with whatever Pop wants.

290
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,160
Well, my mom’s coming, so it’s up to Pop.

291
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,240
It’s okay. I think this should be a special moment for your mom and Tiger.

292
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,160
Next up, we’ll announce the winners of the Mother’s Day essay competition.

293
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:03,920
We’d like to invite the principal, Ms. Trinuch Tianchaiyanon, to present the awards.

294
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,800
So, what’s up with your essay? Why did that guy copy yours?

295
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,080
It was just an entry for the competition. He did it to win the prize money.

296
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,960
How much did he get?

297
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,120
2000 baht.

298
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
Only 2000?

299
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,640
You don’t get it—2000 is a lot, man.

300
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,360
Hey, teacher, can you hold this for me?

301
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,040
And the first prize for the Mother’s Day essay competition goes to…

302
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,160
Pop, bring it over.

303
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,720
Mr. Lersil Panyachak!

304
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,000
I thought it wasn’t supposed to be for anyone. (Confused)

305
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Pop, your essay was amazing. Go up there and get your prize

306
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,400
They’re calling your name.

307
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,280
Lersil, where’s Lersilp? Come up and receive your award!

308
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:47,000
The runner-up prize goes to Mr. Wasin.

309
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,880
Uh-huh.

310
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,960
How did you know I was going to win?

311
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,800
Because your essay was seriously good.

312
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,040
But my essay got soaked with water.

313
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,080
Okay, I’ll write a new one for you.

314
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,440
With your chicken-scratch handwriting?

315
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,560
Ouch, that stings!

316
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,200
You cheater! I didn’t see your name on the entry list before the deadline, so how did you win?

317
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,960
I knew it. How did someone like you win a Mother’s Day essay competition?

318
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,560
You probably wrote some fake, made-up story

319
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,720
Because your mom abandoned you when you were a kid

320
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,720
and she’s… you know.

321
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,280
Who the hell are you? What does that have to do with anything?

322
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,280
You have no right to punch my son.

323
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,360
Look at your son, mouthing off to Pop like that. He’s going to lose his ability to eat if he keeps it up.

324
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,760
Do you even know who I am? Go get your parents.

325
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:46,000
I don’t need parents to defend me. A real man takes responsibility for his words and actions.

326
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,520
Rahas, stop right now!

327
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,960
Damn it!

328
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,480
Rahas?

329
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,800
Hero,stop.

330
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,520
Hero! I told you to stop.

331
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,360
We’ll see each other in the principal’s office.

332
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:38,640
Hey, about your essay—I saved it for you. That way, you won’t miss out on that 2000 baht.

333
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,720
How are you doing?

334
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,640
One way or another, you had to know about this.

335
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,680
It’s fine.

336
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,720
We got lucky that Only recorded the whole clip as evidence that the other guy started the insults.

337
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,360
You cheater!

338
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,520
I didn’t see your name on the entry list before the deadline,

339
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,120
so how did you win?

340
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,120
They’re just trying to wrap things up quickly.

341
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,400
Chill

342
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,800
What punishment did you get?

343
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,360
Man, they tortured me.

344
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:39,880
They made me write out the 12 Thai core values 100 times.

345
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,960
Well, it's still better, isn't it?

346
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,880
What should I do? It sucks.

347
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,480
I can help you practice writing if you want.

348
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,400
Really?

349
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,520
Your shirt’s got blood on it.

350
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
It’s nothing.

351
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,680
Take it off; I’ll wash it for you.

352
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,360
No, it’s okay, it’s just a little.

353
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,520
I’ll wash it for you.

354
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,760
It’s fine.

355
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,920
Take it off.

356
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,920
You’re worried about me, aren’t you?

357
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,880
What am I supposed to wear now?

358
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,640
Here, put this on

359
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,280
Wait for me! Damn,

360
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,440
it even smells like you. Hey, wait up, Pop!

361
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,280
You’re holding your pen wrong again.

362
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,200
You have to hold it like this.

363
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,640
Come here, let me show you. Move your grip up a bit—it’s too close.

364
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,920
When you write,

365
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,000
it doesn’t have to look exactly like mine.

366
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,040
Just make sure it’s legible.

367
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,280
If you want to beat your stepmom’s kid,

368
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,680
you have to do it your own way.

369
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,960
Yeah, I get it.

370
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,480
You must really hate him, huh?

371
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,280
Honestly, I’ve never even met him,

372
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,240
but everyone’s always comparing me to him,

373
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,440
so I end up wishing he didn’t exist.

374
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,960
I get it. I’ve been compared to others before, too.

375
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,880
Hey,

376
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,720
since we’re opening up, how about we crack open a beer too?

377
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,600
Hey!

378
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,640
Alright, cheers! Are you okay?

379
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,360
Your face is all red.

380
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,800
You’re weak, aren’t you?

381
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,120
I'm not easily affected by alcohol

382
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,480
Hey, but you know, my mom isn’t like what Bas said, okay?

383
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,680
What does it matter what he said?

384
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,320
Who cares about that jerk?

385
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,280
My mom just got remarried, that’s all.

386
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,920
I get it. My dad got remarried too.

387
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,200
She married someone rich.

388
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,640
Honestly, she didn’t do anything wrong;

389
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,800
she’s just being realistic.

390
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,280
People often choose to be with someone who has money to make their own life easier.

391
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,880
Yeah, I guess my stepmom thinks the same way.

392
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,960
Since we're already here,

393
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,120
why don’t you go ahead and wear the shoes?

394
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,080
I bought them, and I don’t want to carry them back.

395
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,280
You’re so persistent.

396
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,080
Yeah, just put them on.

397
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,840
Alright, I’ll help you put them on.

398
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,440
Come here, take off your old ones.

399
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,160
Done. You can throw away your old pair now.

400
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,960
I can’t; my dad bought those for me.

401
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,200
Really?

402
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:42,040
Then keep the old pair, but wear these new ones.

403
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,120
Why do you have ten heads or something?

404
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,840
You’re like a Ravana.

405
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,120
Pop, Pop,

406
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,400
I brought some food to share.

407
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,920
Go get a bowl to put it in.

408
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,800
So, Jeab’s feeling better now?

409
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,920
Oh, she’s tough as nails.

410
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,880
Auntie Jeab,

411
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,840
if I need to wash a shirt that has bloodstains, what should I use?

412
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,840
Blood? What happened?

413
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,400
Pop, um… popped a pimple.

414
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,200
If you don’t want your dad to wash it and end up with a new color,

415
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,640
I can wash it for you.

416
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,000
No, it’s okay,

417
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,240
Auntie Jeab. Just tell me how, and I’ll do it myself.

418
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,040
Just use some salt and lemon.

419
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,840
I’ll go get them for you.

420
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,320
Here you go

421
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,440
Squeeze the lemon over the bloodstain, sprinkle a bit of salt, and then scrub, scrub, scrub.

422
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,720
Try it, try it, try it, then scrub it out.

423
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,200
Actually, let me wash it for you.

424
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,120
See? You can squeeze more lemon on it,

425
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,360
sprinkle a little more salt,

426
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,600
and scrub it harder like this.

427
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
See? It’s starting to come out.

428
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,560
Then you can add a bit more lemon if needed.

429
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,120
Hey, how did you get in here?

430
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,760
Once I told them I’m your dad, they let me up.

431
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,800
I’ve been here for a while and you just decided to show up now?

432
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,120
I was waiting to see how long you could last.

433
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,480
Well, I’ve lasted a while now.

434
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,880
You think you're so tough,

435
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,960
getting into fights with others?

436
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:37,040
If I leave you alone, you’re going to ruin my reputation.

437
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,400
Oh,

438
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,600
so you’re more worried about your reputation.

439
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:54,320
Why don’t you just have someone write a song to praise you and be done with it?

440
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,840
You’re really getting out of control.

441
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,920
Someone like you needs a mother to look after them,

442
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,200
like Aunt Ging.

443
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,720
Let her take care of her own kid.

444
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,960
Don’t worry,

445
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,920
her kid will be joining us soon.

446
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,040
Having a sibling might actually be good for you.

447
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,640
What sibling?

448
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,560
I’m not related to any parasites!

449
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,920
Watch your mouth.

450
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,160
Uncle,

451
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,320
he just woke up.

452
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,560
Let him go clean up,

453
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,080
and then we can all talk calmly.

454
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,280
What, are you going to discipline me?

455
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,600
Go ahead, you’re used to it anyway.

456
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,960
But if you think I’m going to live with a parasite,

457
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,840
I’d rather die.

458
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,040
Sir, this is dangerous.

459
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,240
You really want to die, huh?

460
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,480
If you keep acting like an idiot,

461
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,720
I’ll consider not having a son like you.

462
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,120
Please calm down, sir.

463
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,960
You know that no matter how much you use force,

464
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,960
you can’t control Hero.

465
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,840
Don’t do this.

466
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,640
Stay out of it!

467
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,960
Stay out of it!Do you want to die?

468
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Do it.

469
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,080
Let me fall

470
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,040
Are you satisfied? If you are, then leave.

471
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,280
I’m feeling gross and want to shower.

472
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,080
Fine.

473
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,160
I’ll cut off your allowance.

474
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:51,600
Let’s see how you manage without your credit card and live like a poor person.

475
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,400
San, Go!

476
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,760
Yes, sir.

477
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,360
Let him pack his own things.

478
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,560
Live like a poor person?

479
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,000
You don’t get it—2000 baht is a lot of money, you know.

480
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:32,160
That’s why I don’t like rich people—they get everything so easily and then look down on those who struggle.

481
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,800
Just like your stepchild.

482
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,680
What the hell are you doing here?
