1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:11,000
(panting)

2
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,080
Uncle.

3
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,960
Hero.

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
Hero, are you okay?

5
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,360
Come back home!

6
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,440
I’m not going back.

7
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,400
I’m staying with him.

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,160
You think I’ll let you two stay together again?

9
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,720
Get the kids and drag them back home.

10
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,200
Hero.

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,080
Hero.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,360
(panting)

13
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Let me go! I said, let me go!

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,120
Who do you think you are, Dad? Let us go now!

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,760
What’s going on? Why the noises is all around?

16
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,120
Let me and Pop go now!

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,480
Why are you grabbing our kids?

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,960
You can calmly talk.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Why must you use violence?

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,760
You shut up and take your kid inside.

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,600
Don’t let him run off. Go!

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
Hey, take it easy, don’t hurt Pop!

23
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,880
Let me go!
Hey, take it easy, don’t hurt Pop!

24
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,360
Who do you think you are to grab me like this?

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
Hero, calm down!

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
Today, I’m separating these two kids.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,120
You separate us today, but tomorrow, we’ll still have sex.

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,880
Why?

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,560
(punching)

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,920
Hero!

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,600
Hero!

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Stop! Don’t!

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
Go! Leave now!

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
What are you going to do?

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,280
You hit Pop’s hand.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,280
Pop needs me.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,280
Stay out of this.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,560
Only my dad and Hero can help me with my wounds.

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,800
Pop doesn’t need that woman.

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,880
Pop needs me.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,040
Teenagers these days, being close like this, it makes them go astray, doesn’t it?

42
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Does Poppy hate women because you hates mom, so now you're dating a guy?

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,440
It’s called love!

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,640
Are you crazy?

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,200
I don’t hate women! Mom doesn’t mean that much anymore.

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,480
You’re just a teenager, curious, wanting to experiment. It’s normal.

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,560
He probably thinks his mom stole his dad,

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,000
so now he’s taking revenge on you.

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,880
Don't be dramatic!

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,120
Ow!

51
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:35,680
(struggling noises)

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,760
Ahh! Hey!

53
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,040
Pop!

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,040
How’d you get in here?

55
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,400
I climbed up to the second floor and crawled in. Lucky that you're here.

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,240
Yeah! And your mom’s not with you, right?

57
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah, I finally got rid of her. So annoying.

58
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,640
Okay, I’ll climb down.

59
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,040
Wait, slow down. Be careful.

60
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,480
I missed you last night. Can I have a hug?

61
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,960
No.

62
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,000
Come on, just a hug. Please?

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,240
No.

64
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,120
Please?

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,880
No.

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
Is this fun for you?

67
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,720
I’m not having fun anymore.

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,960
What did I do wrong?

69
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,280
Why do you always provoke your dad?

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,200
For you, I’d do anything.

71
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,200
You don’t need to prove your love by fighting with him?

72
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,960
Am I that dumb to you?

73
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
So dumb.

74
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
How?

75
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,160
I’m just choosing my own path,

76
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,880
and choosing you who I want to be with.

77
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,640
If that makes me dumb, then everyone protesting out there must be dumb too.

78
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,760
Please just care about me.

79
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
If I didn’t care you, why would I be worried about you?

80
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,320
Don’t you get how I feel when I look at your face right now?

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,840
What about my face?

82
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,200
How does it look?

83
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,200
How does it look? Tell me, how does it look?

84
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Ouch!

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,040
Go away.

86
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,320
(glass clinking)

87
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,440
Is the meeting over?

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,720
Why? It wasn’t a big issue.

89
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,240
Where’s that kid?

90
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
Which one?

91
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,400
My kid, obviously.

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Both of them is your kids, sir.

93
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
Has anyone treated your wound yet?

94
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,440
Only Dad and you can do that for me.

95
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,400
Why do you have bandage on you?

96
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Does it hurt?

97
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Ouch!

98
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
(knocking)

99
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,280
Go away. Just go.

100
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,640
(gunshot)

101
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,040
Scream!

102
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,040
Shit!

103
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,080
Uncle!

104
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,000
You decide now!

105
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:24,240
I’ll act like I don’t know what’s going on with you if you go joining the army.

106
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,680
But if not, I’ll do everything I can to separate you two.

107
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
(scream)

108
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,720
Hero!

109
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,880
Don’t interfere!

110
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Pop, Hero, are you okay?

111
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Take this kid to his room and wait his dad to pick him back home.

112
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,760
Pop, Mr. Pop, sir.
Why does everything have to be so violent?

113
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,680
Let me go!

114
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,840
Hero, Hero!

115
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,760
Let me go!

116
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,920
Let me go!

117
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,840
Calm down, son.

118
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,880
Let me go!

119
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
Let me go!

120
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,600
Pop!

121
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,880
My mom got this diamond box before she died,

122
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
and it came with a talisman.

123
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,240
Your mom uesd to work at a jewelry store, right?

124
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,120
He probably thought I stole his dad,

125
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,640
so now he’s getting revenge on the kid, huh?

126
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,360
What is this about ?

127
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,240
that you told me Hero seeking revenge?

128
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
What did mom do to them?

129
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,000
Are you doubting me?

130
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,920
Just tell me the truth!

131
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Hero's mom was from the same province like us.

132
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,320
When she visited her sister,

133
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,880
Hero's mom and Mr. Vor stayed at the hotel where I worked.

134
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
I was about to get fired,

135
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,840
and Hero's mom knew I had a kid the same age as hers.

136
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,440
She felt bad and helped me get a job at the jewelry store.

137
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,360
So, you gave her this diamond box?

138
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,520
And then what?

139
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
What’s this talisman about?

140
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,800
I don’t believe in this stuff.

141
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,320
But whoever made this talisman had bad intentions.

142
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,720
You think I used black magic to steal her husband?

143
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,200
Pop, are you out of your mind?

144
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,400
This diamond box?

145
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,520
It was the wife of the Colonel, Mr. Vor’s rival, who bought it.

146
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,880
Really?

147
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,040
Yes.

148
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,840
I’ve tried explaining to Hero many times, but he must be so painful.

149
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,160
So, he needs to blame someone to forget his pain.

150
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,040
And the car switch?

151
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,080
All we know is

152
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,720
Hero's mom chose to switch cars by herself.

153
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,640
Why?

154
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,080
Not even Mr. Vor knew why.

155
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,480
Go back inside, son. Standing in the rain like this won’t help.

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,840
What are you doing here?

157
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
Dad.

158
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
What happened with your hand?

159
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,760
Are you mad at me?

160
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,160
Mad about what?

161
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,120
You know what I mean.

162
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,800
I love you, Pop, unconditionally.

163
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
Did you know about these two kids all along?

164
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,280
How could you let them do this?

165
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,400
You’ve been too caught up with your new wife and kid, haven’t you?

166
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,080
That’s why you didn’t notice your own child.

167
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,760
That’s why he’s turn to be like this.

168
00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:02,720
Don’t you dare talk about my kid! Be a good mom first!

169
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,480
Pop, let’s go home.

170
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,640
I can’t go home, Dad.

171
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,600
I can’t leave him.

172
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,680
Dad.

173
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,040
Please help Hero.

174
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,160
Help him, Dad

175
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,440
Pop, have some grilled rice. I just made it for you.

176
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,160
No, I don’t want any.

177
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,920
I already called the principal. She’ll be here soon.

178
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,400
There she is.

179
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,520
Principal, please help Hero. I’m begging you.

180
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,120
Where’s Hero?

181
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,480
I’ll take you to him. This way.

182
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,960
Go.

183
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Where’s my grandson? Where’s my grandson?

184
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,440
He’s upstairs.

185
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,280
Hero,

186
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,840
you’re still young.

187
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,320
You don’t need to rush into love.

188
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,280
Wait until you finish school. There’s no hurry.

189
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,160
But if I die,

190
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,040
and the person I love doesn’t make it to that day, like mom,

191
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,920
then it’s like I never got to be with the one I love in this life, right?

192
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,080
Dad already killed mom.

193
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,320
Now, you’re going to take Pop away from me too?

194
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,000
Your dad didn’t kill your mom.

195
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
But he sent her to take the bullet!

196
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,200
Your mom chose to ride in that car herself.

197
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,120
Uncle Seri knew everything.

198
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:01,600
I never spoke about it because I didn’t want to make everyone sadder.

199
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,400
But if you hate your dad so much,

200
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,680
I guess I have to tell you.

201
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,920
Your mom had a sixth-sense,

202
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,160
she felt something bad was coming.

203
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,920
That red diamond box?

204
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,160
It’s just a fake talisman, nothing real.

205
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
And what did she touch?

206
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,480
She dreamt your dad would get into the car without a shadow,

207
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,200
meaning something bad would happen.

208
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,400
So, she decided to switch cars with your dad to trick fate.

209
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,200
I’m sorry.

210
00:18:52,760 --> 00:19:00,760
I’m truly sorry about this. Be a good kid, and take care of your mom.

211
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,720
Darling.

212
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,480
Can I switch cars with you?

213
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
I just have a bad feeling.

214
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,200
Come on, let’s go home quickly.

215
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,560
What superstitions are these?

216
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,080
You’re just like your dad.

217
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,640
He didn’t believe in this stuff either.

218
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,960
That’s why your mom didn’t consult him, but went to Uncle Seri instead.

219
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,240
Uncle Seri was in a different unit, so he couldn’t help much.

220
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:59,120
But he warned your mom to go back, yet she did the opposite.

221
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
Excuse me.

222
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:11,040
Did the madam know that car would get shot because my dad was driving it?

223
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,240
She didn’t know she was saving someone else’s kid.

224
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,640
Who wants to die?

225
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,160
(explosion sound)

226
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,040
Mom!

227
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,680
Don’t go in, sir!

228
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,000
It’s dangerous!

229
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,880
Mom!

230
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,960
Ya! let me go!

231
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Ya! Ya!

232
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,080
Sir!

233
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,760
But Dad let her switch just because she threw a fit and faked being sick.

234
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,080
Don’t you think he was just being kind, taking care of his wife?

235
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,880
(crying)

236
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,320
Over there so stubborn and you’re... sigh

237
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,240
Why don’t you take a break, sweetie?

238
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,160
Hero!

239
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,760
Drink some water. You haven’t eaten in two days, Hero.

240
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,960
Hero!

241
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,640
Pop sent this for you.

242
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,000
(Cough)

243
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,400
Hero,

244
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,680
are you really going to do this?

245
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,520
What’s the point if you die?

246
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,320
You gonna be a businessman in hell or what?

247
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,240
You don’t think I’ll go to heaven?

248
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,480
You told me once, right?

249
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,320
You said you wanted to see yourself become a businessman.

250
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,160
If you don’t make it, won’t your mom be heartbroken?

251
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,840
I want you to follow your dreams,

252
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,880
even if it doesn’t include me.

253
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:01,960
You idiot. My mom chose to die for him instead of staying with me.

254
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,480
Now,

255
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,200
you’re all I’ve got left, okay?

256
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,560
And I want you to know,

257
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,360
as long as you hold on to me,

258
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,360
I’ll never leave you.

259
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,920
(Crying)

260
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,160
If you starve yourself,

261
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,000
I’ll starve with you.

262
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,200
If you sleep in the attic,

263
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,680
I’ll sleep on the grass.

264
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:46,960
(Crying)

265
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,520
I think we should just let things unfold naturally.

266
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,840
No, everything’s gone wrong.

267
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,880
You can handle your son however you like, but I’m not doing that.

268
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,040
General, parents want their children to live good lives.

269
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Forcing him down this path, it’s not a good life.

270
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,040
I gave him all the freedom in the world to choose!

271
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,560
How is forcing him like that giving him freedom?

272
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,560
My son’s life is my responsibility, no one else’s.

273
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,080
It’s been two days, sir. You’ve locked him up for two days.

274
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,520
What do you gain if something happens to him?

275
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,080
My son. No one else should meddle.

276
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,920
The meaning of being a father must be different for everyone, I guess.

277
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,800
Poppy, let bring Hero out of here.

278
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,200
It’s been three days

279
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,160
There’s still 15 hours left until it’s officially three days.

280
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,880
How long are you going to put yourself through this?

281
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,480
I’m fine.

282
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,120
And as for him,

283
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,840
you’ve been secretly giving him food and water, haven’t you?

284
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,040
I tried, but he won’t take any of it.

285
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,600
You know what he’s like.

286
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,320
He’ll reach his limit.

287
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,440
Nobody doesn’t love their life.

288
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,080
He’s just trying to get back at me.

289
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
If he wants to be stupid,

290
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,040
let him die.

291
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,920
If you didn’t care,

292
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,840
you wouldn’t be counting down the hours like this.

293
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,320
What do you get out of dying, huh?

294
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,680
Dad.

295
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,520
I don’t want to die.

296
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,800
Just do as I say, and let the past go.

297
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,800
I don’t want to die...

298
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,600
Because if I die, I won’t see Pop again.

299
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,280
Being a soldier is such a big issue for you?

300
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Being with a man, is that a problem for you?

301
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,960
Is it such a big problem for you, Dad?

302
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,520
You gave up everything,

303
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,160
but if I’m with Pop,

304
00:31:52,920 --> 00:32:01,600
I won’t hold a grudge about Mom choosing you over me.

305
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,600
What’s wrong with you?

306
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,800
What are you trying to prove by beating me?

307
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
See my Facebook,

308
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,400
and come find me tonight.

309
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,320
I don’t want you stay in my room at all.

310
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,320
Don’t worry. I’m not interested in you.

311
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,000
But I’m interested in you.

312
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,880
Look, I’m serious, bro.

313
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,880
I want you to help Hero.

314
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,240
This is a huge deal.

315
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,960
Luckily Grandpa isn’t there, since he’s abroad.

316
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,960
My uncle is strict, stricter than my dad.

317
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,520
If I get involved, I’m screwed.

318
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,920
Didn’t Hero say you were his beloved brother?

319
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,800
When you were in trouble,

320
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,360
Hero dropped everything and flew out to see you.

321
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,280
He skipped school for you.

322
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,000
And now you won’t help him?

323
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,480
You don’t get to guilt-trip me on his behalf.

324
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,480
You should beg me.

325
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,280
Okay, straight up then.

326
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,200
What do I have to do for you to help Hero?

327
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,360
Sleep with me.

328
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,800
Tomorrow, I promise to save him assp.

329
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,320
When we met at the restaurant,

330
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,840
I thought you were some low-class kid.

331
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:49,160
But after I saw your clip, man, you’re so exotic.

332
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,600
I really want to make love with you.

333
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,120
Let’s have a one-night stand.

334
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,560
Hey!

335
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,800
Hey! Hey!

336
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
Hero.

337
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,480
Hero, why are you here?

338
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,680
What do you mean?

339
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,680
Hero, you’re not dead, are you?

340
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,760
Hero, tell me.

341
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,200
You were waiting for me to help you, right?

342
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,280
Hero.

343
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,200
It can’t be like this.

344
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,080
Without you, what will I do?

345
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,240
Hero.

346
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,800
Hero, I’m sorry.

347
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:13,200
I couldn’t save you. I’m sorry, Hero. I’m sorry.

348
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,080
Hero. Hero!

349
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,880
You’re delirious from a fever or what?

350
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,040
I have to save my brother so he can run away with someone like you?

351
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,160
If you hadn’t kept him locked up,

352
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,040
he wouldn’t be like this.

353
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,320
Sigh

354
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,360
Darling.

355
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,320
Let him go.

356
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,280
I understand you better than anyone.

357
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,000
You don’t want it to be like this.

358
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,480
Just let it go.

359
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,200
Our son’s life is more important than anything.

360
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,360
Who are you here to see?

361
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,880
I’m here to meet General Vorathee.

362
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,600
Please exchange your ID card.

363
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,800
Are you Mr. Seal?

364
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,640
Yes

365
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,120
The General isn’t here right now.

366
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,960
I called him, he said I could wait inside the house.

367
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,680
Okay, sir. Please go ahead.

368
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,440
Thank you.

369
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,240
Hero!

370
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,400
Are you leaving?

371
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,600
Not waiting for the General?

372
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,080
I’m not feeling well. I think I have COVID.

373
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,760
Okay, take care.

374
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,480
Saen.

375
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,320
Yes?

376
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,920
Go get him down from the attic.

377
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,600
Really?

378
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,560
Yes, really.

379
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,440
I’m not saying it again.

380
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,480
Yes, sir. Yes.

381
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,280
Hero.

382
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,680
Oh shit.

383
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,120
Hero!

384
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,400
Ow, ow!

385
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,960
Hero.

386
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,480
Hero. Hero!

387
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,680
Seal!

388
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,360
You're bleeding.

389
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,480
What happened?

390
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,720
Uncle! Uncle!

391
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,080
What happened?

392
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,680
He punched me, then ran away.

393
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,440
I made this for you too. Eat it on the way. Go, hurry up.

394
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,440
Hey...

395
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
(sigh)

396
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,640
Come on, I have two sons now, don’t I?

397
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,760
Wait, no. Three actually.

398
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,120
Okay

399
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,760
Let’s go, hurry up.

400
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
Hurry up, son. Goodbye, Dad.

401
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,680
Goodbye, sir.

402
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,960
Drive safely.

403
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,920
Take care of yourself.

404
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,560
Has your fever gone down?

405
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,720
I’m fine now.

406
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,800
Safe travels.

407
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,160
Take care.

408
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,240
Go.

409
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,440
Poppy, let bring Hero out of here.

410
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,640
Are you serious?

411
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,360
What if the General storms into our house?

412
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,640
Don’t tell me where you’re going.

413
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,120
If he doesn’t know, they won’t bother him.

414
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,400
Dad’s tougher than us.

415
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,880
You two still have a long future ahead of you.

416
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,000
I don’t want to bring dad to any trouble.

417
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,960
You both have been through enough pain.I feel it too.

418
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,200
And I love Hero like my own son.

419
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:44,840
If you don’t help Hero run away, he might die.

420
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,800
You have to help him, okay?

421
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,400
I wants to go too.

422
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,480
Tian wants to go, huh?

423
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,000
Then you have to eat lots of food, exercise, and go with your big brothers, okay?

424
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,200
Wow!

425
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,400
To make some evidence that we’ve been here.

426
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
But why are we in Mae Hong Son again?

427
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,600
We’re going up north to Pai.

428
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,880
I thought we were going to the beach!

429
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,080
(Sighs)

430
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,360
And I drove for two days. You didn’t say anything.

431
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,080
Damn it.

432
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,280
Go

433
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,480
So, where are we going?

434
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,800
The beach.

435
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,400
My name’s Pop.

436
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,600
Finally,I'm at the sea!

437
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,080
I love the sea!

438
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,560
Hey, are you confessing your love to me?

439
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,200
what

440
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,600
My name is 'Rahus' means “the sea”.

441
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,120
Are you telling me you love me?

442
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,200
Stop twisting my words! What’s that got to do with anything?

443
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,080
(Laughs)

444
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,360
Here! Here!

445
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,080
Got it, got it.

446
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,680
(Laughs)

447
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,120
Hero, hey Hero!

448
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,080
Wait, Hero!

449
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,400
No, don’t! Don’t!
