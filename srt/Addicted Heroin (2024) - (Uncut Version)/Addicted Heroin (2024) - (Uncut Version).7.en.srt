1
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
Why give me these?

2
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,480
I'll be straight with you.

3
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
Everything that happen to you, I did all of this by myself.

4
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,760
Why did you do that to me?

5
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,680
You reminded me of my stepbrother.

6
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't mind anymore, because I know you're just like me.

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,120
I don’t say this often,

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,880
but I’m sorry.

9
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,480
Who the hell are you? What does that have to do with anything?

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,520
Yeah, I hate your mom.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,760
She came into my life while I was still there. I left home

12
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,320
and told my mom I’d bring her son to live with me.

13
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,880
But you know what? I’m happy being here with you,

14
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,200
and I don’t want to drag your mom into this because it’s not your fault.

15
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,360
But what did I do wrong? Tell me, what did I do wrong?

16
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,600
(Knock on the door)

17
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,680
Pop, what’s wrong?

18
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,040
Why are you here alone?

19
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,360
Do you know how worried everyone is?

20
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,440
Why are you soaking wet?

21
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,160
I’ve been searching for you everywhere.

22
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,720
You suddenly disappeared.

23
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,200
You didn’t answer my call,

24
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,400
so I had to look for you.

25
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
How did you know I was here?

26
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,360
I called Tiger.

27
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,920
Tiger

28
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
Pop.

29
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,640
I was really worried about you.

30
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Hey, hero. I’ve found Pop.

31
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,960
He’s at this motel.

32
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,640
I talked to a cop named Sergeant Sin.

33
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,000
He said his son is friends with Pop.

34
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,120
Pop borrowed money from Tiger and then rented a room here.

35
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,760
(Knocking on the door)

36
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,480
(Thunder)

37
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,600
Pop’s in the bathroom, washing up.

38
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
You don’t need to talk.

39
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
I didn’t ask.

40
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
Do you want to come in my room?

41
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
Who was that, Pailin?

42
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,040
No one.

43
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,920
Just someone knocking on the wrong door.

44
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
I’ll dry your shoes first, okay?

45
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,040
(Door opening)

46
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,320
I’ll go grab Pailin’s clothes so you can go home.

47
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,240
I don’t think I can't go back home.

48
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,800
I’ll stay here tonight.

49
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,280
What?

50
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,080
Why? Are you not feeling well?

51
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,080
Should we go to the hospital?

52
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,560
I like it when you worry about me like this

53
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,080
But it’s fine.

54
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,000
I just want to sleep.

55
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,960
I guess I’ll go home and sleep instead.

56
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,920
Pop, are you really going to let me sleep in the hotel alone?

57
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,120
Aren’t you worried about me?

58
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,080
I guess I’ll sleep on the floor then.

59
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,000
Pop, you can sleep on the bed.

60
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,480
I’m just scared I’ll wake up and not see you.

61
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,720
Especially with a bed like this.

62
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,480
I panic, Pop.

63
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,040
Pailin, just sleep. I’ll sit here. I won’t go anywhere.

64
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,240
Why are you sleeping here, anyway?

65
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,440
I don’t want dad to see the bruises from the fight.

66
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Don’t want him to stress out.

67
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,040
You can actually cover the bruises with BB cream, you know.

68
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,320
Actually, before I called Tiger,

69
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,080
I asked Hero first, where you were.

70
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,280
He didn’t know where I was.

71
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,760
But.

72
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,120
Hero doesn’t seem to like me much.

73
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Nah, he hates me.

74
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,440
It’s just a misunderstanding.

75
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,560
Normally, you keep your emotions to yourself.

76
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,520
It’s always been me who understands you, right?

77
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,000
I’m the one who’s always reached out first.

78
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
Pop, I’m itchy.

79
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,000
Can I take my clothes off?

80
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
Pop, aren’t you cold?

81
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,080
You staying here?

82
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,080
I run hot.

83
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,440
Normally at home, I’m always fighting for the fan with him.

84
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,040
Who’s "him"?

85
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,280
Pailin. Go to sleep.

86
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,760
What about Hero?

87
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,320
Why are you asking about him?

88
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,880
Why is your face glowing?

89
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It’s nothing.

90
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,920
You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.

91
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,560
But did you know Hero is really attached to Poppy? Like they’re real siblings.

92
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,680
Siblings? He wouldn’t even accept my mom.

93
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,960
Don’t bring adults into this.

94
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,200
This is about feelings.

95
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,600
Hero gives in to Poppy in everything.

96
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,760
If he messes up sometimes, cut him some slack. If you can forgive, then forgive.

97
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,400
Be a good big brother.

98
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,040
(Phone rings)

99
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,280
Pop,

100
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,200
Hello?

101
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,480
it feels like someone’s following us...

102
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,080
(screaming)

103
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
Whoa!

104
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,840
Poppy, do you want anything to eat.

105
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,760
Oh...

106
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,560
What are you doing? Get out! Help!

107
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,680
(Scream)

108
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
Officer!

109
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,080
Pop, help me!

110
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,280
Pop

111
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
Are you okay, Pailin?

112
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
Nothing happen with you, right?

113
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,360
Pop, I was so scared.

114
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,360
I don’t know what he just did to me.

115
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,840
It’s okay now.

116
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,920
Using our tax money and still causing trouble.

117
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,080
Save your energy and go wash a general’s underwear, old man.

118
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,760
Hey!

119
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,280
(Punch sound)

120
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:38,920
(Screams)

121
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,960
We sleep together every night.

122
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,840
And you still have the nerve to go cuddle with someone else?

123
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,840
What are you doing here? Are you cuddling up with some girl?

124
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,400
What the hell is wrong with you?

125
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,440
You even sent your subordinates to hurt a girl? Are you crazy?

126
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
What girl?

127
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,280
Pailin, she’s a person too. You ordered someone to kidnap and assault her.

128
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,560
Are you a monster?

129
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,480
Whoa, you think I did that? Me?

130
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,200
Who else but someone with a buzz cut like a soldier?

131
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,840
Only soldiers or son’s general like you using a violence.

132
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,200
You think I really did that?

133
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,280
I can’t believe you’d stoop so low.

134
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,040
So you think I did it?

135
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,920
You want revenge now? Go ahead.

136
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:22,400
Where does it hurt? My cheek? Or here? Here too?

137
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,440
Don’t be sarcastic. Don’t you feel guilty at all?

138
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,280
Fine, this is the last time I’m letting you off the hook.

139
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,200
But just so you know, I’m not doing this because I’m weak.

140
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,000
It’s because I love you.

141
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,600
Take your socks.

142
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,560
And get out.

143
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,520
You don’t deserve to stay here.

144
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,400
And even if you realize that, don’t come back.

145
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,280
Don’t set foot here again.

146
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,520
I’ve prepared a gift basket for the Commander and his wife already.

147
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,920
What time should we go tomorrow?

148
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,120
"No, you don't have to go."

149
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,800
I want to greet the Lady of the House.

150
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,440
Maybe I can get involved in the Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters Wive's Association.

151
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,720
I told you, if you have something to do, go do it.

152
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,520
I’ll be coming back late today, so you don’t need to wait.

153
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,040
(Sighs)

154
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,600
Oh, Hero.

155
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,640
Did you hear Poppy is going abroad with  her girlfriend?

156
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
You two were so close.

157
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
It must be lonely without him.

158
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,520
Good.

159
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,040
Then we’ll move back in together. Cozy, right?

160
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,520
Where he goes is his business. Where I stay is mine.

161
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,240
And this place is boiling hot.

162
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,360
So, have you eaten yet? If not, tell me. I’ll cook for you.

163
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:13,320
(Singing)

164
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,600
Whoa! I’m drunk.

165
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,440
Good thing I’ve got you guys.

166
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,920
Yeah, see? I’m singing with you right now.

167
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,960
Do you love me?

168
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,920
Of course, man.

169
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,360
You’re the best.

170
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,000
Why don’t you love me?

171
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,680
What?
I’ll just make you my wife then, Hey, come here!

172
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,720
Oh, Pop! Let’s go, Pop!

173
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,760
Who are you with?

174
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:48,800
I’m with Pailin. Pop’s friend.

175
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,200
Hey, doesn’t seem like just a friend.

176
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:06,960
What kind of friend locks arms like that?

177
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,240
Don’t be scared. We’re just here to eat together.

178
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,800
Pop, you’re still the same. Grilling the first piece for me.

179
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,600
You check to see if the pork is fully cooked first.

180
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,640
Then you grill the second piece for me to eat.

181
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
What the hell are you doing?

182
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,040
pork is fully cooked

183
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
You got it, right?

184
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,800
Almost.

185
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,840
I told you I should be the one on top to grab it.

186
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,040
I’m better up here. I’m more skilled.

187
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,840
Almost got it!

188
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,080
Hurry up!

189
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,440
Oh, damn! Wait!

190
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,480
You’re stepping on my face, you jerk!

191
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Hold still!

192
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,040
I am! You’re just heavy!

193
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,800
We can't accept it. I've told you before.

194
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,960
You said don’t buy unnecessary things, but this is necessary

195
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,520
I know it's necessary, but I want to try to get it on my own.

196
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:23,280
Hey, I want to go to the Songkran festival. Can you take me? Please?

197
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,760
When are you going back to school, Pailin?

198
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,240
When you go with me.

199
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,520
I won’t go.

200
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,400
If you don't go, I won't go.

201
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,880
I gave up everything for you, Pop.

202
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Pop.

203
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,280
I just went through something bad.

204
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,320
I don't want to be alone.

205
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,880
Can't you stay with me?

206
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Please.

207
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,640
What did the police say about it?

208
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,000
The police...

209
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,240
they’re still working on it, you know how slow they are.

210
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,600
But never mind, Pop, come study Chinese with me. I’ve already asked your mom.

211
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Whose mom?

212
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,480
Pop's mom, of course.

213
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,680
Hello, Tiger. Is your dad home? I’m coming over.

214
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,600
So, last month, Pailin got attacked.

215
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,240
(Motorcycle sound)

216
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,840
No, no, no, Pailin’s okay, but I still have some doubts.

217
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,240
Oh, hey...

218
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,640
Whoa, whoa!

219
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,880
Are you covering my head with a black bag again?

220
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,080
Hey Hero, I know it’s you.

221
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,480
You promised you wouldn’t do this again.

222
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,400
Me?

223
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,240
Again?

224
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,840
I’m the bad guy, right?

225
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Am I wrong again?

226
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,520
I’m just trying to find the truth.

227
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,160
I was about to trust you.

228
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,680
You?

229
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,000
Trust me?

230
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,200
But you did this.

231
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,040
You grabbed me like this. You make me doubt.

232
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,160
Pop.

233
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,920
I admit I screwed up.

234
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,400
Whatever I did wrong

235
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,440
I always admit.

236
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:14,960
but whatever I didn’t do, I won’t admit.

237
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,760
I know.

238
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,520
I should trust you more.

239
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,560
Do you really trust me?

240
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,360
Are you sure?

241
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,040
Fine.

242
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,120
Come here, quick.

243
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,000
(Scream)

244
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,880
Hero, why did you grab Pailin?

245
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,560
I’m making you see the truth.

246
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,640
She is a backstabber.

247
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,440
Do you want some evidence? Watch this!

248
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
We were hired by Miss Pailin to act this out.

249
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,440
She told us to make her boyfriend come save her.

250
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,560
She just wanted to prove true love. What's the harm in that?

251
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,080
Pop. I’m so afraid

252
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,000
Now, you know? She turns out to be a snake.

253
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,960
Look at what you’ve done.

254
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,320
Shocked? You shouldn’t be.

255
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,640
And do you know who you’re messing with?

256
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,720
Next time, be careful who you play with.

257
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,760
Hero...

258
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,680
Have you seen the truth yet?

259
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,600
Even if you leave me, I won’t let you be with this snake.

260
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,560
She’s no good, unworthy of you.

261
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,720
Stop it

262
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,240
Hero. That’s enough.

263
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,360
Are you still defending her? Really?

264
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,240
This one?

265
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,840
I told you to let go. You won’t stop?

266
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,720
Why should I stop? For someone like her?

267
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,320
(Trembling)

268
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,480
After what she did to you...

269
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,320
(Trembling)

270
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,680
Pop...

271
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,360
Pop...
Scream

272
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,600
Pop...

273
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,720
Pop

274
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
Dad.

275
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,640
I need to use the bathroom.

276
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,640
I sent Pailin home.

277
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:14,880
After that, whatever you want me to do, I’ll do it.

278
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,120
You can punish me as much as you want.

279
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,480
Seeing you hurt, it kills me. You know that?

280
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,480
I’m not here to make up with you.

281
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,960
I know I’m probably a villain in your eyes now.

282
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,800
I just want to take responsibility.

283
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
From now on.

284
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,480
I’ll be your whole world.

285
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,040
And the love I have for you?

286
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,600
And the love I have for you? It’ll never be divided.

287
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,560
I once promised you.

288
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,720
I’d do everything your dad did.

289
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,480
But I failed.

290
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,600
I told Sergeant Silp to drop the case.

291
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,360
Pop, you’ve been suspicious of me for a while now.

292
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,560
Don’t worry. I’m not mad at Pailin.

293
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:05,040
Thanks for wanting me to continue studying, but I’m not going.

294
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,120
It's not fair to me.

295
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,760
I have everything people envy.

296
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,480
But there’s just one thing I don’t have.

297
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,880
it’s you, Pop.

298
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,040
When I was in China

299
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,920
I couldn’t focus because I kept thinking.

300
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,640
Why did you leave me?

301
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,960
We’re on different levels, Pailin.

302
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,880
You’re from a wealthy family.

303
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,720
I’m just a laborer’s kid.

304
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,000
Our paths are truly different.

305
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,080
But Hero is rich too, right?

306
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,800
His dad’s a general, his grandpa a minister.

307
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,240
He is rich too, right?

308
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,560
He is rich too, right?
This isn’t about him.

309
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,160
Or is it because I’m a woman?

310
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,200
Is it strange that a woman’s superior to a man?

311
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
But when it’s the other way around, it’s not?

312
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,160
It’s not about gender, Pailin.

313
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,080
I’m sorry if this sounds stupid.

314
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,000
But what makes me feel justified is that you staged everything.

315
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,640
I thought you weren’t mad.

316
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
Turns out you despise me.

317
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,320
I’m not mad at you, Pailin.

318
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,800
I’m mad at myself.

319
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,920
I’m mad at myself for being the reason you did something dirty.

320
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,760
When I wanted you to be in a good place, to experience only good things.

321
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,160
But you keep doing things that are bad.

322
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,480
So what?

323
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,640
So what? I told you, I love you, Pop.

324
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,760
I love you too, Pailin.

325
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
Just as a friend now.

326
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,680
Whatever good I wished for you.

327
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,200
I still wish it.

328
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,360
Please go back to school for your future.

329
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,720
Fine.

330
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,920
But the things I gave you.

331
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,120
I’m not taking them back.

332
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,040
That includes my feelings too.

333
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,440
Why didn’t Hero come?

334
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,600
He must want to hang out with young people.

335
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,520
Staying with the elderly must be boring.

336
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,080
Mom, with so many family members around, aren’t you cold?

337
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,880
Let me pour a big splash of water for you.

338
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,680
I wish you a lot of happiness, Mom. Stay healthy.

339
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,600
(Laughter)

340
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,000
Can little Tian spray you with water?

341
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,360
No, little Tian. Where did you get this water gun?

342
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,000
Big brother Hero bought it for me.

343
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,520
Hmm...

344
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,800
He buys water guns for the kids but doesn’t visit grandma.

345
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,240
Hero, is that you?

346
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,000
Are you pouring water on elders for blessings? Am I interluding?

347
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,200
No, come join us in pouring water on on mom for blessings?

348
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,840
You can pour water after Aunt Han.

349
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,240
Mom, Happy New Year!

350
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,440
Happy New Year, dear.

351
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Mom, I bought you lots of gifts.

352
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,680
They’re from abroad. I’m so happy you like them.

353
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,480
I do, dear.

354
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Let me pour water to you, mom.

355
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,360
Mom, please bless Poppy to study abroad.

356
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,880
Abroad?

357
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
Yes.

358
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,400
I'm not going aboard.

359
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,800
Stop meddling, mom. It’s annoying.

360
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,560
Poppy, talk to your mom properly.

361
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,040
My child wouldn’t talk to me like this if you hadn’t turned him against me.

362
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,960
Don’t you talk about Pop’s dad like that.

363
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,440
And don’t meddle with Pop’s family.

364
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,640
Poppy, don’t say that.

365
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,960
Dad...

366
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,160
She’s still your mother.

367
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,600
Family ties can’t be broken. Understand?

368
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,200
Pop...

369
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,080
Poppy... Poppy, my child.

370
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,880
Pop...

371
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,600
How could you deal with Pailin behind my back?

372
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,720
Whatever, Pop. Just go abroad with your girlfriend, and it’s over.

373
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,640
You chose the wrong person.

374
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,200
She’s not my girlfriend.

375
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,560
I want to stay away from her.

376
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,840
Why?

377
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,400
Pailin’s beautiful, rich,

378
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,120
And talented. Why not her?

379
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,840
Because she’s rich.

380
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,960
And I’m poor.

381
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,560
No one’s poor for being ambitious.

382
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,640
Like you?

383
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,640
Exactly.

384
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,000
I admire your ambition.

385
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,840
Poppy.

386
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,600
Everything I did was for your own good.

387
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Someone like me, if I want to study abroad, I’ll find a way myself.

388
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,680
You can’t be as carefree as Hero.

389
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,760
Even if Mr. Vor said you’re equal to Hero

390
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,920
Who loves another child more than his own.

391
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,240
I don’t want you to feel inferior if one day you see Hero more successful.

392
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,000
Do you really think like that, Mom?

393
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,240
Yes.

394
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,280
I want to be with my mom, but she’s no longer here.

395
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,680
It doesn't make the fact that you bullied me any more sympathetic.

396
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,840
How could you think like that about your husband and his child?

397
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,160
Be ambitious, but have limits.

398
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,800
Don’t impose your rotten thoughts on others.

399
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,400
I’m your mother!

400
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,520
I’m embarrassed to have a mom like you.

401
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:22,240
And I pity Hero for having a stepmom like you.

402
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,480
Isn’t taking Hero’s dad enough?

403
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,200
What more do you want from Hero?

404
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,000
Pop, I’ll give you anything.

405
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,040
But one thing I won’t tolerate is if you start having feelings for someone else.

406
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,720
I haven’t broken up with her. I miss her. I’ve never forgotten her.

407
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,280
I had her come here so I could be with her all the time

408
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,680
Not apart for a single second.

409
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,080
I once promised you.

410
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,240
I’d do everything your dad did.

411
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,920
But I failed.

412
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:23,080
(Message sound)

413
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:31,320
My dad bought family shirts for Songkran's day. I brought one for you, too.

414
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:37,720
(Message sound)

415
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,800
Grandma’s asking about you.

416
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,080
(Message sound)

417
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,440
Little Tian wants to play water guns with you.

418
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,640
(Message sound)

419
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,720
For Songkran festival, we’ve got to have some barbecue!

420
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,800
(Message sound)

421
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,720
If Songkran ends and you splash me, I’ll be mad.

422
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,240
(Message sound)

423
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,280
Hero, are you sick?

424
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,400
I’m not mad at what you did.

425
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,680
I understand.

426
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,560
I'm sorry.

427
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,280
this is the last time I’m letting you off the hook.

428
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,080
But just so you know, I’m not doing this because I’m weak.

429
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,880
And get out.

430
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,840
You don’t deserve to stay here.

431
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,440
And even if you realize that, don’t come back.

432
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,320
Don’t set foot here again.
