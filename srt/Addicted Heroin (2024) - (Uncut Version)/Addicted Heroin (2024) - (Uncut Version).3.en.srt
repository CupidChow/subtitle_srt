1
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,680
What the hell are you doing here? This isn’t your place. Get out.

2
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:21,240
How am I supposed to get money to stay alive if I leave? I'm here working just like everyone else.

3
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,760
Don’t you have anything else to do?

4
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,920
You are my idol, remember?

5
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,000
Just don’t cause any trouble, I don’t want to get into a mess.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,480
What trouble? There’s none.

7
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,240
Hey, bro, your shoes are dirty as hell. You can’t come in like that; my friend just mopped the floor.

8
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
What the…?

9
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,560
Are you crazy? How can you say that?

10
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,320
Sorry, Sir

11
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,880
Why are you sorry?

12
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,640
And now you’re mopping it again? Forget it, no need to mop.

13
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
Is that a new bike?

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
Hmm.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,080
I thought you didn’t have any money?

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,360
It’s second-hand.

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Hop on,

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
I’ll give you a ride.

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,960
No need. The local bus will be here at 5 a.m.

20
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,720
Why wait for the local bus when we’re going the same way?

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,960
Come on

22
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,920
hop on.

23
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,800
It’s alright.

24
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,360
Come on, man.

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,120
Here, take your bag and get on.

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
Just ride carefully, alright?

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,800
Hold on tight. Are you holding on?

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,720
Alright, let’s go.

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,640
Ride carefully, man.

30
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,600
Watch the road. The road’s terrible. Blame the people who built it.

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,720
Why are you blaming them?

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,480
Are you nuts? They work late into the night and get paid peanuts.

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,400
It’s those overloaded trucks that mess up the road.

34
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,520
Why are you so angry?

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,880
Is your dad the one who built the road?

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,640
Just look at the road, man.

37
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,160
Whatever.

38
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,520
Here, here, stop

39
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:40,840
Is this it?

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,280
stop, stop.

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
I shouldn’t have come with you.

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,280
If I took the bus, I would’ve been home by now.

43
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,480
Oh, not even a word of thanks?

44
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,640
Isn’t this on the way to your place? Where’s your house?

45
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Uh… there, right there.

46
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,520
It’s just over there.

47
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,920
Then what are you waiting for? Go on.

48
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,000
You should head back before my dad comes.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
It’ll be trouble, serious trouble.

50
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Go into the house before you go.

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,320
It’s no problem. You head back first. Your house is just here, right?

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,680
Ah, hmm.

53
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,320
Go on, get back home.

54
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,120
Umm.

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,640
Alright, fine.

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,440
Ah,hmm.

57
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Come here,Where have you been all night?

58
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Why are you coming back in the morning?

59
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
I let you stay here, and this is how you behave?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,520
You can’t just go wherever you want.

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Well, my aunt went to sue him, so I had to save up and save on accommodation costs.

62
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,520
So, where did you go?

63
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,320
Hey!

64
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,040
Were you out street racing? Doing drugs? Throwing rocks?

65
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Oh, come on, Auntie. You always think the worst of me.

66
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,240
I was working at a convenience store.

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,320
If you don’t believe me, ask Lersil.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,720
Oh!

69
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,720
if you were with Lersil, then I can trust you.

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,280
Double standards, much?

71
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,640
I didn’t hear your motorbike.

72
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,640
I rode my new bike.

73
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Huh?

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,400
And where did you get the money for that?

75
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,520
Here.

76
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,880
Auntie? Do you see anything?

77
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
No, I don’t see anything.

78
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Exactly.

79
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,120
I sold my watch. In the countryside,

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,360
selling one watch can keep you going for a year.

81
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,240
Someone who spends money like you? Are you sure?

82
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,840
I’m sure. I’ve changed my lifestyle.

83
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,320
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to get some sleep before my night shift.

84
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,440
Wait, I’m not done talking to you! Hey, come back!

85
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,160
Hey, Aunt Jeab! How are you?

86
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,280
Hello, Pop!

87
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,480
What are you eating?

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,800
I’ll have the same.

89
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,040
You can’t even decide what to eat on your own?

90
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,880
Hey, don’t forget—you’re my idol.

91
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,560
If you choose a place, that means it’s the best place.

92
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,120
So, what are you and your friend eating today?

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,240
I’ll have the usual.

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I’ll have what Pop’s having.

95
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,680
Hey, take your shirt back. I washed it for you.

96
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
You brought it with you?

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Were you waiting to run into me or something?

98
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,520
Seriously? It smells good.

99
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Hey, Pop, take me shopping for a shirt.

100
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,760
What, if you buy a shirt, you can't buy it yourself.

101
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
If we go in a group, we can get a better price.

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,960
I’m short on cash right now.

103
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,080
Here, Pop.

104
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,440
Thank you!

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,520
This is for you.

106
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
Hero!

107
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,800
I remember, Hero.

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,040
Yes,Thank you!

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,200
Thank you too!

110
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,760
Mom

111
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,760
that guy’s name is Hero.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,760
How cute.

113
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
Delicious.

114
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,120
Umm.

115
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Why did you eat my pastry?

116
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,080
Well, you don’t eat the pastry, right? You just eat the filling.

117
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,320
Who told you that? I eat the filling first, then I eat the pastry.

118
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,600
Why?

119
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,480
It’s just how I like it.

120
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,960
Now stop and give me my pastry back.

121
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
Bring it.

122
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,640
I’ll keep the pastry

123
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,760
Hey, move over

124
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,760
Hey, Hey

125
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Parking right here.

126
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
This is it?

127
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,400
Yeah, stop here.

128
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,680
Excuse me

129
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,640
can I get this shirt along with the one on display for 69 baht?

130
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
The sign says no bargaining!

131
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,960
I’m not bargaining.

132
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,920
I’m asking for a freebie.

133
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,000
I’ve seen that shirt on display for a while, and no one’s bought it.

134
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,520
How about throwing it in with my purchase?

135
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,040
Alright, fine. But you better come back and buy more next time.

136
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,760
Deal!

137
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,880
How was it?

138
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
See? That wasn’t hard.

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,320
Take a look, everything’s available.

140
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,120
How much is this one?

141
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,600
899 baht.

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,080
899 baht? Umm.

143
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,840
How about I pay the price you bought it for?

144
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
899 baht for two shirts.

145
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,680
Are you crazy? Each one is 899 baht.

146
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,880
That’s a tourist price! I’m Thai; why don’t you give me the local price?

147
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,160
Hey, kid! Are you buying or robbing me?

148
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,120
There's no one better than your mom, Get out!

149
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,960
I’m a customer, you know!

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,880
You're dead meat.

151
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,360
Serves you right.

152
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,120
Let’s go.

153
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,960
Why?

154
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,160
Yeah, let’s go.

155
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,920
Which way? How much further?

156
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,960
Just straight ahead, then turn left at that tree.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
Then turn right into the canal?

158
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,320
No, no, turn left, not right.

159
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,920
Okay.

160
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,960
Is that even possible?

161
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,200
Yeah, I’ve done it before.

162
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,240
Have you ever fished with a can before?

163
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,320
Quiet, I’m getting annoyed. I can’t catch anything like this.

164
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,080
What,

165
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,880
is the fish going to get annoyed and not bite the bait?

166
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,960
I’m the one getting annoyed!

167
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,960
Oh.

168
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
Hey.

169
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,760
it’s coming, it’s coming!

170
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,640
Hello?

171
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,720
Lala?

172
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,000
Huh? What? I can’t hear you, bad signal.

173
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
You never call me anymore.

174
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,360
I’ve been busy.

175
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,480
Do you have someone else?"

176
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Who would I have? You’re imagining things.

177
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,920
I can’t help it. You’re far away, and it feels like your heart is too.

178
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,560
Did you get that line from Facebook?

179
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
I’ll come see you.

180
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,840
By yourself?

181
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
No way, are you crazy?

182
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,840
Okay, talk later.

183
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Pop, I’m back! Hey, Pop!

184
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,360
Pop! I’m here!

185
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,080
Shh!

186
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,760
Keep it down.

187
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,440
Okay, I’ll be quiet.

188
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,560
Wow, you caught a lot!

189
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,520
Shhh!

190
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,920
Nice job!

191
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,280
What should I do?

192
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,200
I’m not in the mood anymore.

193
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,200
Why?

194
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,320
Sorry, I’ll catch something for you.

195
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,640
Or I’ll jump in and grab one for you myself, just watch.

196
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,480
Idiot

197
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,960
you’re going to jump in the water to catch a fish?

198
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,480
Hey, I got it!

199
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,240
Hey, It’s squirming!

200
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,400
Hey, Pop, I’m stuck in the mud! I can’t move!

201
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,080
I’m stuck in the mud! I can’t move!

202
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey.

203
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,200
I can’t move at all!

204
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,080
Are you playing around?

205
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,360
This isn’t funny.

206
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
I’m not kidding! Help me! Right Now!

207
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,360
Hey, hey, wait!

208
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,040
Hey!

209
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,600
Now!

210
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,720
Hey!

211
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,040
What are you doing?

212
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,000
Come on!

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,720
Ow!

214
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,880
What’s wrong?

215
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,840
Messing with me?

216
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,760
Ow! Wait!

217
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,280
Did you go fishing or throw a net? Why are you soaking wet?

218
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,000
He jumped in to catch a fish, Dad.

219
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,800
And you?

220
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,960
Well, I thought he was going to drown, so I jumped in to save him.

221
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,320
Wow.

222
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,280
I really want to take a shower now.

223
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,880
Well, hurry up and go home then.

224
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,720
Wait,

225
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,880
let him stay and eat with us first.

226
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,200
Pop, why don’t you take your friend to wash up at the water jar in the back?

227
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,960
Sure, Poppy!

228
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,720
That’s a family nickname, man. You better get home quick.

229
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
Thank you.

230
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,440
And with all that mud on you, you’re going to get pimples. Here, take some ointment.

231
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,560
Dad, this is foot fungus cream.

232
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,240
It’s useful for more than just feet, you know. It can treat ringworm

233
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,120
, itchy fingers and toes, and even fungal infections on the scalp.

234
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,760
But it doesn’t cure acne, Dad! Stop trying to fool me.

235
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,800
This family is so entertaining, I love it.

236
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,120
If you love it so much, stay and eat with us. Dad doesn’t have to build the road tonight.

237
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,600
Build on the road?

238
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,120
Ride carefully, man.

239
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,640
Watch the road. The road’s terrible. Blame the people who built it.

240
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you nuts? They work late into the night and get paid peanuts.

241
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,320
oh

242
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Tonight, invite Aunt Jeab over for dinner.

243
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,880
I know Pop doesn’t like my cooking.

244
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,440
"Sure, let’s go. No need to go to the store today.

245
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
Which store?

246
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,880
Come on, let’s go take a shower.

247
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,960
Why are you not taking of your pants? Are you insecure or something?

248
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,760
I’m not insecure; I just don’t like showing off my privates.

249
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,760
Are you crazy? My grandma’s here!

250
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Put on  your underwear.

251
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,160
How am I supposed to shower with underwear? You’re the weird one.

252
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Go put on some proper pants.

253
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
Let’s eat!

254
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Ahhhh...

255
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,640
My name’s Hero, by the way. No need to raise your voice.

256
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,640
Let's eat fish, Grandma.

257
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,240
So, where do you live, son?

258
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,960
Oh, my house is over there,

259
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,120
around that area.

260
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,360
But last time you said it was that way.

261
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,480
Yeah, something like that. Let's eat.

262
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,840
Here’s some eggs.

263
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,880
Whose kid are you?

264
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,800
Grandma’s.

265
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,120
You wouldn’t know them.

266
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,800
This town is small; everyone knows each other.

267
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,000
I live with my aunt, just the two of us. She’s just an ordinary government employee

268
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,160
not in a high-ranking position.

269
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,640
And where are your parents?

270
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,200
Grandma.

271
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,040
My mom’s no longer around, and my dad remarried.

272
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,120
Granma, let’s not talk about this.

273
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,680
Sweetie, your mom is looking after you from heaven.

274
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,960
When I was a kid, I was close to my grandma.

275
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,600
She was great at sewing, and she even made me a security blanket

276
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,600
That’s how it should be. Store-bought items can't compare to homemade one

277
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,800
right? I miss sewing too, you know.

278
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
You can’t even thread a needle anymore, can you?

279
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,160
Grandma, you should eat more vegetables to keep your eyes sharp so you can get back to sewing.

280
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,640
Hmm.

281
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,080
Poppy, you should eat more veggies too, to keep your eyes sharp.

282
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,160
I don’t like morning glory, Grandma. It smells weird.

283
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,560
Don’t like vegetables? You’ll ruin your eyesight.

284
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Yeah, right. Look at the fish you gave me

285
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,720
it’s full of bones.

286
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
I’m going to need sticky rice to help push it down.

287
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,320
Why sticky rice?

288
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
It helps push the bones down, you know. It’s an old trick.

289
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,720
Oh, rural wisdom. This will be a long night.

290
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,480
So, how far is your house? You want to stay over?

291
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,840
Uhh.

292
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,280
Really?

293
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,000
Don’t impose; let him go home.

294
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,200
Actually, it’s quite far, I can stay...

295
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,000
Well.

296
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,800
I should get going home

297
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,480
Yeah, I’ve got to go. I’ve got something to do tomorrow.

298
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,080
What are you doing? Aren’t you going to have lunch?

299
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,320
Working to earn a scholarship.

300
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,440
Ooh!

301
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,840
Adults should just give out scholarships. Why make students work for it?

302
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,160
Can I skip this?

303
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,120
I brought you some sticky rice. Want some?

304
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,720
No, I don’t want to get my hands dirty.

305
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,320
I’ll feed you.

306
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
No need, that’s messy.

307
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
A bit messy but delicious

308
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,680
No, I’ll eat by myself. Go on.

309
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,840
Come on, just have a bite. I’m feeding you.

310
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,160
No, you eat it.

311
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,120
New Caption

312
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,920
I’ll get messy.

313
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,200
That’s why I’m feeding you.

314
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,280
No, and how did you even bring that in here? This is the teacher’s lounge.

315
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,200
You’re not supposed to eat in here?

316
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,440
Yeah, exactly.

317
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,120
Oh, man.

318
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,800
Aum Aum Aum

319
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,480
No, I’m good.

320
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,160
What are you doing? That’s so slow.

321
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,400
You need to use a template, so you don’t have to keep looking for fonts.

322
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,640
Here, I’ll show you.

323
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,200
Why didn’t you say so earlier?

324
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,200
That’s not a roller; that’s my finger!

325
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,440
Oh!

326
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,600
Are you guys done?

327
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,680
Hey, you, what are you doing here?

328
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,960
Waiting for my friend.

329
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,280
Wait outside. This is the teacher’s lounge, not the student lounge. Go.

330
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,760
Teacher, Pop and I are like sticky rice—meant to be together.

331
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,400
Did you bring food into the teacher’s lounge?

332
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,320
Rahus, get out now! Go, go, go!

333
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm sorry.

334
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Go, go, go!

335
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,240
Are you done yet? Stop grinning.

336
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,760
At first, it looked like they were going to fight, but now they’re friends.

337
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,560
It’s pretty cute

338
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,200
Want me to read your fortune? I’m good at it.

339
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,440
Don’t you want to know what’s coming?

340
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,280
It might help you plan better.

341
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,840
I don’t believe in fortunes.

342
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,000
It’s just a silly thing for people who can’t make their own decisions.

343
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:59,120
Harsh. Come on, let me do it. I’m bored.

344
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:08,560
Your first soulmate won’t be real, but the next one might be.

345
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:21,200
I’ve talked to a few people, but if you’re talking about straight guys, it’s just you.

346
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,800
This stuff is sensitive; I can’t talk to just anyone about it.

347
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,800
And you think you’re the next one?

348
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,280
Let go!

349
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
Crazy!

350
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Teacher! Someone just came into the school and slapped me!

351
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,960
Stop right there! What’s going on?

352
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,640
Some crazy person came in and slapped me

353
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,480
dressed all weird. I don’t even know who they are, teacher.

354
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
Here, Pop, this is for you.

355
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,120
But if anyone tries to hit on Hero, let me know right away.

356
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,120
Isn’t that a bit much, Lala?

357
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,640
You know you’re getting me sent to the principal’s office again, right?

358
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,520
Again?

359
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,640
For what? Don’t tell me it’s about a girl.

360
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,160
Don’t be so jealous.

361
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,960
If I wasn’t jealous, you wouldn’t know I love you.

362
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,400
And you like it, don’t you? Admit it.

363
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200
How did you get here?

364
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,920
Aren’t you supposed to be in class?

365
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,680
I skipped college for you. Aren’t you happy?

366
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
What were you thinking?

367
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,400
What!

368
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,960
Here, Pop, chicken feet.

369
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,680
I want chicken feet too!

370
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,040
Eat a lot.

371
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,000
Just now, you said you wanted chicken feet. Why didn’t you scoop?

372
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,280
Are you biased?

373
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,320
I haven’t even taken a bite yet.

374
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,440
Hey, I picked it for you. Just eat it.

375
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,600
I finished scooping it myself.

376
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,320
Didn’t get any chicken feet.

377
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,920
Pop, are you full? Want more?

378
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,480
I’m good. I’ve had a lot.

379
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,240
And you?

380
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,520
Why do you care?

381
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,240
Guys are all the same; when they’re with their friends, they forget their girlfriends.

382
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,640
Guess I’ll head out then.

383
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,080
Hey, I’ll send you home.

384
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,720
The bike only fits two people.

385
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,000
Why’d you bring me to this cheap motel?

386
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,360
Because you’re under 18.

387
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,400
No normal hotel allow anyone under 18 check-in.

388
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you going to sleep with me?

389
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,560
No, I’m going to stay at my aunt’s house.

390
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,960
Why don’t you take me to your aunt’s then?

391
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,320
What, you want me to tell her I brought a girl home?

392
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,240
That won’t fly. Just go to sleep.

393
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,000
Hey!

394
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,880
What’s the secret?

395
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,560
It’s not right.Hey.

396
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
Why are you writing in that notebook?

397
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
I’m practicing my handwriting.

398
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,320
change handwriting

399
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,960
Your handwriting’s fine. I had a fortune teller read it; they said you’d be rich.

400
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,880
I don’t believe it.

401
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,520
Who’s handwriting are you copying?

402
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,600
Pop.

403
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,120
Pop?

404
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,320
Yeah.

405
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,000
Pop again? You guys are close.

406
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,840
So why do you keep him a secret that you’re from a wealthy family?

407
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,160
It’s because my grandpa and dad aren’t well-liked.

408
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,600
you keeping the secret about your family because

409
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,520
because you’re afraid Pop might try to take advantage of you?

410
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,400
Watch your mouth.

411
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,240
worried Pop might compare himself and get jealous.

412
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,360
Pop’s not that weak.

413
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,440
Pop doesn’t want to be friends with rich people.

414
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,320
Look, it’s important, okay? I’ll keep it a secret,

415
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,280
but you have to take me out and sleep over tonight.

416
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,840
Can’t do that.

417
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,600
Consider it an exchange, okay?

418
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,600
Where’s the new guy, Pop?

419
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,680
Uhhhh.

420
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:53,000
I knew it. I told him over and over, ‘Don’t quit for three months,

421
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,800
and he just disappears after a few days. He was never serious about the job with that attitude."

422
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,840
Do you think Pop makes moan during sex, you know?

423
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,200
Are you out of your mind? Did someone put a black spell on you?

424
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,960
Huh?

425
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,440
Sleep.

426
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:54,040
Hey, I think you should buy this for me. What do you think? Should I get it?

427
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,640
How much is it?

428
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,960
Excuse me, how much?

429
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,760
This one is 4,990 baht.

430
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,000
Can I get it for 490 baht? Buy one, get one free?

431
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
This shirt has spiritual significance.

432
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,400
If you wear it, it might bring you luck.

433
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,560
No, I don’t have the money.

434
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Come back another time then.

435
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,600
What’s with you?

436
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,600
You’ve changed. You used to spend 10,000 baht like it was nothing

437
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,280
and now you won’t even spend 490?

438
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,600
I can’t keep using my credit card and having my parents pay the bill.

439
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,360
I need to change my lifestyle, understand?

440
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,200
No need to get angry. I can buy it for you.

441
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,360
You think I’d let you pay when you’re still asking your parents for money? Are you crazy?

442
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,800
No need to be so harsh.

443
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,560
Or is it because you’ve found someone else and don’t want my gifts anymore?

444
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
Trying to fade out?

445
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,080
Stop being so jealous.

446
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,720
You’re being ridiculous. And it’s hot.

447
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,840
490?

448
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,800
Hey!

449
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,840
Let me help.

450
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,120
Oh, sorry I didn’t help yesterday.

451
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,720
Can you not be annoying?

452
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,440
Better without you, less of a nuisance.

453
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,120
Are you mad at me or something?

454
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,040
No.

455
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,920
What’s there to be mad about?

456
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,080
I didn’t do anything wrong, did I?

457
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,640
You’re always joking around, not going to school, and skipping work.

458
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,200
There it is—you’re mad about that.

459
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,800
No.

460
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,040
How about some juice to cool down?

461
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,760
Tasty.

462
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,320
Good, huh?

463
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,640
Focus on your work.

464
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,200
Wait, you’re taking it with you?

465
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,600
Sure, why not?

466
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,600
The moon is yellow, like crap.

467
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
Stop it.

468
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,320
Moon cake

469
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,040
Mid-Autumn Festival is coming, and the moon is getting ready.

470
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,720
The moon isn’t you; it doesn’t try to hog the spotlight.

471
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,640
From now on, when you see the moon, you’ll think of me.

472
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,560
When I think of you, I think of an eclipse, Rahu swallowing the moon.

473
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,560
Big enough to swallow... ?

474
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
Disgusting.

475
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:29,160
I was talking about mooncakes. What flavor do you like?

476
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:37,760
I don't know. Never had one, they’re too expensive.

477
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,080
If you could, what filling would you want?

478
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,080
Curry chicken.

479
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,520
Got it, I’ll get you one.

480
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,760
Hero

481
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,800
I’m on my way to school. I don’t have time to argue.

482
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,120
I’m calling to apologize. I still love you, you know.

483
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,360
I’m sorry too for raising my voice. I’ve just been stressed.

484
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,240
I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress lately.

485
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:48,840
I get it. I’m dealing with a lot too. Can you come see me today?

486
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,840
But I’m headed to school.

487
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:00,760
I’m really down, Hero. Can’t you come see me?

488
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,680
Fine, I’ll change and come over.

489
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,560
Dick

490
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,640
When are you coming?

491
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,000
Dude, my girlfriend is almost here.

492
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,720
When she arrives,

493
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,880
you should just kiss her, okay?

494
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,200
Alright, alright.

495
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,960
So, is she here yet? Is my girlfriend here yet?

496
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,160
Where is she?

497
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,240
Do it, do it now!

498
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,920
Hey! What the hell are you doing to my girlfriend?

499
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,000
Huh? What the hell are you doing?

500
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,720
Wait, calm down! Just chill.

501
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,120
How could you kiss him?

502
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800
Are you seeing him behind my back?

503
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,880
We haven’t even broken up yet!

504
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,640
Why would you do this?

505
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,960
Seeing each other?

506
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,720
Seriously? I didn’t even feel like that.

507
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,000
If that’s how you feel, then let’s just break up.

508
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,320
Fine?

509
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,960
I’m sorry,

510
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,640
it was just a joke.

511
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,800
She’s not even a real girl; she’s a trans friend of mine.

512
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,520
Yeah, it was all just a setup to prank him.

513
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,640
See? I wasn’t cheating on you.

514
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,400
You’re treating me like I’m some kind of fool.

515
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,080
What’s your problem?

516
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,120
I just wanted your attention.

517
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,200
I hate how you give more importance to that country bumpkin friend of yours than to me.

518
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,480
If you keep acting like this, there won’t be any trust left.

519
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,480
Don’t act all righteous. Didn’t you lie to your friends about being poor, Hero?

520
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,280
What does that have to do with anything?

521
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,880
Yeah, nothing at all, right?

522
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,120
Because Hero’s never wrong.

523
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,280
Fine, it’s my fault.

524
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,560
It’s always my fault.

525
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,160
Hero,

526
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:55,320
I’m asking you one last time—do you still love me?

527
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,320
Of course I do.

528
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,360
Why do you think I rushed over?

529
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,880
You’re my first girlfriend.

530
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,280
You made me feel like someone actually cared about me,

531
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,360
and you helped me through so much.

532
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,800
But if we keep going like this,

533
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,280
I’m just going to hate you more.

534
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Let’s end it here. Let’s end it now.

535
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,000
Hero!

536
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,160
Ouch!

537
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,560
Here, take this and put it on yourself.

538
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,760
Ouch,

539
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,200
you’re being rough.

540
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,600
Here we go again.

541
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,760
I wanted to bring you this mooncake,

542
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,720
and you have to eat it tonight, under the moonlight, to get the vibe.

543
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,520
Want to eat it now?

544
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,680
It’s got a chicken curry puff filling too.

545
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,520
Is there really such a thing?

546
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,240
I had it made special.

547
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,520
Should we eat it now?

548
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,320
It’s pretty good. I’ve never seen such a big mooncake before.

549
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,120
Eating mooncake under the moonlight—doesn’t it feel great?

550
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,280
It’s raining so hard, I can’t even see the moon.

551
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,480
If you keep acting like this, there won’t be any trust left.

552
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,880
Don’t act all righteous. Didn’t you lie to your friends about being poor, Hero?

553
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,440
Hey, Pop,

554
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:16,200
I’ve got something to confess—I’m actually rich.

555
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,160
Yeah, I figured.

556
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,000
Otherwise, you’d be robbing people by now.

557
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,600
No, I mean, I’m really rich. Like, I’m loaded.

558
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,680
Did you know I ride a motorcycle that costs hundreds of thousands?

559
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,440
Yeah, I noticed a long time ago. Ever since I saw your Tag Heuer watch,

560
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,920
I knew you didn’t borrow it from a friend.

561
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,400
Oh, and you’re the principal’s nephew, right?

562
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,680
You even went to my aunt to get your essay accepted.

563
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,640
What the hell! You knew all along?

564
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,640
Man, your elite behavior is obvious.

565
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,480
Watching you pretend to be poor was like watching a bad play.

566
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,920
Is this funny to you?

567
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,880
Ouch…

568
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,040
Get lost. Go home.

569
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,000
I can’t. After that punch, I’m probably internally bleeding.

570
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,400
Come on, get inside. It’s pouring out here, and there’s no moon.

571
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,520
Wait up. My leg hurts.

572
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,080
What the hell are you hurting about?

573
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,280
Walk by yourself.

574
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,280
Ouch!

575
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,320
I really wish my mom was still around.

576
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,320
But she’s gone now.

577
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:01,520
This stuff is sensitive. Who can I talk to about it?

578
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,160
This isn’t about gender; it’s about people.

579
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,560
It doesn’t matter if you’re a guy or a girl.

580
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,840
lying
