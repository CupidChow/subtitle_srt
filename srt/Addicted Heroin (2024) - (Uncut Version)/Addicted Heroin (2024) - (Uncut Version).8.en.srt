1
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,200
Second-round physical education test and interview

2
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,680
Pass

3
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,760
(Gasp)

4
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,360
Wait a minute, Sergeant!

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,640
(Panting)

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,360
1...

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,800
2...

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,960
(Panting)

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
3...

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
1...2...3...4...

11
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,440
5...6...7...8...9...10

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Done.

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Hey!

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,040
Is this okay?

15
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,840
Who is he?

16
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,200
Who is he?

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,360
Kulkanchanaocha

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,000
Keep do it!

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,360
91...

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,800
92...

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,920
93...

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Hey bro.

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,280
You can go shake hands with BNK idol band first.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,400
I will take responsibility for punishing everything myself.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,640
I won’t tell dad either.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Wait for me a few sec, Namsai

28
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,560
Oh...

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,600
200..

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,880
(Sigh)

31
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,640
Take it.

32
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,000
So, how is it? This is my lifestyle.

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,720
Does dad always make you do these?

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
This is a little more to go!

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,480
He made me jump off a tower when I was 5.

36
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,320
crawl through barbed wire at 7,

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,480
trained in boxing at 10,

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,000
and win a fight with 10 soldiers to finish the course.

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,160
Does he think I’m Superman?

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,560
Oh, He made me go on a forest hike too.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,600
At least he didn’t ask me to eat a gecko.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,680
Is this really okay?

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,680
Yeah.

44
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:16,280
But the good thing is, I have my mom who makes me snacks after training.

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Hey.

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,360
Do you want to meet my mom?

47
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,880
Mom, today I brought my boyfriend with me.

48
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,760
What? Who’s your boyfriend?

49
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,200
Shhh, I’m talking to my mom.

50
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,480
Why did you invite me to your house?

51
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:13,520
Well, my dad and your mom invited us for a family dinner.

52
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,040
Isn’t that wierd to you?

53
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,920
Hmm...

54
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,080
I guess it depends on what kind of family it is.

55
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,840
So, how about we start our own family then?

56
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:51,920
(Heartbeat sound)

57
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,960
Yeah...

58
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,920
(Sigh)

59
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
Hey.

60
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,240
is this your picture when you were a kid?

61
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,160
Handsome, right?

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,960
Hard to believe you grew up to be such a mess.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,280
Is this your mom’s room?

64
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,040
Yeah, it is.

65
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,720
Your mom seems really kind.

66
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes, she was.

67
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,920
She is really kind.

68
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,360
My mom loved singing

69
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,280
And she even sang the same song you sang at the convenience store.

70
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,160
Exactly the same song!

71
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,400
But my mom...she didn’t deserve to die.

72
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,200
Huh?

73
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,800
My mom died because of my dad.

74
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,800
What? Are you serious?

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
That day.

76
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,080
My mom went to the border with my dad as part of the military wives association.

77
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,640
What’s that?

78
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,880
It’s the military wives group.

79
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,960
They have to support their husbands in politics too.

80
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,080
And that day.

81
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,120
My dad took my mom's car,

82
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
so she ended up dying because of him.

83
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
(Explosion sound)

84
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,600
Ya! Ya!

85
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,640
Don’t follow, sir!
Let me go! Let me go!

86
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,880
It’s dangerous, Sergeant!
Ya! Ya...

87
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,920
Let me go!

88
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,480
Ya! Ya...

89
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,120
With love and condolences, Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters Wive's Association.

90
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,600
Did your mom work at a jewelry store?

91
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,520
I think so. Why?

92
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,040
My mom got this diamond right before she died.

93
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,920
And it came with this

94
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:29,120
After my mom died, my dad was promoted to general and married your mom.

95
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,680
What? Do you actually believe in supernatural stuff?

96
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
Pop,

97
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,680
you need to meal prayer! First.

98
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,240
You’re having dinner with a general!

99
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,080
meal prayer! First.

100
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,920
come on. Do it now.

101
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,360
Do you think being in the military is a joke?

102
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,640
We shouldn’t talk about this at a family dinner, right?

103
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,720
Don’t count me in.

104
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,840
But what’s even more ridiculous is.

105
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,200
To get promoted to general, you have to sacrifice your wife life to die.

106
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
It’s true. That’s crazy!

107
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,920
Hey, hero.

108
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
Didn’t I tell you not to talk like this again?

109
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,160
Do you think you’re the only one who lost?

110
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,720
No, I’m not the only one who lost.

111
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,080
One, me.

112
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,480
Two, him.

113
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
You sent his dad to die for nothing!

114
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
What did you lose?

115
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,600
You got promoted to general

116
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,520
And you ended up marrying a rich husband,

117
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
and didn’t lose a thing.

118
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,280
It’s such a funny!

119
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,520
When your mother was alive.

120
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,920
I never crossed the line with your father.

121
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,080
She was kind to me, and I respected her deeply.

122
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,240
You don’t need to say anything.

123
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,160
He never listens anyway.

124
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,080
True. Don’t say anything.

125
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,200
And don’t try to make me join the military either.

126
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,320
I don’t want to be part of an organization that caused my mom’s death.

127
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,880
Your grandfather wouldn’t accept not having a grandson in the military.

128
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,360
Seal ran off to study abroad.

129
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,000
So you’re the only one left.

130
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,440
Then adopt a military orphan as your son.

131
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,520
It’s not that hard.

132
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,920
Poppy, why don’t you join the military?

133
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,880
With your skills and being my son, your future is guaranteed to success.

134
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,800
Hey, don’t drag him into this.

135
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
He wants to be a businessman, just like me.

136
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,320
And is that stable enough to take care of your father and grandmother?

137
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,960
Are you brave enough to take that risk, Poppy?

138
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Excuse me.

139
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,360
That’s my family nickname.

140
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,400
Only my dad and grandmother can call me that.

141
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
(Laughs)

142
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,760
He’s saying he only has one dad.

143
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,640
If you and your new wife want more kids, you can try making some.

144
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Oh, or is it that you can’t anymore?

145
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,640
Please, stop using violence.

146
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
Quiet down, don’t cause trouble.

147
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,880
Let’s eat somewhere else. The food here is terrible.

148
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Pop.

149
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,880
You think you can go study abroad without my help?

150
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,600
(Sigh)

151
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
It’s okay, I’ll help.

152
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,720
Where do you want to sit?

153
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,160
I’ll sit here, near the fan.

154
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,640
And what about you?

155
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,760
I’ll sit behind you then.

156
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,960
Why don’t you sit next to me?

157
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,000
Because if I sit next to you, I won't see you.

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,800
But if I sit behind you, you’ll always be in my line of sight.

159
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,760
Ugh.

160
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,000
No.

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
You’ll probably do something mischievous again.

162
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
Come sit next to me.

163
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,680
How about sit in your heart instead?

164
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,120
You frequently show up the middle finger, then you’ll sweat soon enough.

165
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,200
What are you talking about?

166
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
Sit here!

167
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,200
Yes.

168
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,400
Feed me.

169
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,080
Not you!

170
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,760
Hey Kitty! I thought I wouldn’t see each other in 12th grade.

171
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,720
Didn’t you go to the Military Academy preparatory school?

172
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,360
Nosy.

173
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,880
Where’s your duo partner?

174
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,920
Oh, Only? Only isn’t my duo.

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,160
Haven’t seen Only all break.

176
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,320
He was going to a tutoring school to prepare for the exam.

177
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,640
You know the details. What is your relationship like?

178
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,320
I’ll tell you. He was bothering me on social media all break, even asking for hearts.

179
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,040
What?
Asking for hearts?

180
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,280
Not like that!

181
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,160
He wanted me to press ‘like’ during his live streams. You get it? Not like that.

182
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,720
Do you understand?

183
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,320
So, do you need Pop to clear things up for you, Kitty?

184
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,840
No!

185
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,520
Someone like Tiger Yaowamon Inboon would never act weak.

186
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,520
I will behave in a way that upholds my family’s honor.

187
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,320
I’ve already taken care of it.

188
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,720
(Nudge)

189
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,440
Oh, Sai!

190
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,680
Tiger, do you know anything about Only? Spill it!

191
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,360
I don’t know, I’m not even close to him.

192
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,880
Does Only have a celebrity girlfriend?

193
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
How do you know?

194
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,280
Oops.

195
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,560
I saw Only and Punpun, that celebrity, flirting on social media.

196
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,080
It’s so cute.

197
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,880
Really? I didn’t know.

198
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,720
Definitely his girlfriend.

199
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,760
But doesn’t Punpun already have an on-screen partner?

200
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,760
On-screen partners are just for work, right?

201
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Oh, so our Only is private property.

202
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,480
Thanks, Tiger.

203
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,280
You’ve given me so much. I’ll go tell the other girls. Bye!

204
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,760
What did you’ve got? What you mean you’ve got a lot

205
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,320
(Laughs)

206
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,080
Guys.

207
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,720
I was the one who created the fake account and flirted with Punpun.

208
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,320
How’s that? Am I bad or what?

209
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,840
(Laughs)

210
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,440
Oh, Hero, Pop.

211
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,480
(People chatting)

212
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
Nice new shirt.

213
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh, Prem!

214
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,800
Oh, Hey, Hello.

215
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,760
Hey, Fern!

216
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,960
Hey, Pear!

217
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,080
Hey,Hello.

218
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,880
Hi!, Hey, Sai!

219
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,760
Everyone.

220
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,680
For students going into 12th grade, no more playing around.

221
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,160
You need to plan what faculty you’ll apply to.

222
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,560
Do you understand?

223
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,320
But don’t just choose what you like.

224
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:50,720
You have to choose the faculty for your parents and for our school too.

225
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,440
For what?

226
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,680
Quiet down! Listen! From now on.

227
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,240
All activities for 12th graders will cancel.

228
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,080
Sometimes, I think being handsome is a curse.
But the 11th graders' activities are still on.

229
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,240
Sometimes, I think being handsome is a curse.
The sports day is still happening, though.

230
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,720
Do you know that actress, Punpun?

231
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,360
The teacher always stresses one thing – cleanliness

232
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,240
We must stay clean, even though we’re just a rural school.

233
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
What’s up with you? You want to settle some score with me?

234
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,200
What, savings or a checking account?

235
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,720
Ha!

236
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,360
Don't act like it's a joke

237
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,640
You keep messing with me.

238
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,680
I’ll get you a boyfriend so you'll be all bothered.

239
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,560
Oh, so it was you, huh?

240
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,640
Pretending social account to be me and flirting with Punpun?

241
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,760
What!

242
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,880
You didn’t know?

243
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Oh crap!

244
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,440
Hey, are you two done with your homework yet?

245
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,840
I’m gonna copy it later.

246
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
What’s wrong with you?

247
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,800
You’ve got to make Punpun forget about me.

248
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,760
Just tell her it was a fake account.

249
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,600
I already told her.

250
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,640
Because of my good looks

251
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,680
that make women want to approach me in person.

252
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,360
How can you say that so confidently and with a straight face?

253
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,560
I don’t know, man.

254
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,560
You’ve got to use your face to come between me and her.

255
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,920
Me?

256
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,600
Dude, are you a man or not? Own up to it!

257
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Fine. You want to use my face to get in the way? Bring it on.

258
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,640
See you on Saturday.

259
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,240
Go, Fahsai, go! You got this, girl! Dress is perfect

260
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,320
Teaw krub.

261
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,040
Oh my! Hi there, Only!

262
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,440
Why are you here?

263
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,640
I want you to make my sister here even more beautiful.

264
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,440
(laugh)

265
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,680
Wait, did I hear “make beautiful”?

266
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,720
You’ve got a nice body, you’ll be stunning

267
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,760
Exactly!

268
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,240
Wait,

269
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,400
aren’t I supposed to use my handsome face to woo Punpun?

270
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,520
Listen, there’s no one more handsome than me.

271
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,960
Hmm, true.

272
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,560
So I figured I’ll stage it for you to be my girlfriend.

273
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,960
Girlfriend?

274
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,880
But my girlfriend has to be…

275
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
Like this, right?

276
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,440
Fair, beautiful, and petite.

277
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,160
Also, she has to be tall.

278
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,600
Punpun can’t match your height anyway.

279
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,560
But I’m not a girl, though.

280
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,840
Exactly!

281
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,200
If you were a girl, we wouldn’t be able to touch each other.

282
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,880
Right!

283
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,520
But since we’re guys, it’s fine, right?

284
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,200
Right?

285
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,720
Right!

286
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,200
So, you’re saying you’re gonna touch me?

287
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,200
Well, you started this. You’re not gonna take responsibility?

288
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Didn’t you say you were a real man?

289
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,040
A real man, right?

290
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
Okay, okay! Fine, geez

291
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,960
Stop repeating yourself.

292
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,200
Why are you two always bickering?

293
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,640
Show me what’s in your hand ?

294
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,200
Not your hand, mean style references, joking all day long.

295
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,480
If we’re talking references,

296
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,200
fair, beautiful, and petite,

297
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,480
The most important thing is......

298
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,000
Tall.

299
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
Then it’s gotta be…

300
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,840
Gotta be?

301
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,840
Pancake, of course!

302
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,960
Ah, Pancake!

303
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:19,120
Wait, which Pancake? That one or this one?

304
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,920
Doesn’t matter. Pancakes are all the same.

305
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,560
Of course.

306
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,520
Come on, darling. I’ll take care of it. Let’s go.

307
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,400
What are you scared of?

308
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,760
Come on! Are you scared of me, or what? Sit down.

309
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,080
Alright!

310
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,840
two fingers.

311
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,960
No pictures!

312
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,280
Take pictures, go ahead!

313
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,720
This is the flower queen of Ratchaburi!

314
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,280
(Sound effect)

315
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,440
What kind of makeover is this? Why does it feel so tight?

316
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
I don’t feel tight at all.

317
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Do I really have to wear a G-string?

318
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,360
Of course, darling, I wear G-string all the time.

319
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,120
Is she your friend?

320
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,920
Yes, she is.

321
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,640
Oh, her name’s Pancake.

322
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,760
But calling her a friend? Not quite.

323
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,480
You’re so pretty.

324
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,840
If I were really pretty, I wouldn’t be ignored, right?

325
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,480
Only a fool would ignore beauty like this.

326
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,440
Look at this skin! So smooth.

327
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,120
What hand cream do you use?

328
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,240
Let’s have dinner, shall we?

329
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,920
Yeah, let’s eat.

330
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,720
The food’s getting cold.

331
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,200
Honey, do you love spicy food?

332
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,280
Honey, you love shrimp, right?

333
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,280
I’m allergic to shrimp.

334
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,560
I don’t eat spicy food.

335
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,600
Go on, have some.

336
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,240
Here, you eat first, honey.

337
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,040
No, you first, sweetheart.

338
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,400
You two take such good care of each other.

339
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,560
So, do you guys go to the same school?

340
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,600
(Laughs awkwardly)

341
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Yeah, same class.

342
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,080
Wait, I mean.

343
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,240
We’re in the same class.

344
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,040
So, do you want to go into the film department like Only?

345
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,920
I want to be a soldier.

346
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,480
What?

347
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,280
Oops…

348
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,920
Like a PhuKongYodRak, military rom-com series,

349
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,960
Like Markie, the female lead character.

350
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,240
Oh…

351
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
(Whispering)

352
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,720
What?

353
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,040
Your chest…

354
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,360
Huh?

355
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,120
What’s wrong?

356
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,920
Oh, it’s just… hot.

357
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
It’s really warm here.

358
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,560
I prefer places with AC.

359
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,280
Hot, huh?

360
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,720
Hot

361
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,360
Hot, huh?

362
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
Your chest, dude…

363
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,360
Chest?

364
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,840
Oh crap, where did it go?

365
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,160
Oh, found it!

366
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,440
Push it down… and… hup!

367
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,640
Done?

368
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,360
Wait…

369
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,320
Wait, where’d she go?

370
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,000
And who’s paying the bill?

371
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,040
You!

372
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
No, you! You’re the one who brought me here!

373
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,080
I don’t care! I’m out!

374
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,360
(Knock sound)

375
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,400
The store’s closed.

376
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,640
My clothes are inside! I can’t go home like this.

377
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,480
Aunt Taew went to grab dinner. She’ll be back soon.

378
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
What do we do?

379
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,680
Only.

380
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,760
Don’t tell them it’s me, alright?

381
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,240
You here for a haircut?

382
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,400
Just finished. The shop just closed.

383
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,480
Who are you here with?

384
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,760
A friend.

385
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,400
A friend, huh? Why didn’t you introduce me?

386
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,920
It’s an old school friend.

387
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,880
Oh.

388
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,200
Hey, hi! I’m Pancake!

389
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,120
Your voice sounds familiar, Pancake.

390
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,000
Don’t turn around. If you turn around, it’ll be too obvious.

391
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,600
Hmm…

392
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,840
Pancake, you really sound like someone I know.

393
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,360
Are you related to my friend?

394
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
No relatives here.

395
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,760
Relax.

396
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,440
I haven’t even said who yet.

397
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,040
His name’s…

398
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,520
Tiger, Yaowamon Inboon

399
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,840
Know him?

400
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,120
Uh, no. I don’t know him.

401
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,400
Oh really?

402
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,120
Pancake, your chest seems a bit uneven.

403
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
Let me help you adjust it.

404
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,000
Hey! Pop!

405
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,560
Stop it, Pop.

406
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,080
Don’t you dare tell him it was me!

407
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,520
Whoa.

408
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,440
Are you seriously doing this right in front of the shop?

409
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,520
I wasn’t doing anything!

410
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,760
What’s going on with this girl?

411
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,640
Just say it.

412
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,320
it’s didn’t what you think

413
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,480
I don’t care, I’m out.

414
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,880
Hey, who are you?

415
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,480
Hi, I’m Pancake.

416
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,880
I didn’t ask your name.

417
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,040
I asked what your relationship is with Pop!

418
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,240
Turn around and talk to me properly!

419
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,120
If you don’t speak up, I won’t let this go!

420
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,960
Sorry. that would be a bit inconvenient for me at the moment

421
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,440
Inconvenient, my ass!

422
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,960
You wanna start something?

423
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,480
There’s nothing going on.

424
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,240
Turn around and talk already! Where are your manners?

425
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,000
Ugh.

426
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,240
It’s me, Tiger!

427
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,040
Here, take this.

428
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,200
What the hell?

429
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,120
You didn’t tell me!

430
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,640
He told me not to!

431
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,600
See? What I did to him?

432
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,960
How would I know?

433
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,680
I just saw you grab her chest!

434
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,280
What?

435
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,160
Of course anyone would misunderstood.

436
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,200
Great-grandfather, I’m sorry.

437
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,480
I will conduct myself in a way that brings honor to my family in the sport day.

438
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,520
I won’t tarnish its reputation.

439
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Really? Are you nuts?

440
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,320
Pop, come here!

441
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,600
Listen, the coach made him the manager for picking the athletes.

442
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,880
You could win if you do all the events by yourself.

443
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,800
No way, he’d be exhausted!

444
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,960
That wouldn’t be fun, though.

445
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,080
I’m running the 1500 meters, the 400 meters, and the 3-legged race.

446
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,200
Wait, you’re doing long distance and short distance

447
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,080
You’re not gonna make it!

448
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,720
Wow, you’re so worried about your friend!

449
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,240
(footsteps)

450
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,840
Running 1500 meters.

451
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,800
You could win... if you get in a car.

452
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,360
I’m not joking with you.

453
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,960
Come on.

454
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
Don’t be so serious.

455
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,400
I’m cheering you up, chill out!

456
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,360
Overworking yourself isn’t worth it, man.

457
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,320
Cause you’re gonna lose anyway.

458
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,720
(laughs)

459
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,000
What was that?

460
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,200
Alright, fine, I’ll cheer you on.

461
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,760
In the movie “Seven Something.”

462
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,240
They ran 42.195 kilometers!

463
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,120
You’re only doing 1500 meters.

464
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,960
It’s like going to pee and you’re done.

465
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Wait, is your bladder the size of a football field?

466
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,000
Peeing takes you forever!

467
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,360
You’re exaggerating.

468
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,600
Exaggerating? Come race me, then!

469
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Let’s see if you’re still all talk.

470
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,200
I would.

471
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
But all the spots are taken!

472
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,720
Ha! You poser. You should do javelin.

473
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,280
What!

474
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,000
Javelin!

475
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Yeah, javelin!

476
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,640
No way, you do it!

477
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,880
It’s easy.

478
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,080
Try looking that way

479
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,960
just throw it as far as you can.

480
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,040
Even an idiot like you can do it.

481
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,280
I signed you up already.

482
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,680
Wait, you did?

483
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,960
Done and done!

484
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,960
(warm-up)

485
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,360
Tiger.

486
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,240
I’m running the 1500 meters with you.

487
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,080
What?

488
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,040
So we can train together!

489
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,000
????

490
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,560
Let’s go practice now!

491
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,640
If you compete,

492
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,640
instead of just losing normally, I’ll end up losing badly.

493
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,760
Hold up!

494
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,760
(heavy breathing)

495
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,080
Man.

496
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,760
Why they’re running fast

497
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,040
You need to change how you breathe.

498
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,840
When you breathe in, match it with three steps.

499
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,200
And when you breathe out, match it with two steps. Try it!

500
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,920
What?

501
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,720
3...2...3...2...

502
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,880
3...2...

503
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,480
What kind of breathing is that?

504
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,960
Let’s try again.

505
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:53,440
(crying)

506
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,720
How do you feel?

507
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,560
I’m starting to breathe right

508
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,080
Uh-huh, here’s a towel.

509
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,880
Let me wipe the sweat for you.

510
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,520
You’re drenched in sweat!

511
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,240
Pop.

512
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:55,320
(crying)

513
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,520
Who is that?

514
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,720
Damn it!

515
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,160
This is like something out of a horror movie.

516
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,160
What’s wrong?

517
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,400
I tried so hard.

518
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,640
But I still can’t do it.

519
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
Come on, you’re amazing already.

520
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,880
Don’t try to make me feel better, I’ll kick you.

521
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,760
(foot pain)

522
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,040
(crying)

523
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,840
Save your strength for peeing, man.

524
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,680
(crying)

525
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,680
Why are you crying? Did I say something too harsh?

526
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,200
I’m not crying because of you.

527
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,440
Then just drop out.

528
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,040
If you can’t finish the race, you’ll cry again.

529
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,120
I can’t drop out.

530
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,360
Then pretend you’re sick.

531
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,920
No way!

532
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,000
Ouch!

533
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,600
Careful when you sit.

534
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,000
You have a wound, so be careful.

535
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,080
You’re gonna hurt yourself even more.

536
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,880
I won’t give up. I’m not racing just to compete.

537
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,840
See? I told you you’re awesome!

538
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,400
Even when you fail, you keep trying.

539
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,720
Alright, I’m off to throw the javelin.

540
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,680
Watch me!

541
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,000
How do I look? Cool, right?

542
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,080
Cool, right?

543
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,240
Mmm-hmm.

544
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,800
This time, I’m serious.

545
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,320
Whoa!

546
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,360
(laughs)

547
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,480
Ok feeling good!

548
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,000
Do you feel good because I fell?

549
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,000
My butt hurts.

550
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,640
Keep going, though!

551
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,280
Even if you don’t win

552
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,560
Just don’t make it embarrassing.

553
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,360
Ouch.

554
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,000
Soaking your feet in cold water after running helps with muscle cramps.

555
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,120
Right?

556
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,520
Hey Pop.

557
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,080
Can you take some pictures of me tomorrow while I’m racing?

558
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:54,800
I’d like a picture that natural, candid, cool, handsome, you know?

559
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,280
Um,

560
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,520
so do you want a natural or cool and handsome picture?

561
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,640
Whatever you like.

562
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,520
(phone ringing)

563
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,800
Who’s that?

564
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,120
Teacher Saranya.

565
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,920
Oh...

566
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,800
Teacher Saranya, the one who bought you chocolate, right?

567
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,120
Are you trying to ask who gave me the chocolate?

568
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,080
Are you jealous?

569
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,560
Who’s jealous? No one.

570
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Do you wanna know who it was?

571
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,280
Who would want to know?

572
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,800
Come on.

573
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,480
Ouch!

574
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,360
Was the chocolate good?

575
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,720
Didn’t eat it.

576
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,160
Hello, students!

577
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:45,720
Welcome to our 2019 school sports day!

578
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,680
(cheers)

579
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,480
Hey, he just sent me a mini-heart!

580
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,760
Athletes, take your positions!

581
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,520
Wait, his shoelace is untied.

582
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,800
Did you see her?

583
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,440
Teacher Sa looks spicy today. And what’s she doing?

584
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,760
Flirting with the students?

585
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
I heard she gives chocolate to Hero everyday!

586
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,840
Seriously.

587
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,480
Did she put a love potion or something in chocolate?

588
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,400
Like, “You’re mine, body and soul are mind”? Damn!

589
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,160
Fighting, hero!

590
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,840
(clears throat)

591
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,040
On your mark...

592
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,680
Get ready!

593
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,680
(whistle blows)

594
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,280
Orange team, Fighitng!

595
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,680
Hero!!!

596
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,320
Rahus! Fighitng!

597
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:09,480
Look at her, cheering like crazy, She is such a try-hard!

598
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,280
Orange team, Fighitng!

599
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,200
(whistle blows)

600
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,160
(Cheering)

601
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,480
Oh my god.

602
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,520
She’s so into it this round. She didn’t even care in the other races!

603
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,760
Now she’s hugging him.

604
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,080
Over the top much?

605
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,640
In the other rounds, there’s no Hero competing.

606
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,240
She's acting cute with him, and I think it's not normal.

607
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,880
(Bang)

608
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,440
Next up, we’ll run two events simultaneously.

609
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,160
Hey, I got first place just for you.
Next up, we’ll run two events simultaneously.

610
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,960
The first is the 1,500 meters, and the second is the men’s javelin throw.

611
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,720
As soon as I get the gold medal, I will Suddenly hang it on your neck!  Cool?
The first is the 1,500 meters.

612
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,560
Pop.

613
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,920
Pop! What’s wrong?

614
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,640
Hey, What's wrong with Pop?
And the second is the men’s javelin throw.

615
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,560
And the second is the men’s javelin throw.

616
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,560
I gotta go, man!

617
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,440
Where are you going?

618
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,520
(applause)

619
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,160
Even with headphones, he looks handsome.

620
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,880
Where are they going?

621
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,360
(Cheering)

622
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,120
Is everyone ready?

623
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,360
Only Fighting! Fighting!

624
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,000
Only Fighting! Onlyfan!

625
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,720
Why’s Red team cheering for Orange?

626
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,840
They’re not cheering for Orange, they’re cheering for Only!

627
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,360
Only Fighting! Fighting!

628
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,080
Hey, this isn't the blue team anymore. This is the pink team!

629
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,760
I want to say, I have OnlyFans, too!

630
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,920
(Cheering)

631
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,680
On your mark!

632
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,960
Watch out!

633
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,920
(whistle blows)

634
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,680
Come on, run, run, run!

635
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,320
Only, Fighting, go, go!

636
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,640
Move!

637
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,120
Only, Fighting!

638
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,080
Oops, sorry!

639
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,280
Look at Red, why’d they cut in front of Orange like that?

640
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,360
Red’s team blocking Pop!

641
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,760
Red’s cheating!

642
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,480
Hey, Red’s cheating!

643
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,760
Teacher, hold my camera.

644
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,840
Don’t you trust in Lersilp?

645
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,760
Pop, go for it!

646
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,880
Red’s cheating.

647
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,840
Just go, Pop!, go!

648
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,080
Go! Pop.

649
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,680
The orange team, don't pull the red team!

650
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,800
See? I told you to be careful. Mind your step.

651
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,520
What the hell are you doing? Damn it!

652
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,720
What did you do to my Kitty?

653
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,480
Damn!

654
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,680
Oh no, javelin is diving in!

655
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,000
Even though there’s a fight going on, the competition must go on.

656
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,600
Pop, go Pop!

657
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,560
Pop, fight!

658
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,520
Pop, go Pop!

659
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,400
Pop is about to cross the finish line!

660
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,360
Hey,Tiger.

661
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,400
Hurry up!

662
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,080
Hurry up! Pop!

663
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,960
(whistle blows)

664
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,560
Orange takes first place!

665
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,360
(Cheering)

666
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,880
Yay!

667
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,800
Yay!

668
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,360
Pop, you’re amazing!

669
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,440
He can do it.

670
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,400
Very good!

671
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,160
Go on, finish the race! Get up, come on! You’re almost there!

672
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,400
Get up! Get up!

673
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,320
Come on!

674
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,760
Keep fighting! Just a little more!

675
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,160
It's so close to the finish line!

676
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,320
I can't run anymore.

677
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,160
Can you do it! Just a little bit more!

678
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,200
No matter what, I'm going to come in last anyway.

679
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,320
Pop, help me out here!

680
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,440
Tiger, go!

681
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,000
Tiger, Tiger

682
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,960
Kitty, faster!

683
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,320
Give it all you’ve got, come on!

684
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,520
Yeah!

685
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,520
See? I told you you could do it.

686
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,040
You’re incredible!

687
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,920
Hey, Kitty.

688
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,000
Are you okay? Do you need the nurse?

689
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,240
Tiger, hey!

690
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Great!

691
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,320
The heart of the three-legged race is unity

692
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,040
Rahus! Fighting!
The heart of the three-legged race is unity

693
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,480
Teacher, could you please be quiet?

694
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,360
You’re distracting me.

695
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,880
What’s wrong?

696
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,760
Get set!

697
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,280
How are we going to walk without hugging me?

698
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,080
(Whistle blows)

699
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,320
Cheer, cheer!

700
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,480
What's the chocolate?

701
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,600
What chocolate?

702
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:23,520
Oh, are you jealous? Just say it!

703
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,400
Yeah, well, whatever I feel is my problem!

704
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,440
Well, athletes need dark chocolate, right?

705
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,000
Just a little extra motivation.

706
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,440
You're the only one in the team! aren't you?

707
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,640
Why are you mad at the teacher?

708
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,400
The teacher’s pregnant.

709
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,520
What? Pregnant with who?

710
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,720
Hey... ow!

711
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,280
Damn it!

712
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,640
Ouch!

713
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,080
(Sneezing)

714
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,000
Ugh, my nose is all stuffed up.

715
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,040
Hey, anyone got an inhaler?

716
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,920
Hey, I do, I do!

717
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,000
Here, take it.

718
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,360
What kind of inhaler is this?

719
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:43,560
No, no, only Peppermint field for me. Only that.

720
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,840
Aren’t all inhalers the same?

721
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,600
They’re not! Peppermint field is refreshing, aromatic, it’s the best.

722
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,960
Where can you buy it?

723
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,320
At every 7-11.

724
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,920
Oh, okay, I’ll go grab one for you.

725
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,400
Wait a sec.

726
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,880
(Sneezing)

727
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,520
(Sneezing)

728
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,120
Ugh…

729
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,480
who threw this?

730
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:53,720
So refreshing! Saved my life!

731
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,680
Here it is, only Peppermint field!

732
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,360
Wait… where did everyone go?
