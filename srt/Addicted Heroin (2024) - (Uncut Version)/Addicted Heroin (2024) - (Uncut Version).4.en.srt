1
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,320
What are you going to do?

2
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,720
I'm heartbroken Pop.

3
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Comfort me a little, will you?

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,560
It's for the best. You'll find someone better.

5
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Really?

6
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,800
Um. I mean, that girl...

7
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,520
oh

8
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,400
oh, You're so mean.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,840
She was my first love, you know?

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,560
She was so clingy and possessive

11
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,920
It made me feel like I was important when I was with her

12
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,240
Really?

13
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,160
But I admit it, she loved me more than I loved her.

14
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
It made me feel suffocated.

15
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
So, I guess in my next relationship,

16
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,320
I'll make sure I love the other person more.

17
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
Relationships aren't supposed to be perfectly balanced, are they?

18
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,560
Hmm, a love equation

19
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
Do you even have a girlfriend?

20
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
None of your business.

21
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
Are you a virgin?

22
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,440
What kind of question is that?

23
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
Come on, let me see.

24
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,720
Hey, what are you doing? That's inappropriate!

25
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Oh, come on. I'm curious.

26
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,120
No.

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,680
Just let me check.

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,280
No, stop it. Don't mess with me.

29
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,000
Let me check, just once.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,360
If you cross this line, you're going down.

31
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
Oh, you’re really leaving me hanging here.

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,200
Yup.

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,440
If I flip over, I'm falling, you know.

34
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,320
If you cross the line, you're falling too.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,880
I might just kick you over.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,440
If I fall and get hurt, I'll be stuck in this house for a long time.

37
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,440
Hey, take your hand away.

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,920
Why? Are you ticklish?

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,760
I said, take your hand away.

40
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,520
Just reach into your pocket and get it.

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,480
Which pocket? This one?

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
This one?

43
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
Hey, don't go poking around, Hero.

44
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,680
What the hell?

45
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Don’t be naughty.

46
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,520
The size is like an inhaler.

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,320
So, what size is considered okay?

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Turns out, it really is just an inhaler.

49
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,720
I thought it was something else!

50
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,680
Why do you have to pee now?

51
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680
I told you to drink less water.

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
But I was thirsty.

53
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,080
Hey, take it easy.

54
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,360
Let's go fishing.

55
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,080
Pla tin.I'm going to hit you.

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Why?

57
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,400
Come on, let's go to class.

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
Thanks.

59
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Do you see the way it is in the picture? Stretch your leg out.

60
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,360
Like this?

61
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,240
Yeah, stretch your leg straight out.

62
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,800
Is this right?

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
My leg feels tight, man.

64
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,880
Pull your leg back in.

65
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,840
Ouch, it hurts to bend. (Ouch!)

66
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,160
Ouch!

67
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
Hurry up. Move up a bit. Yeah, like that.

68
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,880
Pop, my back hurts.

69
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Here?

70
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,560
Yeah, a bit higher.

71
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,320
Higher.

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,440
It’s still not hitting the sore spot.

73
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,080
Where exactly does it hurt then?

74
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,440
To the left, left a bit, left a bit.

75
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Huh? Are you messing with me?

76
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,200
Hey, I'm not messing with you!

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,760
Come here.

78
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,640
Do you know what a judo throw is?

79
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,200
I’m about to throw you down!

80
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,680
Ouch! Why would I mess you up?

81
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,680
Long-legged Fighting!

82
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
Hurry up.

83
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Long-legged Fighting!

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
Hey, take it seriously.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Long-legged Fighting!

86
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,560
Hey

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Hey, hey, check on our friend!Quick,

88
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,000
check on him! You okay, man?

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,800
I can't take it.

90
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,080
we need a sub. Only, you're in

91
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,360
Only.

92
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
Only, fighting.

93
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,480
Only, show them what you got!

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,160
Take a shoot for your friend.

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Hurry up.

96
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,640
Only.

97
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,520
Hurry up.

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,640
Can he even play, though?

99
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,360
Oh, what now? Even when you fail, you do it in style.

100
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,320
Kitty, how come you couldn’t catch that ball? Come on, man!

101
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,360
Human arms here, not some ghostly long arms that can stretch to catch whatever you throw.

102
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,040
Hurry, pass the ball! Quickly!

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,320
Over there, fast!"

104
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,520
Sent to this side

105
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,840
Serve!

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,840
Only!

107
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,760
Tiger!

108
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,880
Ouch!

109
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,160
Pop!

110
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,880
Hey, are you okay? Pop!

111
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
Hey, get off Pop.

112
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,120
Does it hurt?

113
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,040
Are you alright?

114
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,080
Hey, please help a friend.

115
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,440
You fell on Pop, why?

116
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,240
Hey, calm down. It was an accident.

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
Quiet.

118
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,760
I’ll help Tiger myself.

119
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,480
You're just weak, dude. A total liability!

120
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,520
Hey, you can’t treat him like that.

121
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,840
But I came to help you, didn’t I?

122
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,200
Ouch!

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,160
Hey, are you okay, Pop?

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,920
New Caption

125
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,680
I’m fine.

126
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
Thanks for getting hurt for me.

127
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,720
Ah, thanks for taking the hit for me.

128
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,040
Tiger, Only, can you take me to the nursing room

129
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,720
Only!

130
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
Does it hurt?

131
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,400
Hero, can I speak now?

132
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,760
Umm.

133
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,920
Hey, come on, let’s play again.

134
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,400
Quick, quick, toughen up.

135
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,240
Just get on the bike,

136
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,400
come on. Hurry up, get on!

137
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
please.

138
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,400
Umm, get in the bike

139
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,000
come on, please.

140
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,240
If you don't get in, I'll carry you.

141
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,000
Hey!

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,640
Come on.

143
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,320
Hey, okay, stop.

144
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,400
you're annoying me.

145
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,000
Alright, let's go

146
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,440
You good?

147
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,640
Be careful, walk properly.

148
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,840
Let's go

149
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,800
Let's go!

150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Alright, we're off now.

151
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,560
Come here, let me help you with that.

152
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,000
No need

153
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,960
Usually, I only let my dad take care of my wounds.

154
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,880
I'll take care of it for you. Come here.

155
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,800
No need.

156
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,080
It's fine, just lift your leg.

157
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,520
Um.

158
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,440
So, am I the first one after your dad to treat your wounds?

159
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,840
Thanks for being the first to take care of me, Daddy's little darling,

160
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,400
You're so shameless,

161
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,800
stop being dirty.

162
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Haven't you seen the movie?

163
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
Just do it properly,

164
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,760
and stop joking around.

165
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,640
Why did you push Tiger?

166
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,280
You should apologize to him.

167
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
Are you mad at me just for that?

169
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,440
Woa!

170
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
And what about you pretending to hurt your leg, just to use me taking care you?

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,120
What?

172
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
I just recovered.

173
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,120
Yeah, right. I totally believe that.

174
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,760
You're walking perfectly fine.

175
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,800
Oh, come on! Just because I pushed Kitty a little,

176
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,000
you want me to apologize?

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
If I ended up in the ICU, you wouldn’t even care, would you?

178
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,280
My life is so tragic, (sigh)

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,480
But you're better now. Go back home,

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,080
I'll handle things myself.

181
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,000
No way! How can I leave?

182
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,160
I have to take care of you.

183
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,640
Who told you to stay?

184
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,920
I’ll go ask your dad.

185
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
He'll let me stay for sure.

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
I’ll take care of you myself.

187
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,440
Look, your leg is swollen.

188
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,560
You know what? I just had an idea. I can walk for you.

189
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,920
What do you mean?

190
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,320
Like this.

191
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,720
Come here.

192
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,080
This is where the phrase 'Step Forward Together' comes from.

193
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
That’s funny.

194
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,040
See?

195
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
Uh-huh.

196
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
Uh-huh.

197
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,400
What are you two doing?

198
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,360
Um, Tiger, Hero, we have something to tell you.

199
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,920
Huh?

200
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,880
Huh?

201
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,280
Nothing.

202
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,720
Yes, we do.

203
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,880
Come on.

204
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,840
Go!

205
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,520
Where to?

206
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,160
If you don’t apologize to Tiger, don’t even think about climbing into my bed tonight.

207
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,640
Fine, I’ll go.

208
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,040
I’m sorry.

209
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,120
What?

210
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
I said I’m sorry.

211
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,120
And you have to forgive me so we can move on. Accept my apology now

212
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
Hurry up!

213
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,200
It’s really okay. I wasn’t mad.

214
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,480
I was just startled.

215
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,280
See? He wasn’t even mad at me. Right?

216
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,960
Hey, Poppy, you’re supposed to have a hurt leg,

217
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,640
Come here, let me help.

218
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,320
I’m fine now.

219
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,800
You can go home and pack up tonight.

220
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,000
Why?

221
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,480
Your dad hasn’t kicked me out yet.

222
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,640
My dad is kind.

223
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,760
Even when people cheat him, he still shows compassion and lends them money.

224
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,880
Why show compassion?

225
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,840
The people who hired my dad were cheated themselves.

226
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
So now, my dad feels sorry for them and doesn’t demand repayment.

227
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,760
t’s the smallest person who always gets sympathy, right?

228
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,720
Yeah, that’s true.

229
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,160
If you don’t have money, why did you hire us?

230
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,840
Welcome!

231
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Oh, hello Uncle.

232
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,920
Poppy, what are you doing here?

233
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,800
I told you, you don’t have to do anything.

234
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,480
Just focus on studying for your future.

235
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,040
I can handle everything else.

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,520
Dad.

237
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,720
Dad, you know our family’s money isn’t enough.

238
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,040
Dad earns so little, right?

239
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,560
That’s why Poppy has to work so hard.

240
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,960
If Dad could earn more,

241
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,880
Would Poppy be able to stop working?

242
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,360
Dad, if something isn’t feasible, just admit it. It’s okay.

243
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,800
I’m sorry. I’m just a road repair worker.

244
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,680
I can’t make Poppy as happy as other kids.

245
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,840
And if I could do more,

246
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,360
I still wouldn’t have the right to stop Poppy from working, would I?

247
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,760
Can I get some glue? Where’s the glue?

248
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,720
It’s over there.

249
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,760
Please calculate the bill for me.

250
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,040
I’ll handle the bill for you.

251
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,920
All set.

252
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,560
Uncle, here’s a little gift from the shop.

253
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,040
Thanks

254
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,960
Take it and eat it, dear.

255
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,560
Just accept it and enjoy

256
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
Are you done eating? What's wrong?

257
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,360
When I eat with my dad,

258
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,000
he usually eats after me.

259
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,280
New Caption

260
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,560
waiting for him to finish

261
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,480
but

262
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,680
he actually waits for me to eat my fill

263
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,080
and then eats whatever is left.

264
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,200
When I stayed at your place,

265
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,600
you always left the good food for your dad, right?

266
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,680
I didn’t mean to say that to make him feel bad.

267
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,840
Who’s been messing with your dad?

268
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,880
What can we do?

269
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,080
Hey!

270
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,880
Why are you so pissed?

271
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,400
This store didn't put up the sticker.

272
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,840
I told them to pay for it, and I'd protect them,

273
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,920
but they refused.

274
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,800
Are you guys extorting them?

275
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,880
My country has ..

276
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
How much do you think I make?

277
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,880
What gives you the right to shake me down like this?

278
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,400
I don't care! There are rules here,

279
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
and if you don't follow them,

280
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,440
Hey!  then get out!

281
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,840
What the hell are you doing?!

282
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,160
You...! Hey!

283
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,160
Hey!

284
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,840
Hero!

285
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,240
what are you gonna do, huh?

286
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,840
what are you gonna do?

287
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,440
Hey, please don't.

288
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,960
This is gonna get back to Boss Gai for sure.

289
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,040
Let's go!

290
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,880
You’ll regret this!

291
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
Hero, don't get involved with them.

292
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,880
If you keep giving in, you'll be a slave forever.

293
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
You don't have to be scared. You've got people who’ll help you.

294
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,840
But what about Auntie Jeab?

295
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,840
We’re just ordinary folks. In the end,we’ll still get hurt.

296
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,040
Then I'll take care of it.

297
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,040
Pop.

298
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,080
Alright,

299
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,360
today’s the day we’ll meet with some big-time relatives.

300
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,200
The higher-ups are going to find a new way to make money.

301
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,080
Yes, indeed.

302
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,280
By the way, which one is Kulkanjanaocha?

303
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,920
By the way, which one is Kulkanjanaocha? Is it Mr. Wisanupon or General Chonlathee?

304
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,720
I’m not sure either, Village Chief.

305
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,320
I think the name was something like Rahong... Rahus something.

306
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,720
Why did they have to meet here? Strange.

307
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,160
Yes, I think so too.

308
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,240
Hey, who are you?

309
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,680
Don’t you know who’s in charge here?

310
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,160
Can’t you see the Village Chief sitting right here?

311
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,040
Village Chief, I can’t read.

312
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,720
Posing like that all day.

313
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,440
Code name, Kullakarn Osha.

314
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,360
My grandpa, Visanupong, sends his regards.

315
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:45,520
Hello! Oh, I’ve been thinking of Mr. Visanupong and General Varathi so much.

316
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,400
Haven’t seen them in a long time.

317
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,640
So, what can this small-time Village Chief do for you today?

318
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,200
Or should Chief Kai handle everything for you?"

319
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Well, I have a small issue.

320
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,040
My aunt has a stall around here,

321
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,240
and she’s been harassed by thugs demanding protection money.

322
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,080
Does that happen in this community?

323
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,640
Or should I consult with my grandpa and dad?"

324
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,320
Oh, no, no, no! No need for that.

325
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,680
I think it would be troubling them for nothing.

326
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,840
How about I move her stall to a row house instead?

327
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,360
No need to sell for free anymore.

328
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,040
It's good.

329
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,600
Really?

330
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,160
Really.

331
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,960
And I have another issue.

332
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,320
My uncle is a construction worker,

333
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,600
and he was cheated out of his wages.

334
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,480
Plus, he doesn’t have good benefits.

335
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,400
What should he do?

336
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,840
This seems to be a private contractor issue.

337
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,280
Don’t get the government involved.

338
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,800
And if my uncle becomes a government employee,

339
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,960
would he get better benefits?

340
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,000
Umm.

341
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,800
Are there any positions open at the local administrative office?

342
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,640
Yes, there are.

343
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,400
Alright, I’ll make him the permanent engineer at the local administration.

344
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
Thank you so much for taking care of the people.

345
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,440
My pleasure! A small-time Village Chief like Chief Kai is happy to serve everyone.

346
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,240
Then, if there’s nothing else.

347
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,640
Oh, and please

348
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,920
convey my regards to Mr. Visanupong and General Chonlathee.

349
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,960
Tell them I miss them dearly.

350
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,320
Thank you.

351
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,320
And about this road, it’s too dark at night. What can we do?

352
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,400
Don’t worry about that. Come back tomorrow,

353
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,680
and it’ll be as bright as a festival.

354
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,960
Please take care of it, Mr. Kai.

355
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,600
Village Chief Kai, at your service.

356
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,520
Don't forget.

357
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,440
Is there something wrong, Aunt Jeeab? Dad called me to come here.

358
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm not sure either.

359
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,560
When I asked, they just said it was ordered by someone.

360
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,320
Should I accept it, Pop?

361
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,040
It feels a bit suspicious.

362
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,200
Take it, Aunt. It's normal for the government to help people with their businesses.

363
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,600
You might have been living with unusual things for so long that it feels strange now, right?

364
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,240
That’s true.

365
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,120
This new shop is so much bigger.

366
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,840
Oh, Brother Han, here’s the shop I was telling you about.

367
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,720
Wow, it’s even bigger than the old one.

368
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,760
Look, it’s got a lucky number, 999.

369
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,120
Wow!

370
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,280
I heard you also got some new work, right?

371
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,920
Yes, I got a new job. No more night shifts,

372
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,360
and I’m now a state engineer with a salary and benefits.

373
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,680
and I’m now a state engineer with a salary and benefits.

374
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,440
But it’s strange. We talked today, and I start work tomorrow.

375
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,760
That’s great, Brother. Congratulations.

376
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,320
And another thing, I got all the back pay from my old employer too.

377
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,080
Where did you go to pray for this?

378
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,880
Everywhere. I stop and pray at every temple I pass.

379
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,560
Let me help with that.

380
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,320
Thanks

381
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,520
Poppy, I got a new job,

382
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,920
so you don’t have to work late anymore, okay?

383
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
Well...

384
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,840
Poppy,

385
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,560
give me a chance to take care of you.

386
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,560
If things don’t get better, we’ll figure it out then.

387
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,840
Okay, Dad. I’ll quit. I trust you.

388
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,880
Let it be like this.

389
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,400
Hero, once we finish setting up the shop, you can come home with us.

390
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,000
Wait, why are you inviting him,Dad?

391
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,640
My leg’s all better now. He can go home.

392
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,000
It’s not about whether your leg is better or not.

393
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,800
Guys can tell these things, right, Hero?

394
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,120
You’re not comfortable where you’re staying right now, right? You’re living with your aunt?

395
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:49,800
She’s probably strict and fussy, might not understand what kids like us go through, right?

396
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh, exactly.

397
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,640
So, if you feel more comfortable somewhere else, just stay there.

398
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,520
If you stay over, just tell her we’re not out partying or anything. It’s no big deal.

399
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
That sounds great.

400
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,320
Of course.

401
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,320
I'm part of your family now.

402
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,120
Can I call you Poppy?

403
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,120
I know you've been up to something.

404
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,920
Yeah, I don’t want to lie to you anymore,

405
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,360
or you’ll think I’m just acting again.

406
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,240
So,

407
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,680
here’s the truth

408
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,240
I’m the minister’s nephew.

409
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,640
My dad's a general.

410
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,440
Oh,

411
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,680
so your family’s powerful, and you used your connections?

412
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,560
That’s pathetic.

413
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,680
Well, you're the one who said

414
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,400
ordinary people get crushed by the powerful.

415
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,240
I’m the one getting crushed for you.

416
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,600
Oh, now I’ve got a mafia protector, huh?

417
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,640
I hate my family too,

418
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,960
but I used my connections

419
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,760
because I know I’m helping good people.

420
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,680
It still feels like cheating to me.

421
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,720
But everyone’s been cheated first, right?

422
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,400
Come on, your dad and Aunt Jeab have been through a lot.

423
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,440
So, if I’m not okay with it,

424
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,640
does that mean I don’t want my dad to succeed?

425
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,680
Let him be proud of himself for once.

426
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,960
Let him do something that makes you proud too.

427
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Then he’ll have the courage to ask Auntie Jeab to be his girlfriend.

428
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,360
You really know everything, don’t you?

429
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,080
I know it all.

430
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,520
Hey!

431
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,240
My house might look rough

432
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,560
but my dad and grandma love you, you know that?

433
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,680
And what about you?

434
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,360
Feels like I’ve taken in a stray dog for some good karma.

435
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,560
A dog, really?

436
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,480
Well, you might just get licked, then.

437
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,160
I've been with you for a month and I’ve never seen you jerk off.

438
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,720
Even if I did, I wouldn't let you see it.

439
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,520
When would you even do it? You’re with me 24/7. I never see it.

440
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,160
They say that if a guy helps himself,

441
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,680
it improves sexual performance, but...

442
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,440
Are you crazy? Who does that? It's nonsense.

443
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,240
"Actually, in our group, we take turns helping each other out.

444
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,040
We even have a nickname for it: 'The Big League Gang.

445
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,880
Try it.

446
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,880
Oh, fuck no. I’m not into that.

447
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,400
Not even curious?

448
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,480
No way.

449
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,040
Oh...

450
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,920
I don't need anyone's help. I'm fine on my own.

451
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,400
Really?

452
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,600
I thought you had a girlfriend but were still a virgin, right? Am I right?

453
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,800
If you don’t stop, you’ll end up sleeping outside.

454
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,600
Alright, alright.

455
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,880
Not even a little curious?

456
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,960
When we become teenagers, we get hair around our genitals.

457
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,760
What do we call that?

458
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,800
Pubic hair.

459
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,000
Does it have any benefits?

460
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,120
Yes, it does. It helps mask the smell of our genitals.

461
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,560
If we don’t shower for two or three days, that area helps prevent the smell from spreading.

462
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,040
Can I smell it?

463
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,800
Smell?

464
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,200
If it bothers you, don’t shave it off unless you need to wear a bikini.

465
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
What are you going to smell?

466
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,280
Let me smell.

467
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,800
Don’t.

468
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,200
Let me smell.

469
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,000
Don’t.

470
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Anyone have any questions about it?

471
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,600
Oh...

472
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,640
Wow, if you’re sniffing that much, you’d better buy me a new inhaler.

473
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,880
Why does it smell so fresh?

474
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,480
Kitty.

475
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,080
Why

476
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,760
Why are you blushing?

477
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,960
Blushing? Me? I’m not blushing.

478
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,920
You’re acting suspicious.

479
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,760
Hey Pop, do you have any cool places to recommend?

480
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,440
The gang is coming over this Saturday.

481
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,360
What kind of place?

482
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,160
Something private where no one will bother us?

483
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,240
You planning something dirty?

484
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,600
Oh, you’re curious? If you want to know, come along with me.

485
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,840
Enjoy

486
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,320
Pop, is this the best place around here?

487
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,640
Yeah, this is where all the cool kids hang out.

488
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,600
Really?

489
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,440
Yeah, this is Panther, this is Spark, and I’m Pop.

490
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,840
Hi, I’m Pop.

491
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,920
Which Pop? Just Pop, Pop-eye,

492
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,400
or Poppy?

493
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,520
Hey.

494
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,720
Just plain old POP.

495
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,160
By the way, did you bring the stuff?

496
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,480
My dad just got back from abroad. This isn’t easy to get, you know.

497
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,680
Really?

498
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,360
Really.

499
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,160
Where?

500
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,840
Is that a strange thing?

501
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Whoa... holy crap.

502
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,480
This is awesome.

503
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,080
I’m telling you, we’re not leaving until it’s gone tonight.

504
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,840
Let’s do it!

505
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,880
This drink is strong.

506
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,160
This is some good stuff.

507
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,040
Hey!

508
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,560
guys, we’re in a karaoke place; they’ve got songs to choose from!

509
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:16,800
Ehh.

510
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,360
Come here, birthday boy, you’ve got to sing!

511
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,120
Panther, you go.

512
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,600
Alright.

513
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,280
Oh, he’s not going? Fine, I’ll go.

514
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,040
Come on, come with me.

515
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,880
Let’s sing together.

516
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,240
Huh.

517
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,320
Hey, who pushed me?

518
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,640
Alright, I’ll do a solo!"

519
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,880
Did he really break up with his girlfriend?

520
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,560
How should I know?

521
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,880
I’m not that close to him. Go ask him yourself.

522
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,040
No way, he might punch me.

523
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,120
My throat hurts. Give me that to drink.

524
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,240
Wait, I thought you weren’t close to him? Normally, he doesn’t share drinks with anyone.

525
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,440
Not as close as you guys.

526
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,080
I heard Hero saying they were helping each other out, taking turns, right?

527
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,640
Helping with what?

528
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,600
Ranking up, playing games?

529
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,600
Jerking off?

530
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,120
Come on, show me what you did.

531
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,600
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

532
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,120
Ouch!Just messing around, just messing around.

533
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,720
Why do you believe him? You’re crazy.

534
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,800
See? Just by touching him, this guy freaks out.

535
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,680
He doesn’t like anyone touching him.

536
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,840
Maybe you could grab his junk instead.

537
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,960
Keep it down, or you’ll wake my grandma.

538
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,240
You’re good at pretending to be drunk, you know.

539
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,800
I think I might actually be drunk. I see two beds.

540
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,800
Look, it’s not that. My dad bought an extra bed for you.

541
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,560
Thanks so much for helping him find a new job.

542
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,640
Oh, bless your dad.(Idiomatic: “Bless your dad, but I’ve lost my own benefit”)

543
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:53,040
Sit down for a minute. Come here. I’m dizzy.

544
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,640
It’s winter, you know. If you don’t sleep hugging me, you’re going to get sick.

545
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,800
Let it be cold for once. I’ve been burning up because of you for so long.

546
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,040
I know. Even if I don’t hug you, you’ll end up hugging me anyway.

547
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,200
You can’t sleep alone, can you?

548
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,000
Right?

549
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,560
Who’s going to sleep hugging you?

550
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,320
And by the way, I know now that you’ve never messed around with your friends.

551
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,240
Quit being nasty and sleep in your own bed.

552
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,920
If you don’t stop, I’m going to go sleep with my dad.

553
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,080
Alright, alright. I give up. Let’s just sleep

554
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,320
Done. Goodnight.

555
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,240
Show me a cutie sign.

556
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,440
Is your dad not coming today?

557
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,600
No, he’s busy with work.

558
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,040
Didn’t your mom come?

559
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,560
Why would she come and make a fuss?

560
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,640
Which way are you going?

561
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,240
My grades are out, and I don’t want to brag.

562
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,200
Where’s your class?

563
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,000
5/6.

564
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,800
What did your Kitty do wrong?

565
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,040
There’s a cop watching over him.

566
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,920
That’s Sergeant Sin, his dad.

567
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,240
Dad?

568
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,000
Dad, how did you get here?

569
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,160
I took some time off work, but I have to go back soon.

570
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,720
Hello, Dad.

571
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,640
So, today I have two sons, huh?

572
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,320
Wait, when did we become father and son? Who gave permission?

573
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,880
Well...

574
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,360
Hello!

575
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,240
By the way, Ginger looks familiar. Does your kid study here too?

576
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,600
What are you doing here?

577
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,040
Ah.

578
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,040
Well, I had a feeling Poppy would be at this school.

579
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,800
It's Parents' Day, and you didn't think to tell me?

580
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,320
Wait, Hero, you and him...?

581
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,600
Hold on, do you and Hero know each other already?

582
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:11,120
Pop, don’t tell me you and this woman...

583
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,560
Oh, you must be Pop’s father.

584
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,080
Yes, that’s right.

585
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,680
Where did you get the letter from?

586
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,400
Your aunt sent it to me. So, what’s going on?

587
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,240
So what?

588
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,040
Oh!son!

589
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,160
Pop?

590
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,200
I’ll take my leave. I’m not interested in staying for this circus.

591
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,560
Oh!

592
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,000
Hey!

593
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:52,720
Pop!

594
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,400
Hero!

595
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,240
Umm.That kid...

596
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,200
Hey, are you still holding onto your wedding suit?

597
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,120
Why did you wear it here?

598
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,600
Calm down, since we’re all here

599
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
, how about we go have a meal together?

600
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,760
Uh, actually, I’m not really available.

601
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,120
I’ve got to head back to work soon, so I’ll be leaving now.

602
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:28,040
Now that we’re here, why don’t we go visit Hero’s aunt? Let’s go pay our respects.

603
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,040
Umm.

604
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:29,760
Umm.

605
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,480
That's good too.

606
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:31,800
Let's go.

607
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,720
What’s up with Hero and Pop anyway?

608
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,360
That’s General Vorathee, son of Visanupong.

609
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,880
Is that kid related to them?

610
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,920
Get close to their son, and you’ll go far in life.

611
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,120
Before you start aiming for the future, make sure passing exams first.

612
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,960
Hey, Pop!

613
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,000
You liar!

614
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,120
About what?

615
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,320
Your dad and my mom?

616
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,120
Damn it, I just found out about this too.

617
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,880
Hey,

618
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,640
what are you doing?

619
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,480
I don't want to see your face anymore.

620
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,880
Do you think you're the only one who’s upset about this?

621
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,800
When my dad was with your mom, my mom was still alive,

622
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,080
you know? And she had to die because of my dad.

623
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,080
I’m more hurt by this than you are, got it?

624
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,480
Huh!

625
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,280
So, you hate my mom, right?

626
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,040
Then you don't need to be involved with me.

627
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,840
Yeah, I hate your mom.

628
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,080
She came into my life while I was still there. I left home

629
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,640
and told my mom I’d bring her son to live with me.

630
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,200
But you know what? I’m happy being here with you,

631
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,520
and I don’t want to drag your mom into this because it’s not your fault.

632
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,440
But what did I do wrong? Tell me, what did I do wrong?

633
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,560
No, you didn’t do anything wrong.

634
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,520
But when I see your face, I think of your dad.

635
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,960
And then

636
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,520
I have to remember how my mom left me and my dad behind.

637
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,480
Having you around

638
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,080
is like reopening the wound of my family.

639
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,360
You really compare me to that, huh?

640
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,480
You want me to leave, don’t you?

641
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,080
Pop,

642
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,240
you’re being so cruel.

643
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,840
Hero, Hero, do you want some Chilli Willy today, dear?

644
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,200
Do you want some Chilli Willy?

645
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,960
Chilli Dumplings, Grandma, dumplings.

646
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,800
They’re delicious, you know

647
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,360
It’s okay, I’m not hungry anymore.

648
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,560
What’s wrong? Are you crying?

649
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,200
No, I’m not.

650
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,920
Then come back and eat some another time, okay?

651
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,520
I don’t think I’ll be coming back here anymore.

652
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,840
Where are you going, dear?

653
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,720
Where are you going?

654
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,880
Wait, wait, take the dumplings with you.

655
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,800
You haven’t eaten anything today. Take them with you, please.

656
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:11,240
It’s okay, Grandma. Goodbye.

657
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,080
Hero, take the dumplings with you!

658
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,560
Hero, Hero!

659
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,840
Alright, student, let's recite the Metta Bhavana now.

660
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,520
Sabe sattā… May all beings, who are my fellow sufferers, be free from suffering…

661
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,640
Hey, Kitty, do you know why Pop didn't come to school today?

662
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,560
No idea.

663
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,080
Come on, we’ve been friends since middle school.

664
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,520
Aren’t you even gonna call him and check?

665
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,400
No.

666
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,680
I thought you cared about your friends more than that.

667
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,720
Look, when he has a problem, he keeps it to himself.

668
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,640
We're not nosy friends. If he wants to talk, he'll talk.

669
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,520
But what if something’s really wrong?

670
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,760
Like what?"

671
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,160
What if he got trapped by a ghost in the bathroom,

672
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,000
like in those horror movies?

673
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,760
Hold on, let me finish Metta Bhavana,

674
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,600
May all beings live in peace and happily, free from all sufferings and dangers.Satu

675
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,360
Why didn't Pop come to school today?

676
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,920
Tell Pop that I won’t be coming tomorrow, so he can come then.

677
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:12,000
Kitty… Kitty… Kitty!

678
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,560
What?

679
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,880
Where does Pop live? I’ll go check on him.

680
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,560
Are you really gonna be this nosy?

681
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,400
Yeah. Hey, Hero, pass on the message to Pop for me.

682
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,200
Ouch! Drive more carefully!

683
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,440
It's a rough road.

684
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,640
Do you want to ride?

685
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,600
"I don’t know the way.

686
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,240
Hey!

687
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,200
This atmosphere reminds me of a scene where the male and femal leading actors ride a bike together.

688
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,200
it's just biking.

689
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,280
Sit properly.

690
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,000
Sorry.

691
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,920
Biking is in Fan Chan, and in Season Change they hold an umbrella.

692
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,960
Season Change has biking too.

693
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,000
You watch a lot of movies,

694
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,240
huh? Must be talented, must be cool.

695
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,360
I wonder if it's free?

696
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,320
Why haven’t you come to school for several days? I came to check if you’re okay.

697
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,640
I’m fine, nothing’s wrong.

698
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,720
Good to hear.

699
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,720
Why do you have two beds? Do you have a sibling?

700
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,080
Why are you getting into his personal business?

701
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,280
Cause I want to know, what's your problem?

702
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:52,080
By the way, Hero said he won’t be coming to school tomorrow.

703
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:57,280
Do you two take turns coming to school, or is there something between you?

704
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,440
Only!

705
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,680
What?

706
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,120
Hero was talking to the principal today about transferring schools.

707
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,160
How did you find out about that?

708
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,560
Pink Sand duo told me.

709
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,360
Those two know everything going on in this school.

710
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,400
Those two, or is it really you?

711
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,120
Well, I don’t know as much as you, Kitty.

712
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,400
Hey...

713
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,600
Poppy.

714
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:54,640
Umm.

715
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,960
Hmm... Let me ask you something.

716
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,800
Do you really think Hero would just leave a good friend behind?

717
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:25,920
What's so good about him?

718
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,000
he never judges where I come from.

719
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,480
But he’s your stepmom's kid, right?

720
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,920
So, does that mean he's trying to steal your mom away?

721
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,280
Does that mean Pop stole Hero’s dad too?

722
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,480
No, Dad. It's not like that.

723
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,920
His dad actually took your wife.

724
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,920
You know, your mom and I split a long time ago.

725
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,280
They only just started dating and got married. It's no big deal.

726
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,840
I never held onto that.

727
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,840
But family... it's still a wound, a scar for us.

728
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:30,560
a wound

729
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,600
Listen to me, Pop.

730
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,400
If you hold on to the idea that a family has to be perfect,

731
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,960
you’ll never be happy.

732
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:52,120
A family doesn’t have to be perfect, with kids, a dad, a mom, grandparents, and all that.

733
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,240
Poppy.

734
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,800
no one’s life is perfect. If you cling to that, you’ll just end up unhappy.

735
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,120
Let go of it. What we have right now is good enough, isn’t it?

736
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,960
Now, go find Hero and bring him back.

737
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,000
But—

738
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,600
No buts."

739
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,080
A good friend like him? You’ve got to go get him back.

740
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,720
If you can’t bring him back, don’t bother coming home.

741
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,040
Dad—

742
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,560
Go, and take care of him."

743
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,600
Let's go.

744
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,960
Go now.

745
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,360
Go get him back.

746
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:09,920
Hey, stop!

747
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:10,640
Stay still.

748
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,920
What the . who are you?

749
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,640
Stay still.

750
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,960
Cover his face. Don’t let him see. Get in the car.

751
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,960
Stop struggling, damn it!

752
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,040
Get in the car. I said, get in the car!

753
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,520
Get in! Move! Move!
