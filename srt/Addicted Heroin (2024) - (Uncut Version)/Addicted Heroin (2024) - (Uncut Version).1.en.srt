00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,400
A.D. 2025

2
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,080
Hello, boss.

3
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,760
Hello

4
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,240
Hello, boss. Looking sharp today.

5
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,760
Too bad. He doesn't care about us.

6
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,640
Why are we holding this outdoors? It's so hot.

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
The hall is full.

8
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,800
Really?

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,320
Yes, we got canceled because the military needed it for an urgent event.

10
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,080
Military?

11
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,320
Yes, boss.

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,720
Alright, whatever.

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
Sir, this way please.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,000
You piece of shit

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,640
Why don't you just die already? What the hell are you doing here now?

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,080
What the hell are you doing?

17
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,320
Arrgh!

18
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
Are you a dog?

19
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
Why the hell did you kiss me?

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,000
Are you embarrassed? We've done more than this before.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
You're sick.

22
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,080
Yeah, I'm sick. And now.

23
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,960
I'm going to kiss you everywhere so you won't run off to Pailin again.

24
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,520
You're still not over that, huh?

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,520
No, I'm not. Come here.

26
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,120
What are you doing?

27
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
Get over here.

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Shit.. get off me.

29
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,680
Ouch.

30
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:44,280
A.D. 2018

31
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,640
Students, you may start your military exam

32
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,080
Remember, if you don't remove your shoes and metal objects,

33
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,600
you won't be allowed to take the military exam.

34
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,040
Sir, don't get involved with that family name.

35
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,960
Kulakanjanocha

36
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,520
Keep quite! Just focus on your exam.

37
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,160
158..159…
General Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister and head of the NCPO, is driving the roadmap to the elections

38
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:21,000
160
GNow, let's look at the Future Forward Party, a newly established party, which has elected Mr. Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit as its leader.

39
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,720
Can you handle it?

40
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,120
No problem, I could do this all day.

41
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
No problem, I could do this all day.

42
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,800
Trying to be banned until next year.

43
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,480
so I don't have to take the military entrance exam again

44
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,600
Be respectful to uncle.

45
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
He wants you to have a stable life, Hero.

46
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,160
And you know what?

47
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,360
No job is as stable as the military.

48
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,800
You don't understand, P'Saen.

49
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
I want to do what I love.

50
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,080
If mom were here, she'd understand me more.

51
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,000
Unless she die because of dad...

52
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Don't say that.

53
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
If someone hears, they'll misunderstand. He is really sad, Hero.

54
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,280
He is really sad, Hero.

55
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,840
Sad? He got promoted to General and married someone else.

56
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,840
That doesn't mean he didn't love your mom.

57
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,400
And I think...

58
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeah, right... Don't try to convince me to go to his wedding.

59
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,480
He's still your father, and it's an important event for him. You should go.

60
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,520
Should or have to?

61
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Please, he wants you to go his wedding.

62
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,880
200...

63
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,960
You said you wanted me to go, so I'll go tonight.

64
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Go tonight?

65
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,040
Hero, the wedding is tomorrow.

66
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
Hey, stop!

67
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,320
Stop or I'll shoot!

68
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,240
Hero, I'm glad  we can have a meal together.

69
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,320
Is there something you like? I'll get it for you.

70
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,120
No need, I'll get it myself.

71
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,560
I really like this... prawn and herb spicy salad.

72
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,760
Eating with many people makes it even more delicious, right?

73
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,280
Why don't you invite your child next time?

74
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,720
I'll try to invite them.

75
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,520
In 11th grade now, right? Same as him.

76
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,880
How's the studying going?

77
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,040
Not bad, he gets all A's every term.

78
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,920
Probably better than those famous Bangkok-school kids.

79
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,640
Not really. Bangkok kids have a wider range of skills.

80
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:51,360
My child, if I remember correctly, only won the first place in a national handwriting contest.

81
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,200
Kindergarten handwriting? That's funny.

82
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,000
A man's handwriting can tell your your behavior.

83
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,800
Good handwriting means stability.

84
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,760
Those with messy handwriting means rebellious.

85
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,560
Trust me! You'll never make any progress in your life.

86
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,880
Why not invite him to stay with us and study here?

87
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,840
Really?

88
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,400
um

89
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,280
Why don't you leave now? If you don't respect us, why are you still here?

90
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Why don't you leave now? If you don't respect us, why are you still here?

91
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:52,240
I won't arrest you on charges cutting my wedding picture because Aunt Khing asked me not to.

92
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,960
Because her person did it?

93
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:10,080
Ah! not be like that, she must be happy because she came into money when she married with a rich guy, right?

94
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,760
Stop barking or should I help you shut up?

95
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Calm down, please.

96
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,760
My son might not want to come because he's close to his father.

97
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,360
Even if he doesn't come, I'll still leave.

98
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,040
Calm down.

99
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,840
Here, take it. Today’s going to be a long night.

100
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,040
Do you think Hero will run away?

101
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,080
I don't know, but it used to happen before.

102
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,080
How far he can run away?

103
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,320
It’s such a hassle catching him back.

104
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,000
Sir, sir, Uncle, Hero ran away! Uncle!

105
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,440
Why did you leave a prestigious school for this one?

106
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,120
It's far from home.

107
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:03,880
When I interview kids, they always said that they choose a school close to their home.

108
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,760
what did your general father think about you moving here alone ?

109
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,720
He said go to blazes!

110
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,520
Family issues?

111
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,360
If we stayed together, we might kill each other.

112
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,160
He's still your father.

113
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,440
He's still your father.

114
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,160
Don't expect any kindness from him.

115
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,200
Aunt

116
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,280
This family is driving me crazy.

117
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,560
Aunt, you're the only family I have left.

118
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,120
I've changed schools, but I'm still doing well.

119
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,240
If I study here, I will be the top of my class with a soaring GPA.

120
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,880
You are making such a confident face!

121
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,960
My confidence is high, and my skills even higher.

122
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,480
However, you need a guardian to enroll in the school.

123
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,760
A guardian means an elder who consents me to enroll and that is you.

124
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,400
I'll use my mom's surname.

125
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,840
If I use my dad's, Kulkanchanaocha, my classmate will bully me for sure.

126
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,360
New Gen!

127
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:43,160
And don't tell anyone I'm your nephew or the principal's nephew, cause they'll bully me for it.

128
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:51,560
Fine, but I need to talk to your dad first.

129
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:58,080
Why? If I can't study here, I might end up turning to a life of crime.

130
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,560
You don't want that, do you?

131
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,880
Don't try to threaten me, I need to talk to your dad first. aren't you?

132
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,760
And besides, my house is...

133
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,560
Don’t worry, Aunt.

134
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,680
I’ll rent a place in the shared house nearby.

135
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,080
Someone wrote that they’re renting out the second floor, so I can stay there.

136
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,680
Leaving home and still wanting luxury.

137
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,320
You won't last long; you'll want to come back soon.

138
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,400
No way.

139
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
Even though it's hot in the countryside,

140
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,640
I can handle it. I’ve ridden my motorcycle through it with no problem.

141
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,800
Alright, students, pair up.

142
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,680
We need to wrap up this project quickly.

143
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Number 21, where are you?

144
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,240
The assignment is to break down the Thai poems that we used to learn

145
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,480
analyze poems structure, and identify the external and internal rhymes.

146
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,240
Still analyze Thai poems these days?

147
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,480
Even sober, I’m drunk with love’s drink!

148
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,600
Are you hungover?

149
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,200
Write it on the paper.

150
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,440
What did you say?

151
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,320
Even sober, I’m drunk with love’s drink!

152
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,160
What d’you think might put it aside?

153
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,640
Mid-day cup dilutes morn’ cup of wine

154
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,840
But love’s wine keeps me drunk all the day.

155
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,600
Do you write this or scribble it?

156
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,240
He spoke too fast.

157
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,200
A man's handwriting reflects his status, but yours is a mess.

158
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,760
Lersilp, your handwriting is neat, right?

159
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,480
Write it clearly and quickly.

160
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,640
Are you drunk?

161
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,040
Are you writing with your feet?

162
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,280
What kind of Thai script is this?

163
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,760
There's no head on the letters,

164
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,600
and the only word I can make out is misspelled.

165
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,240
Are you clueless or just messing with me?

166
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,840
Your handwriting might be decent, but your explanations are terrible.

167
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,440
Did you even pay attention in class?

168
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,000
Do you know how to break it down properly?

169
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,440
How do you know?

170
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,920
Look at Lersilp—his handwriting is amazing.

171
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:38,840
Take note and follow his example.

172
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,600
Good job.

173
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,880
A man's handwriting can tell your your behavior.

174
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,160
Good handwriting means stability.

175
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,520
Those with messy handwriting means rebellious.

176
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,760
Trust me! You'll never make any progress in your life.

177
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,640
My child, only won first place in a national handwriting contest.

178
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,240
Kiddie

179
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
Don't call me "kiddiel".

180
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,960
I've called you that since kindergarten. Aren't you used to it?

181
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,960
Give this to the handsome guy.

182
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,760
Which handsome guy, Pop?

183
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,800
Pop's handsome, but I’m talking about someone else.

184
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,680
On, On.

185
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,160
On

186
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,640
what's on ?

187
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,200
My name is Only.

188
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,240
Make sure you call me by it.

189
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,120
That's hard. It's a superstar name.

190
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,520
Better than you, Tiger.

191
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,080
What's wrong with Tiger?

192
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,440
It's fine, but your face suits Kitty cat more.

193
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,520
Don't interfere. Here.

194
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,720
What are you doing?

195
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,520
Homework. I missed class yesterday.

196
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,760
Homework? Oh shit,

197
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,440
I missed it too. Pop, can I borrow yours?

198
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,280
It's with me.

199
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,240
Why are you so mean?

200
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,880
Do you want mine?

201
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,000
Can you even read this?

202
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
Your handwriting looks like a mess.

203
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,000
You copied it wrong too.

204
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
Just wait and copy from Tiger over there.

205
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,240
No thanks.

206
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,880
Let me copy too.

207
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,520
Don't come close to me.

208
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,400
Copy it.

209
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
Don't sneeze on me!

210
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,880
Tiger, hand in the homework for me.

211
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,240
Okay.

212
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,920
Stay away from me.

213
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,240
Take mine to copy. I'll hand in Pop's first.

214
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,440
Wait, give me a pen.

215
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,960
(Sneezes)

216
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,560
is it armstrong's cannon ?

217
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,040
You picked a tough one.

218
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,840
Don’t get too cocky just because you’re smart.

219
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,720
I let you sleep in class because I know you have problems at home,

220
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
but you’re the one who’s really messed up.

221
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,680
Acting out isn’t impressive.

222
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,120
Doing homework for others?

223
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,880
Trying to make extra cash?

224
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,600
Your friends miss out on learning and opportunities.

225
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,000
Punishment for disrespecting me.

226
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Who messed with Pop?

227
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:46,360
They threw out all his paint and ruined his shoes.

228
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,360
Now he has to buy new ones himself.

229
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,040
His dad works hard to support the whole family.

230
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,840
What about his mom?

231
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,600
Pop said he doesn't have a mom.

232
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,000
Take off socks.

233
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,160
Hey!

234
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,600
(stepping on wood) Damn it.

235
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,680
Where is he going? We've been walking for hours.

236
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Hello, Dad.

237
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,480
You're back.

238
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,000
Do you walk to school every day?

239
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,840
It's so far.

240
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,680
Dad, where are the needle and thread?

241
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,720
Under the TV, under the envelopes and bills.

242
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,760
P'Harn, I've brought some food.

243
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Let me see.

244
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,800
Not sure if you'll like it.

245
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,040
P'Harn, Why are you letting your son wear torn shoes?

246
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,960
You said you don’t have a mom?

247
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,040
Are you lying?

248
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,960
I did it myself,

249
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,640
sorry, Dad.

250
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,840
It’s alright.

251
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Pop takes care of his things,

252
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,000
but they must be worn out by now.

253
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,480
Time for some new ones.

254
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,280
Why are your underwear torn?

255
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,120
It’s wet. I wrapped it in a towel and stepped on it to dry.

256
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,080
It’s been raining a lot.

257
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,400
Why is it torn?

258
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,800
How do you wash it?

259
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,600
Frequent washing makes it wear out.

260
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,200
We have few clothes and must rotate them daily.

261
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,280
You should buy more for your son.

262
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Borrow from me if needed.

263
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,480
What kind of person can’t even afford underwear?

264
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,440
No need,

265
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,560
Aunt Jeab just bought me new clothes.
Aunt...

266
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,440
What should we do? You can't wear these shoes.

267
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,600
My school has a fund. I'll ask for new shoes.

268
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,920
If you get the scholarship, that’s great.

269
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,120
I brought some fish today just in case you’re hungry.

270
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,240
Let me see what's there.

271
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,240
Poppy,

272
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm going to work now.

273
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,880
Don't forget to give  medicine to grandma before bed.

274
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,600
Okay.

275
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,200
Mom, can I stay with you?

276
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:15,640
remember this word, I love you.

277
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,720
Will he report me to the teacher again?

278
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,480
Hmm...

279
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,040
Youth can't buy alcohol.

280
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,080
I'm old enough, here.

281
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,160
Lying.

282
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,520
You might look older, but you’re in the same grade as me.

283
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,800
You’re insulting me again

284
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
Take this.

285
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,600
Pop,

286
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,200
you do homework for others, right?

287
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,320
Do you also teach handwriting?

288
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,920
Handwriting?

289
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,160
Why you want me teah now?

290
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,000
Well,

291
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,960
I want to outdo my stepmother’s son.

292
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,080
Can’t stand them, you know?

293
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,120
I can teach you,

294
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,720
but it’ll cost you

295
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,480
Sure. and for this, how much is it ?

296
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
I told you, I’m not selling.

297
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Just take this instead.

298
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,120
Money!

299
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,440
Pop,

300
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,240
can I copy your math homework?

301
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,880
Why are you here?

302
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,240
I came to study, isn't that normal?

303
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,640
Don’t bother him.

304
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,240
Just come for the handwriting lessons.

305
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,040
What's this?

306
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,760
Payment.

307
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,880
Here

308
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,440
Famous steamed buns,

309
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,400
there are many people wating in line.

310
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,160
You give underwear as gifts?

311
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,760
How sweet.

312
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,680
Why give me these?

313
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,280
Don't you need them?

314
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,520
You work to buy these things.

315
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,200
Look at your shoes.

316
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,080
How did you know I needed these?

317
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,040
I'll be straight with you.

318
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,520
Everything that happen to you, I did all of this by myself.

319
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,800
What do you mean?

320
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,160
I ate your bun filling,

321
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,880
squeezed oranges on your ruler,

322
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,160
mixed up your colors,

323
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,880
took screenshots for the teacher,

324
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,320
cut your shoe laces,

325
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,560
and tore up your notebook

326
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,760
Why did you do that to me?

327
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,520
Calm down.

328
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,840
You reminded me of my stepbrother.

329
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,680
Just like that?

330
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,320
Yeah.

331
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,040
I don't mind anymore, because I know you're just like me.

332
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,560
Who would want to be like you?

333
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,280
Alright,

334
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,840
I've returned your paper.

335
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,440
But I want handwriting like this.

336
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,160
Teach me, please?

337
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,880
Before you worry about your handwriting,

338
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,200
fix your attitude.

339
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,520
Keep your papers to yourself.

340
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,520
Pop

341
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,400
Lersilp,

342
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,720
haven't you handed in your competition essay?

343
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,080
I've already sent it.

344
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,760
Ms. Amara is asking.

345
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,840
Hurry up, before the deadline.

346
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
Why did you take my competition essay?

347
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,960
Oh, I already told you.

348
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,600
I gave it back to you

349
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,000
I’m not talking about that one.

350
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,680
I mean the essay I submitted for the competition.

351
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,960
What?

352
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,840
You want to do this?

353
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,600
Do what?

354
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,360
Pop,

355
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,400
I get your essay back.

356
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,440
I did a lot to you.

357
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,560
Lock me up.

358
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,200
Feel better now,

359
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,280
Pop?

360
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,440
Pop, are you there?

361
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,800
Hey, I've got an essay.

362
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,040
I stole it from the teacher.

363
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,120
The one from class 6/5.

364
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,200
What's his name?

365
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,840
6/5

366
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Lersilp, Yeah. I'll copy it for you. Hold on a sec.

367
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,480
Squeezing out yellow watercolor look like poop is better.

368
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,960
What the hell! Who did this?

369
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,960
Damn it, it's all over me! What did you squeeze?

370
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,200
It stinks. Is it poop?

371
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,200
What's going on?

372
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,920
That kid in the next room is bullying me, teacher.

373
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,120
Whoever's in that room, come out now.

374
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,480
I can't come out. I've been locked in by my friend.

375
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,760
He’s bullying me!

376
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,440
Pop, that guy, he stole your essay

377
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,640
See that,

378
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,840
It wasn't me. You locked up the wrong person

379
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,000
Who stole from whom?

380
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,800
Who locked whom up?

381
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,520
Let’s discuss this in the principal's office.

382
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,440
Now!

383
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,320
Why are we getting punished?

384
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,880
We weren't  the ones wronged here!

385
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,920
Explain!

386
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,120
Well, you were stolen your competition essay,

387
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,040
so I get revenge him for you.

388
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,040
Oh,

389
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,480
so it's just like when you hated me like your stepbrother's son

390
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,720
and tore up my homework and messed up my stuff. like that?

391
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,920
I already bought new stuff for you.

392
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,200
Just take it.

393
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,240
You solve problems with money.

394
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,680
Do you just feel better and think everthing is done?

395
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,800
What about my feelings?

396
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,120
I don’t say this often,

397
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,880
but I’m sorry.

398
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,200
Just leave it with the chicken poop.

399
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,480
Come get my apologize when you’re ready.

400
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,560
Eggs come from a chicken’s butt,

401
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,600
like poop.

402
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,840
No wonder omelets are yellow.

403
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,280
It’s fried poop.

404
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,240
And why are you even talking about this?

405
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,520
Baby chicks are yellow too.

406
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,840
Living poop, right?

407
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,960
How did you grow up to think like this?

408
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,280
Next time, order fried poop at a restaurant.

409
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,600
What’s for dinner?

410
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,240
Water spinach and green curry.

411
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,040
Want to try some?

412
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,000
I don’t eat water spinach.

413
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,880
I forgot, sorry.

414
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,320
Your dad’s cooking is good.

415
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,480
Dad,

416
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,040
did you mistake sugar for MSG again?

417
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,680
I’ll cook a new one.

418
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,000
Don’t eat yet, Mom.

419
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,160
Hey,

420
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,600
Dad, what happened? Why is your shirt this color?

421
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,640
I saw that your shirt was yellow,

422
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,320
especially around the armpits, so I used some indigo to try and make it whiter.

423
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,520
Wow, Dad,

424
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,000
it’s not white; it’s blue now

425
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,360
Yeah, it is blue.

426
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,720
It’s okay, I’ll get you a new one.

427
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,200
Did your paycheck come in already?

428
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,200
Dad,

429
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,200
we still haven’t paid for the sports shirt and gym uniform.

430
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,840
The teacher said if we don’t pay,

431
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,440
Pop’s grades won’t be released this term

432
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,080
I’ll do more overtime.

433
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,000
Then you don’t need to do the housework. I’ll take care of it

434
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,120
No,

435
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,000
you need to use your time for studying.

436
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,560
Pop, you’re in high school now.

437
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,440
You need to focus on your studies to get into a good university

438
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,080
and land a good job

439
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,040
You’re saying that again.

440
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,160
I’ll cook again.

441
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,640
Don’t cook for me.

442
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,600
I’ll go get medicine for Grandma at the health center.

443
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,880
Do you need money for Grandma medicine?

444
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,400
No, it's fine.

445
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,040
The same medicine is covered by the gold card.

446
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,760
Mom, I’ll cook this new.

447
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:00,600
(Yawns)

448
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,040
Why so early?

449
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,200
Aunt, could you please take a look at this essay?

450
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,240
Oh, this is Lersilp's.

451
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,280
Why didn't he submit it since yesterday?

452
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,320
The deadline has passed.

453
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,160
Come on, Aunt,

454
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,720
you know he was bullied by his friends.

455
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,400
It's not fair that he didn't get to submit his essay.

456
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,560
It's also not fair to those who submitted on time.

457
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,320
Rules are rules.

458
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,840
Seriously, Aunt?

459
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,840
No one else was bullied like this.

460
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,680
It's not fair.

461
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,760
Hold on.

462
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:02,160
Are you concerned about your friend because you care about them?

463
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,240
He's not my friend.

464
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,720
He hates me.

465
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,840
But that's not the point.

466
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,240
Well, your father said you're narrow-minded and inconsiderate,

467
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,480
that you discriminate and create barriers.

468
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,000
What's the point?

469
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,840
Oh, is this about my stepmother and the issues there?

470
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,440
Well, if it's about that, then yes.

471
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,360
She's your father's wife,

472
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,080
and her children are your siblings.

473
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:35,040
In the future, you’ll need to rely on each other.

474
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,680
Rely on each other like parasites and leeches?

475
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,840
Poppy,

476
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,600
come talk to me first

477
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,040
Stop or I'll shoot!

478
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,880
I won’t live with him.

479
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,760
If he interferes, he’ll regret it.
