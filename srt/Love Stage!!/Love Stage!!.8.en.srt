2
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:46,591
Look at that, our son has returned.

3
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,418
Yes.

4
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,312
Don't just stand there.

5
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,672
Come sit with us.

6
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:13,478
Mom, Dad, aren't you wondering where I went?

7
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,998
Jet told us already.

8
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:22,214
And is there anything you want to tell us?

9
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:36,398
P'Ryo and I...

10
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:37,673
We...

11
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:45,389
P'Ryo and I, we...

12
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:48,159
- Dear...
- What?

13
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:51,441
You really like to bully your son.

14
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,498
Son, did you get a video?

15
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:57,432
I'm just kidding.

16
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,534
You don't have to say anything.

17
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:00,832
We already know.

18
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:02,663
You know?

19
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,561
Know what?

20
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:05,919
What do you know?

21
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:09,518
What do you really want us to know?

22
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:16,652
Then...

23
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,078
Are you both okay with it?

24
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:23,518
How could we not be okay with it?

25
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:26,558
On that day,

26
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:31,778
your dad was the one who hid the kiss scene from the script.

27
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:39,576
Will Anda be able to do this?

28
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:45,712
You can't do that.

29
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:49,827
As long as you are happy,

30
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,838
we can accept whatever it is.

31
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:59,709
But now my main concern is

32
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,958
that Ryo is famous.

33
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:06,238
I don't know if his fans can accept it.

34
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:10,598
Yes, when I was with your dad in the past,

35
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:12,977
we had to date secretly for many years.

36
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,414
When I was pregnant with your brother, Tee,

37
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,947
I even had to go abroad to give birth.

38
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,633
Although times have changed,

39
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:34,998
celebrity love lives are still a very sensitive matter.

40
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,172
You will have to be careful.

41
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:50,798
I understand, Dad.

42
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:49,538
- Anda -

43
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:56,142
Did you miss me?

44
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,638
Not at all.

45
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,398
I just couldn't sleep.

46
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,758
You've only been without me for one night.

47
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:07,598
Narcissist.

48
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,438
What are you doing?

49
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,572
Laying down.

50
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:14,878
Did I disturb you?

51
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:17,364
I was laying here thinking of you.

52
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:20,078
Too bad, I didn't miss you.

53
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,545
Then, it's just me missing you.

54
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:25,530
Then, don't think about it and go to sleep.

55
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,959
I don't want to.

56
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:29,892
Let me hear your voice.

57
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:31,577
Okay?

58
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:35,358
Don't you have a shoot tomorrow?

59
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:38,225
You remember my work schedule?

60
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:41,238
I don't remember at all.

61
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:44,484
Now, go to sleep.

62
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:46,217
Good night.

63
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:48,518
Good luck tomorrow.

64
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:51,082
Okay.

65
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,905
You went to the beach and came back an idiot.

66
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,238
Who are you calling idiot?

67
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:01,618
I'm just reading manga.

68
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:03,150
Can't I laugh?

69
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:06,724
Didn't you cry while watching "Love Superstar"?

70
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:12,638
But you've been laughing since class started.

71
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,138
Because I've been very happy since then.

72
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:19,318
So, what happened at the beach?

73
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:20,434
Let's hear it.

74
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,111
Wait a minute...

75
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,840
How did you know I went to the beach?

76
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,758
Bank told us.

77
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:45,839
Bank, can you help me keep it a secret

78
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,239
that I went to the beach with P'Ryo?

79
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Of course.

80
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,238
I only told the two of them.

81
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:54,038
Why do you ask?

82
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:57,128
It's nothing.

83
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,598
I just... don't want others to know.

84
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,552
You can't go missing anymore, okay?

85
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:10,157
Those two were really worried, you know?

86
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:12,158
If it wasn't for me,

87
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,600
they would have called the police already.

88
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:20,009
Can you imagine the scene that would be?

89
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,438
I also...

90
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:31,262
was very worried about you.

91
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:34,758
Yeah, I know.

92
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:38,497
If you weren't, you wouldn't have sent so many messages.

93
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,497
Right?

94
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,810
Da

95
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:54,005
I'll be leaving now, Bank.

96
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,497
Who taught you to dress like this?

97
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:05,616
Why?

98
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:07,907
It's even more suspicious than before.

99
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:12,448
Really?

100
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,284
Look, look.

101
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:16,139


102
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:18,351
Go, what are you still looking at?

103
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,293
Don't laugh.

104
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,861
What are you looking at?

105
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:44,056
I'm looking at you.

106
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:53,031
No matter how much you love it,

107
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:56,131
this is the one thing you can't steal.

108
00:10:57,124 --> 00:11:00,478
Actually, you can steal it.

109
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:03,212
But you have to buy two more to repay me.

110
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,133
Okay.

111
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:13,651
Don't you have one?

112
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:18,318
Something that you won't let anyone steal from you.

113
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:24,398
Of course I do.

114
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,941
You want to answer that it's me, right?

115
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:32,633
Wow, you understood me so well?

116
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:40,684
P'Ryo, can we take a picture with you?

117
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:44,414
So shy...

118
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,226
I need to use the restroom.

119
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:51,396
We can finally take a picture with P'Ryo.

120
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:54,641
Are you ready?

121
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:55,783
Go ahead.

122
00:11:58,938 --> 00:11:59,938
Thank you.

123
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,397
1 2 3

124
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:07,081
So cute.

125
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,558
Smile.

126
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:12,128
1 2 3

127
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,165
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

128
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,033
You're welcome.

129
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:21,858
Anda

130
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:23,638
I have something to tell you.

131
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,281
What is it?

132
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,680
About Ryo...

133
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:30,618
I hope the two of you will be more cautious.

134
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,870
I sent a private detective

135
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,912
to investigate that paparazzi incident.

136
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,838
So, did you find anything?

137
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:49,478
Is there anyone that might know that you and Anda were there?

138
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:55,758
There probably is.

139
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:59,439
But I really don't think it could be them.

140
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:03,758
You need to be careful what you do for now.

141
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,423
We're already being careful, P'.

142
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,861
Really?

143
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:11,141
Look at this cup.

144
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:18,738
With just this,

145
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,718
everyone can guess.

146
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:28,438
Be more careful.

147
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:32,238
Your fame has nothing to do with me.

148
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:38,318
But I don't want Anda to suffer because of it.

149
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,278
I hope you understand now.

150
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,658
I understand, P'Jet.

151
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:11,708
- What's hidden behind the cup? -
- Why did the two of them share a drink so intimately? -

152
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,953
- The two of them shared a drink? -
- Who did he go with? -

153
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:21,279
- Who did he go with? -
- Sharing a drink? -

154
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,747
- It's his friend -
- I remember it was a guy friend, not a girl -

155
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:23,874
- Come here, I'll scold you until you beg for forgiveness -

156
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,366
What's the matter, Bank?

157
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,708
Oh, it's nothing.

158
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,264
I'm just taking a look.

159
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:05,228
You know, you're on the diet. Be careful what you eat.

160
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:08,428
Tomorrow, we need to go to the gym to burn it off.

161
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,162
Okay.

162
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,793
You've taken so many days off.

163
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,726
Your muscles have disappeared.

164
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,888
This workout will be even more intense than before.

165
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:18,945
Okay, P'.

166
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,329
Do you remember what I said?

167
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,148
You must become even better than Ryo.

168
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,394
I remember.

169
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:27,394
Very good.

170
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,394
But if you want to be better than Ryo,

171
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,848
I can't do this alone.

172
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:33,948
You must help.

173
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:34,948
You know it, too.

174
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,248
I won't give in to P'Ryo.

175
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:38,289
Good.

176
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,191
Oh, can I have this?

177
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,128
Have it.

178
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:43,342
I won't eat it.

179
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,137
Needless to say, your figure is important.

180
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,137
Believe me.

181
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:50,511
Okay.

182
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,533
Hey, let's go to the movies today.

183
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:04,414
Yesterday's incident still hasn't passed.

184
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,947
That's such a small matter.

185
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:07,287
I'm already used to it.

186
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,541
It's a common problem.

187
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:13,432
Even I don't know what our relationship is.

188
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,188
We can go anywhere.

189
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:16,188
It will be fun.

190
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:25,468
What is it?

191
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,597
So, will you come?

192
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:28,954
Nope.

193
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,188
Why not?

194
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:33,924
I have better places to go.

195
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:35,265
Where?

196
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:37,394
I'm not telling.

197
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,708
You sit there and wait.

198
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,388
I'll cook for you today.

199
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:51,214
Wait a minute...

200
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,894
Did I hear you wrong?

201
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,516
You heard me right.

202
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,176
I'll be cooking for you.

203
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:00,126
Will it really be edible?

204
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,772
Just trust me.

205
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:04,239
I read about it online.

206
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:45,237
Everything ok?

207
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,021
Everything's great.

208
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,322
I'll teach you.

209
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:19,868
Okay.

210
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:30,159
See, if we eat like this,

211
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,494
no one will be able to take pictures, right?

212
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:37,947
It's possible that someone is still waiting to secretly take a photo.

213
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:41,728
If he wants to work so hard, just let him be.

214
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:01,801
The life of a celebrity is so troublesome.

215
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:07,328
You say that like you weren't born into a celebrity family.

216
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,424
I only realized it after experiencing it myself.

217
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:18,168
Actually, it's really troublesome.

218
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,168
But if you ask me to choose,

219
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,798
I would still want to be famous.

220
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:24,806
Why?

221
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,211
It would be nicer

222
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:29,108
if your life wasn't as chaotic.

223
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:31,896
Because I like how things are now.

224
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:35,208
Doing the work I love

225
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:37,928
and making people happy.

226
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,048
If I wasn't here,

227
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:44,528
there would be someone else instead.

228
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:46,968
But there's no guarantee

229
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,928
that person could make the fans as happy as I can.

230
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,528
Or maybe they could be happier.

231
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,008
We can't control these things.

232
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:01,888
You really love your fans.

233
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,048
Why wouldn't I love them?

234
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:07,738
I'm here today because of the fans' support.

235
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:12,219
You're my fan too, aren't you?

236
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:15,208
Who's your fan?

237
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,356
I just...

238
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,768
want to give you encouragement to work well.

239
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,009
Nothing more.

240
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,995
But I'm also conflicted.

241
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:32,579
Because I have to be cautious like this.

242
00:24:33,528 --> 00:24:35,385
I wonder...

243
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:38,168
if they knew who I really am,

244
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:43,288
would they still be happy to accept me?

245
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,670
Say something for us.

246
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:49,654
Hello everyone. I'm Ryo.

247
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,293
What are you doing today, Ryo?

248
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,825
I'm shooting an ad.

249
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:57,174
It's very fun.

250
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,264
Oh, is that me?

251
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:06,848
Surprised?

252
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:22,664
P'Ryo, are you okay?

253
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:25,921
Sorry.

254
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:29,936
I feel like this every time I watch this video.

255
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,749
Because...

256
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,827
I lied to you

257
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:44,408
about being a girl?

258
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:47,194
Not at all.

259
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:52,083
Because this is the last video

260
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,083
that I made with my parents.

261
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:02,743
What happened?

262
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,990
They parted ways

263
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:09,860
and went abroad.

264
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:13,368
They both remarried and have their own families now.

265
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,396
They might have forgotten about me by now.

266
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:24,211
Must be lonely.

267
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,890
Hm?

268
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,038
I mean you must be...

269
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:31,649
So lonely.

270
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:37,768
Yeah... so lonely.

271
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:42,389
You might have to stay with me tonight.

272
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,658
Stop that.

273
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,710
Let me sleep at home.

274
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:50,248
If I sleep at your place,

275
00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:52,481
P'Tee will surely break his way in.

276
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:56,834
I'll let you go back.

277
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:59,048
But you have to let me take you.

278
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:00,048
Okay.

279
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:02,357
Let's go.

280
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:06,696
What?

281
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:12,168
That is, you should put some distance between you and Bank for now.

282
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,008
Why?

283
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:22,020
There are few people that knew we went to the beach that day.

284
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:27,848
I suspect the person who took the photos was...

285
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:28,848
Bank.

286
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,608
P', you're overthinking it.

287
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:42,934
Let's go.

288
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,551
How was it?

289
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:08,048
Wow, awesome, Bro.

290
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,421
Did you try it?

291
00:28:09,517 --> 00:28:10,517
Try what?

292
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:12,407
My secret coffee recipe.

293
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,510
You tried it so you could sing better, right?

294
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,030
If it was because of your coffee,

295
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:18,873
I would be dead by now!

296
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,488
Or is it that...

297
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:24,725
you went to the beach and met with someone?

298
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:26,589
That's why you're singing well.

299
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:33,245
I just got a little inspiration, that's all.

300
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:47,867
Got a little what?

301
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,958
To be hiding it like this,

302
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:53,278
it must be love.

303
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:56,798
Love, love, love...

304
00:28:58,282 --> 00:28:59,832
Oh, shut it!

305
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,313
Do you want to keep it secret?

306
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,558
I don't want to ruin P'Ryo's future.

307
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:26,556
His work and his fans...

308
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,598
It's his whole life.

309
00:29:34,354 --> 00:29:35,954
But I don't know why

310
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:40,078
when I think about it,

311
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,737
I feel hurt.

312
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,337
It's weird.

313
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:51,442
I don't think...

314
00:29:52,719 --> 00:29:54,719
I can give you advice on this.

315
00:29:56,148 --> 00:30:00,558
Because I still don't know the answer myself.

316
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:05,794
I can only say that it's between the two of you.

317
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,202
You'll have to decide together.

318
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:11,478
No matter what you choose,

319
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,878
it will affect both of your futures.

320
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,215
Hello, P'Ryo.

321
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,333
Bank

322
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:49,708
You scared me.

323
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,758
I was just about to lift some weights.

324
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:53,438
Can you give me a hand?

325
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,025
I'll help.

326
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,398
Just let me finish up first.

327
00:30:56,956 --> 00:30:58,556
Then, I'll help you.

328
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:19,949
Are you working out in the mornings now?

329
00:31:21,284 --> 00:31:23,438
I've been needing to work out more recently.

330
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:25,324
I go for a run in the afternoon, too.

331
00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:27,374
So, I moved my workouts to the morning.

332
00:31:28,342 --> 00:31:30,022
Why exercise so much?

333
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,989
If I don't exercise,

334
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:35,034
I won't be able to catch up with you.

335
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:38,949
I also want to be...

336
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:40,558
the "national husband."

337
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,935
Don't be in a hurry to catch up.

338
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:46,158
Why?

339
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,652
Bank

340
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:00,187
are you dating anyone?

341
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:03,833
I'm not.

342
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:10,038
If you were, would you make it public?

343
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,658
Of course.

344
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:15,213
There's no need to overthink it.

345
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:23,036
If you make it public,

346
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:25,316
how can you still be "national husband"?

347
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:30,238
Think carefully, Bank.

348
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:32,906
Once you enter that ring, you can't leave.

349
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,840
Whether it's photos or news,

350
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,574
it will follow us forever.

351
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:40,681
If you want to be in the entertainment industry,

352
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:44,118
it comes at a very high cost.

353
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:48,918
Thank you, P'.

354
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:51,621
I'll be careful.

355
00:32:54,176 --> 00:32:55,604
P', you...

356
00:32:57,923 --> 00:32:59,603
should also be careful.

357
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:02,391
What do you mean?

358
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:06,564
Just if a national husband like you

359
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:08,802
were to reveal your partner,

360
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:10,822
it would probably be a big scandal.

361
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,901
Be careful

362
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:15,358
so you don't lose anything.

363
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,973
I'm going to take a shower, P'.

364
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:25,252
So I can hurry to catch up.

365
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:27,140
- Wake up, Anda -

366
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,553
- A bright morning awaits us -

367
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:31,307
- Wake up, Anda -

368
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:32,203
- A bright... -

369
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,518
No matter what you choose,

370
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,918
it will affect both of your futures.

371
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,359
So what should we do then?

372
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:02,647
And... ACTION.

373
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,463
P', you...

374
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:11,143
should also be careful.

375
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:12,873
What do you mean?

376
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:15,774
Just if a national husband like you

377
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:18,173
were to reveal your partner,

378
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:19,718
it would probably be a big scandal.

379
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,171
Be careful

380
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:24,410
so you don't lose anything.

381
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,104
Hey, go take a look at him!

382
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,333
Break, break.

383
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:46,361
It's well written.

384
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,538
You could be a professional.

385
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:50,838
You're exaggerating.

386
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,423
It was you who taught me how to write songs.

387
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:55,318
But I don't have any skills, Bank.

388
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:58,926
I just write about my feelings.

389
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:00,606
I write with my heart.

390
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,661
Write with your heart?

391
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:07,189
If you write love songs,

392
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:08,549
you have to love.

393
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:10,145
Right?

394
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:16,318
P'Ryo

395
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,686
Anda, come with me.

396
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:20,916
What's wrong?

397
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:26,148
Just come on.

398
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:28,948
I have something to tell you.

399
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:30,748
You should calm down first.

400
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,418
Sorry, Bank.

401
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:36,314
I don't need to explain to you.

402
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:39,558
Do you have a problem with me, P'?

403
00:36:40,338 --> 00:36:41,338
Let go.

404
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,358
Are you sure that what you're going to tell Anda

405
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:46,616
isn't about me?

406
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:49,203
What if it is?

407
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:51,718
If it is, just say it to my face.

408
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:54,657
Don't say it behind my back.

409
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:56,609
Like how you peeked at my phone this morning.

410
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:02,380
Let go.

411
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:05,184
What are you doing, P'Ryo?

412
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:06,255
Follow me.

413
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:24,113
What's wrong with you, P'Ryo?

414
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,953
I told you...

415
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,633
to stay away from Bank.

416
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,160
What do you mean by telling me that?

417
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:35,007
Do you want me to break up with my friends?

418
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,551
Believe me, Da.

419
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:39,855
He's very suspicious.

420
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:41,981
You're talking nonsense.

421
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:45,013
And also,

422
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,870
it's only what you think.

423
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,638
Bank isn't like that, P'.

424
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,438
What reason does he have to do that?

425
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:03,273
You must know something.

426
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,826
What did you see on Bank's phone?

427
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:13,264
About that...

428
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,782
Did you find evidence that he took the photos?

429
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:28,023
I don't understand what's going on with you.

430
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:36,277
But what you did was wrong.

431
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,358
Go calm down first.

432
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:41,958
Then, we can talk.

433
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:45,835
Anda

434
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:16,621
I brought you the things for tomorrow.

435
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,727
Ryo

436
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:31,880
Will you tell me?

437
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,918
The reason you couldn't film this morning?

438
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,438
I think I must be crazy, P'Aigo.

439
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:45,316
What's wrong?

440
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,289
Why are you crazy?

441
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,699
It's about the suspect who took those photos.

442
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:57,318
I suspect it was Bank who took those photos of Anda and I at the beach.

443
00:39:57,835 --> 00:40:02,932
Because Anda talked only to him when we were in Pattaya.

444
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:05,099
But I can't find a reason

445
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,998
to prove why he would do it.

446
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:11,379
I also thought it's unlikely.

447
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:15,646
Until this morning.

448
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,255
I saw his phone wallpaper.

449
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:27,476
If he really likes Anda,

450
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:30,104
it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to do that.

451
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:31,453
Because...

452
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,876
he could really ruin my relationship with Anda.

453
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:38,203
But I still don't have any evidence.

454
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:42,003
Knowing that...

455
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:46,529
I'm overthinking everything by myself.

456
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:49,436
But I can't stop myself.

457
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,294
The more I think about it,

458
00:40:54,294 --> 00:40:56,561
Bank isn't the "national husband."

459
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,986
He isn't as famous as I am.

460
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:04,383
He could show his relationship with Anda clearly.

461
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:11,305
The more I think about it, the more jealous I get.

462
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:18,283
Just thinking I might lose Anda...

463
00:41:20,118 --> 00:41:21,348
Ryo

464
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,380
You're not crazy.

465
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,158
It's just jealousy.

466
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,948
I've been jealous of an ex before,

467
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:44,516
but I've never been like this.

468
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:48,638
Because you never had such a deep affection for someone.

469
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,870
So, what should I do?

470
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:15,880
Hey, wait a sec.

471
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,534
Did you see my message on Line?

472
00:42:58,605 --> 00:43:02,427
- If they knew what I am really like, would they still be happy to accept me? -
