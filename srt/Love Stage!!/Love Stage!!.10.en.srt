7
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,016
Is there something you want to say?

8
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,043
Mom and Dad are here for you.

9
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:05,800
I... made my decision.

10
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:07,933
I'm fine.

11
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:37,160
Hello, P'.

12
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Hello.

13
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:40,183
Are you doing okay, Ryo?

14
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:41,526
Yes.

15
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,808
I slept well and remember the script.

16
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:44,733
I'm very well.

17
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,460
Don't make anymore bloopers.

18
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:48,775
Okay.

19
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,215
Sit here and wait.

20
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:52,184
I'll have the staff call you.

21
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:53,304
Thank you, P'.

22
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,920
I made the right decision to accept this job for you, right?

23
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,520
Of course, P'.

24
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,513
This is my first job in a long time.

25
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:19,162
If you didn't accept, I'd be upset.

26
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,506
I know.

27
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:25,166
I know you have the spirit of an artist
and a good actor.

28
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,095
But...

29
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:28,544
On the other hand,

30
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,960
I can see how you're acting.

31
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,673
I'll go get you some water.

32
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:55,548
I'm doing it for you.

33
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,404
I thought you said water-

34
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,419
P'Tee

35
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,640
Long time, no see.

36
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:11,453
Yeah, P'.

37
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,488
I happened to be filming in the studio next door.

38
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,288
So I dropped by to see you.

39
00:05:17,898 --> 00:05:21,960
Then, why did you want to see me?

40
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,053
I just wanted to ask

41
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:27,120
if there's anything you want to ask me.

42
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:39,720
P'Tee

43
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,420
Is Anda okay?

44
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,214
You want to know?

45
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:52,894
But I won't tell you.

46
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,462
I can tell

47
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,680
that Anda wants to go back to you.

48
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,720
But even if he wants to,

49
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,160
he will never come back, will he?

50
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,600
Actually, there is a way.

51
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,831
Want to know?

52
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,798
How much did you pray?

53
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:37,280
I went to 9 temples to do meritous deeds

54
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,200
and managed to get three tickets.

55
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,178
Three tickets?

56
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,184
Yeah, one is for Anda.

57
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,950
He seems really depressed.

58
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,180
Taking him to see Lala is guaranteed to cure him.

59
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,240
Will he really go?

60
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:53,528
Da

61
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:57,680
Will you go to Lala's fanmeet this Saturday?

62
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:00,643
I don't think he heard.

63
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:09,626
Da-da

64
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:13,977
Do you know where the game "Splendor" comes from?
(TN: "dor" sounds like ending particle from Isaan/northeast dialect)

65
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,258
From the northeast! 
(TN: "dor" sounds like ending particle from Isaan/northeast dialect)

66
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:19,126
If it came from the north, it would be "Splenjao".
(TN: "jao" sounds like Lanna dialect from north)

67
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,809
If it was a southern game-

68
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:22,034
That's enough.

69
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:24,772
Stop before you're too embarassed.

70
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,334
Listen to my story.

71
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,506
A few days ago,

72
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,061
I went to a restaurant with a couple of friends

73
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:32,015
and decided to order wine instead of water.

74
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
And then?

75
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:36,469
So I called the waiter over.

76
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:39,600
"Waiter, waiter, wine please."

77
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,864
Then, the waiter came back with 6 glasses of water.
(TN: "wine" and "6" both sound like "hok")

78
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:44,050
Then, I said

79
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,880
"No, we're talking about different 'hok'"
(TN: Also means "6 cups per person")

80
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,358
Then, the waiter went back to the kitchen

81
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:53,720
and came back with 36 cups of water.

82
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,268
36 cups?

83
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:05,701
Did you just laugh?

84
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:08,040
How was my terrible joke?

85
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,189
What are you playing at?

86
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:17,360
We want to cheer you up.

87
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,680
Thank you.

88
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,684
I thought P'Jet was coming to pick me up.

89
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,625
Jet is working.

90
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:55,474
You're not used to me picking you up?

91
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,320
You always know me so well.

92
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,341
Anda

93
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:13,676
About Ryo, are you really sure about your decision?

94
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,347
Well, didn't you tell me

95
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:23,240
that there isn't a right or wrong answer?

96
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:26,644
No matter which path I choose,

97
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:28,710
I can't be completely satisfied.

98
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:33,360
So, I think this is the best way.

99
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,733
It's the best path for P'Ryo.

100
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,360
In that case,

101
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,893
I can treat Ryo however I want, right?

102
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,907
P', what do you mean?

103
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,368
I'm not telling.

104
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,280
Charge-Charge with me to replenish energy.

105
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,958
CUT

106
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,933
Great job.

107
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,502
Thank you, Bank.

108
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:59,686
Did you come alone today?

109
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,053
Yes.

110
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:02,373
Nice work.

111
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,680
We fnished in just a few shots.

112
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:05,433
Thank you.

113
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,543
Yeah.

114
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,840
What's wrong?

115
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,480
You were avoiding me earlier,

116
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,360
but now you want to see me?

117
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,520
I wasn't avoiding you.

118
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,226
I just wasn't ready to tell you yet.

119
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,080
Then, are you ready to tell me now?

120
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,182
Yeah.

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,258
Since I met you,

122
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:01,303
I've never seen you this upset before.

123
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,360
I also want to know

124
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,803
what it is upsetting you so much

125
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,560
that you don't want to talk to me.

126
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,387
It's about you and P'Ryo.

127
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,956
Honestly...

128
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,440
Honestly?

129
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,088
Honestly, I've always been jealous of you guys.

130
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:48,460
But, there's nothing to be jealous of.

131
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,880
What if...

132
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,160
I like you?

133
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:21,280
I...

134
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,258
I might have to reject you.

135
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,320
Even if you're not with P'Ryo anymore?

136
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,328
Yeah

137
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:49,495
We still couldn't be together.

138
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:50,511
Why not?

139
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,957
Didn't you see what happened to P'Ryo?

140
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,846
If that's how it ends,

141
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,148
can you really be happy with it?

142
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:22,667
What if I left behind all the fame for you?

143
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,849
Will you look at me then?

144
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
What?

145
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,584
Anda, did you watch the livestream?

146
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,647
Live?

147
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,426
I sent it to you.

148
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:12,426
Watch it.

149
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,202
Okay, everyone watching don't forget to

150
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:21,686
- Like!
- And...

151
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:22,194
Like!

152
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:24,120
Why so many likes? It should be shared, too!

153
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,800
Don't forget to share!

154
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:31,800
There are so many people today.

155
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,880
There are so many people watching because...

156
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,760
we have a special guest, right?

157
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Right!

158
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,873
Will this really work, P'?

159
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:45,360
My room is right next door to Anda's.

160
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Trust me.

161
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:49,520
If you do this, Anda will definitely change his mind.

162
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:05,030
It's just because P' already has more fans than me.

163
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,108
Hey, P'Tee...

164
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,640
The song Ryo created to woo-

165
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:13,540
Uh, I heard P'Ryo is going to sing for us, right?

166
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:20,162
That's right.

167
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,612
This song was written together with someone else.

168
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,600
♪ Sometimes it seems like you love me ♪

169
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,732
♪ Sometimes you seem unfamiliar when we're talking ♪

170
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,509

- You come out and sing comfortably, but we haven't forgotten the lies you told -

184
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,260
- Don't you want to come out and clarify? It's better to make things clear -

185
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,558
- So brazen -

186
00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:06,380
- Ryo refuses to clarify, but comes out to sing comfortably, doesn't care about fans -

187
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm very sorry.

188
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,920
I didn't expect things to blow up so much.

189
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,839
I'm used to it.

190
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:41,447
You causing trouble, that is.

191
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,520
I just want things to be better, Da.

192
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,298
If it's something that has ended,

193
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,880
you should just let it go.

194
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,680
Why bring it up again?

195
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:08,123
Do you really want it to end like this?

196
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:11,684
Da

197
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,880
In this lifetime,

198
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,664
you can meet only a few

199
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:21,320
that will love and care for you this much.

200
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I already know that, P'.

201
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,920
I already know...

202
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
how sincerely he loves and cares for me.

203
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,000
That's why I'm afraid.

204
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm scared...

205
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,200
his life

206
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,240
and his dream

207
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,140
will be ruined because of me.

208
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,581
For your whole life,

209
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,000
you've been living with fear

210
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,359
until Ryo walked into your life.

211
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,840
He gave you the courage to be happy.

212
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:27,980
But now, why do you tie yourself up with fear again?

213
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:32,920
I don't want to be selfish.

214
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:39,050
Anda

215
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:46,240
Sometimes it's okay to be selfish.

216
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,599
Da, Tee

217
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,360
Have you seen this livestream?

218
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,904
I've been trying to find the best way for everyone.

219
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:05,411
For fans,

220
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,160
for those who support me,

221
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,957
for me,

222
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,663
and also

223
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:17,563
for those who are in the news because of me.

224
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,728
Come and listen to tomorrow's press conference.

225
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,826
Everyone, I'm inviting you again.

226
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,512
What if I gave up all the fame for you?

227
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:37,660
Will you look at me then?

228
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:40,200
I've always been looking at you, Bank.

229
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,168
Whether you are willing to exchange your fame or not,

230
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:59,880
you will always be my cherished friend.

231
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:43,153
Are you sure about this?

232
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:54,913
Thank you, P'.

233
00:22:58,181 --> 00:22:59,953
For everything.

234
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:29,355
Why is this happening?

235
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,440
P'Ryo is going to ruin his future because of me, isn't he?

236
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:38,480
Anda, listen to me.

237
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,449
No matter what Ryo chooses,

238
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,320
it's his choice.

239
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
Hm, is it possible?

240
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Ryo will say something else at press conference?

241
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,800
Something else?

242
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:59,559
For example, that the photo was edited maliciously.

243
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:02,826
Something like that might be believed.

244
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,540
Let's just pray for Ryo to get through this difficult time, okay?

245
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,554
- Bank: I know it's impossible, -

246
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:20,038
- but I really hope -

247
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:21,916
- you can also look at me once in awhile -

248
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,603
- I can only do this much for you -

249
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:25,283
- Please laugh again, Da -

250
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:29,787
Anda, look.

251
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,295
I want to confess to everyone.

252
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,760
The ones who exposed the photo of P'Ryo

253
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:47,724
was me and P'Ae, my former manager.

254
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,187
Just to damage P'Ryo's reputation

255
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,280
so that I can replace P'Ryo.

256
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:03,120
What is it?

257
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
Have you really decided?

258
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:05,998
Yes.

259
00:25:06,982 --> 00:25:08,716
I will explain everything.

260
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,758
Fine, say it.

261
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:16,378
You're really going to destroy your future like this?

262
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:18,448
Go ahead.

263
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,360
Did you think I'd be afraid?

264
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:24,640
If I fall, you won't come out unscathed.

265
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:26,884
Bastard.

266
00:25:28,306 --> 00:25:30,337
P', you can do whatever you want.

267
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:32,880
But I'm ready to admit my mistakes.

268
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,492
That's right.

269
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,725
All the edited photos.

270
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,680
I'm sorry, P'Ryo.

271
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,880
I'm sorry, Anda.

272
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:47,372
Score!

273
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:50,562
As long as Ryo doesn't deny it's an edited photo,

274
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:51,420
the trouble will be over.

275
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:07,093
P'Aigo

276
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,760
This is Anda.

277
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,128
Bank came out and admitted that he released the photos

278
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:17,049
and they were edited.

279
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,060
Whoa, really?

280
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:19,149
Look.

281
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:29,000
It's such a shame Anda didn't come.

282
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:33,928
If he came, he would have been so happy now.

283
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:37,320
We invited him, but he didn't come on his own.

284
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:41,120
It's lucky the ticket could still be resold.

285
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:45,111
In this situation, we have to take pictures to show it off to him.

286
00:26:56,403 --> 00:26:57,640
Ryo, Ryo.

287
00:26:58,207 --> 00:26:59,562
Wait a minute.

288
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,110
We need to talk

289
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Look...

290
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:11,280
Bank just held a live saying the photos were edited and released by him.

291
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,263
But those photos were real...

292
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:20,688
Yes, but this is our chance.

293
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:22,547
If we go out and confirm this,

294
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,080
everything will be resolved.

295
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:28,183
But...

296
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:34,440
We end up lying to everyone.

297
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:40,100
Just let it all end with me instead.

298
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,080
Ryo, won't you think about it at least?

299
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,600
I already though about it, P'Aigo.

300
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,686
I don't want to lie anymore.

301
00:27:58,402 --> 00:27:59,880
I've prepared myself.

302
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:01,647
If I lose everything,

303
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,560
I'll go to America and live with my family.

304
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:13,140
Don't worry about me, P'.

305
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:15,080
Ryo...

306
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:37,732
What did Ryo say?

307
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,300
Is Ryo going to say anything or what?

308
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
He might want to tell everyone the truth.

309
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,520
- P'Aigo: Ryo is going to have the press conference -

310
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:04,218
I'm going to stop P'Ryo.

311
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:06,798
He wouldn't listen to anyone.

312
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:09,115
But if it's me,

313
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,111
surely he'll listen.

314
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,699
Isn't it too late, Anda?

315
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,079
When you get there,

316
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,560
the press conference might already be over.

317
00:29:59,002 --> 00:29:59,840
Hello, everyone.

318
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:07,778
Oat

319
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,921
There's something I need your help with.

320
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:26,805
Thank you, friends from media and fans

321
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,668
for attending this press conference.

322
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:33,560
This is my last press conference.

323
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:35,958
What do you mean by that?

324
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:40,760
(It's Mission Impossible again lol)

325
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:49,800
Auntie, Auntie, look out!

326
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:04,072
P', get moving.

327
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,820
After this press conference,

328
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,100
I'll be going abroad to live with my family.

329
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:22,444
Shit, it's so dark.

330
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:23,702
So dark...

331
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,720
What is this?

332
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:36,671
What do we do?

333
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:41,468
Oh, let's pull the switch.

334
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:42,609
Where is it?

335
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:56,977
This one?

336
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:06,193
It won't move.

337
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:19,120
So, the rumor that you like boys is really true?

338
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,680
I can't do it.

339
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:27,696
Let me try.

340
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:33,145
About that...

341
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,137
Excuse me.

342
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:55,855
Excuse me.

343
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:22,340
Relax, relax.

344
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:43,080
My answer to the question everyone wants to know is...

345
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:48,589
I don't like boys.

346
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,600
I love a boy.

347
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:15,320
The boy I love is...

348
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Anda

349
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:39,883
P'Ryo

350
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:43,602
Why are you doing this?

351
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:48,119
I won't lie anymore, Anda.

352
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:52,349
No matter how many times I think about it,

353
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:53,469
I choose this.

354
00:34:57,689 --> 00:34:58,689
I mean...

355
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:01,275
why are you kissing me?

356
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:04,981
I'm embarrassed.

357
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,101
So embarrassed

358
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,500
You're with me, don't be shy.

359
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:18,844
Then...

360
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:22,665
Let's do it again.

361
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:59,552
Jet, you won't allow this to happen again, right?

362
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,893
I really don't know, Mrs. Chaim.

363
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,040
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

364
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,760
I'm talking about Anda's hair and makeup.

365
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:12,001
No matter if you're in a hurry,

366
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:13,822
the hair and makeup must be beautiful.

367
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:15,720
There were so many reporters.

368
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,840
Isn't this the entertainment industry?

369
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,663
I understand.

370
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:27,413
I will work harder.

371
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,800
- The national husband, Ryo, officially announces he likes boys -

372
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,380
- So what if he likes boys? Does his acting get worse? 
#Love the real Ryo -

373
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,720

375
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,214
P'Aigo, hello.

376
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,554
Oh, Bank.

377
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
Nice to see you here.

378
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,077
I've been trying to call you,

379
00:37:06,077 --> 00:37:08,320
but it seems like the number is disabled.

380
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,940
Oh, I changed my phone number, P'.

381
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,800
Well, I have something to talk to you about.

382
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,160
About the damages I caused for P'Ryo?

383
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
No.

384
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,000
Ryo actually doesn't mind about that.

385
00:37:29,266 --> 00:37:32,400
What I want to talk to you about is...

386
00:37:33,171 --> 00:37:37,674
would you like to come to work under my agency?

387
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,920
P', are you serious?

388
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:46,872
You're not making it up?

389
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,360
Thank you, P'.

390
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:52,388
Thank you.

391
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:04,448
Here.

392
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:21,808
Nervous?

393
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:27,800
With you, it's much better.

394
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,972
I won't be nervous anymore.

395
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,940
Are there still butterflies flying around in your stomach?

396
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,320
The butterflies flew away.
(TN: "Pheesuya" is butterfly)

397
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:40,310
Only the no-eyed ghost is left.
(TN: "Pheedabo" is no-eyed ghost)

398
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,640
Don't be so cute.

399
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:49,040
I'll have to hide you away.

400
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,640
Let's take a picture.

401
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:57,916
Okay.

402
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,263
1 2 3

403
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:10,880
Hey, P'Ryo

404
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,720
When Ryo and Anda's press conference had aired,

405
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,963
many fans expressed that they wanted to see another ad from Happy Wedding.

406
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:30,560
We are also very excited.

407
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,720
Let's do this, Ryo, Anda!

408
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:40,920
I brought the clothes you wanted.

409
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:48,732
Jet, look at this.

410
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,453
They're already way ahead of us.

411
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:54,138
Yeah.

412
00:39:57,488 --> 00:39:58,880
What's wrong?

413
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,520
Do you want to be public like them?

414
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,280
What are you saying?

415
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,220
I'm fine like this.

416
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:19,183
What are you doing?

417
00:40:20,842 --> 00:40:22,122
Posting a photo.

418
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,017
I want to see

419
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,640
if it will get as much attention as Ryo's.

420
00:40:28,777 --> 00:40:30,580
Stop it.

421
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:35,000
Spend your time writing new songs instead of this.

422
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:39,784
Are you sure you want it this way?

423
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:44,236
This kind of thing

424
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,107
still depends on our method.

425
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
Even if you post photos

426
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,208
and let the world know we love each other,

427
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:54,733
it's meaningless if we don't take care of each other.

428
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:10,284
Everyone ready?
