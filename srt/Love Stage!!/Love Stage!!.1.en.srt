2
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,950
Nervous?

3
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,130
Well, I've never done anything like this before.

4
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,900
This is also my first time.

5
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,890
You don't look afraid at all.

6
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,090
Of course, I'm afraid.

7
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,900
My mom used to tell me

8
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,250
when I'm really scared

9
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,500
just focus on this marble.

10
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,660
Hold it over your chest and then recite the spell:

11
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,460
Calm down, calm down.

12
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,570
Then all fear will disappear.

13
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
Calm down, calm down.

14
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,320
Feel better now?

15
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,660
Hey,  what's that?

16
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,050
And that was our first encounter.

17
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,330
Since the first time, I couldn't forget her.

18
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,000
I would like to thank all the newlyweds

19
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,410
that trust and choose Happy Wedding for the past 10 years.

20
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,290
In the future, we will continue to uphold the idea

21
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,500
of letting every couple be beautiful on the stage of love.

22
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,240
Actually, on this year's 10th anniversary,

23
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,220
we have prepared a surprise for you.

24
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,260
But let's keep it a secret for now.

25
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,830
10 years like the blink of an eye.

26
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,100
Yes, that little boy Ryo has even grown to be famous now.

27
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,340
Did you know?

28
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,740
Really?

29
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,620
Really, look here.

30
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,000
But he doesn't seem as famous as I was before.

31
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,440
Who would compare with a great artist like you?

32
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,770
Da

33
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,300
Don't you want to be like Ryo?

34
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,680
I don't.

35
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,400
Didn't I already tell you?

36
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,650
But you haven't tried it yet.

37
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,900
I have tried it.

38
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,340
I was in that ad just now.

39
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,640
And after that?

40
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,570
Make it romantic...

41
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,840
Romeo, tell me you love me.

42
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,440
I...

43
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,930
I love you.

44
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,900
Then, you kiss me now, Romeo.

45
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,390
I can't escape.

46
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,220
Mr. Kevin, Mrs. Chaim...

47
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,100
I have arranged singing and acting lessons for Anda.

48
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,320
Did you ever plan to ask me

49
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,520
if I want to do the lessons or not?

50
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,740
Da, but this class has excellent teachers.

51
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,270
It's a very good offer.

52
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,070
I asked Jet to discuss for a month before reserving.

53
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,270
But I don't want to go, Dad.

54
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,930
Da, we just want the best for you.

55
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,850
If you really want the best for me,

56
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,500
let me be a manga artist like I've always dreamed of.

57
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,490
But Da-

58
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,860
I'm full.

59
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,870
P'Jet, I won't go to any lessons.

60
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,100
What were you arguing about?

61
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,980
Same old.

62
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,520
Our parents still won't stop forcing Anda to sing?

63
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,980
They're probably hoping that Anda will be as good as his brother.

64
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,410
I'm not good.

65
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,570
It's just that our preferences are different.

66
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,880
Do you know what Anda likes?

67
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,350
You've been the manager here for a long time.

68
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,100
You should know what Anda likes.

69
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,870
Do you know what I like?

70
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
I like...

71
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,550
your toast!

72
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
What are you drawing?

73
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,220
Don't look.

74
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,360
It's not finished yet.

75
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,450
Are you going to enter the competition?

76
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,280
No.

77
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,310
You won't enter?

78
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,270
None of your business.

79
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,700
Anda

80
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,580
Yes, Professor.

81
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,070
What filter should you use to polarize light from water?

82
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,890
Uh...

83
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,090
Filter... uh...

84
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,640
You use a CPL filter, Professor.

85
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,810
Correct, Bank.

86
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,870
But I didn't ask you.

87
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,230
Bank

88
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,460
Thank you, Bank.

89
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,050
You're welcome.

90
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,170
Don't forget to study hard.

91
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,280
Next time,

92
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,350
I might not be able to save you.

93
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,740
Next time, I'll be more serious

94
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,820
about avoiding the professor's wrath.

95
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,900
Where are you going next?

96
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,520
Want to go home together?

97
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,940
I'm not going yet.

98
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,130
I'm also going to the club room with Oat and Book.

99
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,510
Want to come with us?

100
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There's a lot of comics to read.

101
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,690
Next time.

102
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,550
I have another shoot today.

103
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,110
I'll be going first.

104
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,220
What kind of person is he?

105
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,930
So handsome and cool.

106
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,080
Why? Is that your type?

107
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,070
It's just a compliment.

108
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,730
So you're really going to draw for the competition, right?

109
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,740
But I probably won't make it.

110
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,320
If you don't make it, try again next year.

111
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,130
But this is the last year.

112
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,260
Are you going to stop drawing?

113
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,280
Don't give up so easily.

114
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,730
My parents want me to do something else.

115
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,680
Something else? What is it?

116
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,600
I'll be an actor or something.

117
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,910
A shy bastard like you?

118
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,530
But if I can draw well

119
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,490
and win the contest,

120
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,870
my parents might reconsider

121
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,970
and allow me to continue drawing.

122
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,720
Don't tell me

123
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,030
that you joined the drawing club

124
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,210
as an excuse

125
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,750
so you don't have to become an actor.

126
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,150
Not at all.

127
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,240
The reason I paint

128
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
is because of my dream.

129
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,350
I want to draw a manga with Lala as the heroine.

130
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,000
This is Lala, the hottest idol right now, isn't it?

131
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,480
If Lala saw this,

132
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,180
she wouldn't even recognize herself.

133
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,460
Oh, Lala, you say...

134
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,390
Enough.

135
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,390
Laughing.

136
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,060
Still laughing.

137
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,490
Stop.

138
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,960
Where there's effort, there's success.

139
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,770
It's your duty to support me.

140
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,460
We will become successful cartoonists.

141
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,040
We will be a sucess!

142
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,580
Let's work hard!

143
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,810
Come on!

144
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,870
And now the audience of our Music Box broadcast wants to know

145
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,430
What is Lala's dream man like?

146
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,100
My dream man, right?

147
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,670
It is a man who cares for me.

148
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,410
Someone warm and caring.

149
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,440
A boy like this is probably my type.

150
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,240
Before we leave,

151
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,710
let's let Lala tell us about her latest projects.

152
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,780
Soon I will be releasing a new album.

153
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,670
The album is called "Love in Music."

154
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:38,140
It will be sweet and divinely cute like me.

155
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,010
Please support me.

156
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,210
P'Ryo!

157
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,080
P'Ryo, I'm a big fan of your work.

158
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,070
I see...

159
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,450
You're Lala, right?

160
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,420
Yes.

161
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,210
Can I take a photo with you?

162
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,260
Of course.

163
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,950
Okay, 1 2...

164
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,410
Thank you.

165
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,580
Love You.

166
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,700
Oh my god!

167
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,070
Oh my god...

168
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,890
Ryo

169
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,430
Ryo

170
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,390
Ryo

171
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,120
You surprised me, P'Aigo.

172
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,030
I stood here calling you for so long.

173
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,620
Sorry.

174
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,840
I was thinking.

175
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,390
Well, I'm used to it.

176
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,220
It's like this whenever you're holding that marble.

177
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Which god are you worshipping?

178
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,200
It's not from a temple.

179
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,690
It just reminds me of the past.

180
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,450
Love interest?

181
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,910
No, P'.

182
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,090
That's right, P'Aigo...

183
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,350
Was there something up?

184
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,060
Oh, someone just called me.

185
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,950
We have an urgent job next week.

186
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,810
Next week...

187
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,080
I don't want to.

188
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,100
I think I will go to Chiang Mai to rest.

189
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,460
Please don't accept it.

190
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
So cancel with him?

191
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,520
Yes, P'.

192
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,490
Hello, Happy Wedding, right?

193
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,900
About shooting the ad next week...

194
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,170
Hello, Happy Wedding, right?

195
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,350
Um... This is Ryo.

196
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,510
I'm very excited for the shoot.

197
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,860
I will definitely try my best.

198
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,800
Anyway, you can talk to P'Aigo about it.

199
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,610
Goodbye, see you.

200
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,630
Thank you, we will contact you again soon.

201
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,830
Yes, yes, thank you.

202
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,170
I'll really become deaf like this.

203
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,250
So do you want a vacation or work, Ryo?

204
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,610
Well, I just remembered

205
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,690
there was a storm in the south so I don't want to go yet, P'.

206
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,050
Wait, wait, wait.

207
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,970
But you just said Chiang Mai, right? (TN: in Northern Thailand)

208
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,770
Chiang Mai.

209
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,490
Yes, Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai.

210
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,650
The weather in Chiang Mai isn't very good recently, P'.

211
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,230
It's better to stay in Bangkok and work, right?

212
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,510
Sure.

213
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,970
Da, I've been wondering for awhile...

214
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,100
but your surname seems so familiar.

215
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,480
Lots of people have a name like this.

216
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,140
But you are being forced to be an actor.

217
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,400
Is it because your parents are celebrities?

218
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,020
You think too much.

219
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,370
Anda, I'm here!

220
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,350
What's wrong, Da?

221
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,010
Well, let's go the other way.

222
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,770
Hey, that's Tee from Crusherz, isn't it?

223
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,400
Who is he waving to?

224
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,520
Whoever he waves to, it's his business.

225
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,850
Let's go.

226
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,670
Wait a minute.

227
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,770
I mean, where did your surname come from?

228
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,600
You are the little brother of P'Tee

229
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,200
from Crusherz, right? Right?

230
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,940
P'Tee from Crusherz?

231
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,980
So then that means...

232
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,090
your parents are...

233
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,280
That's him!

234
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,590
Good luck, P'.

235
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,090
Yes, yes, hello everyone.

236
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,980
Hello

237
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,780
Anda, wait for me.

238
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,960
Anda

239
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Anda, please wait.

240
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,060
Anda, here I come.

241
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,560
Oh, P'Tee, where are you taking me?

242
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,300
P'Tee

243
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,010
Let's drink pearl milk tea together.

244
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,450
P'Tee

245
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,980
Didn't I tell you that you didn't have to come and pick me up?

246
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,880
Aren't you happy that your brother is famous?

247
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,350
It will make it hard for me to live as a human, P'Tee.

248
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,870
I don't want it to be like high school.

249
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,010
My friends asked for your autograph every day.

250
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,100
And the teacher wanted our parents'.

251
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,720
If you're willing to give yourself a chance,

252
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,550
you might be more famous than me.

253
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
I don't want to be famous.

254
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,650
I just want to be a normal person.

255
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,490
Anda

256
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,610
Whatever you want to be,

257
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,880
I love you the same.

258
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,960
You don't need to proclaim your love.

259
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,470
I don't want it.

260
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,070
Then, just take the milk tea.

261
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,430
I'll be right back.

262
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,170
200% sweetness large pearl milk tea.

263
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,300
Do you want it?

264
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,800
Or not?

265
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,400
If not,

266
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,090
it's mine.

267
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,330
No.

268
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,330
You don't like the big pearls.

269
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,060
This one is mine.

270
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,990
Now, tell me honestly.

271
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,660
Why did you come to pick me up from school?

272
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,350
Is something going on at home?

273
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
Not at all.

274
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,800
I won't do it anyway.

275
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,150
Absolutely not.

276
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,570
But they insisted on using

277
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,520
the same actors as 10 years ago.

278
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I tried my best to talk to them,

279
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,750
but they really insisted on this.

280
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,760
But Mom...

281
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,440
Will you really make me dress as a girl again?

282
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,080
I'm not a child anymore.

283
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,370
Who would believe it if I dress up now?

284
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,870
My son...

285
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,470
For this event, Mrs. Erin will also come to see herself.

286
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,990
You can be assured there's nothing to worry about.

287
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,400
Also, my son

288
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,940
is so small

289
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,580
and has a cute face.

290
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,090
Look at your cute nose and mouth.

291
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,580
You'll be so beautiful dressed as a girl.

292
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,610
Dad

293
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,550
Isn't it easier to just find another girl?

294
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,130
No one even knows

295
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,080
that child was me.

296
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,830
But it's what the client wants.

297
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,890
I don't care.

298
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,290
I don't.

299
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,630
Tell him to go find someone else.

300
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,290
Thank you.

301
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,360
Are you writing a new song?

302
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,610
Looks like the song will be nice.

303
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,180
Is the song title "Nothingness?"

304
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,450
It's called "I Can't Think of One."

305
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,460
Hey, Jet...

306
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,420
What do you think about the situation with Anda?

307
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,490
If Anda refuses to do it,

308
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,650
we should just reject the client.

309
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,240
Well, I think I know a way.

310
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,150
Don't turn down the offer yet.

311
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,840
Let me try this first.

312
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,780
That's-

313
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,980
Lala's singing alarm clock!

314
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,710
Do you want it?

315
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,000
Are you trying to bribe me to shoot the ad?

316
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,750
I don't want it.

317
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,010
Wait a minute.

318
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,970
Look!

319
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,040
That's Lala's latest album!

320
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,140
Why? Do you want it?

321
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,980
I don't want it at all.

322
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,270
I can buy it myself

323
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,320
and support Lala.

324
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,310
Wait

325
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,960
- Wake up, Anda -

326
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,020
- a bright morning awaits us -

327
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,030
Do you want it, little bro?

328
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,210
That's-

329
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,600
Lala's voice recorded alarm clock.

330
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,660
Do you want it?

331
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,350
I want it, I want it.

332
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,770
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,680
I agree, P'Tee

334
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,370
I'll do it for the alarm clock.

335
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,390
I'll even dress as a girl, alien, or zombie.

336
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,350
Come on, let me have it.

337
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,430
Give it, P'Tee.

338
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,650
P'Tee, I want it.

339
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,620
Anda

340
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,750
Clock, my clock...

341
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,160
What's wrong?

342
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,400
I'm not quite ready yet.

343
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,500
Let me calm down here first.

344
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,150
Are you thinking of sneaking away?

345
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,530
I wouldn't do that, Dad.

346
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,900
This is a very important step for you.

347
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,550
If you pass this,

348
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,330
there's nothing to be afraid of.

349
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,540
Mom and dad will wait inside for you.

350
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,740
Okay.

351
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,010
New staff?

352
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,890
Are you lost?

353
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,050
So where are you going?

354
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,810
The dressing room.

355
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,970
Oh, it's over there.

356
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,790
I'll take you there.

357
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,360
Hello.

358
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,230
Uncle Kevin, Aunt Chaim...

359
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,550
Hello

360
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,820
You can call me P', little Ryo.

361
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,140
Okay, P'Chaim.

362
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,290
I haven't seen you for a while.

363
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,940
You've gotten so big.

364
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,010
You've grown up to be so handsome.

365
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,920
You shouldn't say that, Aim.

366
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,250
Just look how the little boy from back then

367
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,880
became such a big star now.

368
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,580
I still can't compare with you two.

369
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Oh, stop it.

370
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,120
Don't tease us.

371
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,720
Anyway, about today...

372
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm very glad we can work together again.

373
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,370
I am also very happy.

374
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,670
Okay, P'Aigo.

375
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,470
Thank you very much.

376
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,030
I'll be going now.

377
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,800
My manager called me to get ready.

378
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,870
Okay.

379
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,340
So now you've found the dressing room.

380
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,730
Yes .

381
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,980
How did you meet him?

382
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,390
I was lost and met him by chance in the studio.

383
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,940
Then, I'll go get dressed now.

384
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,700
Everthing went well, right?

385
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,820
Everything is fine.

386
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,670
What are you afraid of?

387
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,530
Mrs. Erin came down to oversee it herself.

388
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,530
No matter what, no one will recognize him.

389
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,130
If we lie to P'Ryo, it's not a sin, right?

390
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,160
Lie?

391
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,790
Who's lying?

392
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,380
We just didn't mention it, that's all.

393
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,090
But you don't need to worry.

394
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,730
Because the people at Happy Wedding

395
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,830
also don't want anyone to know.

396
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,970
Did you find it?

397
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,270
Find what?

398
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,010
That girl.

399
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,620
You went out to look for her, didn't you?

400
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,330
No, I was just going for a walk, P'.

401
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,640
Don't make excuses.

402
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,690
You've been here dozens of times,

403
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,240
but suddenly today is good for a walk?

404
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,050
Alright, enough talking.

405
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,390
I don't know what to say.

406
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,090
Hello.

407
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,950
Hello, Erin.

408
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,070
Hello P'Erin.

409
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,340
Do you remember me?

410
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,490
I always remember.

411
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,400
Thank you very much, Ryo, for coming to help with the ad.

412
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,770
I hope we can work well again.

413
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,010
Let's make it better than before.

414
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,570
Anyway, happy filming today.

415
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,240
Thank you very much.

416
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,840
By the way,

417
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,020
who is the actress that plays the bride?

418
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,330
It's still the same person, right?

419
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,720
Really?

420
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,700
Really, P'.

421
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,040
Then, if she can't film, who can film?

422
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,630
You were the one who saved our shoot that day.

423
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,200
Do you remember?

424
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,730
The little actress got sick that day.

425
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,830
The script is much better now.

426
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,420
Have you gone to inform the actor yet?

427
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,180
Done.

428
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,720
Is this Anda's part?

429
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,430
You can't do this.

430
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,540
- What do I do now? -

431
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,360
- What do I do? -

432
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,440
Oh, right, I need to run.

433
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
Run, run, run.

434
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,400
Don't be nervous.

435
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,320
I know you can do this.

436
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,440
When you are nervous,

437
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,540
just focus on this marble.

438
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Hold it to your chest.

439
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,450
Then, recite the spell:

440
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,850
Calm down, calm down.

441
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,540
And all your fear will disappear.

442
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,290
Let's try again.

443
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Okay, take two.

444
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,490
Kiss...

445
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,060
Kiss...

446
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,200
Kiss...

447
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,820
Why is there a kiss scene?

448
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,410
They sent the script to your rooms.

449
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,970
Didn't you see?

450
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,460
But it's not in my script.

451
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,880
Yes, it is

452
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,020
and you all said it was okay.

453
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,670
I'm not okay with it.

454
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,540
I think I understand now.

455
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,070
I don't understand why she had to run away like that.

456
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,390
I don't think she's ready.

457
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,300
Anda

458
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,080
Are you okay?

459
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,610
That was my first kiss.

460
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,790
I'm sorry.

461
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,700
I can't keep filming.

462
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,450
It's okay.

463
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,430
Really?

464
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,750
Really.

465
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,710
What will you do, P'Jet?

466
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
They didn't finish it, right?

467
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
I'll go tell them

468
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,670
that it was my fault.

469
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,660
But...

470
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,730
it's not your fault.

471
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,490
How could it not be my fault?

472
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,520
It was my fault for not checking the script first.

473
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
P' Jet

474
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,310
I will take responsibility

475
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,900
and resign.

476
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,720
What did you say?

477
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,280
I won't allow it.

478
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,530
I made such a big mistake.

479
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,670
I can't continue like this.

480
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,430
Jet, listen to me.

481
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Even if you resign now,

482
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,830
the problem won't be solved.

483
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,470
The job isn't over yet.

484
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,150
It's not just you who gets hurt.

485
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,650
Not just Anda.

486
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,280
It's all of us, including the clients.

487
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,710
Do you understand?

488
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,230
Anda

489
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,090
You promised me

490
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,480
that you would try to be professional for this job.

491
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,340
Do you remember?

492
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,960
A professional

493
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,550
doesn't run away because of a first kiss.

494
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,010
Then...

495
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,280
You should show us your professionalism

496
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,820
and finish this well.

497
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,590
I'm asking you.

498
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,310
But-

499
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,830
But-

500
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
Don't force him.

501
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,360
I'll handle the rest.

502
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,990
No, P'Jet.

503
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,860
No one else should be hurt by this.

504
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,710
I'll go back and finish it.

505
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:15,780
I'm sorry.

506
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,420
- Damn -

507
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,380
- If I speak now, I'll definitely get caught -

508
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,550
I know

509
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,190
that you are mad at me so you don't want to talk.

510
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,060
Don't turn your back on me, okay?

511
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,610
I've waited for you for a long time.

512
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,760
- What does he mean? -

513
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,640
- What was he waiting for? -

514
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,710
- Is he crazy? -

515
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,390
Since the day we met ten years ago,

516
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,260
I couldn't forget your face.

517
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,550
- Lies -

518
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,720
- If he really remembered, he wouldn't do this -

519
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,560
I'm glad to see you again.

520
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,610
- But I'm not happy, let go -
