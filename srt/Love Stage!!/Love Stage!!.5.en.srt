00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,370
Do you like it?

3
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,830
I like it.

4
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,250
If you still want me to teach you,

5
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,090
just call me.

6
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,400
Wake up for breakfast, Anda.

7
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,480
Just leave it at the door, P'.

8
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,170
I'll open up and get it later.

9
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,250
Thank you.

10
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,560
Is this Anda's?

11
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,340
I'm not sure why he's buying so much lately.

12
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,510
He hasn't been out for several days.

13
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,210
Yeah, it's great.

14
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
Great?

15
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,700
Anda isn't going to see that pervert anymore.

16
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,160
Well, they don't even need to leave the house.

17
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,660
They can just message on the phone.

18
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I'll get it.

19
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,790
Today, we really want to hear about Ryo's favorite item.

20
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,950
So, what is it?

21
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,390
This is it.

22
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,560
A hedgehog toy?

23
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,020
That means this toy has an interesting story, right?

24
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,930
Yes.

25
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,250
Boyfriend...

26
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,720
Well, a fan gave it to me on a special day.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I see.

28
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,370
I'm not your fan.

29
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,830
But Mr. Ryo, can you tell us something?

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,930
What quality should a girl have if she wants to take care of you?

31
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,990
What I like is simple.

32
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,650
As long as the person I like will take care of themself, that's enough.

33
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,540
Please sign for the package.

34
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,740
Thank you.

35
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Anda

36
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,510
Open the door for me.

37
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,390
Here's your package.

38
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,040
Uh, just leave it there.

39
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,690
But I already brought it to you.

40
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,810
Thank you, P', thank you.

41
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,860
Open the door, I'll bring it in for you.

42
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,620
It's fine, P'Tee.

43
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,490
No need.

44
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,710
I'll go out and get it myself.

45
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,160
The box is really huge, Anda.

46
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
- It's okay, P'Tee.
- Open the door for me.

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,170
You won't be able to carry it.

48
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,930
Thank you, P'.

49
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,330
Don't tell me...

50
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,350
P', don't...

51
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm filming in a foreign country now.

52
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,890
I guess we won't see each other for awhile.

53
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,430
What's with that?

54
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,320
Stop laughing.

55
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,930
Where? Who's laughing?

56
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,760
What are you laughing at?

57
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
What?

58
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,170
What is the difference between "scene" and "set," Anda?

59
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,590
What did you say?

60
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,740
I said, what is the difference between "scene" and "set"?

61
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,770
Um...

62
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,930
What do you think, Bank?

63
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,400
Do you want to help your classmate?

64
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,240
"Scene" is a part of action in a film or drama.

65
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,070
"Set" is the place where the film or drama was shot.

66
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,070
Correct.

67
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,500
Didn't you say you would work harder

68
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,230
to not have trouble with the professor?

69
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,440
I've been hiding from him well.

70
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,430
So well...

71
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Everyone can see you sneaking on your phone.

72
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,080
By the way...

73
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,110
You seem happy recently.

74
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,940
Not really.

75
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,240
Are you in love with someone?

76
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,510
I don't know...

77
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,750
what it's like to be in love.

78
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,330
But I know...

79
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,600
what it's like to be in love.

80
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,220
What is it like?

81
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,390
Probably...

82
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,410
I want to take better care of myself

83
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,100
and become a better person

84
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,970
to make that person proud.

85
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,780
I want to see that person smile.

86
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,570
And...

87
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm happy when I see that person.

88
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,470
What if you never fall in love?

89
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,840
Because I love myself...

90
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,040
I can feel happy

91
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,190
seeing myself get better every day.

92
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,190
You have to learn to love yourself, too, right?

93
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,490
If you don't sleep well, your whole body will be tired.

94
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,820
Look at your dark circles.

95
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,310
The type I like is simple.

96
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,560
They just need to take care of themself.

97
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,940
What are you doing after this?

98
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,450
I have two or three hours to spare.

99
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,250
Why?

100
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,670
Let's go shopping.

101
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,880
Bank, look here.

102
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,310
I think...

103
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,040
I want this.

104
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,050
How is it?

105
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,410
Is it right for me?

106
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,080
I think lighter patterns suit you better.

107
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,770
Try this one.

108
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,900
I think this one is pretty good.

109
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
This one?

110
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,490
Very nice.

111
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,220
Why did you suddenly want to go shopping?

112
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,470
Maybe I just want to take better care of myself.

113
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,310
Hey...

114
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,770
Are you really in love with someone?

115
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,600
What love?

116
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,930
I love myself.

117
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,200
I want to see myself becoming better.

118
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,770
You want to look better?

119
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,530
Then, try this.

120
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,720
♪ What does one's heart need? ♪

121
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:06,050
♪ Give it too much, give it chaos ♪

122
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:14,930
♪ Only you care for it so tenderly ♪

123
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,570
♪ Enough for the two of us  ♪

124
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,710
♪ to do a lot right now ♪

125
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,860
You're the person in the ad, right?

126
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,600
Yes

127
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,900
You could tell.

128
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,930
Of course.

129
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,220
How could you tell?

130
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,660
Your eyes.

131
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,670
I can recognize your eyes.

132
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,110
Bank...

133
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,650
Bank...

134
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,810
Bank...

135
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,160
What are you thinking, Bank?

136
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,150
P'Ae?

137
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,870
Yes?

138
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,650
I have something to discuss with you.

139
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,850
What is it?

140
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,460
Suppose...

141
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,990
What if...

142
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,180
there is someone I like...

143
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,030
someone I have a good relationship with...

144
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,620
but it's a boy?

145
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,940
It not possible, Bank!

146
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,830
Don't say it's a boy.

147
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,400
Even with girls, your fans still won't accept it.

148
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,800
So let this idea go right now.

149
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,000
If you still want to be in the entertainment industry,

150
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,460
just focus on your work.

151
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,080
Understand?

152
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,020
Yes.

153
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,810
- Ryo: Okay -
- Anda: How are you? -
- Don't forget to eat -

154
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,430
- I have eaten. Don't forget to eat as well.

155
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,100
He's at it again, Oat.

156
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,640
The symptoms are getting worse.

157
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,500
It's the symptoms of love.

158
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,300
Nonsense.

159
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,430
If not that,

160
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,600
who are you sending photos to?

161
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,320
The cat?

162
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Yeah, I'm looking at pictures of cats.

163
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,870
Hello everyone. I'm Lanlan.

164
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,890
Now, it's time for the much anticipated event.

165
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,960
I have the only signed photo of Ryo in my hands today.

166
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,470
This is a special prize from our entertainment club.

167
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:50,200
This is the event prize for the Ryo fan that can answer questions today.

168
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,810
Who would want something like that?

169
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,750
Yeah.

170
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,740
It would be better if they had that cute actress' photo card, right?.

171
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,800
Isn't that the last limited edition item I'm missing now?

172
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Sorry, friends.

173
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,050
I'm in a hurry now.

174
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,580
It's time for the final quiz.

175
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,310
The question will be asked of each person.

176
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,310
But if one person gets it wrong, the other will immediately win.

177
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,530
He's been in 8 films

178
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,690
and there are 2775 highlight episodes.

179
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,880
I watched every episode 5 times

180
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,740
and collected all the premium versions.

181
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,340
For this competition,

182
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,060
I'm very confident.

183
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,190
It looks like we're ready.

184
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,270
Who will the prize go to?

185
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,210
Let's find out.

186
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,610
Anda's first question is...

187
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,020
what is Ryo's favorite type?

188
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,690
As long as they take care of themself, that's enough.

189
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,310
Someone who takes care of themself.

190
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,300
Correct

191
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,410
Cherry's question is...

192
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,900
what is Ryo's favorite tourist attraction?

193
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,030
The sea!

194
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,370
Great, correct!

195
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,930
Okay, it's Anda's turn.

196
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:45,410
What does Ryo like to draw best?

197
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,530
Portraits of boys.

198
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,140
Wrong.

199
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,380
The answer falls to Cherry.

200
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,510
Portraits of sexy schoolgirls.

201
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,670
Correct

202
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,580
Congratulations!

203
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,880
Our winner today is Cherry.

204
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,790
Thank you, thank you.

205
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
You almost had it.

206
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,720
It's okay.

207
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,490
Wait a minute, Da.

208
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,590
Aren't you afraid of the stage?

209
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,690
Uh, yeah.

210
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,440
But you can do it when the time comes.

211
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,830
See? You could definitely be a model.

212
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,930
Enough.

213
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,610
It's just a coincidence.

214
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,740
Yeah, but say...

215
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,160
Why did you want that signed photo so bad?

216
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,850
Because Anda is smart, Oat.

217
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,930
Smart?

218
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,170
Yeah, didn't you hear?

219
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,280
They said there is only one photo in the world.

220
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,210
If Da won it,

221
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,740
he could auction it off.

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Rich!

223
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,020
Yeah, exactly.

224
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,160
I thought I would win the money to treat you to ice cream.

225
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,270
It's okay.

226
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,930
We can eat it when you win the next event.

227
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,380
Another event?

228
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,990
The event is the drawing contest.

229
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,230
It's due in 3 days.

230
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,810
Don't tell me...

231
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,630
you're not finished yet?

232
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,510
Can I even finish?

233
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,520
Nick, get over here.

234
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,200
Come here, you bastard.

235
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,070
Follow me, you have to follow.

236
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,020
Hey!!!

237
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,010
Okay, okay.

238
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,650
Are you here to help write songs

239
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,380
or to bother me all day?

240
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,570
This guy here said he would just come to eat for free.

241
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,970
Shit, what are you saying?

242
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,000
Of course I'm here to help.

243
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,170
Nick and I are just chasing each other to think of ideas.

244
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,990
Fine, then settle down.

245
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,070
I've been in a very bad mood lately.

246
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,020
Is it about your brother?

247
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,840
Yes

248
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,920
Don't think too much.

249
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,820
Did you see how that pervert haunts my brother?

250
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,680
He doesn't look like a pervert.

251
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,770
Doesn't look like a pervert?

252
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,670
He took off my brother's clothes in the changing room.

253
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,620
Hey, Ryo!

254
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,390
Really, bro?

255
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,530
Of course.

256
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,400
Then, we need a way to deal with him

257
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,270
and keep your brother safe.

258
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,540
Alright, let's hear it.

259
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,900
Send a hitman.

260
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,520
Big, you bastard.

261
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,250
I'm being serious, asshole.

262
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,060
Do you want me to deal with it?

263
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,810
Anda

264
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,850
Is something wrong, P'Tee?

265
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,650
It's very loud in here.

266
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,310
Are you worried about me?

267
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,200
Of course I have to worry about you.

268
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,850
Everything's fine.

269
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,330
Just these two were playing loud.

270
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,510
But it's so late.

271
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,620
Why haven't you slept yet?

272
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,240
Did I wake you up?

273
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,350
Not at all.

274
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,100
I'm trying to finish painting.

275
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,800
Will it be okay?

276
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't know if I can finish in time.

277
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,070
It's late...

278
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,900
So we'll help you.

279
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,630
Hey, I don't think...

280
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,000
that guy came to beg your brother like a psycho.

281
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,960
Anda, don't listen to Big.

282
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,740
He just likes to talk nonsense.

283
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,640
What can we do to help?

284
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,370
Then, you can paint the black hair

285
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,240
and you paint the scenery.

286
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,140
Do you really know how to draw?

287
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,350
Nick used to be the champion of the drawing contest.

288
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,730
In kindergarten.

289
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,770
Actually, I won't trouble you.

290
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,660
What trouble?

291
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,940
We're here already.

292
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,970
Do you see this, Anda?

293
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,640
It's very good.

294
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,880
You're so great, P'Tee.

295
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,720
Did you mean it that you want to compete?

296
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,980
Yes.

297
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,770
But the line drawing is so bad.

298
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,630
Hey, Big.

299
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,980
What's wrong with the line drawing?

300
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,870
It's very "hip-hop"

301
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,370
Very "hip-hop," right Nick?

302
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,270
Right, right, hip-hop.

303
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,640
Isn't hip-hop dancing?

304
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,460
P'Tee spilt the ink. I saw it.

305
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,000
Hello?

306
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,530
Sounds like you're still sleeping.

307
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,980
P'Ryo

308
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,100
What's wrong?

309
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,410
I'm fine.

310
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,710
Are you back?

311
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,730
Wait a minute, P'Ryo.

312
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,020
P'Tee, I told you I'm not angry.

313
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,530
Don't knock on my door.

314
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,380
P'Tee

315
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
P'Ryo!

316
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,800
It's alright, isn't it?

317
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,560
Wait for me to collect my things first.

318
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,930
So strange.

319
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,220
Strange that you're not fussing

320
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,330
and even let Ryo up to see Anda.

321
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,230
I don't want to be the bad guy.

322
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,210
Bad?

323
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,070
Anda must be mad at me.

324
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,490
I took a two day break

325
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,220
so I flew back to see you.

326
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,570
It's a pity.

327
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,390
I may not be able to go out with you for these days.

328
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,330
And who told you to take us out?

329
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,530
I'm here to help you draw.

330
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,130
But...

331
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,070
it's okay.

332
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,200
I can finish by myself.

333
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,080
You can finish by yourself, but will it be on time?

334
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,730
But this is your rest day, P'.

335
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,920
My rest days...

336
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,430
are the days I'm with you.

337
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,410
We have two days left

338
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,930
before the contest.

339
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,990
This all has to be repainted.

340
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,750
I don't know what to do.

341
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,670
We must be in time.

342
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,460
Let's make it happen together.

343
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,920
Okay?

344
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,150
What do you guys think Ryo will do to Anda?

345
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,140
It's alright.

346
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,170
Don't think too much.

347
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Hey, P'.

348
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,380
Why do I hear strange noises?

349
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,870
Listen.

350
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,250
Did you hear that?

351
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,800
Almost done.

352
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,900
Anda

353
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,350
Anda

354
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,180
So cute...

355
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,230
You've come this far. Be strong, Ryo.

356
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
P'Ryo!

357
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,090
Why is it like this?

358
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,170
P'Ryo, what are you doing?

359
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,770
Why do I feel this way?

360
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,120
I've already done this, haven't I?

361
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,410
This is not the first time.

362
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,200
- Aigo: It's almost time for check-in -

363
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,080
I'm still not full...

364
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Just once more.

365
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,460
- Wake up, Anda -

366
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,950
- A bright morning awaits us -

367
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,460
- Wake up, Anda -

368
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,930
- A bright morning awaits us -

369
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,280
- Wake up, Anda -

370
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,770
- A bright morning awaits us -

371
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,170
What the heck was I dreaming?

372
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,640
- Good luck with the contest -
- P'Ryo -

373
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,780
Today...

374
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,720
I'll prove to everyone that I can do it.

375
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,890
Are you ready?

376
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:43,960
Ready.

377
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,690
I'll be waiting for the good news.

378
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,770
Thank you for everything.

379
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,660
It's fine.

380
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,840
Here's my file.

381
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,280
Whenever I meet the cameraman

382
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,880
or people with expectations of me,

383
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,900
I start trembling.

384
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,470
And sometimes get a fever.

385
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,770
I went to the doctor before

386
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,960
and they said it is stage fright.

387
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,690
Good.

388
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,970
Relax, relax.

389
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,660
Just a little more.

390
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,070
Anda

391
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,190
Anda
Anda

392
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,070
Anda
