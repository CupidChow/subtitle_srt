2
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,830
Ready?

3
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,170
Don't be nervous.

4
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,030
Anda.

5
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,770
It's alright.

6
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Take a deep breath.

7
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Well, let's try again.

8
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,010
That looks great.

9
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Very good.

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,200
Good.

11
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,120
Great, wonderful.

12
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,210
P'Ryo

13
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,350
How should we pose next?

14
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,250
Just like we were doing before.

15
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,800
Should we try back to back?

16
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,460
Sure, how should I stand?

17
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,120
Oh, turn around.

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,430
And then?

19
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,850
Lean together like this.

20
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,610
Wow, I love this sweet picture.

21
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,960
Wow

22
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,530
This picture is very beautiful.

23
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,480
Agreed.

24
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,020
Can we make it into a poster?

25
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
Sure, I'll arrange it.

26
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,640
Well, the atmosphere is very good.

27
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,420
Let's keep shooting.

28
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,140
Just a little more.

29
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,220
Okay, very good. Keep it up.

30
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,480
Good, good.

31
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,300
Now, I'll take solo shots for Anda.

32
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,250
You can do it.

33
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,730
Okay, no need to be nervous.

34
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,360
Let's keep the mood from just now.

35
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,150
Good, good, okay.

36
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,030
I'll keep taking pictures now.

37
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,510
Just like this.

38
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,150
Relax.

39
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,050
Like that.

40
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,500
Good.

41
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,760
Relax, just relax.

42
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,470
Smile...

43
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,770
Anda...

44
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,200
Do you feel better now?

45
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,880
With this, we don't owe you anymore, right?

46
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,310
P'Jet

47
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,540
Can I stop doing this kind of work now?

48
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,550
But...

49
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,980
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

50
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,560
I can't do it.

51
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,930
I would like to tell you

52
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
that you won't need to be in front of the camera again,

53
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,330
but you know, right?

54
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,570
It's not possible.

55
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,560
Why?

56
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,900
Was I born in the wrong family?

57
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,410
Do I really have to do this?

58
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,610
What-

59
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,430
What should I do, P'Jet?

60
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,380
How can I avoid this?

61
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,170
If you don't want to do it,

62
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,090
you'll have to get better at drawing.

63
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,260
Do you know...

64
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,430
what's wrong with this year's competition?

65
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,410
Uh... the poster turned out ugly?

66
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,510
Spirit is what's missing.

67
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,980
Spirit...

68
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,400
And you...

69
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,010
Do you know why I'm organizing this contest?

70
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,010
Tax evasion?

71
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,730
I want to rid the industry of

72
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,340
the concept of "hungry artist."

73
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,980
Increase the reward!

74
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,070
Triple the value!

75
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,310
Oh

76
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,670
This year...

77
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,310
it's even bigger than last year.

78
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,570
Can we really do it?

79
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,360
Of course.

80
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,040
We've been waiting a year for this contest.

81
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,390
The bigger the better.

82
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,310
When we succeed,

83
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,450
everyone will see.

84
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,630
But I think it would be easier for you to be a model.

85
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,970
Enough.

86
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,520
I'm being tormented by this already at home.

87
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,820
Oh, how is it torment?

88
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,010
After becoming a model, you'll be famous.

89
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,040
You will be surrounded by girls

90
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,710
and you'll be able to perform with that beautiful actress.

91
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,300
Are you still not over her yet?

92
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,220
Of course.

93
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,980
She's my love. I am going to marry her.

94
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,570
Even if I don't know her name,

95
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,250
we are destined to be together.

96
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,380
Hey, can you ask P'Ryo for her name?

97
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,720
Even Google couldn't find it.

98
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Sure, I'll ask.

99
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,060
Here's the script for the ad that we'll be filming the day after tomorrow.

100
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,640
Thank you.

101
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,390
What are you reading?

102
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,660
Oh, it's yaoi...

103
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,090
Yaoi...

104
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,890
Well...

105
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,620
Boy's love.

106
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,060
You know, boys that like boys.

107
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,450
What?

108
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,770
Oh

109
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,760
It's nothing.

110
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,200
I was just wondering when men flirt with each other,

111
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,750
how do they do it?

112
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,810
It's almost the same as flirting with a woman.

113
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,510
But there will be little differences.

114
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,570
What?

115
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,220
Do you want to read, too?

116
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,980
I know a lot of good stories to recommend.

117
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,020
Not today, P'.

118
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,840
I need to read the script today.

119
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,550
I have to go, Ryo.

120
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,420
Learn your lines, okay?

121
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,910
I will.

122
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,800
I had Jet sign you up for a new audition role.

123
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,730
What, Mom?

124
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,880
The producer asked for you personally, Anda.

125
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,570
He wants to see you at the audition.

126
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,470
I refuse.

127
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,770
I can't do it.

128
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,810
I don't see how you can't.

129
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,590
I can do it, but I really don't want to, Dad.

130
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,390
Why didn't you ask Anda first?

131
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,750
Tee...

132
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,200
If I asked, he would run away like that.

133
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,830
Do you really have to force him like that?

134
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,790
Calm down first.

135
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,860
The way you're treating Anda

136
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,760
really makes me wonder.

137
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,860
If I didn't like singing,

138
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,450
would you force me like this, too?

139
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,070
Anda

140
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,160
Anda

141
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,020
Can you let me in please?

142
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,860
Anda

143
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,280
I understand you.

144
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,430
You didn't come to convince to do it again, right?

145
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,510
Of course not.

146
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,900
I'll talk to our parents myself

147
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,080
about refusing the audition.

148
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,660
Really?

149
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,330
I don't want to see you hurt again.

150
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,660
Thank you.

151
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,700
We haven't had barbecue together in a long time, right?

152
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,150
If you stop crying and smile sweetly for me,

153
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,980
I'll take you this Saturday.

154
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,840
Cheater.

155
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,340
Bringing up meat to tempt me is cheating!

156
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,980
But it made you smile, right?

157
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,050
You better get me a lot.

158
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,080
Deal.

159
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,850
Ryo...

160
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,330
Did I leave my novel at your place?

161
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,600
Yes

162
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,610
I've been looking for it. Please hold onto it for me.

163
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,020
And how is it going with the script? Did you memorize it?

164
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,780
I'm looking through it right now.

165
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,710
Well, I won't bother you then.

166
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,900
Let's try this.

167
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,240
Turn around

168
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,310
and stand back to back.

169
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,160
Like this?

170
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,410
Wow, I love this sweet picture.

171
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,390
Wow.

172
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,410
This picture is very beautiful.

173
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,090
Agreed.

174
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,700
Can we make it into a poster?

175
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,450
Sure, I will have it arranged.

176
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,350
Why do people want to be famous, Bank?

177
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,290
Because famous people make a lot of money?

178
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,060
Is there another reason

179
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,010
if it's not for the money?

180
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,650
Maybe because...

181
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,110
you want people to accept you.

182
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,450
So that means...

183
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,170
If we are not famous,

184
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,540
no one accept us?

185
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,310
Why are you suddenly asking this?

186
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,980
Because of the photoshoot for the magazine cover?

187
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,770
My parents looked very happy

188
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,410
to see me get a job in the industry.

189
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,250
But I don't know why

190
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,280
I keep feeling...

191
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,380
worse and worse.

192
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,740
Why?

193
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,670
Don't you like when everyone knows you?

194
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,640
No.

195
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,950
I don't like it.

196
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,500
When everyone's eyes are on me,

197
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,160
it's like...

198
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,860
everyone is looking for something to criticize.

199
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,070
But they might also admire you.

200
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,680
Among the admirers,

201
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,460
there will still be critics, too.

202
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,290
Living in that kind of world

203
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
is like being on a display.

204
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,410
You have to do certain things

205
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,750
and be a certain way.

206
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,020
But no one ever asked me

207
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,070
what I really want to be?

208
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,350
Have you ever heard the expression

209
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,600
that everything comes at a price?

210
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,170
That's it.

211
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,230
That is the price you pay for fame.

212
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,690
And because fame gives us more opportunity,

213
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,370
we agree to pay that price.

214
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,060
Life...

215
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,720
Privacy...

216
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,760
Exchanging that for fame and money,

217
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,920
is it really worth it?

218
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,540
For you,

219
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,070
I don't know.

220
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,310
But for me,

221
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,920
without rich parents

222
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,090
and younger siblings to take care of,

223
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,860
it's really worth it.

224
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,760
For this, you'll have to find the answer on your own.

225
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,540
Are you ready to pay?

226
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,630
Parcel delivery.

227
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,420
The total is 4250 baht.

228
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,580
Here.

229
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,560
Thanks.

230
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,450
Now, if I were famous...

231
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,790
Book would definitely be a womanizer.

232
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,150
Well, what about you, Oat?

233
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,710
I would probably donate to animal shelters.

234
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,890
Such a good man. I hate people like you.

235
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,010
Chill.

236
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,170
What about your personal lives?

237
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,640
Hanging out with girls.

238
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,810
What about your personal lives?

239
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,250
I thought you would rather spend time with dogs and cats.

Where did he go?

Ryo...

317
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,380

Hello, guys.

Well, I would like to know you better.

323

Where do I look like a sheep?

326
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,170
I think we should go and see the real sheep.

327
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,320
Guys...

328
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,070
We have to do whatever it takes to make Anda hate Ryo.

329
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,570
Aye aye, P'.

330
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,910
This lamb is so cute.

331
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,920
What are their name?

332
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,040
This one is Khaotang and this one is Khaoniew.

333
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,980
You can feed them this.

334
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,200
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

335
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,110
P' will let you go now.

336
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,010
Eat slowly.

337
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,050
No need to fight.

338
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,200
This is for everyone.

339
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,550
Not me, P'Ryo.

340
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,630
I won't eat it.

341
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,260
Thank you.

342
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,250
Eat a lot.

343
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,140
It's so hot.

344
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,210
How is the roast lamb?

345
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,610
It's delicious.

346
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,240
Yes

347
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,770
The meat is tender.

348
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,100
Oh, that's right

349
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,200
It's meat from Khaotang and Khaoniew.

350
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,940
Those cute little sheep just now.

351
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,820
I think I'm full, P'Ryo.

352
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,230
Score!

353
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,410
They were probably just kidding.

354
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,420
It's okay, forget it.

355
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,910
A fun show will be happening now.

356
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,260
You can watch it for free.

357
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,290
Fun is guaranteed.

358
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:00,320
Hurry.
Fun is guaranteed.

359
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,830
Hurry.

360
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,290
Let's go. Please come this way.
Hurry.

361
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,270
Let's go. Please come this way.

362
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,670
Where are we going?

363
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,960
To see the talking sheep.

364
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,440
Talking sheep?

365
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,670
Why do your faces look familiar?

366
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,940
We're not familiar. We've never met.

367
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,920
Hello

368
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,890
Everyone, welcome to the animal show.

369
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,680
If everyone is ready,

370
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,690
let's please welcome

371
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,960
our guests

372
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,340
for the

373
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,010
goose dance show!

374
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,800
Before the show, we'd like to invite a volunteer.

375
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,750
Who is a good pick?

376
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,380
Please invite that handsome man.

377
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,860
Let's see this handsome guy

378
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,480
dance like a goose.

379
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,620
Give him some applause.

380
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,290
Come on.

381
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,590
Come on.

382
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,660
Not coming? Ok...

383
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,200
I'll come get you.

384
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,320
Hello, handsome. Come on up.

385
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,300
Come up.

386
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,310
Don't be shy.

387
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,680
Hello, hello.

388
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,830
Dance with us.

389
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,360
Ok 1 2 3

390
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,120
♪ Geese, geese, bathe in the river ♪

391
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,550
P'Ryo, you got wet.

392
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,440
How is it?

393
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,220
It's fun.

394
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,610
Hey P'Ryo...

395
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,270
I want to try this one.

396
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,350
Well, I'm not very good at it.

397
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,990
But I want to play.

398
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,710
You guys...

399
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,770
I will arrange the next plan.

400
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,550
Great, not even Tom Cruise can do it.

401
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,740
Tom Cruise?

402
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,810
Who's that?

403
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,980
Are you dumb?

404
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,900
It's the guy who plays "Mission Possible."

405
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,060
What possible? It's "impossible."

406
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:00,110
The spaceship is ready to go to the moon!

407
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,610
Anyone who wants to go up, please come through here.

408
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,540
Guaranteed to be stimulating!

409
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,170
Come, come.

410
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,470
I guarantee it'll be fun.

411
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,810
- What will be stimulated?
- Don't worry.

412
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,040
It'll be stimulating.

413
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,010
It's a little hot.

414
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,150
Oh, it's okay. Just drop it. We'll turn on the AC.

415
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,990
Die, die, die.

416
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,910
So much fun, P'Ryo.

417
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,300
Damn, you guys...

418
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,830
You can't do anything.

419
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,400
Today was a little chaotic.

420
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,620
Are you feeling bored?

421
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,270
I thought it was fun, P'Ryo.

422
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,210
So, I'll invite you to play again, okay?

423
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,640
Will we look for Khaoniew and Khaotang?

424
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,610
Khaoniew and Khaotang?

425
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,860
Oh, that's right.

426
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,560
Hey, Anda.

427
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,210
Are you okay?

428
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,490
I feel a little dizzy.

429
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,720
Probably because of the ride earlier.

430
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,520
Here, get on.

431
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Will it be okay, P'Ryo?

432
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,850
Of course.

433
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,410
Come on.

434
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,740
1 2 3

435
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,640
Let's go

436
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,300
Okay.

437
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,730
Let's go

438
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,460
P', thank you for today.

439
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,020
How did you think about today?

440
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,330
I've never done anything like this before.

441
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,080
But it's fun?

442
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm very happy.

443
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,300
Thank you.

444
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,270
P'Ryo...

445
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,870
you're like my brother.

446
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,870
Stupid.

447
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,710
It's not the same.

448
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,300
I'm not like your brother

449
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,580
because today, I confirmed...

450
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,570
that I don't want to be your brother.

451
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Thank you...

452
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,950
for sending my brother back.

453
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,770
With pleasure, P'Tee.

454
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,270
"Mr. Tee."

455
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,760
Call me "Mr. Tee."

456
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,860
because I don't think of you as a brother.

457
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,100
Okay...

458
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,660
Mr. Tee.

459
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,820
Well, Anda, let's go in.

460
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,110
Thank you for today, P'Ryo.

461
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,500
I'll see you at my house tomorrow.

462
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,270
Okay.

463
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,890
Wait, wait, wait.

464
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,460
What did you just say?

465
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,950
I said "see you,"

466
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,420
Mr. Tee.

467
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,780
Bye.

468
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,100
Bye bye.

469
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,640
Anda, where are you going?

470
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,820
Why don't you tell me?

471
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,090
I can take you.

472
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,650
What kind of drawing competition are you entering?

473
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,710
It's a manga drawing contest.

474
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Do you have to draw many types?

475
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,400
Yes, that's why I wanted to study with P'Ryo.

476
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,280
Are there BL novels, too?

477
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,730
BL?

478
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,290
There is.

479
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,160
Do you like it?

480
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,890
I like it.

481
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,350
If you want me to teach again, just call me.

482
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,070
Okay

483
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,370
Thank you.
