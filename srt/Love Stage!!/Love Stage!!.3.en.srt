00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,320
P'Ryo!

3
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
What's wrong with you?

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,110
Is it almost better?

5
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,310
Luckily, your face is not bruised.

6
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,640
What about my schedule?

7
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,510
I've already contacted and cleared everything.

8
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,520
But to achieve this, my ears were tormented all day.

9
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,810
I can imagine, P'.

10
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,660
I'm sure they grumbled a lot about the trouble.

11
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,610
It's okay, just consider it a vacation.

12
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,310
I don't count restless nights like this as a vacation.

13
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,440
It looks like you fought with someone.

14
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,180
Don't lower me to your standard.

15
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,040
I'm not violent like you, P'.

16
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,220
I'm also not violent at all.

17
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,710
Hey, Ryo!

18
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,420
Even when you jump and kick someone to knock him out?

19
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,820
Really, who do you think your brother is?

20
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,940
My little brother was being harassed by a psychopath.

21
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,540
Anyone would do the same.

22
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,000
But you can't just go jump and kick him like that!

23
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,880
I told you it was just an accident.

24
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,610
Okay, fine.

25
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,150
I was too violent.

26
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,200
But Jet... won't you help me?

27
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,590
I'm already helping.

28
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,130
Helping with what?

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm looking for a lawyer to contact.

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,230
By the way, which lawyer should we use?

31
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,830
Lawyer?

32
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,080
We have to file a claim for damages and sue for assault.

33
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,600
And there is also your loss of income.

34
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,050
Troublemaker!

35
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,760
Anda

36
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,850
Anda, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,680
I don't want to hear it.

38
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,180
Anda

39
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,600
Jet, Jet, help me, too.

40
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,030
Are we really going to sue?

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,860
Of course.

42
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,560
Why are you asking?

43
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,800
Well, it was just an accident.

44
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,580
Are you sure it was just an accident?

45
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,810
Yes.

46
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,180
Besides, I'm almost recovered.

47
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,930
Look at you.

48
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,800
See how lucky you are to only be a little injured.

49
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,640
In the case of a more serious injury,

50
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,160
you wouldn't just lose a few opportunities but your whole future.

51
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,770
You must understand that your body and appearance

52
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,110
are tools in your profession.

53
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,300
So whoever is responsible for damaging them

54
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,400
should be held accountable.

55
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
I won't give up easily on this matter.

56
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,140
You already packed my things from the gym, right?

57
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,170
Oh, I've already collected everything.

58
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,220
I also had your clothes washed

59
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,150
and packed your bag in the car.

60
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,930
With my things,

61
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,170
was there anything else?

62
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,050
Oh,

63
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,850
You mean...

64
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,990
this little bag.

65
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,970
Right?

66
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,820
Someone called to ask me what you like.

67
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,390
Who?

68
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,730
Not telling.

69
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,740
I just remembered that I have a meeting with a client.

70
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,040
This little kid will have to stay all by himself.

71
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,320
Tell me first who  called to ask about me?

72
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,210
It's... the one who gave you that hedgehog.

73
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,730
Da-da, have you seen the Happy Wedding ad yet?

74
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,280
Yes, what about it?

75
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,370
The actress is so beautiful, don't you think?

76
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,800
He looks pretty cool, doesn't he?

77
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,540
P'Ryo is so lucky that he got to kiss her even without making an effort.

78
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,130
People are born with unequal luck.

79
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm jealous. Da, what about you?

80
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,760
By the way, doesn't this actress look like you?

81
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,180
Hey, what nonsense.

82
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,500
Show me.

83
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,220
Yeah.

84
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
You looked at so many pictures, your eyes are dizzy.

85
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,840
As you can see, I'm a boy.

86
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,000
You're right. When you look closely, she's not quite like you.

87
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,260
More like Lala!

88
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,590
I think Lala is cuter.

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,590
The actress is cuter.

90
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,950
Lala is cuter.

91
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,240
The actress is cuter.

92
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,740
Lala.

93
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,710
The actress.

94
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,370
Lala.

95
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Oat is cuter.

96
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,470
What are you talking about?

97
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,040
What should I buy to visit P'Ryo?

98
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,000
Anda

99
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,030
Oh, Bank.

100
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,870
About that day,

101
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,950
you're okay, right?

102
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,240
I'm okay.

103
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,080
The person who isn't okay should be P'Ryo, right?

104
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,300
Hey, can I ask you something?

105
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,070
If I want to buy something to visit a patient,

106
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,300
what should I buy?

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,760
Just buy... some fruit to help them get better.

108
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,040
Is that really enough?

109
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,280
Enough for what?

110
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,310
Enough to stop him from suing us.

111
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,050
Hey, Nick.

112
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,110
Yes, yes.

113
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,200
You know how to sing, right?

114
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,100
Yes, I can sing.

115
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm relieved to hear that.

116
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,120
I've even participated in competitions and won awards.

117
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,560
Shit, what award?

118
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,530
The New Artist award

119
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,440
for Pheasant Kindergarten.

120
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,310
You little beast.

121
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,650
That's really a grand prize.

122
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,370
Why are you asking?

123
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,280
Want me to steal your part?

124
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,370
Yes.

125
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,040
Boss, where are you going?

126
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,230
Don't leave us, Boss.

127
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,000
Boss, what's the matter?

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,270
Boss, I'll give you donuts.

129
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,650
I'll give you all of them. Take it.

130
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,140
Please, Boss.

131
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,310
Don't go, Boss.

132
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,340
Hey!

133
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,750
Do you think...

134
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,970
there will be donuts for me in prison?

135
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,180
If there isn't,

136
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,450
you have to bring some for me when you visit.

137
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,810
Am I that scary?

138
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,930
You appeared so quietly,

139
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,450
anyone would be scary.

140
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,440
After bathing, you have to dry yourself, little hedgehog.

141
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,640
Why did you eat so little?

142
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,390
Do your teeth hurt?

143
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,730
I don't really like to eat rice.

144
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,670
Why are you here?

145
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,420
Here.

146
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,980
I wanted to return it to you.

147
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,370
No need.

148
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,610
Just consider it like a gift.

149
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,980
No.

150
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,840
It's yours anyway.

151
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,620
Looks like you need it more than me.

152
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,820
Keep it.

153
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,330
That way you can stop being nervous in front of the camera.

154
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,520
It's been 10 years.

155
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,310
I didn't expect you to remember.

156
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,470
Why wouldn't I remember?

157
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,300
I'm sorry

158
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,860
I'm sorry for lying to you all this time.

159
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,470
Did you come only for this?

160
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,030
Actually, I have something to ask you.

161
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,600
What is it?

162
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,950
Will you...

163
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,000
really sue us?

164
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,030
Well...

165
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,360
I'm still thinking about it.

166
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,430
Oh Jet...

167
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,480
Are you sleeping here today?

168
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,030
Yeah... to work until morning.

169
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,880
Sounds like a long night.

170
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,800
Come have a drink with me.

171
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,410
Okay, a drink is fine.

172
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,900
Here's to Ryo not suing.

173
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,370
Cheers to that.

174
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,090
Hey, Jet...

175
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,800
♪ Oh liang... with fried rice ♪

176
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,640
♪ Eat it in a square room ♪

177
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,750
Have you written a new song yet?

178
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,860
Yeah, I'm waiting for Anda to come back and sing with me.

179
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,150
It's past 8 p.m. and there's still no sign of him.

180
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,340
He won't answer my calls either.

181
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,300
If that's the case,

182
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,120
we should have another glass.

183
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,550
Aren't you going back?

184
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,350
I have decided

185
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,900
that I will not leave

186
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,750
if you are still going to sue.

187
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,870
I'm going to take a shower first.

188
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,800

189

191
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,920

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,620

What am I thinking?

195
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,420
It looks funny, doesn't it?

196
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,200
It doesn't.

197
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,030
I can see you laughing.

198
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,510
I laughed because it's so cute.

199
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,220
Did you know that no one has ever complimented my drawings?

200
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,810
Does it look good?

201
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,630
Well, it's just normal.

202
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,250
There's a lot of snacks.

203
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,450
Did someone visit?

204
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,610
Ah, I bought it myself.

205
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,560
Because you said that you don't like to eat rice.

206
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,810
Will anyone know that the actress is...

207
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,900
Is what?

208
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,940
That woman is...

209
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,850
a man and a liar.

210
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,610
So he was punished with a kiss from a man.

211
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,440
And it was also the first kiss.

212
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,720
What's so weird about first kisses?

213
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,100
It's weird...

214
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,550
how good it was.

215
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,310
Like it wasn't the first at all.

216
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,990
It really was the first.

217
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,190
Believe it.

218
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,240
I believe it...

219
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,190
because you were trembling like that.

220
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,720
I don't like being in front of the camera.

221
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,930
When I meet the photographer,

222
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,380
the crew,

223
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,700
people who have expectations of me,

224
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,520
I always start trembling.

225
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
and sometimes get a fever.

226
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,680
I went to the doctor

227
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,630
and they said it was stage fright.

228
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,630
Stage fright?

229
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,760
Yes, P'.

230
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,880
Every time I go on stage or...

231
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,290
I'm in front of many people,

232
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,950
it's like I have butterflies in my stomach.

233
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,650
I feel nauseous.

234
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,440
But you did well for the Happy Wedding ad, right?

235
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,030
Probably because of P'Ryo and the marble.

236
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,130
I have to thank you for your skills.

237
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,840
By the way, I haven't seen any visitors.

238
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,240
Don't you have a family or anyone to visit while you're sick?

239
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,160
P'Aigo went to work.

240
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,500
So, she can't take care of me.

241
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,630
What about your parents?

242
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,520
They live in America.

243
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,990
I fly to see them once a year.

244
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,440
In order to do what I love,

245
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,670
I chose to stay in Thailand.

246
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,040
But Anda, what do you want to be?

247
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,050
I want to be a cartoonist.

248
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,440
Cartoonist?

249
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,450
Anda

250
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,840
Anda

251
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,990
Anda, where are you?

252
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,770
Why didn't you come sleep at home?

253
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,770
Well, I came to the hospital to take care of P'Ryo.

254
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,230
Ryo? He'll kiss you again.

255
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,300
Don't you know how to be afraid?

256
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,300
Kiss what?

257
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,790
There's nothing to kiss.

258
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,620
If he does something again, tell me.

259
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,790
I'll teach him a lesson.

260
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,960
We still haven't resolved the old lawsuit.

261
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,100
Do you already want a new one?

262
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,480
Well, I'm worried about you, Anda.

263
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,390
You don't have to worry about that anymore.

264
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,150
Oh, Anda, is Ryo still going to sue?

265
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,790
I'm asking him for you.

266
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,070
Anda, don't forget to come sing with me.

267
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,460
Hello Anda... Anda...

268
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,950
P'Ryo

269
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,350
will you sue P'Tee and me?

270
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,710
So, you're only interested in this matter?

271
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,160
It's just that my brother is very concerned about this.

272
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,860
So, your brother sent you to convince me not to sue?

273
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,850
Not at all.

274
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,960
I came by myself.

275
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,610
Jet

276
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,810
Mr. Kevin

277
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,360
Take a look at these lyrics.

278
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,950
The songs from the past were great.

279
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,130
Have you ever tried to sing it?

280
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,410
No, Mr. Kevin.

281
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,080
I'll have to try it.

282
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,430
Mr. Kevin gave it to me.

283
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,430
I see that you're going to write a new song, right?

284
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,510
Yes.

285
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,500
Take a look at these songs.

286
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,330
They might help inspire you.

287
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,420
Did you write it yourself, Dad?

288
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,680
Yes, it's been a long time since I wrote anything.

289
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,760
But I just write and leave it alone.

290
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,770
I've never offered it anywhere.

291
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,080
Take a look.

292
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,450
I'll take it to Mr. Tee's room.

293
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,580
Dad, are you afraid that I won't be as successful as you?

294
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,270
Well, I'm more worried that you will be confused.

295
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,740
If we don't know ourselves,

296
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,850
our songs won't be worth listening to.

297
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,840
Dad, are you trying to say something to me?

298
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,850
To compose a song, you must use your heart.

299
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,950
Just write what you feel.

300
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
But if you don't feel anything,

301
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,980
you should ask Jet.

302
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,660
Ask Jet?

303
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,090
Now, Lala is with Ryo, the national husband.

304
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,950
National husband?

305
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,320
They must be crazy!

306
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,760
What?

307
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,890
Really, how, how... and how?

308
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,350
Look at these two!

309
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,890

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,730
Yeah, I didn't sing very well today.

321
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,810
If someone like you doesn't sing well,

322
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,450
what about a crow voice like mine?

323
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,600
I don't know how good my voice should be.

324
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,410
Just better than yesterday is enough.

325
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,710
You told me yourself, didn't you?

326
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,650
If you keep practicing, you'll slowly get better.

327
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,970
C'mon, let's go eat.

328
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,200
Why eat and gain weight?

329
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,060
Oh, P'Ae.

330
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,590
I didn't have an appointment today, did I?

331
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,660
Sorry, I forgot to tell you

332
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,260
that I booked another acting class for you.

333
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,870
But I...

334
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,070
But... but what?

335
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,620
Hey, Bank. No more buts.

336
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,780
If you're not active now, when can you get an acting job?

337
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,480
Or don't tell me...

338
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,610
you think they will hire you as a model until you die of old age?

339
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,740
It's not like that.

340
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,970
But I don't want to go today.

341
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:05,020
Must go, how can't you go? Must go. Go now. Fast.

342
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,560
Hurry up.

343
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,380
P'Nut, the director, wants to talk to you.

344
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,250
Go, go, go.

345
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,700
I'll be going, Anda.

346
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,850
Every time I go on stage or I'm in front of many people,

347
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,320
it's like I have butterflies in my stomach.

348
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,810
Why is this so pitiful?

349
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,660
Thanks.

350
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,720
Hey, Jet.

351
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,800
Listen to the song my dad wrote.

352
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,450
I think melody is good.

353
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,690
It's nice.

354
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,560
Your father is very talented.

355
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,790
Jet,

356
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,140
I feel like my dad is trying to hint at something.

357
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,480
Hint at what?

358
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,970
About composing music.

359
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,890
Dad said that if I can't find inspiration, I should ask you.

360
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
We don't have any work today, P'Aigo?

361
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,460
Actually, I had a photoshoot for a magazine scheduled,

362
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,370
but I canceled it.

363
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,680
because I thought you would be in the hospital longer.

364
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,610
After having a break, I really want to work.

365
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,650
We have a photoshoot tomorrow.

366
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,790
The schedule is so long.

367
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,560
Don't cry and beg me for a break.

368
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,010
So today, have a good rest.

369
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,060
What's wrong?

370
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,330
You don't seem very happy.

371
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,330
Are you thinking of someone?

372
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,630
No.

373
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,380
Sure?

374
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,190
Ok, I'll be leaving.

375
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,420
I have an appointment to talk to a lawyer about the lawsuit.

376
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,020
I'll ask to look at the gym's CCTV later

377
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,220
to make sure the incident wasn't just an accident.

378
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,870
What if it wasn't an accident?

379
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,090
Then, there are many grounds to appeal.

380
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,620
Excuse me.

381
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,450
What's up, Ryo?

382
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,760
P'Aigo, I'll have to trouble you.

383
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,710
Hello Mrs. Aigo.

384
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,740
Hey Da, it's time to sign up for the cartoon contest.

385
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,340
What are you going to draw?

386
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,560
Are you ready?

387
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,940
I will draw Lala as usual.

388
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,400
That's your drawing, right? Let me see it.

389
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,570
I don't want you to show you.

390
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,470
What is this?

391
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,860
Mouse? Pig?

392
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,620
It's not an animal.

393
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,050
We'll be leaving.

394
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,070
Goodbye, P' Jet.

395
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,260
Bye, bye.

396
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,760
Bye, Anda.

397
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,910
Mrs. Aigo called to discuss the lawsuit.

398
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,270
So they're going to sue P'Jet?

399
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,840
No.

400
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,180
As long as you agree to their terms.

401
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,550
What are their terms?

402
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,530
Anda

403
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,210
What happened?

404
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,230
Ryo decided not to sue us.

405
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,670
Hey, we survived this time.

406
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,740
Yes!

407
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,430
But why is Anda upset?

408
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,260
P'Aigo agreed under the terms that Anda must work to compensate.

409
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,750
What work?

410
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,060
Photoshoot.

411
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,590
C'mon, again?

412
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,310
I already said that I don't like photoshoots.

413
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,390
They're going to force me again.

414
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,360
What is he thinking?

415
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Don't give up, little hedgehog.

416
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,260
If someone is willing to open up about their fear,

417
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,610
it would be too cruel to not do anything.

418
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,020
For this person,

419
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,290
I want him to know

420
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:15,840
the butterflies aren't as scary as he thought.

421
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,680
Instead...

422
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,460
they're beautiful and amazing.

423
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,690
Just like him.
