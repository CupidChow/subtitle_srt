00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,960
I don't understand

3
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,560
why you are going through so much trouble to help me?

4
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,470
You know...

5
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,790
in the past,

6
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,640
before I realized I liked acting,

7
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,010
I was like you, too.

8
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,910
Like me?

9
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,030
Chasing after your dreams,

10
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,620
trying this and that.

11
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,890
I tried a lot of things.

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,690
It is tiring,

13
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,330
but keep trying to do your best.

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Make sure there is nothing for you to regret.

15
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,530
That has nothing to do with you helping me.

16
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,280
Of course it does.

17
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,140
Hey, Jet

18
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,290
Did you invite me for coffee

19
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,410
just to sit and stare at you in a daze?

20
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,650
I just have something to think about.

21
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,700
It's about Ryo, right?

22
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,770
My worries are no less than yours.

23
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,950
That Ryo has been eating and sleeping with Anda for several days.

24
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,590
I'm afraid that my brother will fall into that bastard's trap.

25
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,550
But I was thinking about Anda's matter.

26
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,520
Isn't that the same thing?

27
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm referring to what I said to Anda.

28
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,410
It probably sounded cruel

29
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,950
but I don't want him to continue forcing himself to draw.

30
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,820
Forcing himself?

31
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,870
I'll go get you some water.

32
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,110
Are you really going to enter the contest?

33
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,670
I've come this far.

34
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,540
Of course I will.

35
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,320
Why?

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,680
Aren't you afraid of failure?

37
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,360
Of course I'm afraid.

38
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,560
But I believe

39
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,960
that I can do it.

40
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,690
Trust me, don't compete.

41
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,660
I don't want to see you sad.

42
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,040
You are always like this.

43
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,590
I haven't even been able to try.

44
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,900
You just decide that it's impossible.

45
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,760
I'm just saying what I see.

46
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,920
With your painting skills...

47
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,940
the chances of winning are very slim.

48
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,410
There is also the appeal of the characters.

49
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,220
It's more that just painting skills, P'Jet.

50
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,230
I think my work also is capable

51
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,170
of competing with others.

52
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,400
I'll bring back the award and prove it.

53
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,180
When the time comes,

54
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,270
please take back your words.

55
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,680
Hey, you've known Anda for a long time.

56
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
You should know

57
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,690
why Anda is so obsessed with drawing manga.

58
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,190
Because drawing comics

59
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,440
is the only way Anda can escape the stage

60
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,800
and hide from his fears.

61
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
But I don't think he can escape like that.

62
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,190
Do you really think

63
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,270
that if Anda becomes a cartoonist,

64
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,130
he won't have stage fright?

65
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,220
You're on stage more often than me.

66
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
I think you should understand.

67
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,900
Anda is not afraid of the stage.

68
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,560
Anda is afraid of being judged.

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,390
I want to help you do what you love.

70
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Like me...

71
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,600
I don't want you to have any regrets.

72
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,750
So then...

73
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,650
Even if you don't succeed,

74
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
at least you've tried.

75
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
Thank you.

76
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,230
Let's go get your dream.

77
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,850
Okay.

78
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,760
Let's do it.

79
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,750
So the only way for Anda to find his way,

80
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,290
is to let him figure it out himself.

81
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,910
Trust me, don't compete.

82
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,910
I don't want to see you sad.

83
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,930
You're always like this.

84
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,430
I haven't even been able to try yet.

85
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,240
You already decided that it was impossible.

86
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,820
I'm just saying what I see.

87
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,790
With your painting skills...

88
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,080
there is very little chance to win.

89
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,220
I'll win the award and prove it.

90
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,060
Let's go get your dreams.

91
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Thank you very much.

92
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,950
The publishing house said Anda left.

93
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
He didn't pass?

94
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,540
Anda

95
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,750
Why were you sitting there like that?

96
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,900
What would you do if I didn't come home?

97
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,530
I would just

98
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
keep walking

99
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,760
to find Book or Oat.

100
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Or I'd go to Bank.

101
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,890
I could go anywhere

102
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,970
just as long as it's not home.

103
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,920
What's wrong?

104
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,060
Can you tell me?

105
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,490
It's nothing.

106
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,930
Is it because of the contest?

107
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,800
Yes.

108
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,960
It smells good.

109
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,880
Good morning, little hedgehog.

110
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,490
What are you doing?

111
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,970
Making your breakfast.

112
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,930
It looks delicious.

113
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Wait a minute.

114
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,760
Try it.

115
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,460
It's delicious.

116
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,210
Then, make sure to eat a lot.

117
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,180
Why did you suddenly come back last night?

118
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,800
Because your family was calling

119
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,840
to ask if you were with me.

120
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,550
They said you didn't go home.

121
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,140
I was really shocked.

122
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,600
So I hurried back.

123
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,070
I've caused you trouble again.

124
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,990
It's okay.

125
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,680
Even if I didn't come back last night,

126
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,050
I would have come back this morning.

127
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,670
It's not me you should be worried about

128
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,770
but your family.

129
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,880
They are very worried about you, you know?

130
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,660
By now, they probably called the police.

131
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,260
You don't have to worry.

132
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,280
Anda is staying at a friend's house.

133
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,630
Yeah, I know.

134
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Did you call to ask?

135
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
How did you know?

136
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Because we think the same.

137
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,660
I also called Anda's friend this morning.

138
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,440
Then why are you still worried?

139
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,660
Of course, I have to worry.

140
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,290
I told him to send Anda home right away.

141
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,380
But look.

142
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,280
He still isn't home yet.

143
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,220
If you're worried, you can just call again.

144
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,390
Hello, Oat?

145
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,000
Where are you?

146
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
Hurry and bring Anda home.

147
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,760
Tell him I'm waiting for him.

148
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,120
Did you call Oat just now?

149
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,120
Yeah, why?

150
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,600
What's up, Oat?

151
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,110
Well, I can't contact Da at all.

152
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,910
Can you guys help me contact Anda?

153
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,340
Contact Anda?

154
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,060
Well, P'Tee told me to take Anda home right away.

155
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,810
Take Anda home?

156
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,440
What does that have to do with you, Oat?

157
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,940
Well, P'Tee called me this morning

158
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,120
to ask if Anda is with me.

159
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,370
So I told him

160
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,040
that Anda is with me.

161
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,150
But actually, he's not with you.

162
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,030
Then, why did you lie to P'Tee?

163
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,950
Because there's a rule in our manga club

164
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,180
that if someone's family calls

165
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,760
to ask if one of our members is with us,

166
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,900
we should say yes.

167
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,740
Just in case someone hides from their family and sets up a tent

168
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,000
to stand in line for a handshake event.

169
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,390
I just remembered that there was

170
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,910
a handshake event in the bay recently.

171
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,430
This is bad.

172
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,550
Yeah, it's bad.

173
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,560
What are we going to tell his brother?

174
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,640
It's worse than that.

175
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,190
Last night when P'Jet called me,

176
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,620
I also told him that

177
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,440
Anda is with me.

178
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,180
It's really bad.

179
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,880
I think we should throw it away.

180
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,210
Do you mean these papers?

181
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,640
Yes.

182
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,330
I don't know why I should keep it.

183
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,560
Keep it.

184
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,700
It's really good.

185
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,590
It is evidence that you've worked hard.

186
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,710
Evidence of failure.

187
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
There's nothing good about it.

188
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,990
What a pity.

189
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,990
I think it would have passed.

190
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,990
That day,

191
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,760
my stage fright symptoms came back.

192
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,890
I'm sorry.

193
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,000
You helped me so much,

194
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,570
but our effort was wasted.

195
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,690
It's not completely wasted.

196
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,890
What isn't wasted then?

197
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,400
Sometimes the joy of the journey

198
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,270
isn't at the destination.

199
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,590
Right?

200
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,480
♪ Can I be that person? ♪

201
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,680
♪ Am I good enough to deserve your love? ♪

202
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,890
♪ Please tell me what to do ♪

203
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,570
♪ What is missing? Please tell me ♪

204
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,300
You just asked, right?

205
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,430
What's left?

206
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,400
Yeah.

207
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,560
In this comic,

208
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,730
there is still your sincerity.

209
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,560
It's a really good song.

210
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,340
You couldn't write it without sincerity.

211
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,410
Actually, I really wrote this song

212
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,240
hoping that someday the real Lala can sing it.

213
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,860
But after thinking about it,

214
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
I know there's no hope.

215
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,320
So I drew a cartoon Lala to sing it instead.

216
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,750
Why do you think it's impossible?

217
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,510
Because Lala's an idol.

218
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,920
And I'm just...

219
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,580
Just what?

220
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Just a normal person

221
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,520
who has never kissed anyone but me?

222
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,550
Stop it.

223
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
Yes, yes.

224
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,810
Okay.

225
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
How is it?

226
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,430
In short, neither Oat nor Book are really with Anda.

227
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
Where would Anda go?

228
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,630
Maybe you should try Ryo?

229
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,540
Anda definitely wouldn't be with Ryo.

230
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,850
Trust me.

231
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
How can you be sure?

232
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,440
It's a brother's instinct.

233
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,590
Do you have to go back to filming?

234
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,130
Well, I have to redo some photos.

235
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,690
Then I...

236
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,180
Want to go home?

237
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,550
If you don't want to go back,

238
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,610
you can come with me.

239
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,520
I can go?

240
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,960
Yes, let's go to the beach together.

241
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,290
You look like a kid who's never been to the beach.

242
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,570
I haven't been for a long time.

243
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,050
It's beautiful.

244
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,210
Are you sure you still don't want to call your family?

245
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,210
I'll call them later.

246
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,940
I've been a good boy for a long time.

247
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,260
Let me rebel for a few days.

248
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,990
Okay

249
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,220
Let's do whatever you like.

250
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,630
Take it easy.

251
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,840
What?

252
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,420
Don't you like coconut water?

253
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,860
I like it, but...

254
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,890
I'm wondering how you knew I liked it, P'Ryo?

255
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,500
Well, if you drink more coconut water, you can have more energy.

256
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,840
Then, you should drink more

257
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,880
so you can have energy for work.

258
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,560
Well... I'm not working.

259
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,910
Why?

260
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,240
If I tell you that I lied to you,

261
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,840
will you be mad at me?

262
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,240
Lied?

263
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,060
I lied to you about the photoshoots.

264
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,690
Actually, I don't need to shoot anymore.

265
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,340
Then why did you bring you here?

266
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,690
I brought you out to play.

267
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,190
And that's not the only reason.

268
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,530
Come.

269
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,140
Where are we going?

270
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,190
Just come.

271
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,270
Into the sea?

272
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,270
No, go that way.

273
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,880
Where are you taking me then?

274
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,700
Be careful.

275
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,420
Ready, Anda?

276
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,930
1 2 3

277
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
It's beautiful here.

278
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,550
I have something to show you.

279
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,660
Come.

280
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,070
P'Ryo

281
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,570
CUT

282
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,230
That's enough. Lala can rest now.

283
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,880
Thank you.

284
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,830
P'Ryo

285
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,130
I missed you.

286
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,380
Missed you, too.

287
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,350
Hi

288
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,970
Uh... miss you.

289
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,350
So cute.

290
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,140
Where are you staying?

291
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,960
Annanan Hotel is nearby.

292
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,140
What about you, Lala?

293
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,850
It's the same place.

294
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,090
Do you want to go party together?

295
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,740
Is it ok, Anda?

296
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,510
Um... it's ok.

297
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,310
Okay.

298
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,010
Today doesn't feel real, P'.

299
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,240
I must have died and gone to heaven.

300
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
I feel the same.

301
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
It's just like that day we met.

302
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,420
That day?

303
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,480
Yeah

304
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,360
My heart was beating so fast.

305
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,210
I thought we'd never meet again in this life.

306
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,130
But here we are.

307
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,470
I'm back.

308
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,230
Here, take it.

309
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,730
And this cup is for me.

310
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,100
P'Ryo

311
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,890
This is me, right P'Ryo?

312
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,970
Yes.

313
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,160
So cute

314
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,280
Actually, I really wrote this song

315
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,240
hoping that someday the real Lala could sing it.

316
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,050
♪ Can I be that person? ♪

317

320
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,720
It's very well written. I like it a lot.

321
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,050
But I can't see it clearly.

322
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,130
Thank... you.

323
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,100
Come on, don't get sappy.

324
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,840
We're here to celebrate today.

325
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,530
After all, we finished filming.

326
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,340
Here, I'll pour you a drink.

327
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,510
Before drinking, we need to swirl it

328
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,050
so the wine can share its aroma.

329
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
Oh, it smells so fragrant.

330
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,640
Oh, cheers.

331
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,150
Take it slow, Lala.

332
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,650
Don't get too drunk.

333
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,340
I won't get drunk, P'Ryo.

334
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,110
Cheers.

335
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,870
Cheers.

336
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,470
Look, this is the real Lala.

337
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,820
Don't tell anyone.

338
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,440
Don't tell anyone that I know how to have fun.

339
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,840
Of course, I won't tell anyone. Definitely not.

340
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,880
Okay, cheers.

341
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,640
Cheers, hurry.

342
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,650
Okay.

343
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,420
- You're quiet -
- Where are you? -
- Book and Oat are looking for you -

344
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,130
- What are you doing? -
- Anda, are you ok? -
- You can always call me if you need to -

345
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,750
- Why are you so quiet? -
- How was the contest? -
- Anda, don't be sad -

346
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,140
Are you contacting your family?

347
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,100
It's Bank.

348
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,510
He's taking study notes for me.

349
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,380
It's upsetting.

350
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,930
You're with me but chatting with other men.

351
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,910
You're jealous?

352
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,450
Yes, very jealous.

353
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,480
Are you drunk?

354
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm not drunk.

355
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,080
You must be a couple.

356
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,630
Lala

357
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,600
Yeah?

358
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:45,630
I'll send you back to your room.
Yeah?

359
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,550
I'll send you back to your room.

360
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,660
Ryo is the cutest.

361
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,570
Lala, don't fall asleep.

362
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,270
Get up.

363
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Anda, grab Lala's bag.

364
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,640
It finally turned on.

365
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Did you contact Anda?

366
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,050
Yeah, but he didn't answer.

367
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
So what are you smiling about?

368
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,780
Look at this.

369
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,330
This is...

370
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,370
I secretly installed tracking app on his phone.

371
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,280
Are you a stalker?

372
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,190
It should be called "thinking ahead."

373
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,440
She drank more than I expected.

374
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,070
Lala.

375
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,690
This is how she normally is.

376
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,580
When it's not normal, it's even worse.

377
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,860
I'm sorry.

378
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,820
I couldn't reserve you a room in time.

379
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,480
They were full.

380
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,930
It's alright.

381
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,090
I've already troubled you enough like this.

382
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
I'll just sleep on the sofa.

383
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,190
The bed is wide enough to share.

384
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,840
Thank you.

385
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,630
Today was the best day of my life.

386
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,890
Today was also the best day of my life.

387
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,820
Thank you.

388
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,250
For coming with me.

389
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,680
That's enough.

390
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,710
P'Tee! P'Jet!

391
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,530
Anda

392
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,550
Ryo!

393
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,980
Ryo!
- P'Tee!

394
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,610
- Sometimes the joy is not in the destination but the journey -
