Miss Aigo, Miss Aigo.

3
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:37,004
Let me ask you a few questions.

4
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,699
You're Mr. Ryo's manager, right?

5
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:41,136
Uh... yes.

6
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:46,756
Who is the mysterious woman seen walking with Mr. Ryo at the beach?

7
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,602
Oh, it's about that.

8
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:51,138
I'll have to let Ryo answer that.

9
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,900
His new girlfriend, right?

10
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,069
Is it the one from the Happy Wedding ad?

11
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,912
Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

12
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:03,418
Are you reluctant to answer because the one in the photo isn't a woman?

13
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:05,454
Hey...

14
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:07,166
Mr. Ryo likes men, right?

15
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,737
Miss Aigo

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,138
Now, the question female fans want to know:

17
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,258
Who was that mysterious woman?

18
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:24,898
Is it the actress from the Happy Wedding ad?

19
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:27,394
Should we come forward to clarify?

20
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:32,498
Not yet.

21
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,431
The story isn't very big right now.

22
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:39,262
Also,

23
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,992
no one knows about Anda yet.

24
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:45,145
It's better if we don't come forward and make matters worse.

25
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:50,650
Will it really be okay?

26
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,454
This kind of news

27
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:57,303
will fade away very soon.

28
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,249
But now

29
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:04,658
what we really need to worry about

30
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:07,235
is how Anda is taking it.

31
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,618
You're right.

32
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,018
My beautiful actress!

33
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,043
Why are you shouting, Book?

34
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:19,858
Come look.

35
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:24,872
Not only did P'Ryo steal her kiss,

36
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,778
he also stole her heart.

37
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,415
Why do the comments say...

38
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:38,168
"this beautiful actress is disguised as a woman"?

39
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,157
I also think it's true.

40
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,681
It's mind-blowing.

41
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:48,698
How could a boy be so pretty?

42
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,157
There are a lot of rumours right now.

43
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,978
Can you answer some questions for the fans?

44
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,039
Who is the woman from the photo?

45
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:08,944
Are you dating that woman?

46
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:12,154
For now, all I can say is

47
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,918
that person is just an ordinary civilian.

48
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:19,338
So, that means you're dating a civilian right now?

49
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,098
Calling it "dating," seems a little too much.

50
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:29,658
Then, why were you holding hands?

51
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:34,978
Maybe it was the camera angle.

52
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,301
Actually, there is nothing between us.

53
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,496
We're just friends.

54
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,734
Just friends?

55
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,910
The song is finished now.

56
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,734
Why are you still so upset?

57
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,529
It's not because of Anda's matter.

58
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,303
Didn't I tell you

59
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:11,818
that the news comes and goes quickly?

60
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:13,256
It will be forgotten after awhile.

61
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:14,892
Yeah.

62
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:18,458
I'm worried about the relationship between Anda and Ryo.

63
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,218
I don't know how they can go on in this current situation.

64
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:26,354
What if this happened to us?

65
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:27,794
What would you do?

66
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,578
I would do nothing.

67
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:32,178
Just let it go.

68
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:33,934
Jet

69
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:39,998
I think my fans care more about my songs than who I love.

70
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:51,034
I like you...

71
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,378
just because you're you.

72
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,227
Anyway, you've already finished the song

73
00:05:58,227 --> 00:05:59,740
but we still haven't celebrated yet.

74
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,765
We're still celebrating?

75
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,011
Don't you want to?

76
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,658
I'm planning to cook for you.

77
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:08,938
I want to.

78
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:12,498
I want to eat whatever you'll make.

79
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:34,004
Da

80
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:36,738
How are you today?

81
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,418
You mean...

82
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,658
how is the matter with P'Ryo and I?

83
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:47,418
Yeah.

84
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,914
Well,

85
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:53,578
we're still the same.

86
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:57,438
There's no problem because of the news, right?

87
00:06:58,498 --> 00:06:59,498
Right.

88
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:01,711
That's good.

89
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:04,487
This is what the entertainment industry is like.

90
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,352
You'll get used to it after awhile.

91
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,495
Okay?

92
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,818
Yes, I understand.

93
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:17,291
There is no privacy in this circle.

94
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:19,898
I'll be leaving now.

95
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:41,858
P'Ryo

96
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:53,338
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,731
If it's about Bank,

98
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:01,458
I'm not mad at you.

99
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,928
But it made you unhappy.

100
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,978
So I want to apologize to you.

101
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:17,258
Forgive me?

102
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:23,970
I said I'm not angry.

103
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,938
About the news,

104
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,066
what should we do now?

105
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,826
You don't have to do anything.

106
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:51,862
I'll take care of it with the media.

107
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,578
Then...

108
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,172
what about our relationship?

109
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,174
Our relationship...

110
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:13,694
is still the same.

111
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:18,891
Everyone still thinks you're a girl

112
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,258
So...

113
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:27,118
no one will find out about us.

114
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:35,378
Right, no one will know.

115
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:10,818
Da, are you ok?

116
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,938
I'm okay.

117
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:16,253
Why wouldn't I be okay?

118
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,189
You don't have to pretend, Da.

119
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:21,165
Others don't know, but I do.

120
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:22,500
You're the one in the picture.

121
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:25,406
You really know so well.

122
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,178
It's no wonder

123
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,769
why P'Ryo was so suspicious.

124
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,682
that you were taking the photos.

125
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,929
Da, you know, right?

126
00:10:34,976 --> 00:10:36,569
I would never do that.

127
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,628
I know.

128
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,483
That's why I quarreled with P'Ryo

129
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:42,858
to protect you.

130
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:47,969
So, how are things between you and P'Ryo?

131
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,298
We made up.

132
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:55,809
That's good.

133
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,878
I thought you guys were still fighting because of me.

134
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,091
I need to apologize to you

135
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:08,598
about the trouble with P'Ryo that day.

136
00:11:10,556 --> 00:11:12,236
Don't worry about it.

137
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,760
If it was me,

138
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,304
I would be like that, too.

139
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:19,404
I understand.

140
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:21,518
He should be very worried about you.

141
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,596
Worried because of you?

142
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:26,455
There's nothing to worry about.

143
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:31,886
Yeah.

144
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,124
That's right.

145
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,398
There's nothing to worry about.

146
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,123
Hey, Oat!

147
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,054
What is it, Book?

148
00:11:53,794 --> 00:11:57,938
Doesn't it seem like Anda?

149
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,479
What seems like Anda?

150
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,885
It's the photo of P'Ryo on the beach.

151
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:09,958
Look closer, totally resembles Anda.

152
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:15,074
Are you crazy?

153
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:16,973
You don't believe me?

154
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,098
Look now.

155
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:26,144
It's kind of similar.

156
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,628
Right?

157
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,157
The more I think about it,

158
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:32,269
isn't it too coincidental

159
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,946
that Anda also took a trip to the beach?

160
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:48,218
P'Ryo, do you think our relationship is really possible?

161
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,262
Why are you suddenly asking that?

162
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:58,258
I just thought about it

163
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,365
because of the news.

164
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:04,258
Between the two of us,

165
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:06,249
can it really work?

166
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,898
I told you, didn't I?

167
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:13,059
News matters won't affect us.

168
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:16,298
We can say that today,

169
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,493
but not necessarily in the future, right?

170
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,241
If one day,

171
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,921
someone knows about us

172
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:30,414
and your relationship with boys,

173
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:33,578
what will we do?

174
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:37,738
If that day comes,

175
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,258
I'll come forward to tell them

176
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,778
that we're together.

177
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:45,218
In exchange for your future?

178
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,317
If I have to choose,

179
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:58,638
I prefer a future where the two of us are together.

180
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,218
It's not worth it, P'.

181
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:13,458
Compared to the work you've dedicated your life to.

182
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:26,298
If I had to choose,

183
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:30,958
I would choose to give you a good future.

184
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:36,698
Let's talk about the future when we get there.

185
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:39,578
Right now, I'm hungry.

186
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,525
Let's find something to eat.

187
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Okay?

188
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,938
Why did you bring me to this restaurant, P'?

189
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:25,758
Why?

190
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,038
Does it seem bad?

191
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,718
There are so many people, something might happen.

192
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:45,775
I want to prove it to you

193
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:48,134
that we can still live normally.

194
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,934
Don't worry about anything.

195
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:54,578
As long as we don't do anything excessive, it will be fine.

196
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,418
It's really okay, right?

197
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,150
Yeah.

198
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,453
If someone really takes a picture of us,

199
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:17,538
what news will he spread?

200
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:21,147
"Ryo goes to dinner with a friend."

201
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:24,171
"Doesn't it look delicious?"

202
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,658
Don't worry.

203
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:32,578
Nothing will happen.

204
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,231
Let's go.

205
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:21,904
Hello

206
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:22,939
What's up?

207
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:25,818
Where are you?

208
00:17:25,975 --> 00:17:28,042
Oh, sorry I forgot to tell you.

209
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:29,703
I came to spy on Anda.

210
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:31,458
Spy on Anda?

211
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:33,303
Right.

212
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,442
I was right to come spy on him.

213
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:36,860
Did you know?

214
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,669
Ryo took Anda out to dinner.

215
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,100
He's not careful at all.

216
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,235
There are many people here.

217
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:46,313
I don't know when the paparazzi might follow to take photos.

218
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:48,398
So, when are you coming back?

219
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:52,778
Well, it might be awhile to get back.

220
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:55,854
Let me make sure that lunatic won't come take pictures again.

221
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,218
Did you forget?

222
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,058
Forget?

223
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:07,721
Oh, I'll be back to eat later.

224
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,766
When you sound like this,

225
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,049
that means you're not hungry, right?

226
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,290
Let's eat together tomorrow.

227
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,498
You got it again today?

228
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,011
Yeah.

229
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,904
I talked to the reporter just now.

230
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:24,258
It's not 100% certain,

231
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:27,506
but judging from the IP and upload address,

232
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,818
the person who took the photo of Anda and Ryo may be...

233
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:32,379
What?

234
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:37,547
Da

235
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,258
What's the matter?

236
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:45,538
Just I heard a familiar voice.

237
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:52,878
Are you being cautious because you're afraid of being photographed?

238
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,578
It's strange if you're not cautious.

239
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:08,734
Try it.

240
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,498
Didn't you say not to do anything excessive?

241
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:38,858
It was just a trivial thing.

242
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:44,525
It'll be on the news later.

243
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:00,795
Anda

244
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:40,418
Anda, follow me.

245
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:47,062
Anda

246
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,780
I'll take you.

247
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:54,893
The termination of our contract with Ryo

248
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,109
has nothing to do with him dating a man.

249
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,709
Please don't assume.

250
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,498
If that's the case, why did you terminate the contract with Ryo?

251
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:04,883
Because we feel that Ryo

252
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:07,065
does not suit our brand's image.

253
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:10,143
Even though you've worked with Ryo for 10 years, right?

254
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,610
What happened?

255
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:12,619
Goodbye.

256
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,778
Well, the contract just expired.

257
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:19,689
It has nothing to do with the exposed photos.

258
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:23,333
When we choose the next representative,

259
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,658
we want 100% real men.

260
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,978
Can you tell us who the next representative will be?

261
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:32,844
Ah, we already have eyes on this matter.

262
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:34,644
But we can't reveal it yet.

263
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,267
- It rose to the top of the search
@Gay and what's it to you? -

264
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,941
- Does who he likes or loves make his work worse? -
- What's it to us? What isn't it? If you liked men, you should have said earlier. You tricked us -

265
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,742
- It's a pity -
- So what if he's gay? What right do you have to spray paint his car? -

266
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:45,374
At a time like this, waffles are really tasty.

267
00:23:45,406 --> 00:23:47,086
They can heal anything.

268
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:03,458
Pink bubble tea has arrived, Anda.

269
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,384
Thank you.

270
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:25,378
No matter what, we will be by your side.

271
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:28,664
This is just a trivial matter.

272
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:30,999
It will be over soon.

273
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:56,255
- The handsome  rising star, Bank, is about to seize the role of brand representative for Super X and ChaCha Beverages from Ryo -

274
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:12,362
Anda

275
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,455
There are too many people.

276
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:26,201
Let's talk somewhere else.

277
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:28,422
Okay.

278
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:39,080
I saw the news about you, Bank.

279
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:40,398
Congratulations.

280
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,209
Thank you.

281
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:53,766
Anda, are you okay?

282
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:07,809
Not okay.

283
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:11,444
I still don't understand.

284
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:14,848
Don't understand what?

285
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:19,778
I don't understand the paparazzi.

286
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,931
Why are they doing this to us?

287
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:31,578
I can understand the photos from the beach.

288
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,630
But the other one...

289
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:38,413
was taken while we were at home.

290
00:26:38,413 --> 00:26:40,992
Why are they tareting P'Ryo and I

291
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:44,258
to hurt us so deliberately?

292
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:57,418
In this circle,

293
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:01,853
nothing is good at all.

294
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,503
Bank, you be careful, too.

295
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:14,538
Don't have problems like ours in the future.

296
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,950
Okay.

297
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,898
I really-

298
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:25,218
shouldn't have entered P'Ryo's life in the first place.

299
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:34,277
Are you still comfortable

300
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,458
being by Ryo's side?

301
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,342
How can I feel comfortable, Bank?

302
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:52,578
I screwed everything up

303
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:58,618
I'm to blame for ruining Ryo's life.

304
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:09,635
Then, you might feel better if you stop.

305
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,036
Why don't you stop?

306
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:31,025
How is the work schedule lately?

307
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:39,438
The workload is down, right?

308
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:40,848
Yes.

309
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:50,338
Having a break is better.

310
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,199
If it's a break, you should really rest.

311
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,818
Look at yourself now.

312
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,392
It's like you haven't slept.

313
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:01,938
Did you eat anything today, Ryo?

314
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:03,676
Ryo

315
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:05,788
Ryo

316
00:29:06,637 --> 00:29:07,637
Ryo

317
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:08,661
Yes?

318
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,658
I forgot to eat today.

319
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,658
Then, I should find something to eat.

320
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,713
Ryo

321
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:29,578
Isn't this great, P'Ae?

322
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,138
It's not over yet.

323
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:35,058
Bring it over.

324
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:41,750
Thank you.

325
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,031
But it's not my birthday.

326
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:50,165
We're celebrating your new popularity.

327
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:55,266
You became the representative of two tending brands.

328
00:29:57,678 --> 00:29:59,778
Oh, I see.

329
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:03,242
Hey Bank, do you see now?

330
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:08,098
I told you just listen to me and you'll be popular soon.

331
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:13,138
Thank you for your hard work in getting to this point.

332
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,738
I'm just lucky.

333
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:18,057
If it weren't for the rumors about P'Ryo by chance...

334
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:20,138
It's not by chance.

335
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:29,477
Such coincidences are impossible, Bank.

336
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:30,865
This...

337
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:32,538
This P'...

338
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:36,828
Hey, Bank.

339
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:40,272
Chances like this don't come often.

340
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,679
So you must do your best.

341
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,809
This was your doing, P'?

342
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:01,104
How could you do this?

343
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,550
It's for your future, of course.

344
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,458
For my future?

345
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,329
Or for your own future?

346
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,199
What's the difference?

347
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:13,687
For you, for me...

348
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:20,073
The most important thing now is that Ryo's jobs are now yours.

349
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:21,700
We succeeded, didn't we?

350
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,418
But we didn't need to do it this way.

351
00:31:29,203 --> 00:31:31,003
What way should we do then?

352
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,133
Bank, you really want to use clean methods

353
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:40,998
and slowly wait for Ryo to disappear before you can climb up?

354
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:43,914
Stop dreaming, Bank.

355
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:48,498
Until Ryo is gone, you won't be able to climb the ladder.

356
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:55,754
You know it yourself, so let go of those naive thoughts.

357
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:59,534
Oh, and also the idea of liking men.

358
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:00,430
Really?

359
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,176
Do you want to end up like Ryo and Anda?

360
00:32:07,821 --> 00:32:10,358
Don't intrude in others' lives like this.

361
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,751
Bank

362
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:16,739
P', you're disgusting.

363
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,333
You-

364
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,922
I'll expose you

365
00:32:24,947 --> 00:32:27,683
and tell everyone what you did.

366
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:29,734
Fine! Go on then!

367
00:32:29,734 --> 00:32:32,978
I'm warning you, I won't let this slide!

368
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:34,505
I'll drag you down with me.

369
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,213
Bank, you bastard!

370
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:49,138
Bank, just you wait!

371
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:54,036
What?

372
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:54,898
You think you're so impressive?

373
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:56,303
If you're so capable, just go!

374
00:32:56,303 --> 00:32:58,448
You go and I'll eat it by myself!

375
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:21,847
Here.

376
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:23,529
What is it?

377
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:25,738
Have some milk first.

378
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:39,258
I've been thinking.

379
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,055
Did you figure it out?

380
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:44,378
What you should do now?

381
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:51,593
If you're just trying to figure out what is right,

382
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:53,114
it's impossible.

383
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,159
Why?

384
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:02,444
Anda

385
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:06,269
What you think is right

386
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,498
will still be wrong

387
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,538
in the eyes of some people.

388
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:19,718
You should choose with your heart, ok?

389
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,443
But the path from my heart,

390
00:34:27,153 --> 00:34:29,458
won't make me happy.

391
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:35,698
Then you can cry on my shoulder.

392
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:11,671
Anda

393
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:43,818
P'Aigo said you wouldn't eat anything.

394
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,858
P'Aigo was exaggerating.

395
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,618
I'll cook for you.

396
00:35:51,488 --> 00:35:52,488
Okay.

397
00:35:52,924 --> 00:35:54,604
You're making it.

398
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:56,458
So, I'll definitely eat it up.

399
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,420
Go sit down and wait.

400
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:20,374
You won't burn down the kitchen, right?

401
00:36:29,245 --> 00:36:30,245
Try it.

402
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:47,978
Mm, it's delicious.

403
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,603
You practiced secretly.

404
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:55,818
I just did what you taught me.

405
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,418
In that case,

406
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,418
I need to teach you some more dishes.

407
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,154
Won't you eat with me?

408
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:13,858
Or just watch me eat?

409
00:37:16,104 --> 00:37:18,294
I like watching you eat.

410
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,658
Is something wrong?

411
00:37:42,086 --> 00:37:44,175
I want you to have a future.

412
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:51,178
So...

413
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:55,092
Let me leave your life.

414
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:04,428
Don't, Anda.

415
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:08,169
Don't do this.

416
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,241
I love you.

417
00:38:18,098 --> 00:38:20,576
If you really love me,

418
00:38:20,576 --> 00:38:22,256
don't leave me, okay?

419
00:39:42,058 --> 00:39:48,138
I prefer a future where the two of us are together.

420
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:50,017
It's not worth it, P'.

421
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:54,041
Compared to the work you've dedicated your life to.

422
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,990
If I had to choose,

423
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:01,218
I would choose to give you a good future.

424
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:11,958
- Missed calls from Ryo -
- 113 missed calls -

425
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:47,781
- What we think is right, is still wrong in the eyes of some in the end. Let's choose from the heart -
