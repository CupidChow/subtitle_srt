2
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:45,569
There's nothing else to lose with this shoot.

3
00:01:50,809 --> 00:01:52,928
I'll go back and finish the scene.

4
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:16,226
Perfect.

5
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:17,747
What did you say?

6
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:19,734
How was my acting?

7
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:21,053
Nice, right?

8
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,329
If Anda finds out, I won't help you.

9
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,729
If I don't do this,

10
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,689
Anda will never continue filming.

11
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,529
Besides...

12
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,529
If you don't tell and I don't tell,

13
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:39,040
no one will know.

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,689
Okay?

15
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:46,249
I'm worthy of graduating from drama department.

16
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,889
Great, right? My acting skills-

17
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:51,269
What acting skills?

18
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:01,849
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,969
Don't turn your back on me, okay?

20
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,649
 I've waited for you for a long time.

21
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,214
Since the day we met ten years ago,

22
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,081
I couldn't forget your face.

23
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:45,756
You...

24
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,609
You're a man?

25
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,369
You've always been a man.

26
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,649
Y-yes.

27
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:10,169
The girl I met that day...

28
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,568
That girl also...

29
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,929
It was me.

30
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,423
What is going on?

31
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:24,915
What is this?

32
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:32,566
You've been lying to me, haven't you?

33
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:38,569
What are you thinking, huh?

34
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,893
Please calm down.

35
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:44,654
Listen to me first.

36
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:59,949
Does he hate me, Mom?

37
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:03,009
You mean P'Ryo?

38
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,269
He doesn't.

39
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,729
How not?

40
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,547
He ran away

41
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,909
and also cut off the filming.

42
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,049
It must be because of me.

43
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:29,530
You were great today, okay?

44
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,409
You tried your best.

45
00:05:58,464 --> 00:05:59,615
P'Jet

46
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:00,615
Yes?

47
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,569
Do you...

48
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,969
think P'Ryo is okay now?

49
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,076
Right, how could it be okay?

50
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,950
I didn't say anything.

51
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,812
How could it be okay?

52
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:56,858
If he wants to be angry,

53
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,276
he should be angry with us parents.

54
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,759
Because we're the elders and didn't tell him the truth.

55
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:07,292
I will apologize to him myself.

56
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,049
Let me go, too.

57
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:15,120
I have something to return to him.

58
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:28,827
Are you sure you want to go with me?

59
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,289
Yes, I'm sure.

60
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,949
Your "secret coffee" has arrived.

61
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,129
Drink up, Tee, Nick.

62
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:07,289
Shit Big

63
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,129
Why do you add pepper to your coffee?

64
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,369
This is my dad's secret recipe.

65
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:13,249
When you can't come up with ideas,

66
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:16,514
add some pepper and your brain will spark to life immediately.

67
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,689
How is your brain alive, Big?

68
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:22,449
Your brain is sleeping everyday, you little shit.

69
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,192
P', P', P'

70
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,289
Right now, I feel

71
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,109
a rush of ideas.

72
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,239
Here's my idea.

73
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:37,541
I made a song with Big

74
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,918
and we'll show it to you.

75
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,540
You want to show it off?

76
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:41,908
Yes, let's do it.

77
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
Here we go.

78
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,249

00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:50,809

00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:08,833

85
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,757

87
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:19,209
If the two of you will just be quiet and leave me alone,

88
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,309
I promise I'll write a single for you.

89
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,109
But we need several singles

90
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:27,309
and the interview is coming soon.

91
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,569
How will we explain to the fans?

92
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,257
Shit

93
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:36,646
Hey, Nick

94
00:09:36,646 --> 00:09:37,598
What?

95
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:38,915
I told you that song wouldn't work.

96
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,335
What?

97
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,439
We shouldn't have shown it to him.

98
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,649
But my song is great.

99
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,569
But I still have a song...

100
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:46,309
Better keep it to yourself.

101
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,829
Are you not drawing today, Da?

102
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:08,474
Not in the mood.

103
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:11,889
You seem upset today.

104
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,618
It's that obvious?

105
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:25,706
"Liars will be punished."

106
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:28,297
So the saying goes.

107
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:35,329
If you know you're wrong, just apologize.

108
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:39,809
He might have just been shocked.

109
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:44,489
Will just an apology fix it?

110
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,657
Buy him something he likes to persuade him.

111
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,676
Good luck, Anda.

112
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,754
I'm leaving now.

113
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,369
Buy what he likes...

114
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:48,529
- Anda: Hello -

115
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,164
Reply if you read it.

116
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,129
P'Ryo, I'm sorry.

117
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,897
I really don't know what to do.

118
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,868
I'm not okay leaving you like this.

119
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:21,169
If I could turn back time,

120
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:22,929
I wouldn't let it become like this.

121
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,129
I'm really sorry, P'.

122
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:30,417
Um, sorry. I'm Aigo.

123
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,929
Who is this?

124
00:12:38,973 --> 00:12:41,365
Sorry, wrong number.

125
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,269
Oh, are you Anda?

126
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:47,477
Er, yes.

127
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:51,529
I'll let Ryo know you called.

128
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:57,529
Did P'Ryo say anything about me to you?

129
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,564
Ryo told me about you,

130
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,569
but it was nothing bad.

131
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,208
Then, can you tell me

132
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,649
what kind of things P'Ryo likes?

133
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:14,569
Hm, what Ryo likes?

00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,387

Thank you to Crusherz for performing live for us today.

142
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,449
Thank you.

143
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,969
Thank you, everyone.

144
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:12,349
Thank you.

145
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,733
I heard that you've been working on a new song lately.

146
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:18,707
Can you tell the fans what type of song it is?

147
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:19,895
Well...

148
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,490
The type...

149
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:26,592
It's a rock song. Cute, but the lyrics are very fresh.

150
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:32,107
Then, can you give the fans a sample?

151
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:35,089
Uh, that's...

152
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:36,102
Um...

153
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:41,337

154
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:42,600

155
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:22,809
And we are... Crusherz!

156
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,172
Not going to say hello?

157
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:56,609
Sorry, didn't see you.

158
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,199
Everything was cleared up the other day, right?

159
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,929
It's clear.

160
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,089
But I would appreciate

161
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:10,428
if your brother would stop pestering me.

162
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,439
Does my brother disgust you that much?

163
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:14,849
I'm not disgusted.

164
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:18,552
I just don't want to see him.

165
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,745
But Anda apologized to you.

166
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:25,689
I've already put it from my mind.

167
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:27,529
Just stop bothering me.

168
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:31,009
It's fine if you just stay out of my life.

169
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:32,249
I don't understand

170
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:34,582
why you hate my brother so much.

171
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:37,089
Just because kissing a boy.

172
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:42,649
Whether I care or not,

173
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,809
it's my right to decide.

174
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,314
If your brother keeps harrassing me with messages

175
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,889
or tries to contact me,

176
00:16:51,369 --> 00:16:52,664
I'll let the police deal with it.

177
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,166
You're really too much.

178
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,336
Hey

179
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,660
Yes, Mom?

180
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,464
What are you doing?

181
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:25,289
Look how much you're smiling.

182
00:17:28,164 --> 00:17:29,164
Looking...

183
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:31,869
Looking at pictures of Bank's audition.

184
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,912
Well, I'm going out to see Ryo now.

185
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:39,512
Do you want to come?

186
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:50,454
Hello.

187
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:51,751
Hello, Mrs. Aim.

188
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,069
Mrs. Aim, why did you want to see me?

189
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,139
Well...

190
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:04,709
I wanted to apologize to you for what happened.

191
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,581
If that's the case,

192
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,369
it's already forgotten.

193
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:17,036
You can rest assured.

194
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:25,049
But still let me explain, okay?

195
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,209
Okay.

196
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:32,999
Well, we don't want you to think

197
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,984
that we hid this from you on purpose

198
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,857
just to hurt your feelings, Ryo.

199
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:41,926
It's really already forgotten.

200
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:48,569
Uh, P'Ryo...

201
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,756
If that's all Mrs. Aim wanted,

202
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:59,436
then I'll be leaving.

203
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:08,334
All better?

204
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:11,248
He...

205
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,289
Is he really not upset anymore?

206
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,766
Good, good.

207
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,100
Change position.

208
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:24,369
Get closer.

209
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:26,665
Good, good.

210
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,009
Good, good.

211
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:31,873
Good.

212
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,449
Good, take a break.

213
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,369
Good work.

214
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:42,369
P'Ryo

215
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,448
I was really nervous, P'.

216
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:48,649
I was shaking the whole time since I got to take pictures with you.

217
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,914
You're exaggerating.

218
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,950
You're a huge superstar.

219
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,950
Anyone would be like this, P'.

220
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,272
Don't consider me so highly.

221
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:00,225
You're also a rising star.

222
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,607
I've been following your work.

223
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,289
Really?

224
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,335
You've had many photoshoots

225
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:11,269
and you'll be starring in a TV series soon, right?

226
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,729
I wish I can be just half as famous as you.

227
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,229
And as attractive.

228
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:17,916
What's your advice?

229
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,956
You give me too much credit.

230
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:22,654
You're even more attractive than me.

231
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:24,694
Not true, P'.

232
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,771
I'm no match for you.

233
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:29,849
Then...

234
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:32,066
Where do you go to workout?

235
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:32,972
I want to go, too.

236
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:37,456
It's right here near the studio, through the alley.

237
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,202
Bank

238
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:42,189
How was it, P'Ae?

239
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,813
Amazing!

240
00:20:50,438 --> 00:20:51,742
Nong Ryo

241
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:52,758
Hey.

242
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:54,605
It's been awhile, P'Ae.

243
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:58,027
Is Bank your new artist?

244
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:01,609
That's right.

245
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:04,729
You see, Bank is a rising star now.

246
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,398
He's even better than you were at this time.

247
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:11,169
That's good, P'.

248
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,089
Take good care of him.

249
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:17,729
Taking care of this is my area of expertise.

250
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,117
You should know, Ryo.

251
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:24,189
I think you should worry about yourself.

252
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:27,052
I heard about your latest ad.

253
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,332
It caused a lot of trouble, didn't it?

254
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:32,686
Right?

255
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:35,668
P'Ae, you haven't changed at all.

256
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:38,989
You still like to gossip and spread rumors about others.

257
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,582
Give it a rest, P.

258
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,546
It's not a good look on you.

259
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:48,891
Thank you.

260
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:55,359
That was amazing!

261
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:58,489
So amazing, how are you so amazing?

262
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:13,543
P'Ae

263
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:18,121
Do you know P'Ryo?

264
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:21,959
Know him?

265
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:24,132
I know him very, very well.

266
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:27,169
He used to follow me around all the time.

267
00:22:28,076 --> 00:22:29,756
He became like he is now

268
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:34,451
thanks to me.

269
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:37,665
Is that true, P'?

270
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:40,789
Of course, it's true! Why would I lie?

271
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,365
But you never told me before.

272
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:43,365
Why would I?

273
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,234
Because now...

274
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,297
my obligation is to make you

275
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:49,829
more famous than someone.

276
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:53,969
More famous than someone?

277
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:55,195
Who are you referring to?

278
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,697
Being more famous than someone is the same as being more famous than everyone.

279
00:22:58,697 --> 00:22:59,673
It's the most famous!

280
00:23:02,707 --> 00:23:04,049
I'll do my best.

281
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:08,209
Bank, your best is not enough.

282
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,110
Remember what I said?

283
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:14,964
In this industry, there is no true friendship

284
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,989
or eternal enemy.

285
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,209
C'mon, get in.

286
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,500
Why are you so late?

287
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,389
I know why I'm having trouble writing the song now.

288
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:02,825
Why?

289
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:06,769
Because you're always pulling that stern face.

290
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:10,449
And would that affect your work?

291
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:11,544
It's only natural.

292
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,030
Get on.

293
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,848
Hold on tight.

294
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:34,600
What's going on?

295
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:41,433
Dear, how is Anda?

296
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,533
He might need some time.

297
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:50,177
But these kind of things happen.

298
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,475
It's not a big deal.

299
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:58,054
This is the entertainment industry.

300
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:03,032
It was even worse before, wasn't it?

301
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:04,179
Much worse.

302
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,967
But it's good.

303
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:09,755
Our son is gaining experience.

304
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,867
But now I'm not so worried about Anda.

305
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,367
I'm more worried about Tee.

306
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:19,598
Why?

307
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:21,400
Because of the new song?

308
00:25:21,762 --> 00:25:22,958
Hey, dear.

309
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,333
Don't you have any advice for our kids?

310
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,233
He probably doesn't need our advice anymore.

311
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:51,933
I think he might find his inspiration soon.

312
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:58,033
What's wrong with these children of ours?

313
00:25:58,953 --> 00:25:59,953
It's fine.

314
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,860
Stop worrying about the kids for awhile.

315
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,267
Won't you worry about your husband?

316
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm tired.

317
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,900
Shall we go to bed?

318
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,760
You better just sleep.

319
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,167
Don't come and pester me.

320
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,555
You don't want it?

321
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:22,555
But I know you.

322
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,554
P', did you buy what I asked you to?

323
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:35,433
Of course.

324
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,141
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

325
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,196
It's no trouble.

326
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:45,167
I needed to pick you up today anyway.

327
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,368
What's going on today?

328
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
You have classes today.

329
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:52,600
What classes?

330
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:54,433
Special classes.

331
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:10,861
Good.

332
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:18,051
Anda

333
00:27:18,255 --> 00:27:21,000
Anda, come practice singing with us.

334
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,134
Anda, sing after me.

335
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:31,833
♪ La la la la la la ♪

336
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:36,806
x La la la la la la x

337
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:40,683
Ok, ok. Let's try with just the lips like this.

338
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:45,887
Try it.

339
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:52,610
OK, good job.

340
00:27:52,618 --> 00:27:56,804
This method is used by many world-famous celebrities.

341
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,575
Then, I can sing a song now, right?

342
00:27:59,913 --> 00:28:01,967
Sing a song for me.

343
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:05,267
Uh, what song?

344
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:07,033
Any song you want.

345
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,767
But I don't really sing any.

346
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:13,900
Then, just sing whatever you sing in the shower.

347
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:15,769
In the shower?

348
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:20,500
Little ducky

349
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:27,780
I don't really sing in the shower either.

350
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,533
Oh, there has to be something.

351

I sing a lot at home.

00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:42,500
So, how was the lesson?

375
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:46,411
Didn't you hear it?

376
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:50,772
But for the first day, you did really good.

377
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:53,677
Hey, Bank!

378
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,358
Do you need to see a doctor to have your ears checked?

379
00:30:56,358 --> 00:30:58,092
Do you have something in there?

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,090
You're so fun to tease.

383
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:10,033
It's fun, you say? Fun? Fun?

384
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:13,667
Just keep working at it and you'll slowly get better.

385
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,220
You can do it.

386
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:17,959
Shall we grab something to eat?

387
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,959
Let's go.

388
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
To be honest...

389
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:24,925
I don't really like singing.

390
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:28,250
I'd rather write songs.

391
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,166
You write songs?

392
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:33,100
Well, I try.

393
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:35,035
Show me.

394
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:36,400
Hey, don't look.

395
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:40,100
This one I wrote only for Lala.

396
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:41,619
Lala?

397
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:43,299
You mean the idol?

398
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:44,667
Yeah.

399
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,267
But it's the Lala in my manga.

400
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:52,842
The real Lala

401
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,944
would never sing the songs I wrote.

402
00:31:55,528 --> 00:31:56,528
Cute, right?

403
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:59,900
Yeah, it's cute.

404
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:04,967
What's that bag for?

405
00:32:07,137 --> 00:32:08,137
This bag?

406
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:13,867
Well, it's something I got to apologize to P'Ryo.

407
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:15,395
P'Ryo?

408
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:19,567
Don't tell me the one who's angry at you is P'Ryo?

409
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,400
Yeah, it's him.

410
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,033
But he doesn't want to see me

411
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:31,997
and I don't know how to find him.

412
00:32:33,872 --> 00:32:37,000
I can take you if you want to meet P'Ryo.

413
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:40,865
Really?

414
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:53,887
Want to come workout with me?

415
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,245
So we can stay in shape.

416
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,467
I won't, but you can feel free.

417
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:15,941
So sore.

418
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:45,412
Hey, what are you peeping at?

419
00:33:45,412 --> 00:33:46,412
What peeping?

420
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:49,349
I saw you sneak a peak.

421
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:51,900
I'm working.

422
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,897
Please don't disturb me.

423
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:54,733
I'm still working out.

424
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,050
Please don't sneak a peak, okay?

425
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:57,248
Jet, what are you fretting over?

426
00:34:58,036 --> 00:34:59,036
Anda

427
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:00,792
What about Anda?

428
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:03,878
Anda said he would go meet Ryo to apologize.

429
00:35:21,674 --> 00:35:23,143
Try it slowly.

430
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:24,924
Hey, that's it.

431
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Okay.

432
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,454
I'll help you put it down now.

433
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,000
Move your knee here.

434
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:32,671
Here, here.

435
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:33,696
Okay.

436
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,385
Is this right, Bank?

437
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,532
It's right.

438
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:37,548
Now lift up.

439
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,497
Like that.

440
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:43,194
Now down, down slowly.

441
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,001
Nice, you're strong.

442
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:44,524
Bank

443
00:35:58,941 --> 00:35:59,941
And again.

444
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:01,144
Up.

445
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Like that.

446
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Good job.

447
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:12,472
P'Ryo

448
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
P'Ryo

449
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:21,633
I got this for you.

450
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,967
It's my apology.

451
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:32,433
Did I ever ask for your apology?

452
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:36,376
I told your brother to tell you

453
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,533
that I don't want to see you again.

454
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
But...

455
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:47,992
P'Tee didn't say anything to me.

456
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,981
If he didn't tell you yet,

457
00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:57,535
then I'll tell you clearly now.

458
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,632
I'm not angry.

459
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:05,856
But I don't want to see you again.

460
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:12,636
Go away!

461
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:07,503
Yes, okay, P'Aim.

462
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:20,333
 - The number you dialed is unavailable, please try again later -

463
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,205
His phone's off.

464
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,633
Where is he?

465
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:00,567
I've been waiting for years

466
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:03,100
like I was born to wait for that person.

467
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:07,100
Did she turn out that bad?

468
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:08,532
No

469
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:14,667
That person just isn't what I expected.

470
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:21,467
Then, are you willing to understand and accept that person as they are now?

471
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:24,937
That...

472
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:29,624
I'm not sure if I can.

473
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,390
P', what are you doing?

474
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:04,367
You're really not a girl, right?

475
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:06,568
What are you saying?

476
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:08,082
How could I be a girl?

477
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Prove it.

478
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,140
Prove to me

479
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,500
that you're really a boy.

480
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:16,967
What do you mean prove, P'Ryo?

481
00:40:17,464 --> 00:40:18,464
Anda

482
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:20,308
Anda

483
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:23,267
P'Ryo

484
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:31,285
Why is it like this?

485
00:40:33,324 --> 00:40:35,457
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,799
Why do I feel like this?

487
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,730
Shit!

488
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,700
Ryo, you bastard!
