2
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,100
That's enough.

3
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,800
P'Tee! P'Jet!

4
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,240
Ryo!

5
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
Wait.

6
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,980
Let me go.

7
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,880
Ryo!
- P-Tee, don't!

8
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,640
You secretly installed the tracking app on my phone.

9
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,600
Yeah.

10
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,920
How can you do that?

11
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
How?

12
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,720
If I didn't do that,

13
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,587
how would I find you here with that Ryo?

14
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,760
Uh... last night, I-

15
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,460
You don't need to explain.

16
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,460
I'm not upset.

18
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,480
You're oviously upset.

19
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,480
How about this?

20
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,280
I won't be upset that you installed the tracking app.

21
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,760
So, you don't be upset with me either...

22
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,660
about... last night.

23
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,800
You have a right to be angry with me.

24
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,500
Still thinking about that?

25
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,840
Yeah.

26
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,660
Anda is an adult.

27
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,480
I know that.

28
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,680
Since you know,

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,933
why are you worrying so much?

30
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,440
I know Anda is an adult.

31
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
But no matter how old,

32
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,293
he shouldn't run away without telling us.

33
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,500
I'm not mad at him.

34
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,820
I'm just disappointed.

35
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,200
You see, we were both scared to death.

36
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,000
In the end, I saw Anda and Ryo on the bed like that.

37
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,116
Not to mention, Ryo knew where Anda was but didn't call us.

38
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,920
Try the steak here.

39
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,440
It's guaranteed to make you feel better.

40
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640
You remember?

41
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,180
That I like eating this steak.

42
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,740
That means you're worried about me, right?

43
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,980
Why are you asking?

44
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,740
Just eat.

45
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,113
I won't eat if you don't answer me.

46
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm worried about you.

47
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,020
Then, I'll continue eating.

48
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,680
I just don't want you brothers to fight.

49
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,800
It didn't work?

50
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,527
It's useless. He's still upset.

51
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,040
What should I do?

52
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720
Do you want me to try?

53
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,160
No need.

54
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,920
It's our familiy matter.

55
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll take care of it.

56
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm sorry.

57
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,960
Why are you sorry?

58
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,967
If I didn't do that last night,

59
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,980
it wouldn't turn out this way.

60
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,960
If that's the case,

61
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,280
I should be the one to apologize to you.

62
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,020
That's enough.

63
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,520
Obviously, I'm not ready.

64
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,080
Yet I dared to kiss you.

65
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,800
When you are ready,

66
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,720
we'll continue.

67
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
Don't worry.

68
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,600
I still have 60 years with you.

69
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,240
Will we be together that long?

70
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,520
Yeah.

71
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,200
If I don't die first.

72
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,680
I'll go resolve things with P'Tee first.

73
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,480
P'Jet

74
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,780
Anda

75
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,840
Where's P'Tee?

76
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,840
He just went out for errands.

77
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,420
What's the matter?

78
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,820
Then, I have something to discuss with you.

79
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,320
Answer me, what's going on between you and my brother?

80
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,080
I love your brother.

81
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
What's wrong with that?

82
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Since when?

83
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,680
From the beginning.

84
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,240
Since the day of the filming the ad?

85
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
No.

86
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,800
It was ten years ago.

87
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,880
Even though you always misunderstood Anda was a woman?

88
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Yes.

89
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,180
But now I'm not mistaken.

90
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,973
You still love him, right?

91
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,480
Your brother wasn't mad because you were with Ryo.

92
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
He was just worried about you.

93
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,720
You also know very well how he is, right?

94
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,860
How could he really be mad at you?

95
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,900
It's because I know so well

96
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,880
that I'm anxious like this.

97
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,250
I usually apologize for awhile,

98
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
then, P'Tee is alright.

99
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
But now, look...

100
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,200
He must be really angry.

101
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,740
Because you haven't run away like this before.

102
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,240
But thinking about it, I'm also wondering.

103
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,360
How could I dare run away like that?

104
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,020
When we are in love,

105
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,950
we always dare to do crazy things.

106
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
In...love?

107
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,320
Speaking of you and Ryo,

108
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,550
what's going on between you two?

109
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,210
Did you confess that you like him?

110
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
Da, I think I left my phone in the room.

111
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,740
Let me borrow yours.

112
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,530
I'll tell P'Tee that we're here together.

113
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
Here, P'Jet.

114
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,310
Passcode is the same, right?

115
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,520
Hey, P'Jet!

116
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,540
Because of what happened last night?

117
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,220
What?

118
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,000
I thought your reaction would be bigger than this.

119
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,840
It's normal at this age, isn't it?

120
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,360
But it's between boys...

121
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,760
What about it?

122
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,020
It's nothing strange.

123
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,200
You talk like you've been with guys before.

124
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,200
Why are you following me?

125
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,780
I just came to see Anda.

126
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,400
I still haven't accepted what happened between you two.

127
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,000
Because I'm a man, right?

128
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,100
Jet.

129
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,140
Jet.

130
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,020
Open the door for me.

131
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,680
Hello?

132
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,600
Did you and P'Jet sleep in the same room?

133
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,040
You asked me just now...

134
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
why I don't accept you, right?

135
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Yes.

136
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
It's not because you're a boy.

137
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,620
Then, why?

138
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,580
Because I don't like you.

139
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,580
Jet.

140
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,800
Jet, are you there?

141
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,480
Did you do it?

142
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,500
Yeah, I did.

143
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,920
Does it hurt, P'?

144
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,000
Depends on the method.

145
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,160
Method?

146
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,160
What about size?

147
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,160
Size?

148
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,040
What size?

149
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,460
Anda.

150
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,340
Did it hurt?

151
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,340
It's okay, P'.

152
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,620
Scared me to death.

153
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,000
Did you have a nice chat?

154
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,580
Not at all.

155
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,320
What were you talking about size just now?

156
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,980
You heard it wrong, P'.

157
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
But just now I really heard that.

158
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,200
So what is it?

159
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,940
It's the beach, right P'Jet?

160
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,520
Right.

161
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,800
I just said I'm going for a walk on the beach tonight.

162
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,320
The size of the beach.

163
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,830
There's a boat to go squid fishing.

164
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,170
It looks delicious, P'Ryo.

165
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Good.

166
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,320
P'Tee, P'Jet...

167
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,860
You didn't follow us, did you?

168
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
No.

169
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,620
We just wanted to eat here, okay?

170
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,510
This place has a discount today.

171
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
The seafood, Anda.

172
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,180
Right, the shrimp at this place are huge.

173
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,200
But you're allergic to seafood, aren't you?
Right, the shrimp at this place are huge.

174
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,150
But you're allergic to seafood, aren't you?

175
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,220
But can't I eat other things, Anda?

176
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,870
Do you have to correct my mistakes?

177
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,840
Won't you even eat the vegetables?

178
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,970
I don't like the vegetables.

179
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,190
But the vegetables have vitamin C.

180
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,440
So you don't get sick.

181
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,400
It's hard. You're trying to force me again.

182
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,680
Eat it now.

183
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,540
I won't eat it.

184
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
Eat it.

185
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,020
Uh Anda, let me peel the shrimp for you.

186
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,480
It's okay, P'Tee.

187
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,520
Sore throat.

188
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,680
Sorry, Da, Ryo...

189
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,010
The two of us bothered you all day.

190
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,880
It's fine, P'Jet.

191
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,300
This is also fun.

192
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,530
It's like a double date.

193
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,440
What date?

194
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,680
Hey everyone, let's sing, okay?

195
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
P'Tee...

196
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,990
Can you play the guitar for me?

197
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,880
E Key please.

198

199

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,040
Did you learn to sing?

204
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,660
Hey, P'Jet...

205
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,360
Here, eat some more.

206
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,070
I don't want this.

207
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,200
Ok ok, I'll get a different one.

208
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,240
Oh, careful.

209
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Jet.

210
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,980
Do you also think Anda and Ryo can go on like this?

211
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,840
I don't see any problem.

212
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,200
Ordinary people and superstars...

213
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,950
As long as the fans don't know, it should be fine.

214
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,320
That means that Anda has to hide all the time.

215
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,530
That's not surprising.

216
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,690
You've always been like that yourself.

217
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,560
Don't forget you're also a celebrity.

218
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,910
But I'm not the same as Ryo.

219
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,170
How is it different?

220
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,200
Of course it's different.

221
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,840
Because I'm ready to accept the person I'm with.

222
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,280
If you want, I can declare who I love to the world.

223
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,830
How do you know that Ryo isn't ready?

224
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,040
Can't you see?

225
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,840
Because I think sometimes, Ryo just treats Anda as a plaything.

226
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,890
At that time...

227
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,360
I wasn't sure you would be serious either.

228
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,970
How can I let go...

229
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,040
when I've met the right person?

230
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,310
Right?

231
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,040
I don't know.

232
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,120
What is it?

233
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,860
Why do you have this expression?

234
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,940
Do you want to announce that we're together?

235
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,820
What would your parents say if we anounced it?

236
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,220
The manager of the Sirikun family

237
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,560
with their eldest son like that?

238
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,000
What do you think?

239
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,190
Your parents definitely wouldn't want this.

240
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,750
You're right.

241
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,100
Then, it may be best to always stay like this.

242
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,500
I haven't finished it, P'Ryo.

243
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,730
Give it back.

244
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,390
When you write love songs,

245
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,200
who do you think of?

246
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,860
I think of...

247
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,550
sticky rice and rice noodles.

248
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,720
Oh...

249
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,960
Can you give it back?

250
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,160
You want it back?

251
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,090
If you want it,

252
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,840
you'll have to kiss me first.

253
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,910
P', try it.

254
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,680
♪ Can I be that person? ♪

255
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,880

258
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,520
What's wrong?

259
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,280
What is your inspiration for songwriting?

260
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,760
All my inspiration for songwriting comes from Chaim.

261
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Jet, I understand what my dad was saying.

262
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,310
I know what my song is missing.

263
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
What is it?

264
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,320
Do you remember?

265
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,780
My dad once said to ask you.

266
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,930
Ask me?

267
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,640
I may not be able to answer.

268
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,360
I don't know about songs.

269
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,820
But you're the one who knows my heart.

270
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,070
I understand, but can't tell anyone.

271
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
Yes, you can.

272
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,940
You can tell others through my song.

273
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,320
You are my song.

274
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
What a crazy song...

275
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,780
This crazy song

276
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,250
means I love you.

277
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,220
It's not like that.

278
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,520
This is my song.

279
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,950
I can write anything I want.

280
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Just a kiss.

281
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,740
I don't have time to write songs.

282
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm the one writing.

283
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,180
We're not even at the hook yet.

284
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,150
How is it?

285
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,110
My song's hook...

286
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,600
Is the hook finished?

287
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,000
The hook...

288
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,840
still has to be repeated many times.

289
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,180
Cheater.

290
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,010
For the hook in round 2,

291
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,400
you have to help me sing it.

292
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,730
Are you afraid?

293
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,520
I've never done this before.

294
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,560
It's also my first time.

295
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,550
But...

296
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,160
you don't look scared at all.

297
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,240
I'm afraid.

298
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,860
Whenever I'm scared,

299
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,920
I'll look into your eyes

300
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,280
and remember how much I missed these eyes.

301
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,520
How lucky I am to still be able to see these eyes.

302
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,380
I miss it, too.

303
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
Your eyes...

304
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,940
Today...

305
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm ready.

306
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,190
Wake up, Anda.

307
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,780
P'Ryo, why are you up so early?

308
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,940
I have a surprise for you this morning.

309
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,510
What is it?

310
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,920
This is your floating breakfast.

311
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,220
Wow, what a great surprise.

312
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,740
Let's eat together.

313
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,740
Should I eat breakfast or you?

314
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,780
P'Ryo, indecent.

315
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
P'Ryo

316
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,460
If someone sees us,

317
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,860
it won't be good.

318
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,100
We're outside now.

319
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,660
What if we're photographed?

320
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,220
Wait a moment.

321
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,780
We'll be seen.

322
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,610
You're wearing a hat and sunglasses.

323
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,970
No one will know.

324
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,660
P'Ryo

325
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,140
Yes?

326
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,790
The two of us

327
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,980
Being like this...

328
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,210
It means...

329
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,740
we're dating, right?

330
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,210
Of course.

331
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,270
Hey, what are you doing?

332
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,990
This is private property.

333
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,220
Hey, stop there.

334
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,310
Stop.

335
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,060
Stop.

336
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,070
I'm sorry.

337
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,000
Don't hit me.

338
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,180
Jet

339
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,700
You have to be careful.

340
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,700
Both of you.

341
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,820
Okay, P'Jet.

342
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
I usually come here.

343
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,350
The privacy has always been good.

344
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,310
I never had a problem before.

345
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,620
No one ever knew I was here.

346
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,220
Are you sure no one knows?

347
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,860
I'm sure.

348
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,010
It's good we got the camera.

349
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,300
Otherwise, it would be bad.

350
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,860
Don't act like this outside, Ryo.

351
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,970
You have to be more careful.

352
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,460
You're not an ordinary person.

353
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,900
Don't take risks.

354
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,180
- When we are in love, we always dare to do crazy things -
