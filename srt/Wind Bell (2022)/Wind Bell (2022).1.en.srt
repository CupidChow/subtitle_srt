1
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:07,375
How have you been?

2
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:14,417
I was worried
because it rained so much this spring.

3
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,312
It's really summer now.

4
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,750
We have to turn
on the air conditioner all day.

5
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:52,216
Even if I open the window,
It's not cool at all.

6
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:58,007
That made me think of this place.

7
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:03,914
Here, we used to spend the summers
without an air conditioner.

8
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:43,125
In our home, grass and trees
that we haven't seen grew lush.

9
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,609
I can barely see the end of the roof.

10
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,682
If I hadn't come down this summer,

11
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:58,054
I might never have found the house again.

12
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:33,031
5 years was a longer time than I thought.

13
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,554
For all of us.

14
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,459
(Where are you now?)

15
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:03,248
Hello?

16
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,350
Hand the sleeping bag over to me.

17
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,709
No, I can hold it.

18
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,226
There's insect repellent in the drawer.

19
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,698
I'm covered with mosquito bites.

20
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,514
Did you know this happened to our house?

21
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:27,187
Your house…

22
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,419
Since you moved out, I've just seen it
a few times on my way here.

23
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,375
The house was almost abandoned.

24
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:40,656
Five years has passed already.

25
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:14,094
Jeongwoo,

26
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,207
Come in. Watch out for mosquitoes.

27
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:16,992
Yes.

28
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,437
Eun-san grew up a lot.

29
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:29,946
Eun-san?

30
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,750
She's already in six grade.

31
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:39,945
Thank you.

32
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,109
It's good.

33
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:54,953
But…

34
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,630
You don't look any better
than the last time.

35
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:02,904
I'm sorry
I couldn't say “hello” properly then.

36
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:03,922
No problem.

37
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:08,031
At the funeral, Everyone was so busy.

38
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:11,405
Are you okay?

39
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:14,021
Uh…

40
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:16,834
My mom went back to work.

41
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,687
I don't know.

42
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:23,706
How are you?

43
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:24,959
Me?

44
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:26,226
Well…

45
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,585
I work at my mom's cafe.

46
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:30,937
These days, I've been doing carpentry.

47
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:33,695
Take care of my dogs…

48
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,187
That's nice.

49
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:38,796
What about you?

50
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,299
I go to college.

51
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:44,849
Wait a minute.

52
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,101
- Are you here?
- I'm back.

53
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:48,790
It's hot outside, right?

54
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,554
That's right.

55
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:54,875
Who is he?

56
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,835
We met him briefly last month.

57
00:07:58,316 --> 00:07:59,367
It's Jungwoo.

58
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:00,620
Hi.

59
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,535
Huh? Your name is Jungwoo?

60
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,039
Yeah, Do you remember him?

61
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,279
Yes, I'm jungwoo.

62
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,320
No, But I know him.

63
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,781
How do you know him if you don't remember?

64
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:13,843
I saw the name. At the hideout.

65
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:15,457
Do you have a hideout?

66
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:16,765
Yes.

67
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,349
But it's a secret.

68
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:19,851
Why is it a secret?

69
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:21,629
Where is it?

70
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:23,112
It's a secret.

71
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,952
You're not playing in a dangerous place,
are you?

72
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:29,821
No, it's just a house.

73
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:31,096
House? Which house?

74
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:33,234
Where's the house here?

75
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,718
No, It's just an empty house.

76
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,229
Can't we play there?

77
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,710
It's okay.

78
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,085
You can play there.

79
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:15,687
Here!

80
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:32,007
Shall we go in?

81
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,250
I was taller than you back then.

82
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:27,703
That's true.

83
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:30,548
You didn't grow at all in Seoul.

84
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:42,890
How is life in Seoul treating you?

85
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,109
Aren't you going though a hard time?

86
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:47,976
I'm just…

87
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,351
My mom and grandmother had been going
through a really hard time.

88
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,140
Everyone got busier.

89
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:00,883
Grandma missed this place a lot.

90
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,351
Out home and her friends.

91
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,991
She talked about you from time to time.

92
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:14,562
What about you?

93
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,234
Sometimes.

94
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,656
I only have good memories here.

95
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:26,609
That's a relief.

96
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:32,468
Will you keep living here?

97
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:34,851
Yeah.

98
00:11:35,516 --> 00:11:36,804
I'm here always.

99
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:39,710
But it's not the same.

100
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:45,893
Anyway...

101
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,734
it's nice to see your face.

102
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,390
Yours too.

103
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:01,617
I was taller than you back then.

104
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,851
Don't you find it creepy here?

105
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:24,117
Not at all.
My playmates aren't scared either.

106
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:30,195
By the way, how many people lived here?

107
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,663
Me, grandma, mom and dad.

108
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:33,625
The four of us.

109
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:35,862
There are four of us, too.

110
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,568
It fits perfectly.

111
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,671
We should mow the grass.

112
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:49,303
Snakes might come out here.

113
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,240
I'll do it!

114
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,507
You can do it with your friends.

115
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,150
I want to join you.

116
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:57,838
Then…

117
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:00,640
let's do it together later.

118
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:02,695
Okay.

119
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:25,945
Our house has a new owner.

120
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,914
It's changed a lot here,
but it's still beautiful.

121
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,718
What are you doing?

122
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,326
- Writing a letter.
- Can I have a look?

123
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:47,429
No.

124
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,195
Don't…

125
00:13:58,526 --> 00:13:59,812
What are you two doing?

126
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,578
It's too late Eun-san.

127
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:07,523
We have to go out early tomorrow morning.

128
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:09,093
It's time to go to bed.

129
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,343
Yeah, let's go to bed.

130
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,194
Goodnight.

131
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:15,539
Goodnight.

132
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:17,369
Yes, good night.

133
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:26,945
In fact, for thousands of times,
I've escaped to this place in my mind.

134
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,476
Now I feel that

135
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:32,539
I am ready to say goodbye to this place.

136
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:50,742
Grandma...

137
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,687
it's rainy season soon.

138
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:58,562
You really wanted to go out
during the rainy season.

139
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:04,570
When you were in hospital,
you said you felt submerged by the rain.

140
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,890
Now, let's get rained on
as much as we want.

141
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:15,308
Though I'll bring an umbrella, sometimes.

142
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:20,468
It's not far from here,

143
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,727
so visit me in my dream.

144
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:34,343
I miss you.

145
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:37,860
Goodbye.

146
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,164
From Jungwoo.

147
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:52,804
"Wind Bell"
