1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,297
<i>It's cold.</i>

2
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,092
<i>Did I leave the hotel window open?</i>

3
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,358
Damn it.

4
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,164
Awake again, sir?

5
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,676
Hey.

6
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,597
Do you even know who I am?

7
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,559
Oda Shinichiro,
a second-generation <i>Zainichi </i>Korean.

8
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,603
Korean name, Kim Gwang-il.

9
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,856
Didn't you come three days ago
for sightseeing?

10
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,026
Did someone from Nagoya send you?

11
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,654
Or Sakaguchi from Tokyo?

12
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,949
Or was it Mr. Choi from Busan?

13
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,118
Well, aren't you popular?

14
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,203
That's why

15
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,997
you should've led a better life

16
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,918
if you wanted to die
of natural causes, sir.

17
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,926
I've heard of you.

18
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,181
A skilled female assassin
from the peninsula.

19
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,392
The rumors must be true

20
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:27,105
if they sent you alone to deal with me,
Oda Shinichiro, the Kansai tiger.

21
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,983
The yakuza sure are damn pretentious.

22
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,777
There is no pretense.
This is my pride as a samurai.

23
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,778
Goodness.

24
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,614
So you do understand Korean!

25
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,410
But I do wonder…

26
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,373
Why have you waited
for this Oda Shinichiro to wake up?

27
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,458
Well, I meant to finish you off earlier,

28
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,794
but I had a change of heart.

29
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,841
If it isn't too lengthy a tale,
I'd like to hear about it.

30
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,342
Sure, I suppose.

31
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,219
Then I'll just speak casually.

32
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,472
I have a daughter.

33
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,809
<i>She's pretty just like me.</i>

34
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,981
What?

35
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,859
<i>But she can be pretty rude as well.</i>

36
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,194
<i>Anyway,</i>

37
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,237
<i>we were watching the news one weekend.</i>

38
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,617
<i>Senator Oh Jeong-sik,</i>
<i>the new candidate for prime minister,</i>

39
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,785
<i>is denying claims that his son Oh</i>

40
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,872
<i>was fraudulently admitted</i>
<i>to the college of music.</i>

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,751
<i>Prosecutors have summoned Oh</i>
<i>to begin the investigation.</i>

42
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,294
These people…

43
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,006
Everyone wants to get their kids
into a good school.

44
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,424
As if they wouldn't do the same.

45
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,759
Seriously…

46
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,513
I mean…

47
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,308
I'm not saying what he did was right.

48
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,394
Just that any parents would feel the same.

49
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,605
But it's not fair.

50
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,608
Not much in life is.

51
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,072
If someone got into college like that,
that means someone else got rejected.

52
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,199
What if that was me?

53
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,660
Would you still be saying that?

54
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,957
If I were you, Mom,

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
I'd teach my kid how to compete fairly

56
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,253
rather than preach
about how unfair the world is.

57
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,381
<i>Quite the extraordinary daughter.</i>

58
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,757
Isn't she?

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,093
We really can learn
from children at times.

60
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,511
I agree.

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,181
That's why
I'm going to compete fairly today.

62
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,229
Are you fine with that?
You're going to regret it.

63
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,488
Superb!

64
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,910
I see that you're a samurai too.

65
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,122
Grant me a garment, so that
I may receive you with due courtesy.

66
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,081
Whatever.

67
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,669
Just say that you're cold.

68
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,632
Your sword looks too old.
Want something new instead?

69
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:05,513
Of course,
women wouldn't know much about swords.

70
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,814
This wakizashi was forged 400 years ago

71
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:21,487
by Akihiro, the greatest swordsmith
of the Edo shogunate.

72
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,074
For a samurai,

73
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,704
it is a work of masterful art,
akin to the Holy Grail.

74
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,166
What do you think?

75
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,419
Isn't it impressive?

76
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,385
I bought this for 30,000 won at Walmart.

77
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,404
Let's see.

78
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,283
Shall we begin?

79
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,278
You're impressive.

80
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,155
Yes, I know.

81
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,150
You can be proud of yourself.

82
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,901
There are only three people
in the whole of Japan

83
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,238
who can put up
that much of a fight against me,

84
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,741
Oda Shinichiro.

85
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,627
Are you quitting?

86
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,170
Time out.

87
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,881
Let me switch my weapon up.

88
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,966
As you wish.

89
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,644
There is no coincidence in winning.

90
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,271
A thousand days to forge the spirits…

91
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,530
and ten thousand days to polish.

92
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,413
Only after this discipline--

93
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,304
You fucking bitch…

94
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,514
Sorry.

95
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,433
Gotta go before the store closes.

96
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:55,177
KILL BOKSOON

97
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,118
Oh dear. When did you get so wilted?

98
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,204
You should have told Mommy.

99
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,805
<i>My daughter, Boksoon, has been smoking.</i>

100
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:44,727
It was done out of curiosity
as a young child who knows nothing.

101
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,147
Just as I forgive the sins of my daughter,

102
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,984
Lord, please forgive my sins.

103
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,820
-Amen.
-Amen.

104
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,369
Take it.

105
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:06,999
Eat it.

106
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,054
You have to swallow it.

107
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,407
You're home late.

108
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,662
When did you start smoking?

109
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,542
Drinking might be okay,
but nothing good comes from smoking.

110
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,710
Don't do it.

111
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,882
That's like jaywalking while saying
traffic rules should be obeyed.

112
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,510
You're not very convincing, are you?

113
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,523
When did you start smoking?

114
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,944
Wanna smoke one with me?

115
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,572
Just stop with this cool mom bit.

116
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,666
I'm going to kill her.

117
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,295
Gil Jae-young.

118
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,006
Sorry for slamming the door.
And I promise I'll quit smoking.

119
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,473
What? Did you wanna say something?

120
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,436
Well, help me choose what to wear

121
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,481
to the education meeting tomorrow.

122
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,233
Oh, that meeting.

123
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,320
Isn't that just a meeting

124
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,865
where aggressive private-school moms
brag about their money and kids?

125
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:10,956
Everyone goes
to the US mainland for a reason.

126
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,459
We went to Hawaii last year too.

127
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,670
The food was good,
and there were lots to do,

128
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,756
but there are too many Koreans now.

129
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,299
The kids can't improve their English.

130
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,927
I heard that's why everyone
is going to Singapore.

131
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,303
Don't even think about it.

132
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,555
That's where average kids go.

133
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,392
-They don't have good extracurriculars.
-I see.

134
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,313
Then where would you recommend
going these days?

135
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,356
Oh, right.

136
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,317
Why didn't you and Jae-young go
anywhere this summer?

137
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,569
-This summer?
-Yes.

138
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,199
Oh, I was on a business trip.

139
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,999
I'm sure it's harder for you
since you're on your own.

140
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,087
I plan on going this time, for sure.

141
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:02,132
So-ra's been telling me
to look after Jae-young too.

142
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,221
But what did you say you do for a living?

143
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,226
I just work for an event planning company.

144
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,896
"Event"? What kind?

145
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,732
<i>Earlier this morning in Seoul,</i>

146
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,069
<i>a man in his forties was found dead</i>
<i>from a gunshot wound</i>

147
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the Dongho Bridge construction site.</i>

148
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,739
<i>He was identified</i>

149
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,201
<i>as the Japanese-born Korean Kim Gwang-il,</i>
<i>who arrived in Korea three days ago.</i>

150
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,372
<i>This leader of a yakuza organization</i>
<i>based in Kobe, Japan…</i>

151
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,760
See, she didn't stick to the script again.

152
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,931
How are we supposed to clean up that mess
if she uses a gun in a domestic show?

153
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,601
<i>The Japanese government has not yet made</i>…

154
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,603
I don't think it was a bad move.

155
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,897
Why not?

156
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,318
<i>As you all know,</i>
<i>gun-related crimes are uncommon in Korea.</i>

157
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,028
<i>Considering that fact,</i>

158
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,323
<i>this was likely the result</i>
<i>of the Japanese yakuza power struggle.</i>

159
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,075
<i>Whether Korean gangs were involved…</i>

160
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,581
See? Who would suspect the angry wife
of a cheating yakuza husband?

161
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,666
<i>-To summarize our investigation…</i>
-Jeez.

162
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,252
You are way too soft on Boksoon.

163
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,296
<i>A second-generation Japanese-born Korean</i>

164
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,007
<i>who is known by his Japanese name,</i>
<i>Oda Shinichiro,</i>

165
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,009
<i>as well as his Korean name, Kim Gwang-il.</i>

166
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,028
You're here.

167
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,490
Welcome.

168
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,911
This could cut through rock like butter.

169
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,206
Boksoon, you have my respect.

170
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,166
-Did you have fun with it?
-Yes.

171
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,588
Do you think
I'll ever be able to pull off a show

172
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,883
for the prime-time news, just like yours?

173
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,636
You're still young.

174
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,471
Right. Keep your head up, Yun-seok.

175
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,974
Our generation will get a chance too.

176
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,559
Maybe sometime in the 23rd century.

177
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,604
How come Min-seok isn't here today?

178
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,733
Yeah, he died.
Two weeks ago on a business trip to China.

179
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,736
Gosh, I was supposed to buy him dinner.

180
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,990
Enough about the dead.
Tell us more about your latest show.

181
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,702
Was the yakuza guy really
all he was hyped up to be? Was he strong?

182
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,246
How was he?

183
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,165
He was very strong.

184
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,002
If we had fought properly,
I might have lost.

185
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,921
I must be past my prime.

186
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,881
-Don't say that.
-No way.

187
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:52,678
It's not like we're part of a contest.
Does it matter if they're strong or weak?

188
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,640
What matters is finding their weaknesses.
Even if you have to make one for them.

189
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,310
As Kill Boksoon once said,
"Thou shalt find the weakness first."

190
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,147
"If none can be found,
it shall be devised!"

191
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,482
-Yes!
-Why does he keep doing that?

192
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,193
I learn from you once again, my lady.

193
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,863
Is that true, my little Gwang-man?

194
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,406
-So gross.
-What a dumbass.

195
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:16,410
But how much are you getting paid
for a show that big?

196
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,829
Enough to treat you all to drinks today.

197
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,498
Come on, you can tell us.

198
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,333
If you don't wanna say it out loud,

199
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,045
then just write out the first number.

200
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,672
Gosh.

201
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,053
-Oh my.
-Wow.

202
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,515
Gosh, Boksoon makes more with one show
than I do with seven in my company.

203
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,935
You can't compare your company to MK.
MK's a global corporation.

204
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,396
Consider yourself lucky
for being able to work.

205
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,108
I can't even work
without being hired by a company.

206
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,154
All thanks to the rules
that MK made seven years ago, right?

207
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,491
Am I wrong?

208
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,078
There's an old saying.

209
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,454
SEVEN YEARS AGO

210
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,663
"One kill will save you

211
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,459
three times the amount of patience."

212
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,550
We here are professionals
who put those words into action.

213
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,929
We're not some workers
for any old detective agency.

214
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:22,101
Nor are we some old-fashioned gangsters
wearing tasteless suits.

215
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,897
We had pride in our work.

216
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,732
Killing…

217
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,278
has become a global business,
and we earned the respect we deserve.

218
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,950
Until those unemployed amateurs

219
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,329
ruined our reputation
by even killing children for chump change.

220
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,672
We're in such an unfortunate situation

221
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,717
because there are no rules
in this industry.

222
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,095
That's why

223
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,141
I am proposing
a set of simple rules for all of you.

224
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,060
Here's a question!

225
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,650
If we pick and choose who to kill
while following the rules,

226
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,694
won't we be the ones losing our jobs?

227
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,113
This will only benefit the unemployed.

228
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,158
You must be the one
who started a company recently.

229
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,246
It is still very small.
I'm Sergeant Shin, sir.

230
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,331
That's a good point.

231
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,916
For that reason,

232
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,546
the rules must be ones
that those unemployed could never follow.

233
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,467
That way,
we are justified in getting rid of them.

234
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,971
Now, exactly three rules.

235
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,223
First,

236
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,310
you must not kill minors.

237
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,145
Second,

238
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,273
you will only take on shows
sanctioned by your company.

239
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,316
Third,

240
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,196
you must always attempt shows
sanctioned by your company.

241
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,032
If you agree to these three rules,

242
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,327
the unemployed amateurs will no longer

243
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,581
be able to work in this industry.

244
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,791
I agree!

245
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,128
I totally agree!

246
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,759
How could I have known then

247
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,136
that I would get my hand cut off
and get fired?

248
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,848
My company ran itself to the ground
trying to follow those rules,

249
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,477
and I didn't even get
my severance pay. Damn it.

250
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,312
Here's a question.

251
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,066
How come all the rules are made
by those in power?

252
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,400
Here's the answer.

253
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,362
Because rules make those in power
even more powerful.

254
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:42,699
The rules were just a way for MK
to monopolize the industry, weren't they?

255
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,701
Look, besides Sergeant Shin's,

256
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,162
all the other companies
became basically mom-and-pop shops

257
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,705
cowering in MK's shadow.

258
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,957
You're an MK man too.

259
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,583
That's why I can talk shit about it.

260
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,545
They rank us however they want
in order of A, B, C, and D.

261
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,381
So only the rich become richer

262
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:02,094
while the rest of us are forced to be
grateful for the crumbs they leave behind.

263
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,095
Come on.

264
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,807
Getting paid according to your skills,
that's a given.

265
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,904
Wow, that just sounded
like I'm not good enough.

266
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,907
I'm no longer that kid
who used to follow you around.

267
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,662
Then send me a bloody knife.

268
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,664
So I can see how far you've come.

269
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,878
Why are you bringing up a bloody knife?

270
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,216
But it is true
that people like us are having a hard time

271
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,468
because of companies like MK.

272
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,846
That's true.

273
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,432
Seems like I'm the bitch in the room.

274
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,520
Then are you not going to join MK
if they recruit you, Hyeon-cheol?

275
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,940
Blaming everyone else
while wallowing in self-pity.

276
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,359
That's a privilege
for incompetent people, right?

277
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,113
Sorry, everyone.

278
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,407
I guess I'm just too competent.

279
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,958
<i>By the way, what does it mean</i>
<i>to send a bloody knife?</i>

280
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,252
It's an old-school message

281
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,213
that existed before any talk of rules.

282
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:25,594
Let's say you send him
a knife with blood smeared on it.

283
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,889
That means you're inviting him
to pick a time and place

284
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,724
to fight to the death.

285
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,394
But those romantic notions
are a thing of the past now.

286
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:38,273
<i>Those were the days</i>
<i>when Boksoon was in her prime.</i>

287
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,902
<i>She was extremely scary back then.</i>

288
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,780
-Fuck, the car isn't even fully loaded.
-Damn it.

289
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,157
Move.

290
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,952
That's one frigid fucking bitch.

291
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,664
Hey, you five pigs!

292
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,041
What?

293
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,669
What the fuck did you say?

294
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,047
-Hey.
-Calm down.

295
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,258
Hey, lady, that's not
a nice thing to say to people.

296
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,512
One, two, three, four, five pigs.

297
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,139
-What about it?
-You fucking little bitch--

298
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,974
What the fuck?

299
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,143
<i>But don't you think someone like Hee-sung</i>

300
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,521
<i>should easily be ranked A, even at MK?</i>

301
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:21,149
<i>Reputations aside, I don't think</i>
<i>he'd be an easy match for Boksoon.</i>

302
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,151
<i>His skills are obviously good enough.</i>

303
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,779
<i>He was once considered</i>
<i>the rising star at MK.</i>

304
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,282
<i>But for whatever reason,</i>
<i>Chairman Cha Min-kyu singled him out.</i>

305
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,259
There's no blood on it.

306
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,145
I don't think I can hold it any longer.
Can we change--

307
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,939
Hold it in. I'm enjoying this.

308
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,661
<i>Are you really going to quit?</i>

309
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,290
<i>Smoking is a must</i>
<i>during our miserable teenage years.</i>

310
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,042
<i>What's got you so miserable?</i>

311
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,961
<i>Everything besides you.</i>

312
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,297
<i>Intense school life.</i>

313
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,008
<i>My stupid boyfriend.</i>

314
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,510
Especially my mom.

315
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,222
She'd kill me if she found out about us.

316
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,557
She's so square.

317
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,143
You know what my mom saved me as
on her phone?

318
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,312
-What?
-"Pwincess."

319
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,855
No way.

320
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,857
Moms are all the same.

321
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,318
They act like they love us.

322
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,362
But they'll be disgusted
if they see our true selves.

323
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,699
Whatever.

324
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,495
I don't know my mom that well either.

325
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,038
She hides a lot from me too.

326
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,623
Like what?

327
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,250
It's nothing.

328
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,543
What is it?

329
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,670
Are you hiding something from--

330
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,260
Hey, you two.

331
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,805
You shouldn't be skipping lessons
and smoking like this!

332
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,934
Hi.

333
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,939
Smoking after trigonometry is the best.

334
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,860
We're going to do karaoke.
We have beer, too.

335
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,695
Awesome!

336
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,031
What about you?

337
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,699
You guys have fun.

338
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,744
Hey.

339
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,163
Just come with us today.

340
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,669
Back off.

341
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,381
See you tomorrow.

342
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,010
Hey, Cheol-woo.

343
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,721
You got rejected by Jae-young again.

344
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,224
Wasn't she scary as hell just now?

345
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,141
Right?

346
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,520
Look, he even got scared. Fucking loser!

347
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,940
What the fuck did you just say to me?

348
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,149
Hey, stop that.

349
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,443
He flips out when you call him that.

350
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,211
What's this?

351
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,839
Your dad's surgery bill.

352
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,301
Receiving money afterward
just makes it feel weird.

353
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,720
Thanks, but I can't take it.

354
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,848
Instead, can you stay with me
a little longer?

355
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,183
I'm not just giving it to you.
Pay me back later.

356
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,894
Don't need it. Already taken care of.

357
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,313
How?

358
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,398
I see you're worried about me.

359
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,026
-You wanna know how?
-No.

360
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,737
Not if it's going to bother me.

361
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,449
Boksoon!

362
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,200
Gil Boksoon!

363
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,080
Just say that you worry about me.

364
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,166
If you're really worried about me,

365
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,335
you can set up a company
and take me with you.

366
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,629
You said your contract
is ending soon, right?

367
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,380
Recklessness isn't attractive.

368
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,841
If you start a company,
it will really take off.

369
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,385
I like Chairman Cha.

370
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,598
He's the one
who taught me everything I know

371
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,600
and gave me everything I have.

372
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,104
He's also the one
who could take everything away from you.

373
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,609
Will you kill me if he tells you to?

374
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,409
Of course you would.

375
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,412
I might quit working
once my contract ends.

376
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,624
This suddenly? Why?

377
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,556
Does my daughter have a boyfriend?

378
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,974
Not a chance.

379
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,270
If you were a little friendlier,
boys would line up to date you.

380
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,530
Don't you have a historical debate class?
I heard it counts toward your grade.

381
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,949
It's childish
to make kids fight for a grade.

382
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,784
That's the point. It's a fight.

383
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,956
You know when your opponent flinches
while you're debating?

384
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,290
That's their weakness.

385
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,085
You have to tear them apart
until they beg for mercy.

386
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,087
I thought you
just told me to be friendlier.

387
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,927
What's the debate about?

388
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,347
It's about who should be
on the 100,000-won bill if there was one.

389
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,642
That sounds fun. Who are you choosing?

390
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,310
There were a lot of candidates.

391
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,356
Gwanggaeto the Great, Eulji Mundeok,
Kim Gu, An Jung-geun…

392
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,525
I noticed a common thread in all of them.

393
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,568
They're all men.

394
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,652
Besides that.

395
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,946
They've all killed someone.

396
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,866
So I chose Nongae.

397
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,035
Killing isn't an easy task for a woman.
I like that about her.

398
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,497
I see…

399
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,334
That's an interesting perspective.

400
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,399
Goodness, it's Gil Boksoon!

401
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,776
Jeez, what's up with you?

402
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,444
What brings you all the way here?

403
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,821
Chairman Cha called me over.

404
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,033
That's great.
Help me out while you're here.

405
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,202
No, that's embarrassing.

406
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,705
Please, just this once.

407
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,832
-I'm not going to.
-Just this once.

408
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,429
Gosh.

409
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,473
Oh, Director.

410
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,808
Good morning, Director Cha!

411
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,852
Good morning, Director Cha!

412
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,821
Unbelievable.

413
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,949
Hello.

414
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,911
I heard you all have
monthly evaluations today,

415
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,621
so I dropped by to cheer you up.

416
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,122
Boksoon, you're so cool!

417
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,709
This place looks familiar.

418
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,752
Yes.

419
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,588
They're recreating your show
from five years ago.

420
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,256
The Yeosu rotary bathroom case.

421
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,344
-A girl?
-Yes.

422
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,305
Oh. I see there are a lot of girls
in the ranks these days.

423
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,933
She's the ace of this batch.
We're debuting her soon.

424
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,601
Oh, really?

425
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,853
Hello, I'm Kim Young-ji.

426
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,522
Why are you so nervous?

427
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,524
You're her hero.

428
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,944
So I'm gonna make her
the next Gil Boksoon.

429
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
Go ahead.

430
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:12,991
I'll show you.

431
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,787
Who wants to spar with Young-ji again?

432
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,208
No one?

433
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,128
Wow. You must be really good.

434
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,506
I'll see it next time.

435
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,341
Good luck, everyone!

436
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,385
Shame you can't see it.

437
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,054
She's probably better
than you were at that age.

438
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,559
Young-ji?

439
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,813
Can I spar with you for a second?

440
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,830
Do you really not need any equipment?

441
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,833
You're not using real knives either.

442
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,086
This is fine.

443
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,965
Ready, go!

444
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,287
Using both hands is good,
but your moves are too padded out.

445
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,708
I don't think
I fought like that at her age,

446
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,376
did I?

447
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,678
Good choice.

448
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,766
A real blade would have cut your side.

449
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,730
So? Doesn't she remind you of yourself?

450
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,233
I was prettier than her.

451
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,202
You just died

452
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,329
without making a sound.

453
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,801
Take your pick.

454
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,097
Both shows are urgent requests.
So we need to give them answers quickly.

455
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,520
This is sweet.

456
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,982
-I'm sorry. I'll make you a new one.
-No, it's fine.

457
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,026
I just won't drink it.

458
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,029
You can go now.

459
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,494
What's wrong with you?
Do you not want to work?

460
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,663
I just finished a show,

461
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,499
and I should give
the next generation a chance too.

462
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,253
How about Han Hee-sung? He's pretty good.

463
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,005
Do you not see the letter A here?

464
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,382
He's good enough to be ranked A.

465
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,218
That's my decision to make, not yours.

466
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,889
I choose this one.

467
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,142
Another domestic show.
You didn't even read it over.

468
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,353
I'm feeling more patriotic as I get older.

469
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,983
Thanks to you,

470
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,861
it looks like I'll be visiting Russia.

471
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,490
Gosh, it must be a grand show
if you're going yourself.

472
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,242
It involves the mafia.

473
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,622
With Old Man Dokgo in retirement
and Mantis on vacation,

474
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,794
it comes down to just you or me.

475
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,679
Have you thought
about the terms of the contract renewal?

476
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,851
Your kid is 15 years old now, right?

477
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:56,440
You promised me 15 years ago.

478
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,611
I told you it's not because of her.

479
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,533
Let's go eat.

480
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,868
Gives us time to catch up.

481
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,454
I already had breakfast.

482
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,124
We'll get <i>tteokbokki.</i>

483
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,667
-At that place?
-Yes.

484
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,006
That's an offer I can't refuse.

485
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,353
Here are the materials
you requested, Director Cha.

486
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,065
Leave it there, Detective Kang.

487
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,361
What are you looking at?

488
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,867
Something unsightly.

489
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,748
She used to follow me around

490
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,834
and tell me about everything
that happened at school.

491
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,628
Now she stays in her room
with the door closed.

492
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,506
She has so many secrets.
She even set up a password on her phone.

493
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,218
Keeping secrets means
she's creating a wall between you two.

494
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,929
You're right, a wall.

495
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,059
Everything you taught me
when I first started out,

496
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,062
read your opponent's next move,
find their weakness,

497
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,855
and catch them off guard.

498
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,566
-None of that works on her at all.
-Oh dear.

499
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,443
She's a tough one.

500
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,571
Killing people is simple
compared to raising a kid.

501
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,281
You're right.

502
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,868
Plus, it makes good money.

503
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,121
But then…

504
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:39,085
why aren't you telling me
what you want for the contract renewal?

505
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,589
The <i>tteokbokki </i>is very good.

506
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,511
If it's not because of your kid,
then what's the reason?

507
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,557
Do you think you'll feel God's wrath?

508
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,850
You and me,

509
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,687
we're already going to hell.

510
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,065
That's why we don't pray.

511
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,197
It's a kid.

512
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,532
He's not a minor.

513
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,700
Why is this a level-A show?

514
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,995
It will become the talk of the town.

515
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,748
It has to look undoubtedly like a suicide.

516
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,214
This reminds me of when I first met you.

517
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,678
I don't even remember.
That memory's been gathering dust.

518
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,187
Hello, sir.

519
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,692
What?

520
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,612
Is Jae-young okay?

521
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,286
Yes, I'll be on my way.

522
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,037
What's wrong?

523
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,292
Jae-young stabbed a friend with scissors.

524
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,086
Looks like she's talented like her mom.

525
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,468
I'm just kidding.

526
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,387
That's nothing to joke about.

527
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,224
Make jokes about that again,

528
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,061
and the world's dullest knife
will be stuck inside your mouth.

529
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,236
<i>We've been told that Jae-young was talking</i>
<i>to Cheol-woo during the break</i>

530
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,238
<i>when she stabbed him with scissors.</i>

531
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:36,243
The problem is that neither of them
will say why this happened.

532
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,998
Excuse me, does the victim need a reason?

533
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,626
My son is a victim!

534
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,377
Ma'am,

535
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,379
I'm so sorry.

536
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,549
-I'll pay for the hospital bill--
-Forget about it. I have the money.

537
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,468
Just call the police.

538
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,179
It was just a fight between kids.
No need for the police.

539
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,681
She stabbed him right here!

540
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,602
<i>If the wound was any deeper,</i>
<i>it would have been fatal!</i>

541
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,233
She was definitely trying to kill him.

542
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,362
What in the name of God
did she learn from her parents?

543
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,323
Excuse me! That was uncalled for!

544
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:18,327
You shouldn't be taking sides
just because So-ra is close to Jae-young.

545
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,038
I'm not taking Jae-young's side.

546
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,458
I'm just mediating
as a parents' committee member.

547
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,710
We called So-ra's mother over

548
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,004
because So-ra was the only witness.

549
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,965
But she is also refusing to speak.

550
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,134
Are you saying So-ra is involved
in this horrible incident?

551
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,719
No, I didn't quite say that.

552
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,056
Anyhow, Ms. Gil. Just one week.

553
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,933
Jae-young is suspended for one week.

554
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,060
My child was stabbed.
That's not long enough!

555
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,354
We will hold
a school discipline committee afterward.

556
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,439
If Jae-young doesn't tell us
why she did it by then,

557
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:52,152
she can no longer attend this school,
according to the rules.

558
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,362
Expulsion?

559
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,575
You'll be expelled if you don't say why.

560
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,998
Once you leave this school, you can't
come back no matter how much we pay.

561
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,792
Do you think
you can survive in a public school?

562
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,044
Just stop! You sound so snobbish.

563
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,798
"Snobbish"?

564
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,552
Are you saying that stabbing someone
is a cultured thing to do?

565
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,846
You could've really killed him!

566
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,475
Do you know how dangerous that spot is?

567
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,935
Of course I do.

568
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,521
What did you say?

569
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,398
I stabbed him there to kill him.

570
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,783
<i>The first time I killed someone, I was 17.</i>

571
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,495
That was when I first met Chairman Cha.

572
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,748
He said I was born to kill.

573
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,461
It made sense
since I grew up with violence.

574
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,966
That's why I wanted to raise her
to be the very opposite of me.

575
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:01,055
But sometimes when I look at her,
she reminds me of my younger self.

576
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,222
And it scares me.

577
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,809
You're thinking too deeply about it.

578
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:11,148
She could have just said that
because she felt rebellious.

579
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,360
Isn't she at that kind of age?

580
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,236
Right, let's do it this way.

581
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,823
Just tell the company the truth.

582
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,327
Chairman Cha will let you go
if it's because of your kid.

583
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,372
Or I guess he could kill you.

584
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,086
When I decided to give birth to Jae-young,
I promised him

585
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,588
that I wouldn't let her affect my work.

586
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,551
But it's hard.
Not physically, but emotionally.

587
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,973
There are times…

588
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,145
when I see my reflection
in the dying person's eyes.

589
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,235
On those days, I'm afraid to go home
and look her in the eyes.

590
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,321
Thinking my dad knows
what I'm doing right now

591
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,864
makes my skin crawl.

592
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:05,160
I know this is selfish,

593
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,705
but I don't want to give up
my career for my kid either.

594
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,791
Am I not qualified to be a mother?

595
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,961
Making good money
is the best qualification.

596
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,718
I also don't want to give up
my career for my dad either.

597
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:25,764
Even though I'm currently
not making a lot of money.

598
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,812
It's ironic that I'm a mother
while doing this kind of work.

599
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,361
Are there any good educational killings?

600
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,531
The world is full of irony.

601
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,075
We wage wars in the name of peace.

602
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,619
We want to believe lies over the truth.

603
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:52,875
And killers gather and make rules.

604
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,585
Hey.

605
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,671
Are you writing a book or something?

606
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,884
Why? Are you going to publish it for me?

607
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,972
"Find the truth
behind the contradictions."

608
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,309
That's the title of my book.

609
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,144
The truth is…

610
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,732
that you're definitely a good mom.

611
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,777
See? You're thinking
about how to raise your child

612
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,571
rather than how to kill one.

613
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,660
By the way, did you come empty-handed?

614
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,498
How could you visit me without a gift?

615
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,044
Gosh, look at how it passed

616
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,296
the aorta to the lumbar.

617
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,965
My gosh, good details here.

618
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,469
These are unsolved murder cases
from the police.

619
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,596
Quite a few, right?

620
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,016
They were disguised
as involuntary manslaughter,

621
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,476
but look closely.

622
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,520
This is definitely
the work of a professional.

623
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,189
So, you're saying

624
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,399
that these are unsanctioned shows?

625
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,776
Precisely.

626
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:05,239
The other chairmen have confirmed
that these aren't the shows of a company.

627
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,242
Does that mean
the unemployed are acting up again?

628
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,411
The work is too good to be theirs.

629
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,750
Then it must be someone
who retired or was fired.

630
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,627
Or it could be a current employee.

631
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,837
No way.

632
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,673
-That's not possible.
-Of course not.

633
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,757
It's not possible.

634
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,051
It is possible.

635
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,095
I think it could be possible.

636
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,847
Yes, it's possible.

637
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,100
The police said
they'll do their best to investigate,

638
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,643
so we'll see the big picture.

639
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,644
On the off chance

640
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,815
that one of our employees is involved,

641
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,985
I would like us at MK

642
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,779
to deal with that employee.

643
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,241
If my kid steps out of line,

644
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,451
I should be the one
to straighten them out.

645
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,789
It feels shitty when they take a beating
from someone else's boss.

646
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,126
Companies turn a blind eye
to their employees who break the rules,

647
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,254
everyone here knows that.

648
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,342
We're trying to take this incident
as an opportunity to right some wrongs.

649
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,511
Wow, scary.

650
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:12,973
How scary.

651
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,727
Times are tough,

652
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:22,566
and it won't help business if we run them
all hard like a bone-dry anus.

653
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,777
Sergeant Shin.

654
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,617
If you can't run your company properly,
go back to the military.

655
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,245
You're making yourself look incompetent.

656
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,585
No one knows who the culprit is yet.

657
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,005
That's why I mentioned
there's an off chance.

658
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,132
What if there's an off chance…

659
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,598
the culprit is an MK employee?

660
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:56,934
Goodness.

661
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,770
Then I must take responsibility.

662
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:00,854
What would you like?

663
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,317
My head on a platter?

664
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,956
Well, you don't have to go that far.

665
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,008
Don't be too easy
on that military brat, Sergeant Shin.

666
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,136
He's naturally a son of a bitch.

667
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,056
If you don't rein him in,
you can get bitten.

668
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,142
Boksoon…

669
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,771
might not renew her contract with us.

670
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,693
That figures.

671
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,446
Women always stop working
once they have kids.

672
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,366
She held out long enough.

673
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,747
But who did you say
the child's father was?

674
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,752
Just a regular guy.

675
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,631
Someone unlike us?

676
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,302
Anyway, don't worry.

677
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,638
Mantis will be back soon,

678
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,558
and we're training a new generation
so they can replace the old.

679
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,686
Honestly, Gil Boksoon is past her prime.

680
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,983
Even the best knife grows dull over time.

681
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:34,114
I said the wrong thing to Boksoon earlier.

682
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,782
And…

683
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,828
she said she'll stab me

684
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,456
with the dullest knife in the world.

685
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,125
Why a dull knife, of all things?

686
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,465
Because it hurts more.

687
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,475
Did you really try to kill him?

688
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,603
Of course you didn't.

689
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,979
I know you.

690
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,861
But why did you do it?
You're not that kind of person.

691
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,404
What kind of person is that?

692
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,824
I'm not one of your houseplants.
Just let me be.

693
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,286
Do you think
those things just grow on their own?

694
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,664
I have to water them, repot them,
trim their leaves, and pull the weeds!

695
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,500
That's my job!

696
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,379
Where are you going?

697
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,798
I have to photosynthesize.

698
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,001
How did things at the school go yesterday?

699
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,088
<i>Don't ask me.</i>

700
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,675
<i>I wish someone would shoot me in the head.</i>

701
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,762
<i>How's your daughter?</i>
<i>Did you get to talk to her?</i>

702
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,765
<i>I ended up talking to a wall.</i>

703
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,268
<i>She won't open up to me.</i>

704
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,688
<i>It's wearing me out.</i>

705
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,190
<i>I wish being a mom</i>
<i>had a set contract period too.</i>

706
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,780
<i>There's always a reason</i>
<i>people put up a wall.</i>

707
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,574
Waiting for her

708
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,702
could be the solution.

709
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,205
Until she opens up first.

710
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:50,041
For moms,

711
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,378
that is biologically impossible.

712
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,591
Then you could give her a dad.

713
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,392
Right. Your work schedule is ready.
Do you need to rehearse?

714
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,478
No. Let's go and shoot it right now.

715
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,940
<i>I'll send you the equipment and an intern.</i>

716
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,819
<i>It's internship season.</i>
<i>Give them some real-life experience.</i>

717
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,323
<i>One kid is enough for my plate.</i>

718
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,242
<i>You'll like them.</i>

719
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,834
Good evening, ma'am!

720
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,005
Open.

721
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,137
A box cutter?
You could use sleeping pills.

722
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,765
Director Cha said
we needed something intense this time.

723
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,766
I see.

724
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,353
-Is this the suicide note?
-Yes.

725
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,606
They analyzed the target's handwriting
and forged it with a pen.

726
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,732
Would you like to check?

727
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,901
No, it's easier
if you don't know the storyline.

728
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,363
Nothing difficult about suicide.
Let's hurry up and go home.

729
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,843
He looks younger than me.

730
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,303
Why is he going to die?

731
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,722
He's a classic pervert.

732
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,725
The type to spike a girl's drink
and kill her to classical music.

733
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,352
Really?

734
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:33,937
No.

735
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,064
Got the face of a goddamn angel.

736
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,886
Why would he eat junk food?
It's so unhealthy.

737
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,189
He's left-handed.

738
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:20,900
Okay.

739
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,781
Wait.

740
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,492
You can't cut him in one motion.

741
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,621
For a suicide,
you have to stop and start while cutting.

742
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,458
That's how you create a hesitation wound.

743
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,375
Okay.

744
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:38,793
Give it to me.

745
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,386
You need to put emotions
into the tip of the blade.

746
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,721
There's 60% fear…

747
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,141
and 40% hesitation.

748
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,228
Wow, I can feel your emotions from here.

749
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,859
<i>Senator Oh Jeong-sik,</i>
<i>the new candidate for prime minister,</i>

750
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,111
<i>is denying claims that his son Oh</i>

751
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,156
<i>was fraudulently admitted</i>
<i>to the college of music.</i>

752
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,993
<i>Prosecutors have summoned Oh</i>
<i>to begin the investigation.</i>

753
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,580
MY FATHER IS INNOCENT

754
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,751
CAN'T STAND THE INJUSTICE

755
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,711
I NO LONGER WANT TO BE A BURDEN

756
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,049
FATHER, PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR LEAVING FIRST

757
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,971
Should your phone be on
when you're working?

758
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,309
No, it shouldn't.

759
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,733
PWINCESS

760
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,945
Stay outside for a moment.

761
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,864
-What?
-Or should I leave instead?

762
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,782
No.

763
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,208
I'm working right now.

764
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,503
<i>-Will you be home late?</i>
-Why do you ask?

765
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,131
<i>Just because.</i>

766
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,759
<i>Mom.</i>

767
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:12,679
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

768
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,352
Have you eaten?

769
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,105
<i>Not yet.</i>

770
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,819
Don't skip meals.
I made kimchi stew for you.

771
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,792
VLADIVOSTOK

772
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:26,669
A double.

773
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,349
KILL BOKSOON

774
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,233
<i>Can you talk?</i>

775
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:49,859
For a minute.

776
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,737
Are you done?

777
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,697
<i>I failed.</i>

778
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,493
What?

779
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,704
He woke up.
Maybe there wasn't enough sleeping gas.

780
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,040
I should've checked beforehand.

781
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,626
It was my mistake.

782
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,963
<i>You must've read the suicide note.</i>

783
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,134
You know I don't read those.

784
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,845
Three reasons why I can't believe you.

785
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,306
First,

786
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,977
Gil Boksoon is one
who would never fail this show.

787
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:25,812
Second,

788
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,731
this show is one
that Gil Boksoon would never fail.

789
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:29,732
And third.

790
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:34,612
<i>The client is a heartless father</i>
<i>who is trying to kill his own child.</i>

791
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,077
Are you saying
I wouldn't work for those reasons?

792
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,538
<i>You'd know better than me.</i>

793
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,294
"You must always try shows
sanctioned by your company."

794
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,422
If you didn't actually fail…

795
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,471
you just broke the rules.

796
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,225
Then are you going to kill me?

797
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,985
<i>Why aren't you answering me?</i>

798
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,073
Hold on.

799
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,539
I see they began the shoot.

800
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,417
He should've turned his phone off at work.

801
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,344
Kill that Asian bastard!

802
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,975
Don't back away! You fucking bastard!

803
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,837
<i>Just listen to me while you're working.</i>

804
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,132
<i>I clearly stated that I failed this show.</i>

805
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,928
<i>Whether you believe me is up to you.</i>

806
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,598
<i>But you'll have to believe me</i>
<i>if you need my signature on that contract.</i>

807
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,569
Cease fire!

808
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,450
Is that all you need to say?

809
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,412
<i>One more thing.</i>

810
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,998
<i>No one else can work on my failed show.</i>

811
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,459
Those are

812
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,088
my conditions for renewing my contract.

813
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,076
That's not him.

814
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,790
Over there!

815
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,870
Let me talk to the intern.

816
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,167
Do I have to lie?

817
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,212
No, just tell him the truth.

818
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,968
Hello, Chairman Cha.

819
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,763
<i>Did she really fail?</i>

820
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,602
I was not on the scene.

821
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,604
<i>Try again.</i>

822
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,609
Yes, she did fail.

823
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,320
I think I miscalculated the amount of gas.

824
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,488
I apologize, sir.

825
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,116
Yes, sir.

826
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,747
<i>I also have one condition.</i>

827
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,170
I decide the duration of the contract.

828
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,089
Until then,

829
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,592
Gil Boksoon continues to be MK's knife.

830
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,125
SO-RA

831
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,053
How does that make any sense?

832
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,098
Even if she softened up
after becoming a mom…

833
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,275
What if

834
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,194
she broke the rules on purpose?

835
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,364
Why would she?

836
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,746
Fine.

837
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,916
I'll see who I can give this show to.

838
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:20,833
<i>No.</i>

839
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,210
<i>Just close it as a failed case.</i>

840
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:25,546
Are you crazy?

841
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,050
It was a level A.
What about our reputation?

842
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,177
Is this also part of her plan?

843
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:35,890
So it was.

844
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:38,476
She didn't actually fail.

845
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,395
<i>You two are unbelievable.</i>

846
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,482
<i>What is she to you</i>
<i>to make you act this way?</i>

847
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,317
The plane's taking off.

848
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,527
Just have the contract ready.

849
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:07,088
Your daughter, fortunately,
resembles her mother.

850
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,424
But she looks depressed.

851
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,052
She'd be prettier if she smiled.

852
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:17,848
That's why

853
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:22,019
you should've led a better life as a cop
if you wanted to die of natural causes.

854
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,855
It'll be over once I move the chair.

855
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,725
You're supposed to be in school right now.

856
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,146
Are you here to kill my dad?

857
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,026
Your dad is killing himself

858
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,402
after shooting

859
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:13,696
his own daughter.

860
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,824
Oh.

861
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,660
I should've stayed for the last class.

862
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,459
How chaotic.

863
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,422
You could solve this right away
if you just follow the rules.

864
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,969
You're gonna shuffle it up again anyway.
What's the rush?

865
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,140
How old are you?

866
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,686
-Seventeen.
-That complicates things.

867
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,396
In what way?

868
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,315
I have a younger sister.

869
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,069
So I don't kill children. That's my rule.

870
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,573
I see this job isn't just for bad people.

871
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,791
Are you always this reckless?

872
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,251
Defining someone as a child

873
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,796
is really vague.

874
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,215
Rules should be clear.

875
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,635
How about minors? I don't have my ID yet.

876
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,514
But letting a witness survive…

877
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:22,681
Hey!

878
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,272
Now you're the witness.

879
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,434
Are you having a bad day, Director Cha?

880
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:14,650
It's not polite to ask
if you can tell I'm having a shitty day.

881
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,571
Did you find anything?

882
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:22,575
Yes. It's from the recent
Daejeon researcher murder case.

883
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:25,911
We found the truck
that disappeared from the scene

884
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,663
at a junkyard.

885
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,166
Thankfully, the dashcam is still working,

886
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,459
so we were able to identify
all the visitors.

887
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,298
-Damn it.
-Is that someone you know?

888
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,517
Detective Kang.

889
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,896
There's a person like that
in the police force too, right?

890
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:58,360
<i>Someone who is talented</i>
<i>but can't make it big.</i>

891
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,154
<i>Why is that?</i>

892
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:02,531
<i>Maybe they have an attitude problem.</i>

893
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,075
<i>Or maybe they fell out of favor</i>
<i>with their bosses.</i>

894
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,077
<i>Exactly. Just left out in the cold.</i>

895
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,456
<i>And they don't even know why.</i>

896
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,499
<i>Poor thing.</i>

897
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,091
Why are you so surprised?

898
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,594
You look like you've been caught.

899
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,556
<i>I am innocent by all accounts!</i>

900
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:33,270
<i>The people trying to slander me</i>
<i>are now attacking my son.</i>

901
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:36,357
<i>I, Oh Jeong-sik,</i>

902
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,736
<i>will march on without hesitation</i>
<i>against these lowbrow attacks.</i>

903
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:45,574
<i>-Oh Jeong-sik!</i>
<i>-Oh Jeong-sik!</i>

904
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,494
<i>-Oh Jeong-sik!</i>
<i>-Oh Jeong-sik!</i>

905
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,454
I didn't actually try to kill him.

906
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,790
I'm not some kind of psychopath.

907
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,378
Should I stop?

908
01:10:57,461 --> 01:11:00,047
What? No, go ahead.

909
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,216
Here.

910
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:06,553
Yes?

911
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,059
Cheol-woo kept bothering me.

912
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,646
But I really didn't mean to stab him.

913
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,564
-I just wanted to scare him--
-Of course.

914
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,900
That's what must've happened.

915
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,737
Yoo Cheol-woo.

916
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,408
He's a coward, although he acts tough.

917
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,743
His mom is like that too.

918
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:32,413
Can I please continue?

919
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:33,872
Right.

920
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:35,416
I'm sorry.

921
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,625
The thing is…

922
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,338
he sent me some photos during lunch.

923
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,895
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt,</i>

924
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,440
but can I ask what the photos were?

925
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:04,194
Just some photos he took
without me knowing.

926
01:12:06,363 --> 01:12:08,324
So I asked him to delete them.

927
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,326
Under one condition.

928
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,871
It's a crime to sneak pictures of someone.
Delete it already!

929
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,416
-Go out with me for one month.
-What?

930
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,670
Hey, is there something wrong
with your brain?

931
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:23,047
Just one month.

932
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,675
After the month,
I'll break things off cleanly.

933
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,345
Of course, I'll be the one to dump you.

934
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,098
What's the point of that?

935
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,101
Hey, there's no fucking point.

936
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,520
The point is how I look to others.

937
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,022
Wow.

938
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,733
You really are a fucking loser.

939
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,153
Hey.

940
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,156
For fuck's sake!

941
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:54,119
You're the one
who made me like this, Gil Jae-young!

942
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,835
What's it gonna be?

943
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,214
Once I press send,

944
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,841
the photos will go out
to half of the school.

945
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,385
Press it.

946
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,472
Then I'll kill you.

947
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,016
I'm so scared.

948
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,685
I'm really going to do it.

949
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:22,314
Five.

950
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:24,441
Four.

951
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:26,693
Three.

952
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:28,862
Two.

953
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,614
One!

954
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,242
Wait!

955
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:36,412
Cheol-woo, please don't be like this.

956
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,830
My life will be over.

957
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,124
Don't ask me.

958
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,876
It's up to Jae-young.

959
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,922
Bastard.

960
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:52,177
Jae-young, let's just do what he says.

961
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,179
What have we got to lose?

962
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,056
Right, nothing that bad will happen.

963
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,641
I beg you.

964
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:59,017
Hey, she's begging you.

965
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:00,978
This isn't really us.

966
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:06,150
By the way, who wears
the pants between you two?

967
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,945
-Damn it.
-Jae-young!

968
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,029
Oh no!

969
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,532
Cheol-woo, are you okay? Oh no!

970
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:14,950
Should I call the teacher?

971
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,008
That's me and So-ra.

972
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:34,845
I see.

973
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,563
I like girls, Mom.

974
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,070
What's with that look?

975
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:57,701
What?

976
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:13,926
Jae-young.

977
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,514
You could just be confused.

978
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,437
Why didn't you tell me about this?

979
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:27,773
Even if I liked boys,

980
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:33,487
would I have to confess to you,
saying, "Mom, I think I like boys"?

981
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:35,781
No, I mean…

982
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:38,700
Not exactly, but…

983
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,913
How can I know nothing about you?

984
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,668
What about you?

985
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,170
Are you honest with me?

986
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,474
You wanna get killed, huh?

987
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:04,560
This is my goddamn home.

988
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,936
Kill me.

989
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,980
Director Cha fired me.

990
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,190
I didn't even get to make my debut.

991
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,276
Well, it makes sense

992
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,780
since a mere intern dared
to ruin Gil Boksoon's show.

993
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,535
I might not be worth
even a speck of dust to you,

994
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,039
but do you know how hard
I fought to get to this point?

995
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:32,629
Fine.

996
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:34,673
You came just in time.

997
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,846
They always need me at work
at times like these

998
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,098
and even send a person to fetch me.

999
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:51,732
Jae-young, let's continue when I get back.

1000
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:12,377
So, are you here to argue with me?

1001
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,963
I did nothing wrong.

1002
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:20,260
If anything, I lied because of you.

1003
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,678
I know.

1004
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,641
But in life,

1005
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,143
things become your fault for no reason.

1006
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,771
Other times, you get away with things.

1007
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,815
There's no such thing.

1008
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:35,275
I'll give you an example.

1009
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:39,529
Let's say that you like girls.

1010
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,742
-You didn't do anything wrong.
-Right.

1011
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,703
But people might think that's wrong.

1012
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,832
Isn't that a bit conservative
for someone who kills people for a living?

1013
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:54,920
Adults are all like that!
You think your parents are any different?

1014
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,672
My parents aren't alive.

1015
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,345
Only you would know
whether you've done right or wrong.

1016
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,847
No one else decides that for you.

1017
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:12,062
Kids these days.

1018
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:15,232
So damn smart.

1019
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:21,238
PWINCESS

1020
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,244
Take care.

1021
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:29,996
Gosh.

1022
01:18:31,081 --> 01:18:32,958
I only had two tables today. Damn it.

1023
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,044
-Hello.
-Who's this?

1024
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:37,879
Our company's intern.

1025
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:43,176
An MK intern is a member of the elite!
When's your debut set for?

1026
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,845
I got fired.

1027
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,346
You're not getting fired.

1028
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:49,141
She's gonna make it big, so remember her.

1029
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,977
I got a little taste,
and she's one sharp-ass blade.

1030
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:54,563
Jesus,

1031
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:58,191
if that's coming from Kill Boksoon…

1032
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:00,819
What's going on?

1033
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,322
Hello, Boksoon.

1034
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,575
-Hello.
-You even have a new suit.

1035
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:10,704
You're here early. Hello.

1036
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:11,705
Nice to meet you, sir!

1037
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:14,166
My name is Kim Young-ji,
a 12th league intern at MK.

1038
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,001
-Gosh, MK.
-MK.

1039
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,879
Oh, MK? Nice to meet you.

1040
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,882
So you're here
to congratulate your senior.

1041
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:25,385
See? I told you
people at big companies are loyal.

1042
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:27,262
Congratulate who?

1043
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,806
Aren't you here to congratulate Hee-sung?

1044
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,770
Oh, you didn't know.
Hee-sung was promoted to rank A today.

1045
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:36,813
So suddenly?

1046
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,275
Well, it just happened.

1047
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,039
What happened exactly?

1048
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:57,167
Sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

1049
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,420
You know too, right?
This is in the company's best interest.

1050
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,423
I never gave you the right to decide.

1051
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,175
I'm the director of this company.

1052
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:08,637
What's so fucking special
about Kill Boksoon anyway?

1053
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:13,266
Come on, brag a little.
Your show made the breaking news.

1054
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:19,064
Boksoon, take a look
and tell him he did a good job.

1055
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,566
<i>Today at 4:30 p.m.,</i>
<i>the prime minister candidate</i>

1056
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:26,321
<i>Oh Jeong-sik's son died after falling</i>
<i>from the roof of his apartment complex.</i>

1057
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,907
<i>Oh had already stopped breathing</i>

1058
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,992
<i>by the time the ambulance arrived.</i>

1059
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:09,406
What?

1060
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,368
Why are you looking at me like that?

1061
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,331
You must think I'm a crazy bitch, right?

1062
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,710
At least I'm honest with myself.

1063
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,259
But what about you?

1064
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,139
If there's a flower I want, I'll have it,
even if I have to pluck it.

1065
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:38,810
But you can't do that, can you?

1066
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:43,189
That's why I'm going to keep it
as a knife in my pocket.

1067
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:48,111
Prepare the rest of the contract.

1068
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:50,405
You know that's the show
I gave up on, right?

1069
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:54,034
What do you mean?
You gave up on a sanctioned show?

1070
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:56,328
That's not what she meant. She failed it.

1071
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,413
Boksoon failed?

1072
01:21:58,496 --> 01:21:59,539
Who was it?

1073
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,584
Do I have to answer that?

1074
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,670
Goodness, the soup must be ready.

1075
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,173
I wonder why they suddenly
gave you a level-A show.

1076
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:10,634
Why?

1077
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:13,970
I guess you thought
I'd never reach rank A.

1078
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:14,930
Right.

1079
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,266
Fuck, seriously…

1080
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:23,188
Who do you think was the reason
I never got a big job all these years?

1081
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:53,927
What took you so damn long?

1082
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:56,471
<i>Director Cha?</i>

1083
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:01,768
Goodness.

1084
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:03,561
Is this Boksoon?

1085
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:06,773
-I see you've done something interesting.
<i>-Boksoon.</i>

1086
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,317
<i>I have more power than you think.</i>

1087
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:12,070
What if you get in trouble?

1088
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,863
Min-kyu would never punish me.

1089
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:16,366
No,

1090
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:17,826
but I will.

1091
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:23,665
I called Hee-sung, not you.

1092
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:27,043
Fine, I'll see you soon.

1093
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:31,506
Answer it here.

1094
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,848
Yes, Director Cha.

1095
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:43,268
No.

1096
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:48,023
I'm with Boksoon,

1097
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,985
a few friends from other companies,
and our intern.

1098
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:56,489
No, I mean…

1099
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:58,992
I think that will be difficult.

1100
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,375
I understand.

1101
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:15,633
Director Cha wants to say hello.

1102
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,135
To us?

1103
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,554
<i>Hello, I'm MK's Cha Min-hee.</i>

1104
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,682
<i>Are you not going to say hi?</i>

1105
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,476
-Hello.
-Hello.

1106
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,353
<i>-Young-ji, are you there too?</i>
-Yes.

1107
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:30,231
<i>I've heard a lot</i>
<i>about you guys from Hee-sung</i>

1108
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,984
<i>that you have great potential.</i>

1109
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:37,405
<i>That's why I want</i>
<i>to give everyone an opportunity</i>

1110
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,701
<i>to start working at MK</i>
<i>as rank B, at least.</i>

1111
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:44,871
<i>Young-ji, you'll make your debut.</i>

1112
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:46,289
Stop fooling around, Director Cha.

1113
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:49,459
Excuse me!
Does that also include the unemployed?

1114
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:50,502
<i>Yes.</i>

1115
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:53,671
<i>You'll have to take on</i>
<i>a show with Hee-sung.</i>

1116
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,884
<i>One of our employees disgraced us</i>
<i>by breaking the rules.</i>

1117
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,096
<i>I authorize this show</i>
<i>as the representative director of MK.</i>

1118
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:02,472
<i>That employee will--</i>

1119
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:05,141
Han Hee-sung, let go of it.

1120
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:15,860
Aren't you ashamed?

1121
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,321
Last time, you said that MK--

1122
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:01,030
PWINCESS

1123
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:42,322
Come on, grab her!

1124
01:26:52,498 --> 01:26:54,375
Damn it. Move!

1125
01:26:58,087 --> 01:26:59,547
Gosh, did that hurt?

1126
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,426
My face is off-limits.

1127
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:19,525
You have my respect, Boksoon.

1128
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,375
This is quite the irony, isn't it?

1129
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,835
You're enjoying this too.

1130
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,588
I hope you understand, Boksoon.

1131
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,215
It's just…

1132
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:45,802
the way things are.

1133
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:47,220
Sure.

1134
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,640
Gotta help yourself, right?

1135
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:03,444
You're going places, kid.

1136
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,457
Congrats on your debut.

1137
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:32,468
I worked on some unsanctioned shows.

1138
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,972
But Director Cha
fucking found out about them.

1139
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,729
You know I really liked you, right?

1140
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:51,362
That's lame, Hee-sung.

1141
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:54,866
I see this isn't working.

1142
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:02,748
Boksoon.

1143
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:06,461
Please check on my dad once in a while.

1144
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:42,288
PWINCESS

1145
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:48,211
This is Gil Boksoon.

1146
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:52,256
I'll explain later.
Please clean up this place.

1147
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,806
-We're in trouble, right?
-No.

1148
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:04,143
We're fucked.

1149
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:11,234
But it helps to know that

1150
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:13,528
we're fucked together.

1151
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:19,492
But why did you help me?

1152
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,249
Just to survive.

1153
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,796
And I thought
I'd have a better chance of it with you.

1154
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:48,437
Sorry I couldn't get to the phone.

1155
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,982
I’m probably gonna be a while longer…

1156
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:56,028
Are you crying?

1157
01:32:57,446 --> 01:32:58,656
<i>Is it because of me?</i>

1158
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,662
Don't cry, Jae-young.

1159
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:06,330
Did something happen?

1160
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,207
<i>Hello?</i>

1161
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:14,338
You've really crossed the line this time.

1162
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:18,050
How much more do I have to keep
letting things slide for you?

1163
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,635
<i>-Mom, what's wrong?</i>
-My phone--

1164
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:21,345
<i>Hello?</i>

1165
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,848
Please turn off my phone.

1166
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,308
<i>Mom!</i>

1167
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:30,313
Mom, what's going on?

1168
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:32,982
Hello?

1169
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:34,400
<i>Mom.</i>

1170
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:39,447
Sir!

1171
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:42,783
She did nothing wrong!
It was Director Cha's orders.

1172
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,121
Director Cha told them to kill her.
That's what caused this!

1173
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,477
Cleaners are required to report
the bodies of employees

1174
01:34:10,102 --> 01:34:11,771
to their companies.

1175
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:15,441
I'm just gonna head home for the night.

1176
01:34:16,108 --> 01:34:19,445
All the companies will know
by tomorrow morning.

1177
01:34:19,528 --> 01:34:22,823
Tell your sister
that I'm coming to see her soon.

1178
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,036
You can't mess with her.

1179
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:29,872
-She's gonna be handling your contract.
-Are you kidding me?

1180
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:32,041
I can only protect you

1181
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:34,627
as long as you're with MK.

1182
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,797
How fucking touching.

1183
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,132
The other companies' pride is on the line.

1184
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:43,719
Their employees died,
and they don't know why.

1185
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:47,515
They'll keep coming after you
until they find you dead.

1186
01:34:50,726 --> 01:34:52,478
What if I tell them why?

1187
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:55,856
Would your sister be safe?

1188
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:00,695
Then I'd have to kill you right now.

1189
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,158
It'll break my heart as well.

1190
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:09,370
When your daughter becomes an orphan.

1191
01:35:42,653 --> 01:35:43,904
I'll come to work tomorrow.

1192
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,532
I'll get the contract ready.

1193
01:35:56,292 --> 01:36:00,045
Aren't you also the one putting up a wall?

1194
01:36:07,553 --> 01:36:08,971
She did nothing wrong.

1195
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:11,515
She's too good to be fired.

1196
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,607
Thank you for the lesson, Ms. Gil!

1197
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,519
What happened?

1198
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:59,438
Why did you hang up like that
and not pick up?

1199
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,649
Do you know how worried I was?

1200
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,779
I dropped my phone.

1201
01:37:07,696 --> 01:37:09,073
What's wrong?

1202
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,664
Nothing happened to me.

1203
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:18,958
Did something happen?

1204
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:21,460
Tell me.

1205
01:37:22,294 --> 01:37:23,796
Nothing happened to me either.

1206
01:37:27,466 --> 01:37:28,467
Gil Jae-young.

1207
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,100
It's over with So-ra.

1208
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:38,018
Why?

1209
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:41,647
I told her that I told you,
and she told me never to call her again.

1210
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:43,941
She said it was all just a joke to her.

1211
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,986
Telling me that she liked me…

1212
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,531
and kissing me…

1213
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,709
She said she's not that type.

1214
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,218
So, are you saying you're "that type"?

1215
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,345
Yes, I am.

1216
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:16,390
Isn't that why you ran off earlier?

1217
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:22,730
I'm sorry.

1218
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:25,190
What are you sorry for?

1219
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:29,361
Now that this happened, I know for sure.

1220
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,448
I'll hide it from now on.

1221
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:36,118
Can't you just accept my apology?

1222
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:39,038
Do you have to make me
look stupid to feel better?

1223
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:46,587
And

1224
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:50,841
why do you have to hide it from everyone
when you did nothing wrong?

1225
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:16,992
Something did happen, right?

1226
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:26,710
You don't have to tell me.

1227
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:51,443
I have these colleagues…

1228
01:39:54,905 --> 01:39:57,032
and they were a little hard on me today.

1229
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,454
So we had a little fight.

1230
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:05,582
Why?

1231
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:10,754
It sometimes happens when you work.

1232
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,800
Because they have to survive too.

1233
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:19,930
What about you?

1234
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:24,476
Do you believe what So-ra said to you?

1235
01:40:26,145 --> 01:40:27,104
You don't, right?

1236
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,525
She's just trying to survive too.

1237
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,947
So, what are you going to do?

1238
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,244
I'm done with them.

1239
01:40:43,912 --> 01:40:45,372
I won't be seeing them again.

1240
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,086
That's a bold move.

1241
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:56,633
I'm not done, honestly.

1242
01:40:58,802 --> 01:41:00,429
I guess I really like her a lot.

1243
01:41:03,932 --> 01:41:05,851
If I knew this would happen,

1244
01:41:07,102 --> 01:41:09,605
I would've just dated
that loser, Cheol-woo.

1245
01:41:11,523 --> 01:41:13,692
Then I wouldn't have to break up
with So-ra…

1246
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:18,614
and I could've kept going
to the school you like.

1247
01:41:20,532 --> 01:41:21,492
Guess so.

1248
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:24,578
But why didn't you?

1249
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:31,210
I just wanted to stay true. To myself.

1250
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:47,726
You're so admirable,

1251
01:41:48,727 --> 01:41:49,561
my baby.

1252
01:41:55,984 --> 01:41:56,819
Mom.

1253
01:41:57,986 --> 01:41:58,946
Yes?

1254
01:41:59,738 --> 01:42:01,490
I've seen a gun

1255
01:42:02,574 --> 01:42:03,784
in your bag before.

1256
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:07,246
And a fake passport too.

1257
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,588
Do you happen to work at…

1258
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:26,431
the National Intelligence Service?

1259
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:33,814
I looked it up online,
and that made the most sense.

1260
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,116
Jae-young.

1261
01:42:46,535 --> 01:42:47,911
I didn't say a word.

1262
01:42:52,207 --> 01:42:53,292
I knew it.

1263
01:42:55,043 --> 01:42:55,961
It's confidential.

1264
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,258
You must be exhausted.

1265
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:05,470
Both of us must be.

1266
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:09,850
-I'll go wash up.
-Okay.

1267
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:25,449
Mom?

1268
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:28,118
Have you ever fired that gun?

1269
01:43:30,454 --> 01:43:33,248
Yes, only when I'm practicing.

1270
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:52,100
<i>I don't care if she's Gil Boksoon</i>
<i>or Kill Boksoon.</i>

1271
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,102
<i>We can't let her off the hook.</i>

1272
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:57,856
I poured my entire life
into establishing this company.

1273
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:00,651
How am I supposed to
face my employees now?

1274
01:44:02,527 --> 01:44:05,030
But if someone top-class
like Gil Boksoon did that,

1275
01:44:05,113 --> 01:44:07,241
doesn't that mean MK had other intentions?

1276
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:12,079
The cleaners said
that it happened over drinks.

1277
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:14,873
It must have been her personal decision.

1278
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:18,752
"A personal decision."

1279
01:44:18,835 --> 01:44:21,964
But would MK let go of her that easily?

1280
01:44:22,047 --> 01:44:24,258
-She's Chairman Cha's favorite--
-By the way.

1281
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:29,346
Was this really…

1282
01:44:31,723 --> 01:44:33,183
her personal decision?

1283
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,356
Gosh, sorry about that!

1284
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:43,944
I deactivated your card
because I thought you'd be dead.

1285
01:44:44,569 --> 01:44:47,072
An Americano, right? Without syrup.

1286
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:49,074
Don't smile.

1287
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:52,703
I can see your fangs.

1288
01:44:53,328 --> 01:44:55,872
Be careful. It hurts when I bite.

1289
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:57,207
Yes.

1290
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,376
It did sting a bit.

1291
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,173
<i>No matter how much</i>

1292
01:45:05,257 --> 01:45:07,259
of an unprecedented bitch she is,

1293
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:12,889
it's hard to believe that Gil Boksoon
would kill other companies' employees

1294
01:45:14,349 --> 01:45:15,600
simply on a drunken whim.

1295
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:17,644
That's what I'm saying!

1296
01:45:18,937 --> 01:45:21,064
But then, why would Gil Boksoon do that?

1297
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:24,776
Let's hear it from Chairman Cha.

1298
01:45:25,777 --> 01:45:30,324
If it was really her personal decision,
he'll just toss her to us.

1299
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:36,621
But if he keeps making excuses,

1300
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:38,874
Chairman Cha

1301
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:42,210
could also be the one
breaking those rules.

1302
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:46,048
But, gentlemen,

1303
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:51,094
will you be able to pick this bone
with Chairman Cha face-to-face?

1304
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:55,098
You bet your ass! He's the one who made up
these damn rules in the first place!

1305
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:59,186
Making us kill our own employees
whenever a lousy rule was violated,

1306
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:00,854
running us all into the ground.

1307
01:46:00,937 --> 01:46:02,689
This time, I won't--

1308
01:46:06,818 --> 01:46:08,695
You're all here early.

1309
01:46:14,826 --> 01:46:17,079
How instinctive you all are.

1310
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:22,209
I see Director Cha is not here today.

1311
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:24,795
Yes, she had something to take care of.

1312
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,132
Shall we begin?

1313
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:31,843
Min-kyu should be
well into damage control right now.

1314
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:34,471
It's pretty remarkable.

1315
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:38,683
How is it that you exist
in a world beyond his rules?

1316
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:43,480
What's so special about you?

1317
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:45,023
I'm sure he's working hard

1318
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:48,568
because his sister's neck is on the line.

1319
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,530
Mine?

1320
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,868
That's why we're signing this contract.

1321
01:46:58,078 --> 01:46:59,746
An agreement to share a single fate.

1322
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:03,208
Don't worry.

1323
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:07,754
I have no plans
to truly get along with you.

1324
01:47:10,215 --> 01:47:14,594
Let's just pretend to be fucking chummy,
just as we always have.

1325
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:18,682
I wonder what kind of story will pan out.

1326
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:23,395
Since we share a single fate.

1327
01:47:23,478 --> 01:47:25,897
The lead
in the latest unsanctioned show was,

1328
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:28,108
unfortunately, one of my own MK employees,

1329
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:29,693
Han Hee-sung.

1330
01:47:30,694 --> 01:47:33,738
First, I'd like to apologize to you all.

1331
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:36,074
As such, I assigned this matter

1332
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:39,119
to fellow MK employee Gil Boksoon

1333
01:47:40,203 --> 01:47:43,540
so that we could handle this internally
as efficiently as we could.

1334
01:47:44,916 --> 01:47:45,792
Last night,

1335
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:49,087
as Gil was dealing with Han,

1336
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:50,714
Han ended up resisting.

1337
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:52,799
The other companies' employees

1338
01:47:53,675 --> 01:47:56,761
who were close to Han
took his side, and in the process--

1339
01:47:56,845 --> 01:47:57,888
Wait a minute.

1340
01:47:59,347 --> 01:48:01,099
So, are you saying…

1341
01:48:04,102 --> 01:48:08,732
our employees somehow
took part in violating the rules?

1342
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:09,691
No.

1343
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:14,404
I believe they were merely
trying to help a dear friend.

1344
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:17,991
We at MK would like to offer you
sufficient compensation

1345
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:20,577
for this unfortunate incident.

1346
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,914
By "sufficient compensation," you mean…

1347
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:25,790
Is that what's important right now?

1348
01:48:25,874 --> 01:48:28,752
We must establish the facts first!

1349
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:30,170
All right.

1350
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,925
Then how about we bring Gil Boksoon

1351
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:38,386
to a committee
and hear what she has to say?

1352
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,932
Yes, in due time. But she's currently
healing from an injury.

1353
01:48:42,432 --> 01:48:43,725
What about that kid?

1354
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:48,730
The cleaners said
they saw a girl with Gil Boksoon.

1355
01:48:50,273 --> 01:48:51,650
<i>She was MK's intern, right?</i>

1356
01:48:52,567 --> 01:48:54,778
Let's bring her out first.

1357
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:57,822
No one should know
about what happened today.

1358
01:48:57,906 --> 01:48:59,908
-Yes, sir.
-I know you'll do a good job.

1359
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:03,954
Like when you lied to me last time.

1360
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:07,207
I'm sorry about that, sir.

1361
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,376
You shouldn't be sorry.

1362
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:13,255
You must always follow through with a lie.

1363
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:17,050
Even to those who know it's a lie.

1364
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:23,807
I can do a good job.

1365
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:26,685
I'm a great liar, sir.
I will follow through--

1366
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:37,153
The easiest way to solve a problem
is to get rid of it.

1367
01:49:37,779 --> 01:49:38,697
Don't you agree?

1368
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:40,699
<i>Does that make any sense?</i>

1369
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:44,035
That the only witness suddenly vanished?

1370
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:45,912
<i>That stupid girl.</i>

1371
01:49:46,788 --> 01:49:48,498
I had such high hopes for her too.

1372
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,126
But it couldn't be helped.

1373
01:49:52,627 --> 01:49:54,754
We have a lot to protect, you know.

1374
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:58,633
Honestly,

1375
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,636
we're all thinking the same thing.

1376
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:03,888
Something is fishy.

1377
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:05,599
Too fishy.

1378
01:50:07,309 --> 01:50:09,269
Maybe it's not just Gil Boksoon

1379
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:12,897
but also our dear colleague Chairman Cha

1380
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:15,775
who broke the rules.

1381
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:19,946
That's the logical conclusion
we've come to.

1382
01:50:22,115 --> 01:50:23,575
And one more thing.

1383
01:50:26,578 --> 01:50:28,038
The recent unsanctioned show.

1384
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:30,749
You were to take responsibility

1385
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:33,668
if it was by an MK employee.

1386
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:37,797
What will you do now?

1387
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:40,800
Are you actually…

1388
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:44,888
going to give your head on a platter?

1389
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:47,974
I wonder.

1390
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:52,103
I think

1391
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:54,898
you've all misunderstood.

1392
01:50:58,026 --> 01:50:58,943
I…

1393
01:51:00,403 --> 01:51:02,280
cannot break the rules.

1394
01:51:08,828 --> 01:51:09,704
Because…

1395
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:13,083
I am the rule.

1396
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:17,379
Damn it, fuck!

1397
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:36,189
First,

1398
01:51:36,981 --> 01:51:39,067
you must not kill minors!

1399
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:43,822
Second, you will only take on shows
that are sanctioned by your company!

1400
01:51:43,905 --> 01:51:44,781
Third,

1401
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:49,077
you must always attempt the shows
that are sanctioned by your company!

1402
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:52,747
Fourth!

1403
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:58,002
You must not take out your weapons
during a sacred meeting!

1404
01:52:03,633 --> 01:52:04,551
I just came up…

1405
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:08,054
with that last rule.

1406
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:23,027
Has anyone else come
to their own logical conclusions?

1407
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:29,117
Who wants to come for my neck?

1408
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:31,286
No takers?

1409
01:52:33,955 --> 01:52:35,832
If you ever want to take my life again,

1410
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:38,835
send me a bloody knife.

1411
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:43,131
I'll always be happy to respond.

1412
01:52:46,259 --> 01:52:49,721
Give this to Chairman Cha,
and tell him to set the time and place.

1413
01:52:59,856 --> 01:53:02,609
<i>This really is an unjust death.</i>

1414
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:05,737
<i>My son had just turned 20.</i>

1415
01:53:07,155 --> 01:53:09,199
<i>He was an honest and talented young man.</i>

1416
01:53:10,909 --> 01:53:12,869
<i>This was not just a suicide.</i>

1417
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:16,498
<i>It was a homicide caused</i>
<i>by the political disputes</i>

1418
01:53:17,248 --> 01:53:18,166
<i>of twisted adults.</i>

1419
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:20,877
Hello?

1420
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,213
<i>To my son, who is watching over me…</i>

1421
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:24,255
Hello?

1422
01:53:28,343 --> 01:53:29,219
<i>Hello?</i>

1423
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:34,057
You must be Jae-young.

1424
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:36,976
I heard a lot about you from your mom.

1425
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:40,063
Who am I speaking to?

1426
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:43,066
I'm someone who works with your mom.

1427
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:46,820
<i>I see. At the event planning company?</i>

1428
01:53:49,405 --> 01:53:50,240
Yes.

1429
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:53,785
<i>I guess you called home</i>
<i>because her phone broke.</i>

1430
01:53:53,868 --> 01:53:55,411
<i>She's not home yet.</i>

1431
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:00,667
All right. Thanks.

1432
01:54:02,126 --> 01:54:02,961
<i>Wait.</i>

1433
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,966
Could I ask you something?

1434
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:12,303
What is my mom like

1435
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:15,557
when she's at work?

1436
01:54:22,313 --> 01:54:24,107
Your mom is great at what she does.

1437
01:54:25,233 --> 01:54:26,651
She loves her job.

1438
01:54:28,945 --> 01:54:30,113
Is there anything else?

1439
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:34,158
<i>What should I tell her</i>
<i>when she comes home?</i>

1440
01:54:42,458 --> 01:54:43,293
<i>Hello?</i>

1441
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:49,257
Tell her that I received her message…

1442
01:54:51,467 --> 01:54:53,553
<i>and that I'll see her at the office.</i>

1443
01:54:58,725 --> 01:55:01,227
<i>So Gil Boksoon offed Director Cha?</i>

1444
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:05,398
<i>What the hell is going on? Damn it.</i>

1445
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:09,068
<i>I heard this from an insider at MK.</i>

1446
01:55:10,028 --> 01:55:13,615
<i>Gil even sent Chairman Cha a bloody knife.</i>

1447
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:20,204
Have some of this too.

1448
01:55:22,123 --> 01:55:22,957
Ugh.

1449
01:55:24,792 --> 01:55:26,794
You have to eat everything at your age.

1450
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:39,474
Mom.

1451
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:43,227
I think I'll just tell the truth
and stay at this school.

1452
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:46,522
You'd like that too, right?

1453
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:48,399
Are you sure?

1454
01:55:56,491 --> 01:55:59,577
To be honest,
I don't like spinach either. It's bitter.

1455
01:56:05,166 --> 01:56:06,542
Will you be home late today?

1456
01:56:09,337 --> 01:56:10,922
I'll find out when I get there.

1457
01:56:13,257 --> 01:56:14,467
And you know what?

1458
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:17,720
Unhealthy food tastes better.

1459
01:58:59,507 --> 01:59:00,716
He's waiting upstairs.

1460
01:59:02,176 --> 01:59:03,469
Aren't you getting off work?

1461
01:59:04,846 --> 01:59:05,680
Well…

1462
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:08,307
You wanna see who will come down, right?

1463
01:59:13,688 --> 01:59:14,605
I'll see you later.

1464
02:00:07,992 --> 02:00:09,076
Want a drink?

1465
02:00:13,497 --> 02:00:14,665
I drove here.

1466
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:22,173
My sister died,
but I didn't shed a single tear.

1467
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:27,303
I must've done this for too long.

1468
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:29,472
You've always been like that.

1469
02:00:31,349 --> 02:00:32,183
What about you?

1470
02:00:35,645 --> 02:00:36,562
Maybe in the past?

1471
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:39,941
I also thought you'd changed.

1472
02:00:41,275 --> 02:00:42,235
But you didn't.

1473
02:00:47,365 --> 02:00:50,243
You're sitting in front of me right now.

1474
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:52,578
You're right.

1475
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:55,915
We haven't changed at all.

1476
02:00:56,499 --> 02:00:58,542
Seeing that we're sitting here together.

1477
02:01:00,044 --> 02:01:01,587
Is this because of that kid, Young-ji?

1478
02:01:01,671 --> 02:01:03,881
She did nothing wrong.

1479
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,467
I thought I told you that.

1480
02:01:08,386 --> 02:01:10,179
She had to go for your wrongs to go away.

1481
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:12,682
Things that already happened
don't just go away.

1482
02:01:13,557 --> 02:01:17,186
If no one knows about it,
then it didn't happen.

1483
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:18,437
But I know about it.

1484
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:22,733
I'm not being true to myself.

1485
02:01:29,156 --> 02:01:30,783
You never use both hands.

1486
02:01:31,909 --> 02:01:33,035
Your right hand, then?

1487
02:03:53,134 --> 02:03:53,968
What's wrong?

1488
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:56,512
You can't read my next move?

1489
02:03:59,473 --> 02:04:01,225
Regardless of which hand I injured,

1490
02:04:02,226 --> 02:04:03,936
I won't let it become my weakness.

1491
02:04:07,148 --> 02:04:09,150
I already know your weakness.

1492
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:12,820
What is it?

1493
02:04:14,947 --> 02:04:15,781
Me.

1494
02:04:16,907 --> 02:04:17,950
Gil Boksoon.

1495
02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:31,005
But since when?

1496
02:05:00,659 --> 02:05:02,328
<i>Now you're the witness.</i>

1497
02:06:34,503 --> 02:06:35,838
I thought about it.

1498
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,427
Regardless of whether you die

1499
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:43,846
or I die…

1500
02:06:50,144 --> 02:06:52,354
would it be hell
for me to live without you?

1501
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:56,567
Or for your kid…

1502
02:07:01,363 --> 02:07:03,907
<i>to be watching this right now?</i>

1503
02:07:37,691 --> 02:07:38,776
It's not true, right?

1504
02:07:54,458 --> 02:07:55,501
This can't be true.

1505
02:07:58,545 --> 02:07:59,463
It can't be.

1506
02:08:06,387 --> 02:08:08,180
God, please.

1507
02:08:31,036 --> 02:08:33,288
<i>God, please.</i>

1508
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,330
Mom?

1509
02:09:16,373 --> 02:09:17,499
You're home late.

1510
02:09:18,625 --> 02:09:19,460
Yes.

1511
02:09:20,419 --> 02:09:21,295
Did I wake you?

1512
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:25,174
Sorry, go back to sleep.

1513
02:09:27,301 --> 02:09:28,343
Mom.

1514
02:09:44,610 --> 02:09:45,736
Long day?

1515
02:09:55,204 --> 02:09:56,038
Yes.

1516
02:09:57,873 --> 02:09:58,957
You look tired.

1517
02:09:59,625 --> 02:10:00,459
Get some rest.

1518
02:10:02,252 --> 02:10:03,086
Okay.

1519
02:10:05,964 --> 02:10:06,799
Good night.

1520
02:10:09,259 --> 02:10:10,844
Don't close the door.

1521
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:12,971
It feels stuffy.

1522
02:11:36,430 --> 02:11:39,099
<i>Breaking news.</i>
<i>Newly-elected Prime Minister Oh Jeong-sik…</i>

1523
02:11:39,182 --> 02:11:40,309
Jae-young.

1524
02:11:40,392 --> 02:11:44,229
<i>…was found dead</i>
<i>inside his car today at 12:18 p.m.</i>

1525
02:11:44,313 --> 02:11:46,440
-Gil Jae-young!
<i>-He asphyxiated on carbon monoxide.</i>

1526
02:11:46,523 --> 02:11:48,567
<i>The police suspect this was a suicide</i>

1527
02:11:48,650 --> 02:11:51,403
<i>based on the fact that he suffered</i>
<i>from severe depression</i>

1528
02:11:51,486 --> 02:11:52,529
<i>over his son's suicide.</i>

1529
02:11:52,613 --> 02:11:53,614
Jae-young!

1530
02:11:57,534 --> 02:11:59,453
Just came to say goodbye to my friend.

1531
02:12:10,714 --> 02:12:12,758
Aren't you going to say bye
to your bestie?

1532
02:12:17,554 --> 02:12:18,805
I thought about it.

1533
02:12:21,058 --> 02:12:23,060
Whether I should kiss you right now…

1534
02:12:25,687 --> 02:12:27,189
or just kill you.

1535
02:12:37,866 --> 02:12:38,951
Take care.
