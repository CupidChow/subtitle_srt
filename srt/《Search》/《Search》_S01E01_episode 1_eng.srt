 This drama is a work of fiction, and the related characters, names, agencies, groups, and situations have no correlation to the real world.

 1997 Haeju City, Hwanghae Province

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,270
 We've caught some signal.

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,610
 Are you sure she went to the South?

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,860
 Stop at the checkpoint on Route 34.

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,770
 Locate Major Ri Kyeong Hee!

14
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,470
He can't have gone very far.

15
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,180
- Find him! 
 - Yes, sir!

 1997 General Observation Post Entrance

17
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,480
 Episode 1

18
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:20,430

19
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,850
Commander, Unity!

20
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,230
Unity!

21
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,850
Right. Today is the Commanderâ€™s last operation. Let's do well.

22
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,080
Yes, we've prepared a goodbye party tonight.

23
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,790
That guy thinks it's a welcome party for him.

24
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,160
He met a good wife and was assigned easy positions

25
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,050
and was forced to come here for his promotion.

26
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,850
Should we?

27
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,380
Should we initiate him properly in the minefield?

28
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,860
Let him be. People like him don't die even from stepping on mines.

29
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,090
It'll be a relief if he can just stay away from causing accidents.

30
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,950
Hyeok, you should have just stayed at the headquarters.

31
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,330
Why are you here at the front, suffering?

32
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,030
Are you asking because you don't know?

33
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,680
My father-in-law told me that I had to have field experience in order to get a star.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,320
How dare those bastards disrespect a commissioned officer?

35
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,430
If you want to stay here, you have to get along with the non-commissioned officers.

36
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
Those people...

37
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,450
I know that much without you telling me, Jo Min Gook.

38
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,250
Today's operation will be led by the new commander and the division's commissioned troop orientation officer.

39
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,130
You will do your best to complete today's operation and return safely.

40
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,970
- Everyone, total security left and right!
 - Total security left and right!

41
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,270
- Deploy in formation.
 - Deploy in formation.

42
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,350
- Deploy!
 - Safety! Mission! Fighting!

43
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,210
 Ten others besides Captain Jo Min Gook have entered Gate 8.

44
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,400
 Land mine

45
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,110
Short break. Two minutes rest.

46
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,420
Two minutes rest.

47
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,250
Why are you filming this?

48
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,860
Your wife is quite the beauty.

49
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,320
How does it feel to be on an operation after a long time?

50
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,400
It's nice.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,360
Try being stuck at the office and having to do all the grunt work for the commander. You'll go crazy.

52
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,180
Using the promotional video as an excuse to join the operation, like today, lets me breathe.

53
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,770
The air is great at the DMZ.

54
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,210
That's right.

55
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,930
Captain.

56
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,030
North Koreans released poison into that water.

57
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,130
Stop joking around. Break is over!

58
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,820
Erase what you filmed.

59
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,510
Alright.

60
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,110
You can't joke around in the DMZ.

61
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,280
Starting now, it's a danger zone. Be on high alert. Move.

62
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,690
- Move!
 - Move!

63
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,680
  Military Demarcation Line

64
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,360
 Mines

65
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,070
 Sector 21

66
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,670
Rest for a minute.

67
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,820
This is Owl at Sector 21.

68
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,830
Approaching southbound towards to the C1 sector building. Over.

69
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,270
 Confirmed.

70
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,550
Binoculars.

71
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,300
There isn't something there, is there?

72
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,170
- There could be.
 - Shh!

73
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,320
Shh!

74
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,860
Anomaly detected.

75
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,480
In the northern direction?

76
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,090
 Owl.

77
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,860
 - Owl?  
 - I'll keep it open. Over.

78
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,370
Move ahead in two minutes.

79
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,530
Walkie.

80
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,910
This is Owl. A situation has occurred in Sector 21. Requesting assistance.

81
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,650
 Trying to figure out the situation.

82
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,030
- Is the antenna set up? 
 - Yes.

83
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,930
Nest. Nest!

84
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,790
Sir, I think the North has jammed our radios.

85
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,850
It keeps breaking! What should we do?

86
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,110
Change the channel and connect to the closest OP.

87
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,330
This is Owl. 103 reporting wind anomalies, over.

88
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,030
 103, 103. In front of Sector 21,

89
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,980
 a ferry touched an underwater mine and got stuck.

90
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,450
 It is impossible to confirm whether suspicious people are on board or not.

91
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,290
Major Jo, what should we do?

92
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,430
Why don't we pull out first?

93
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,690
Contact headquarters.

94
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,580
This is Owl. Nest. Nest!

95
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,910
It's disconnected.

96
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,910
Try it again.

97
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,350
103. Report the situation again.

98
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,550
 We're currently obscured by a blind spot. Over.

99
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,900
Let's get out of here first, Captain.

100
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,290
 103, confirmation of a North Korean female soldier near the stranded boat.

101
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,330
What? A defector? Are you sure it's a defector, not an armed guard?

102
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,760
She's an unarmed defector.

103
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,310
Visual confirmation.

104
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,490
The radio operator should stay at the guard post and try to reach headquarters.

105
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,840
This is Owl. Nest, are you there? Nest? Nest?

106
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,380
 Owl. Confirmation of a defector on-site.

107
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,550
-  Over.  
- On-site?

108
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,470
Those OP (Operation Post) bastards, they don't care since they're not dealing with this.

109
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,400
Listen up. We will begin the transfer of the defector.

110
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,700
Sergeant, you deploy the operation. Sergeant Kim, you're on rear alert.

111
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,580
- Move.
 - What are you doing? Stop moving.

112
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,510
We haven't gotten any orders from HQ. Why are you deciding this by yourself?

113
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,540
The field commander has authority. I made the judgment call.

114
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,540
- Deploy.
 - Deploy.

115
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,540
Hands up!

116
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,800
Please don't shoot.

117
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,820
Please don't shoot.

118
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm a nuclear weapons researcher of the Korean People's Army,

119
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,140
Major Ri Kyeong Hee.

120
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,430
I'm Captain Jo Min Gook.

121
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,800
You've crossed the military demarcation line.

122
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,510
Are you a defector?

123
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,530
Yes.

124
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,390
First Lieutenant Han.

125
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,070
Film the defector.

126
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,240
Yes, sir.

127
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,690
Do you wish to defect to South Korea for freedom?

128
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,070
I came to South Korea

129
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,470
with my baby. Please help me.

130
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,460
The date and time is May 25th, 1997 at 9:35 am.

131
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,960
We will take the defector back now.

132
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,660
Move!

133
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,460
 Hey, there!

134
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,930
What's happening?

135
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,490
Shouldn't we shoot first?

136
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,250
The safety of the defector is priority.

137
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,370
Hey, South Korean Commander!

138
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,770
Send that girl back here.

139
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,220
This lady has already defected to the South.

140
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,690
What? What are you doing, Comrade Major Traitor?

141
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,800
Are you saying you'll run away just like this? Where is Woo Sang Min?

142
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,900
You know where he is.

143
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,070
I don't know!

144
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,880
If you do that, I can't guarantee the safety of that baby.

145
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,170
We can't guarantee your safety either if you keep acting like this.

146
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,300
Oh? Are you saying we should spill each others' blood?

147
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,360
Oh, damn. I guess we can't resolve this with words!

148
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,930
 Military Police

149
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,870
Look here! Comrade Group Leader!

150
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,840
Comrade?

151
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,410
Why are you being like that, Comrade Major?

152
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,620
I will go back to the North,

153
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,700
so please let me send my baby to the South.

154
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,530
Don't you need me alive to find what you're looking for?

155
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,750
South Korean Commander! Did you hear what she said?

156
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,670
You can't.

157
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,270
What? I can't?

158
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,560
What kind of nonsense is that? Stay still!

159
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,060
Commander of the South Korean Armed Forces,

160
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,320
I will not defect.

161
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,130
So please let me go back.

162
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,550
Instead, I leave him in your care.

163
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,660
I think that's a good plan, Commander.

164
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,540
First Lieutenant Han.

165
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,910
Take the baby.

166
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,390
Please take good care of him.

167
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,700
Please.

168
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,060
Retreat.

169
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,700
Commander!

170
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,170
What are you doing?

171
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,560
No!

172
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,360
Drop the gun!

173
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,810
Won't you drop the gun? Drop the gun, bastard!

174
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,110
- Put the gun down!
 - Hey, Second Division?

175
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,600
Put the guns down!

176
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,300
What are you doing? Drop the gun!

177
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,090
Sergeant First Class Kim!

178
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,930
Put your guns down, bastards!

179
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,440
No!

180
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,090
 Joseon

181
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,550
 Search

182
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,730
 June 2020

183
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,950
 Division 10 Reconnaissance Battalion

184
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,690
Let's go!

185
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,860
Stop it!

186
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,100
Let's go, let's go!

187
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,650
Do you think you are Michael Jordan?

188
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,870
Dragon Snake! We'll really die like this. It is scorching hot today.

189
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,170
Dragon Snake!

190
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,470
Today the temperature is the hottest since South Korea was founded.

191
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,100
Ah, these weak guys.

192
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,630
How nice is this? We don't even have training.

193
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,090
We should play on days like this.

194
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,540
Wow.

195
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,550
This crazy bastard. Is he senile or something?

196
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,430
Hey, Bbong Rak, where are you going?

197
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,730
Follow me, bastard.

198
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,590
- Quickly.
 - Yes.

199
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,290
Why play basketball on a day like this?

200
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,300
It's time for cold bean noodles.

201
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,620
Kids. This is why I like Bbong Rak so much.

202
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,570
- Can you put the ice in quickly?
 - Of course.

203
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,660
Thanks.

204
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,870
Give some to the youngest too. Look at his face! The heat has made his face weird.

205
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,000
This looks serious.

206
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,850
Eat up. Our country's practically Africa now.

207
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,070
There's no such thing as spring and fall anymore.

208
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,340
It's only June, but does 43 degrees(109Â° F) make sense?

209
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,700
Hey, this is better than the stuff they sell.

210
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,150
Why is this so delicious?

211
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,570
Hey, Maknae! Eat! 
 (Maknae is a term for the youngest in a group)

212
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,030
 Is he sleeping?

213
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,640
Hey, Maknae.

214
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,980
Is Byeok Joon okay? What did medical say?

215
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,260
They said it's not serious.

216
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,400
It's because of my stamina. Sorry.

217
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,190
This won't do.

218
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,250
Go get something cold at the PX (store on a military base).

219
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,580
Are you serious?

220
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,110
I'm going to buy everything!

221
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,480
Of course I'm serious. It's not my card, it's my mom's.

222
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,620
Wow. Now that you're three weeks away from being discharged, you will even take the chance to use your mom's card!

223
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,770
So go get some quickly.

224
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,800
I want to go too. The best credit cards are the corporate card and Mom's card.

225
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,950
Bbong Rak, you know what I want, right?

226
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,530
Of course. We'll be right back.

227
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,090
Bye.

228
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,890
- Are you really okay? 
- Yes, I'm fine.

229
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,910
I heard that your mother runs a restaurant.

230
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,020
Well, a small one.

231
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,780
She makes enough that I can use her card.

232
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,500
Does your father work with her?

233
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,110
What does your father do?

234
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,790
She runs it with my uncle. My father isn't around.

235
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,920
Why are you sorry? It's not like you knew.

237
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,110
My father just plays at home all day, his whole life.

238
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,060
That's why I'm always curious what other fathers do.

239
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,340
What a thing to be curious about.

240
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,590
I guess so.

241
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,500
You're weird.

242
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,110
Sergeant Yong! You are blessed with more work in your last weeks!

243
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,840
We've gotten a request for help.

244
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,740
- Unity!
 - Unity.

245
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,950
The weather is so hot.

246
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,960
And I heard there's no training today. Isn't that right?

247
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,460
It's not training.

248
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,750
Of course, military support to civil authorities. That is not training.

249
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,120
Get ready!

250
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,110
- Aren't you coming with us?
 - I'm coming!

251
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,170
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

252
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,160
 DMZ 329th GP (Guard Post)

253
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,520
Where on earth did it go?

254
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,330
Maybe the ball had feet and walked away.

255
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,370
This won't do. I'll search around here, you go that way.

256
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,240
You don't have your weapon?

257
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,220
It's okay. I have this.

258
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,010
Yes, sir.

259
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,230
Be careful.

260
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,630
Damn.

261
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,830
Hey, Private Kwon.

262
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,530
What are you doing here?

263
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,480
Hey, Private Kwon.

264
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,130
Private Kwon!

265
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,630
This is a wolf who escaped from a zoo.

266
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,600
This looks like a Siberian  gray wolf.

267
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,130
Attention!

268
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,970
Our search party can look for civilians.

269
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,730
We also often look for wild animals.

270
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,820
The dogs and the search party members

271
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,340
will complete this mission before sunset.

272
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,530
Yes, sir.

273
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:29,810
And you, search party, as soon as you find the wolf in the photo,

274
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,550
tell the CBR capture team.

275
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,220
- Yes, sir.
 - Any questions?

276
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,070
(I am) Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

277
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,800
CBR team? Does the wolf have rabies?

278
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,170
They're investigating right now.

279
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,420
And is it true that each of us only get one tranquilizer dart gun?

280
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,220
I'm disappointed at that too.

281
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,700
We will die if we get bitten by this wolf.

282
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,270
So be careful not to get bitten, okay?

283
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,210
Yes, sir. Unity!

284
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,290
- Bye.
 - Work hard.

285
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,630
Let's go.

286
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,860
Hey, Maknae!

287
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,720
It's here.

288
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,820
Dragon Snake, can't you go slowly? The others are behind.

289
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,460
Guys, let's exercise regularly.

290
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,000
Aren't you guys embarrassed to be in the search party?

291
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,170
Dragon Snake, you're too much!

292
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,930
- Are you bragging about your stamina? 
 - Leo, stay.

293
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,910
I found it. Let's go!

294
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,250
Our kids have gone up.

295
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,130
What I don't get is if they get bitten by that wolf, they die.

296
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,250
But they only get one dart gun? Does that make sense?

297
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,440
Hey, this son of a...

298
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,180
What's that?

299
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,400
Where did you come from?

300
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,440
These guys. Come quickly!

301
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,710
Hey, Maknae. Hold that dart gun and rest here.

302
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,210
- No, sir, I'm fine! 
 - I'll rest!

303
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,360
Get up!

304
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,560
Hey. Leo smells something.

305
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,380
When you find the wolf, don't move. Okay?

306
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,150
Yes, sir!

307
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,370
- Answer properly! 
 - Yes, sir!

308
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,230
Follow me.

309
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,780
Found it!

310
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,390
Stop.

311
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,630
Alright.

312
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,970
Let's catch ourselves a wolf.

313
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,290
Okay.

314
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Why are you so scared? Did you see something scary?

315
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,490
We're not scary people.

316
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,780
Hey, Maknae! Bring the dart gun.

317
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,110
Huh? Quickly!

318
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,000
Get down from the tree now.

319
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,840
C'mon.

320
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,050
The gray wolf is a master of tree climbing.

321
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,200
In fact, it prefers animals in trees over those on the ground.

322
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,750
They are known for that. Get down.

323
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,990
Are you guys really...

324
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,210
You guys are soldiers!

325
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,240
Bring it here.

326
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,130
It's loaded.

327
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,480
But it's not loaded.

328
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,830
What?

329
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,000
Who's flying the drone?

330
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,330
What's that? What if the wolf runs away? Hey.

331
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,030
Who's good at throwing stones?

332
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,700
I played in Little League as a pitcher.

333
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,720
Yeah?

334
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,530
If you can get that,

335
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,840
I'll let you be in charge of the military dogs.

336
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Really? Yes, sir.

337
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,110
Hey. Are you trying to hit Leo?

338
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,000
No, sir.

339
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,360
Bring a stone.

340
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,670
Bring it!

341
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,660
It's fine.

342
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,190
This is how you throw stones.

343
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,310
I couldn't get it.

344
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,110
Be quiet!

345
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,360
Stay still.

346
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,550
Wolf's location confirmed. We will carry out the capture. Over.

347
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,750
I got it.

348
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,530
Why's he doing that?

349
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,250
Hey!

350
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,450
Wow, I'm alive.

351
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,070
Hey.

352
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,050
Why am I so dizzy?

353
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,380
Hey!

354
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,840
I'm sorry, Sergeant. I tried to shoot the wolf.

355
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,410
Sergeant Yong!

356
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,310
Sergeant Yong!

357
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,850
Stop all movement.

358
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,240
Yes, ma'am!

359
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,720
Unity.

360
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,270
Who are you?

361
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,570
I'm Lieutenant Son Ye Rim of the CBR team.

362
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,910
Put the dart gun down and stand back.

363
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,260
Move the wounded. We'll take care of the wolf.

364
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,840
Yes, ma'am!

365
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,160
Dragon Snake!

366
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,510
Get him on my back.

367
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,600
Did he get bitten? What's wrong?

368
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,940
We tried to shoot the wolf.

369
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,430
- That littleâ€“
 - Help us.

370
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,090
Quickly!

371
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,340
One, two, three!

372
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,380
Am I a wolf?

373
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,040
Quickly!

374
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,020
Sir, I'm okay.

375
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,290
I'm fine!

376
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,790
Sorry!

377
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:11,950
 329th Guard Post, 3 hours after the disappearance of Corporal Oh

378
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,230
He couldn't even shoot his gun.

379
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,590
This is the 329th Guard Post. Grave accident at the GP during operations.

380
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,330
One missing, one dead.

381
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,290
Requesting a search party to find the missing person. Over.

382
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,490
 KCST

383
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,210
- Lieutenant Son. 
 - Yes.

384
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,410
There's been an incident at the GP (guard post).

385
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,200
At the DMZ?

386
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,720
Yeah.

387
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,830
A soldier went missing at the GP.

388
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,810
They said it seems like he was attacked by a wild animal.

389
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:15,310
Investigate to see if any animals inside the DMZ are infected.

390
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,240
 No Entry Permitted

391
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,310
Lieutenant. Can you see anything with that?

392
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,690
Yes. I can see very well.

393
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,030
It looks like it's different from what's used by the CBR. 
  Do Not Enter

394
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,200
Yes, it's different.

395
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,640
The missing corporal.

396
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,080
It's definite that he was dragged away by something.

397
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,960
What? What are you talking about?

398
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,640
- These are military boots from North Korea. 
- What?

399
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,140
They're about size 250.

400
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,190
They wouldn't have made this deep of a depression.

401
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:01,050
This is 329th Guard Post, near the accident site. Traces of a North Korean soldier found.

402
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,140
It looks as if it's related to the missing person. Over.

403
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,900
No. It's not an animal.

404
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,550
Yes, please confirm.

405
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,250
Take this to Director Moon at the CBR Institute. It's urgent.

406
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,160
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,820
 Comply with vehicle entrance and exit procedures

408
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,560
 From: Director Moon
 Here are the results. Please check the file attached.

409
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,540
 Oh Jin Taek, 1995 December 15th. Type A

410
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,570
 Kwon Bae Hong, 2000 September 11th. Type O 
 Unidentified person

411
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,330
This is Lieutenant Han.

412
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,500
Have you checked the file?

413
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,330
As you expected, blood from three different people was found.

414
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:17,300
 Private Kwon, Corporal Oh, and one more.

415
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,510
Yes. I knew that would be the case.

416
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,380
But rabies virus was detected in that person's blood.

417
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,580
Rabies?

418
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,690
 Yes. I have to look into the details.

419
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,040
 Rabies - a disease also known as hydrophobia, characterized by difficulty swallowing water at onset.

420
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,720
Hey, Leo.

421
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,470
In 456 hours, I will become a civilian.

422
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,800
Just 456 hours.

423
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,210
But should I really be getting shot with a tranquilizer dart gun?

424
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,290
What do you think?

425
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,870
What do you think?

426
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,230
Seo Byeok Joon, really...

427
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,030
Unity!

428
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,600
Can you play dead? Huh?

429
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,290
On the floor... I should have taught that to him.

430
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,490
Quartermaster!

431
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,660
I'm not leaving.

432
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,910
Why all of a sudden another company's operations?

433
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,730
It can't be helped.

434
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,700
You're too much, sir. I almost died today.

435
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,320
But only a little bit of anesthesia got into your system

436
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,270
so you're very lucky. You had a good nap.

437
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,370
I didn't sleep, sir. I nearly died!

438
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,830
Whatever. Take Leo and go. If you bring them power ammunition, they'll give you grenades and live ammunition.

439
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,860
Put on your battle gear vest, get together an offensive and go to gate 8.

440
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,000
Private Seo, you're not participating.

441
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,220
Private Seo, that's right. But Leo should also not participate.

442
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,780
He ran in the daytime too, isn't night too much? Isn't that right, Leo?

443
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,950
Division 3's chief specifically said he needs you and Leo.

444
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,520
You two veterans will have to take the lead and run.

445
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,970
Yeah. When you come back, you'll be granted special leave,

446
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:25,490
and Leo will get special food. I'll take care of the others, too.

447
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,060
Special leave?

448
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,730
You said special leave, right?

449
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,060
I'll get going.

450
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,990
Hey, Byeok Joon. Get Leo ready.

451
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,600
Okay.

452
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,280
I'm going not because of the leave, but for Leo's sake.

453
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,810
Clean up Leo's house by the time I get back.

454
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,520
Yes, sir! It'll be sparkling clean!

455
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,470
Be careful!

456
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,770
Unity!

457
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,330
If you step on a mine, you're dead.

458
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,190
Special leave.

459
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,800
Gate 8...

460
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,030
I'm always nervous when I go there.

461
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,660
Hey, you're a corporal. You still believe those legends?

462
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,650
Everyone believes in them, except for you, Dragon Snake.

463
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,120
- Really? 
 - Yes.

464
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,260
It's not just any ghost.

465
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,300
He's the ghost of a stupid soldier ghost who wandered to the GP because he had no sense of direction.

466
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,180
Imagine how many eternal regrets he has!

467
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,170
He must really want to kill all the soldiers he sees.

468
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,370
They say that he doesn't even have a face because he stepped on a mine.

469
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,730
Hey, why don't you take this chance to capture that ghost?

470
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,760
Is there a law that says only the Marine Corps can catch ghosts?

471
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,260
Show them that the search party can, too.

472
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,500
Ghosts are the thing I hate most in this world.

473
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,040
I agree.

474
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,480
Kids. Whenever I take you around, I'm embarrassed.

475
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,370
So please don't say useless stuff and be quiet.

476
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,120
Yes, sir!

477
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,390
We're almost there. Get ready.

478
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,050
Leo. Let's get you some special food.

479
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,250
And I'll get special leave.

480
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,090
Good boy.

481
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,740
Check (gun) breechblock 2-3 times, retreat, move forward.

482
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,350
- Check breechblock 2-3 times, retreat, move forward.
 - Check breechblock 2-3 times, retreat, move forward.

483
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,820
- Trigger. 
 - Trigger.

484
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,420
- All clear. 
 - All clear.

485
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,360
- Load magazine.
 - Load magazine.

486
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,230
- Are you done? 
 - Yes.

487
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,920
- Pull out the gun. 
 - Pull out the gun.

488
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,680
Let's go.

489
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,400
- Attention. 
 - Attention.

490
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,030
This mission was assigned by the CBR team.

491
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,370
Lieutenant Son Ye Rim will join you as a special officer.

492
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:45,470
It's an honor to carry out a mission with the search party. Let'sâ€“

493
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,670
Let's do this well.

494
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,030
- Questions?
 - Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

495
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,180
Is this simply a missing person?

496
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,590
There were blood and footprints of a North Korean soldier found near the site of the accident.

497
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,850
We can't rule out North Korea's interference in this.

498
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,550
Our mission is to find the missing person as soon as possible.

499
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,970
- Is that understood? 
 - Yes, sir!

500
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,380
There is a risk of rabies throughout the DMZ. Be careful.

501
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,700
- In formation. 
 - In formation!

502
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,810
- Enter! 
 - Enter!

503
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,120
So you were alive, Lieutenant Son?

504
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,090
I'm alive and well.

505
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,660
Let's talk after the mission.

506
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,750
I have nothing to say to a traitor.

507
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,430
Traitor? Hey, who's the traitor here?

508
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,770
You're the traitor because you transferred first.

509
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,320
Me? When?

510
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,880
Don't you remember? That guy, that time.

511
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,090
A whole year later, nothing's changed.

512
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,770
A whole year later, you still won't explain.

513
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,220
- That guyâ€“ 
 - We're in the middle of an operation.

514
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,800
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

515
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,420
I know, Lieutenant Son Ye Rim.

516
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,220
Let go of that hand.

517
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,430
Be careful during the operation.

518
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,860
I can take care of myself, Lieutenant Son.

519
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,960
What's wrong with him?

520
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,630
It looks like a wild animal. We'll continue.

521
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,270
 Team Leader. It's this way.

522
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,160
 Found a shoe in the reed field that appears to belong to the missing soldier.

523
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,070
 We will be approaching Section 2-1 to look for the missing soldier.

524
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,470
Team Leader!

525
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,090
If there's this much blood, we need to find him quickly, Team Leader.

526
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,780
- Pigeon. This is Eagle speaking.
  - Found the shoe of the missing soldier.

527
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,620
 The reed field. We will enter to search now.

528
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,290
Come here.

529
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,360
 Emergency!

530
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,840
In Section 2-1...

531
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,590
 We detected a land mine explosion.

532
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,710
 Eagle. Looks like you're in a danger zone.

533
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,830
 Pull out quickly. Over.

534
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,270
- Movement detected at 1 o'clock (direction). 
 -  Suspicious person found.

535
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:43,130
Team Leader. Leo smells the missing soldier.

536
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,930
Leo's never been wrong. Trust me.

537
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,030
Go in, Team Leader.

538
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,820
He can't last long.

539
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,330
We will find the missing soldier and move out.

540
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,250
 Group 1, maintain the boundary.

541
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,890
Group 2 is under Lieutenant Son's command. Search the reed field with the dog.

542
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,560
 Move!

543
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,720
No, no.

544
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,760
No, no! Wait!

545
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,120
No, no, no, no!

546
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,290
No!

547
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,500
Is something wrong?

548
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,250
Looks like he is nearby.

549
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,240
Leo has never acted like this. He's too excited.

550
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,200
Leo, no!

551
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,120
Group 2, standby.

552
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,890
Leo! Wait!

553
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,640
Leo! Leo!

554
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,610
Stop.

555
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,480
If you move, I'll shoot.

556
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,200
What was that just now?

557
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,370
I don't know.

558
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:56,840
Team Leader. Team Leader!

559
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,050
Team Leader! Team Leader!

560
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,080
Four o'clock!

561
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,330
Lieutenant.

562
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,630
A suspected enemy is on the run at 1 o'clock.

563
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,770
Keep your guard up and continue searching for the missing soldier.

564
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,950
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

565
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,660
Leo, heel!

566
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,440
Heel.

567
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,050
Search.

568
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,490
Good boy.

569
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,040
 Come here.

570
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,660
Come here.

571
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,570
Good boy.

572
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,870
Attention.

573
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,720
Salute.

574
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:48,120
But did you see his neck wound?

575
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,850
It looks strange for a wild animal.

576
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,020
And on top of that, there's no sign of struggle.

577
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,490
Our communication with Group 1 has been cut off for now.

578
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,920
So I'll go to report to Group 1's Team Leader directly.

579
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,430
Group 2, until we get reinforcements,

580
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:06,040
maintain your position. Understood?

581
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,520
I'll come with you.

582
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,680
No. Sergeant Yong, stay with the private and secure the area.

583
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,320
Be careful.

584
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,050
What is that?

585
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,090
 Two o'clock.

586
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,650
Team Leader. We found Corporal Oh,

587
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,830
but he was already deceased.

588
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,470
Team Leader, the wild dogs are right ahead.

589
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,320
Are you sure those are dogs?

590
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,480
There are too many.

591
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,660
Leo!

592
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,170
What's wrong?

593
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,970
Is something there?

594
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:36,510
Lieutenant Son. Throw a flare at my signal.

595
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,630
- One, two. 
- Throw!

596
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,390
Fire!

597
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,640
Hey.

598
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,110
Damn.

599
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:30,960
 Land Mines

600
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:13,910

601
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:29,440
 One month prior. Sector 21

602
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,450
 Search

603
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,260
 - There's been an accident in Sector 2-1. 
 - Leo!

604
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,770
 It had to be there, of all places.

605
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,460
 The two of you saw him?

606
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,730
 You can do anything I ask of you, right?

607
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:35,640
 Mine removal?

608
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,480
 What brings you here?

609
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,030
 I'm Captain Song Min Gyu, leading the North Star Special Missions Force.

610
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,110
Something strange is happening to Corporal Oh's blood.

611
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:46,870
 Only his blood cells are changing.

612
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:50,110
 Is this related to the person who was found near him?
