 This drama is a work of fiction, and the related characters, names, agencies, groups, and situations have no correlation to the real world.

 Scenes with animals were filmed safely with the help of experts

 1997 Haeju City, Hwanghae Province

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,270
 We've caught some signal.

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,610
 Are you sure she went to the South?

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,860
 Stop at the checkpoint on Route 34.

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,770
 Locate Major Ri Kyeong Hee!

14
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,470
He can't have gone very far.

15
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,180
- Find him! 
 - Yes, sir!

16

 1997 General Observation Post Entrance

17
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,480
 Episode 1

18
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:20,430

19
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,850
Commander, Unity!

20
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,230
Unity!

21
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,850
Right. Today is the Commander’s last operation. Let's do well.

22
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,080
Yes, we've prepared a goodbye party tonight.

23
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,790
That guy thinks it's a welcome party for him.

24
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,160
He met a good wife and was assigned easy positions

25
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,050
and was forced to come here for his promotion.

26
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,850
Should we?

27
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,380
Should we initiate him properly in the minefield?

28
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,860
Let him be. People like him don't die even from stepping on mines.

29
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,090
It'll be a relief if he can just stay away from causing accidents.

30
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,950
Hyeok, you should have just stayed at the headquarters.

31
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,330
Why are you here at the front, suffering?

32
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,030
Are you asking because you don't know?

33
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,680
My father-in-law told me that I had to have field experience in order to get a star.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,320
How dare those bastards disrespect a commissioned officer?

35
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,430
If you want to stay here, you have to get along with the non-commissioned officers.

36
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,390
Those people...

37
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,450
I know that much without you telling me, Jo Min Gook.

38
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,250
Today's operation will be led by the new commander and the division's commissioned troop orientation officer.

39
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,130
You will do your best to complete today's operation and return safely.

40
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,970
- Everyone, total security left and right!
 - Total security left and right!

41
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,270
- Deploy in formation.
 - Deploy in formation.

42
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,350
- Deploy!
 - Safety! Mission! Fighting!

43
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,210
 Ten others besides Captain Jo Min Gook have entered Gate 8.

44
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,400
 Land mine

45
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,110
Short break. Two minutes rest.

46
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,420
Two minutes rest.

47
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,250
Why are you filming this?

48
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,860
Your wife is quite the beauty.

49
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,320
How does it feel to be on an operation after a long time?

50
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,400
It's nice.

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,360
Try being stuck at the office and having to do all the grunt work for the commander. You'll go crazy.

52
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,180
Using the promotional video as an excuse to join the operation, like today, lets me breathe.

53
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,770
The air is great at the DMZ.

54
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,210
That's right.

55
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,930
Captain.

56
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,030
North Koreans released poison into that water.

57
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,130
Stop joking around. Break is over!

58
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,820
Erase what you filmed.

59
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,510
Alright.

60
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,110
You can't joke around in the DMZ.

61
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,280
Starting now, it's a danger zone. Be on high alert. Move.

62
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,690
- Move!
 - Move!

63
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,680
  Military Demarcation Line

64
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,360
 Mines

65
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,070
 Sector 21

66
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,670
Rest for a minute.

67
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,820
This is Owl at Sector 21.

68
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,830
Approaching southbound towards to the C1 sector building. Over.

69
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,270
 Confirmed.

70
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,550
Binoculars.

71
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,300
There isn't something there, is there?

72
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,170
- There could be.
 - Shh!

73
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,320
Shh!

74
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,860
Anomaly detected.

75
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,480
In the northern direction?

76
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,090
 Owl.

77
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,860
 - Owl?  
 - I'll keep it open. Over.

78
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,370
Move ahead in two minutes.

79
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,530
Walkie.

80
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,910
This is Owl. A situation has occurred in Sector 21. Requesting assistance.

81
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,650
 Trying to figure out the situation.

82
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,030
- Is the antenna set up? 
 - Yes.

83
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,930
Nest. Nest!

84
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,790
Sir, I think the North has jammed our radios.

85
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,850
It keeps breaking! What should we do?

86
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,110
Change the channel and connect to the closest OP.

87
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,330
This is Owl. 103 reporting wind anomalies, over.

88
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,030
 103, 103. In front of Sector 21,

89
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,980
 a ferry touched an underwater mine and got stuck.

90
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,450
 It is impossible to confirm whether suspicious people are on board or not.

91
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,290
Major Jo, what should we do?

92
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,430
Why don't we pull out first?

93
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,690
Contact headquarters.

94
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,580
This is Owl. Nest. Nest!

95
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,910
It's disconnected.

96
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,910
Try it again.

97
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,350
103. Report the situation again.

98
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,550
 We're currently obscured by a blind spot. Over.

99
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,900
Let's get out of here first, Captain.

100
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,290
 103, confirmation of a North Korean female soldier near the stranded boat.

101
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,330
What? A defector? Are you sure it's a defector, not an armed guard?

102
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,760
She's an unarmed defector.

103
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,310
Visual confirmation.

104
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,490
The radio operator should stay at the guard post and try to reach headquarters.

105
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,840
This is Owl. Nest, are you there? Nest? Nest?

106
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,380
 Owl. Confirmation of a defector on-site.

107
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,550
-  Over.  
- On-site?

108
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,470
Those OP (Operation Post) bastards, they don't care since they're not dealing with this.

109
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,400
Listen up. We will begin the transfer of the defector.

110
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,700
Sergeant, you deploy the operation. Sergeant Kim, you're on rear alert.

111
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,580
- Move.
 - What are you doing? Stop moving.

112
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,510
We haven't gotten any orders from HQ. Why are you deciding this by yourself?

113
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,540
The field commander has authority. I made the judgment call.

114
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,540
- Deploy.
 - Deploy.

115
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,540
Hands up!

116
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,800
Please don't shoot.

117
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,820
Please don't shoot.

118
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm a nuclear weapons researcher of the Korean People's Army,

119
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,140
Major Ri Kyeong Hee.

120
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,430
I'm Captain Jo Min Gook.

121
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,800
You've crossed the military demarcation line.

122
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,510
Are you a defector?

123
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,530
Yes.

124
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,390
First Lieutenant Han.

125
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,070
Film the defector.

126
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,240
Yes, sir.

127
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,690
Do you wish to defect to South Korea for freedom?

128
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,070
I came to South Korea

129
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,470
with my baby. Please help me.

130
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,460
The date and time is May 25th, 1997 at 9:35 am.

131
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,960
We will take the defector back now.

132
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,660
Move!

133
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,460
 Hey, there!

134
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,930
What's happening?

135
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,490
Shouldn't we shoot first?

136
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,250
The safety of the defector is priority.

137
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,370
Hey, South Korean Commander!

138
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,770
Send that girl back here.

139
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,220
This lady has already defected to the South.

140
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,690
What? What are you doing, Comrade Major Traitor?

141
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,800
Are you saying you'll run away just like this? Where is Woo Sang Min?

142
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,900
You know where he is.

143
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,070
I don't know!

144
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,880
If you do that, I can't guarantee the safety of that baby.

145
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,170
We can't guarantee your safety either if you keep acting like this.

146
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:11,300
Oh? Are you saying we should spill each others' blood?

147
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,360
Oh, damn. I guess we can't resolve this with words!

148
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,930
 Military Police

149
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,870
Look here! Comrade Group Leader!

150
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,840
Comrade?

151
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,410
Why are you being like that, Comrade Major?

152
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,620
I will go back to the North,

153
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,700
so please let me send my baby to the South.

154
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,530
Don't you need me alive to find what you're looking for?

155
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,750
South Korean Commander! Did you hear what she said?

156
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,670
You can't.

157
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,270
What? I can't?

158
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,560
What kind of nonsense is that? Stay still!

159
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,060
Commander of the South Korean Armed Forces,

160
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,320
I will not defect.

161
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,130
So please let me go back.

162
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,550
Instead, I leave him in your care.

163
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,660
I think that's a good plan, Commander.

164
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,540
First Lieutenant Han.

165
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,910
Take the baby.

166
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,390
Please take good care of him.

167
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,700
Please.

168
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,060
Retreat.

169
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,700
Commander!

170
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,170
What are you doing?

171
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,560
No!

172
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,360
Drop the gun!

173
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,810
Won't you drop the gun? Drop the gun, bastard!

174
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,110
- Put the gun down!
 - Hey, Second Division?

175
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,600
Put the guns down!

176
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,300
What are you doing? Drop the gun!

177
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,090
Sergeant First Class Kim!

178
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,930
Put your guns down, bastards!

179
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,440
No!

180
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,090
 Joseon

181
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,550
 Search

182
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,730
 June 2020

183
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,950
 Division 10 Reconnaissance Battalion

184
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,690
Let's go!

185
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,860
Stop it!

186
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,100
Let's go, let's go!

187
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,650
Do you think you are Michael Jordan?

188
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,870
Dragon Snake! We'll really die like this. It is scorching hot today.

189
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,170
Dragon Snake!

190
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,470
Today the temperature is the hottest since South Korea was founded.

191
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,100
Ah, these weak guys.

192
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,630
How nice is this? We don't even have training.

193
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,090
We should play on days like this.

194
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,540
Wow.

195
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,550
This crazy bastard. Is he senile or something?

196
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,430
Hey, Bbong Rak, where are you going?

197
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,730
Follow me, bastard.

198
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,590
- Quickly.
 - Yes.

199
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,290
Why play basketball on a day like this?

200
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,300
It's time for cold bean noodles.

201
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,620
Kids. This is why I like Bbong Rak so much.

202
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,570
- Can you put the ice in quickly?
 - Of course.

203
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,660
Thanks.

204
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,870
Give some to the youngest too. Look at his face! The heat has made his face weird.

205
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,000
This looks serious.

206
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,850
Eat up. Our country's practically Africa now.

207
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,070
There's no such thing as spring and fall anymore.

208
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,340
It's only June, but does 43 degrees(109° F) make sense?

209
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,700
Hey, this is better than the stuff they sell.

210
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,150
Why is this so delicious?

211
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,570
Hey, Maknae! Eat! 
 (Maknae is a term for the youngest in a group)

212
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,030
 Is he sleeping?

213
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,640
Hey, Maknae.

214
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,980
Is Byeok Joon okay? What did medical say?

215
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,260
They said it's not serious.

216
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,400
It's because of my stamina. Sorry.

217
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,190
This won't do.

218
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,250
Go get something cold at the PX (store on a military base).

219
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,580
Are you serious?

220
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,110
I'm going to buy everything!

221
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,480
Of course I'm serious. It's not my card, it's my mom's.

222
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,620
Wow. Now that you're three weeks away from being discharged, you will even take the chance to use your mom's card!

223
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,770
So go get some quickly.

224
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,800
I want to go too. The best credit cards are the corporate card and Mom's card.

225
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,950
Bbong Rak, you know what I want, right?

226
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,530
Of course. We'll be right back.

227
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,090
Bye.

228
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,890
- Are you really okay? 
- Yes, I'm fine.

229
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,910
I heard that your mother runs a restaurant.

230
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,020
Well, a small one.

231
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,780
She makes enough that I can use her card.

232
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,500
Does your father work with her?

233
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,110
What does your father do?

234
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,790
She runs it with my uncle. My father isn't around.

235
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,920
Why are you sorry? It's not like you knew.

237
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,110
My father just plays at home all day, his whole life.

238
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,060
That's why I'm always curious what other fathers do.

239
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,340
What a thing to be curious about.

240
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,590
I guess so.

241
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,500
You're weird.

242
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,110
Sergeant Yong! You are blessed with more work in your last weeks!

243
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,840
We've gotten a request for help.

244
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,740
- Unity!
 - Unity.

245
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,950
The weather is so hot.

246
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,960
And I heard there's no training today. Isn't that right?

247
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,460
It's not training.

248
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,750
Of course, military support to civil authorities. That is not training.

249
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,120
Get ready!

250
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,110
- Aren't you coming with us?
 - I'm coming!

251
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,170
- Let's go.
 - Yes.

252
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,160
 DMZ 329th GP (Guard Post)

253
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,520
Where on earth did it go?

254
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,330
Maybe the ball had feet and walked away.

255
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,370
This won't do. I'll search around here, you go that way.

256
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,240
You don't have your weapon?

257
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,220
It's okay. I have this.

258
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,010
Yes, sir.

259
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,230
Be careful.

260
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,630
Damn.

261
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,830
Hey, Private Kwon.

262
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,530
What are you doing here?

263
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,480
Hey, Private Kwon.

264
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,130
Private Kwon!

265
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,630
This is a wolf who escaped from a zoo.

266
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,600
This looks like a Siberian  gray wolf.

267
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,130
Attention!

268
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,970
Our search party can look for civilians.

269
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,730
We also often look for wild animals.

270
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,820
The dogs and the search party members

271
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,340
will complete this mission before sunset.

272
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,530
Yes, sir.

273
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:29,810
And you, search party, as soon as you find the wolf in the photo,

274
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,550
tell the CBR capture team.

275
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,220
- Yes, sir.
 - Any questions?

276
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,070
(I am) Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

277
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,800
CBR team? Does the wolf have rabies?

278
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,170
They're investigating right now.

279
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,420
And is it true that each of us only get one tranquilizer dart gun?

280
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,220
I'm disappointed at that too.

281
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,700
We will die if we get bitten by this wolf.

282
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,270
So be careful not to get bitten, okay?

283
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,210
Yes, sir. Unity!

284
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,290
- Bye.
 - Work hard.

285
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,630
Let's go.

286
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,860
Hey, Maknae!

287
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,720
It's here.

288
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,820
Dragon Snake, can't you go slowly? The others are behind.

289
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,460
Guys, let's exercise regularly.

290
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,000
Aren't you guys embarrassed to be in the search party?

291
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,170
Dragon Snake, you're too much!

292
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,930
- Are you bragging about your stamina? 
 - Leo, stay.

293
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,910
I found it. Let's go!

294
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,250
Our kids have gone up.

295
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,130
What I don't get is if they get bitten by that wolf, they die.

296
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,250
But they only get one dart gun? Does that make sense?

297
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,440
Hey, this son of a...

298
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,180
What's that?

299
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,400
Where did you come from?

300
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,440
These guys. Come quickly!

301
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,710
Hey, Maknae. Hold that dart gun and rest here.

302
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,210
- No, sir, I'm fine! 
 - I'll rest!

303
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,360
Get up!

304
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,560
Hey. Leo smells something.

305
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,380
When you find the wolf, don't move. Okay?

306
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,150
Yes, sir!

307
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,370
- Answer properly! 
 - Yes, sir!

308
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,230
Follow me.

309
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,780
Found it!

310
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,390
Stop.

311
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,630
Alright.

312
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,970
Let's catch ourselves a wolf.

313
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,290
Okay.

314
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Why are you so scared? Did you see something scary?

315
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,490
We're not scary people.

316
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,780
Hey, Maknae! Bring the dart gun.

317
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,110
Huh? Quickly!

318
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,000
Get down from the tree now.

319
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,840
C'mon.

320
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,050
The gray wolf is a master of tree climbing.

321
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,200
In fact, it prefers animals in trees over those on the ground.

322
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,750
They are known for that. Get down.

323
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,990
Are you guys really...

324
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,210
You guys are soldiers!

325
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,240
Bring it here.

326
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,130
It's loaded.

327
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,480
But it's not loaded.

328
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,830
What?

329
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,000
Who's flying the drone?

330
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,330
What's that? What if the wolf runs away? Hey.

331
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,030
Who's good at throwing stones?

332
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,700
I played in Little League as a pitcher.

333
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,720
Yeah?

334
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,530
If you can get that,

335
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,840
I'll let you be in charge of the military dogs.

336
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Really? Yes, sir.

337
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,110
Hey. Are you trying to hit Leo?

338
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,000
No, sir.

339
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,360
Bring a stone.

340
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,670
Bring it!

341
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,660
It's fine.

342
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,190
This is how you throw stones.

343
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,310
I couldn't get it.

344
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,110
Be quiet!

345
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,360
Stay still.

346
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,550
Wolf's location confirmed. We will carry out the capture. Over.

347
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,750
I got it.

348
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,530
Why's he doing that?

349
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,250
Hey!

350
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,450
Wow, I'm alive.

351
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,070
Hey.

352
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,050
Why am I so dizzy?

353
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,380
Hey!

354
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,840
I'm sorry, Sergeant. I tried to shoot the wolf.

355
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,410
Sergeant Yong!

356
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,310
Sergeant Yong!

357
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,850
Stop all movement.

358
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,240
Yes, ma'am!

359
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,720
Unity.

360
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,270
Who are you?

361
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,570
I'm Lieutenant Son Ye Rim of the CBR team.

362
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,910
Put the dart gun down and stand back.

363
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,260
Move the wounded. We'll take care of the wolf.

364
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,840
Yes, ma'am!

365
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,160
Dragon Snake!

366
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,510
Get him on my back.

367
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,600
Did he get bitten? What's wrong?

368
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,940
We tried to shoot the wolf.

369
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,430
- That little–
 - Help us.

370
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,090
Quickly!

371
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,340
One, two, three!

372
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,380
Am I a wolf?

373
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,040
Quickly!

374
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,020
Sir, I'm okay.

375
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,290
I'm fine!

376
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,790
Sorry!

377
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:11,950
 329th Guard Post, 3 hours after the disappearance of Corporal Oh

378
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,230
He couldn't even shoot his gun.

379
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,590
This is the 329th Guard Post. Grave accident at the GP during operations.

380
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,330
One missing, one dead.

381
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,290
Requesting a search party to find the missing person. Over.

382
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,490
 KCST

383
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,210
- Lieutenant Son. 
 - Yes.

384
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,410
There's been an incident at the GP (guard post).

385
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,200
At the DMZ?

386
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,720
Yeah.

387
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,830
A soldier went missing at the GP.

388
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,810
They said it seems like he was attacked by a wild animal.

389
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:15,310
Investigate to see if any animals inside the DMZ are infected.

390
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,240
 No Entry Permitted

391
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,310
Lieutenant. Can you see anything with that?

392
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,690
Yes. I can see very well.

393
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,030
It looks like it's different from what's used by the CBR. 
  Do Not Enter

394
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,200
Yes, it's different.

395
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,640
The missing corporal.

396
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,080
It's definite that he was dragged away by something.

397
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,960
What? What are you talking about?

398
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,640
- These are military boots from North Korea. 
- What?

399
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,140
They're about size 250.

400
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,190
They wouldn't have made this deep of a depression.

401
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:01,050
This is 329th Guard Post, near the accident site. Traces of a North Korean soldier found.

402
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,140
It looks as if it's related to the missing person. Over.

403
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,900
No. It's not an animal.

404
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,550
Yes, please confirm.

405
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,250
Take this to Director Moon at the CBR Institute. It's urgent.

406
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,160
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,820
 Comply with vehicle entrance and exit procedures

408
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,560
 From: Director Moon
 Here are the results. Please check the file attached.

409
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,540
 Oh Jin Taek, 1995 December 15th. Type A

410
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,570
 Kwon Bae Hong, 2000 September 11th. Type O 
 Unidentified person

411
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,330
This is Lieutenant Han.

412
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,500
Have you checked the file?

413
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,330
As you expected, blood from three different people was found.

414
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:17,300
 Private Kwon, Corporal Oh, and one more.

415
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,510
Yes. I knew that would be the case.

416
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,380
But rabies virus was detected in that person's blood.

417
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,580
Rabies?

418
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,690
 Yes. I have to look into the details.

419
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,040
 Rabies - a disease also known as hydrophobia, characterized by difficulty swallowing water at onset.

420
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,720
Hey, Leo.

421
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,470
In 456 hours, I will become a civilian.

422
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,800
Just 456 hours.

423
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,210
But should I really be getting shot with a tranquilizer dart gun?

424
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,290
What do you think?

425
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,870
What do you think?

426
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,230
Seo Byeok Joon, really...

427
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,030
Unity!

428
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,600
Can you play dead? Huh?

429
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,290
On the floor... I should have taught that to him.

430
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,490
Quartermaster!

431
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,660
I'm not leaving.

432
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,910
Why all of a sudden another company's operations?

433
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,730
It can't be helped.

434
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,700
You're too much, sir. I almost died today.

435
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,320
But only a little bit of anesthesia got into your system

436
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,270
so you're very lucky. You had a good nap.

437
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,370
I didn't sleep, sir. I nearly died!

438
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,830
Whatever. Take Leo and go. If you bring them power ammunition, they'll give you grenades and live ammunition.

439
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,860
Put on your battle gear vest, get together an offensive and go to gate 8.

440
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,000
Private Seo, you're not participating.

441
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,220
Private Seo, that's right. But Leo should also not participate.

442
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,780
He ran in the daytime too, isn't night too much? Isn't that right, Leo?

443
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,950
Division 3's chief specifically said he needs you and Leo.

444
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,520
You two veterans will have to take the lead and run.

445
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,970
Yeah. When you come back, you'll be granted special leave,

446
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:25,490
and Leo will get special food. I'll take care of the others, too.

447
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,060
Special leave?

448
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,730
You said special leave, right?

449
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,060
I'll get going.

450
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,990
Hey, Byeok Joon. Get Leo ready.

451
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,600
Okay.

452
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,280
I'm going not because of the leave, but for Leo's sake.

453
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,810
Clean up Leo's house by the time I get back.

454
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,520
Yes, sir! It'll be sparkling clean!

455
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,470
Be careful!

456
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,770
Unity!

457
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,330
If you step on a mine, you're dead.

458
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,190
Special leave.

459
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,800
Gate 8...

460
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,030
I'm always nervous when I go there.

461
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,660
Hey, you're a corporal. You still believe those legends?

462
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,650
Everyone believes in them, except for you, Dragon Snake.

463
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,120
- Really? 
 - Yes.

464
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,260
It's not just any ghost.

465
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,300
He's the ghost of a stupid soldier ghost who wandered to the GP because he had no sense of direction.

466
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,180
Imagine how many eternal regrets he has!

467
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,170
He must really want to kill all the soldiers he sees.

468
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,370
They say that he doesn't even have a face because he stepped on a mine.

469
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,730
Hey, why don't you take this chance to capture that ghost?

470
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,760
Is there a law that says only the Marine Corps can catch ghosts?

471
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,260
Show them that the search party can, too.

472
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,500
Ghosts are the thing I hate most in this world.

473
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,040
I agree.

474
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,480
Kids. Whenever I take you around, I'm embarrassed.

475
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,370
So please don't say useless stuff and be quiet.

476
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,120
Yes, sir!

477
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,390
We're almost there. Get ready.

478
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,050
Leo. Let's get you some special food.

479
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,250
And I'll get special leave.

480
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,090
Good boy.

481
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,740
Check (gun) breechblock 2-3 times, retreat, move forward.

482
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,350
- Check breechblock 2-3 times, retreat, move forward.
 - Check breechblock 2-3 times, retreat, move forward.

483
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,820
- Trigger. 
 - Trigger.

484
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,420
- All clear. 
 - All clear.

485
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,360
- Load magazine.
 - Load magazine.

486
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,230
- Are you done? 
 - Yes.

487
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,920
- Pull out the gun. 
 - Pull out the gun.

488
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,680
Let's go.

489
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,400
- Attention. 
 - Attention.

490
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,030
This mission was assigned by the CBR team.

491
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,370
Lieutenant Son Ye Rim will join you as a special officer.

492
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:45,470
It's an honor to carry out a mission with the search party. Let's–

493
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,670
Let's do this well.

494
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,030
- Questions?
 - Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

495
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,180
Is this simply a missing person?

496
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,590
There were blood and footprints of a North Korean soldier found near the site of the accident.

497
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,850
We can't rule out North Korea's interference in this.

498
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,550
Our mission is to find the missing person as soon as possible.

499
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,970
- Is that understood? 
 - Yes, sir!

500
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,380
There is a risk of rabies throughout the DMZ. Be careful.

501
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,700
- In formation. 
 - In formation!

502
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,810
- Enter! 
 - Enter!

503
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,120
So you were alive, Lieutenant Son?

504
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,090
I'm alive and well.

505
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:47,660
Let's talk after the mission.

506
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,750
I have nothing to say to a traitor.

507
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,430
Traitor? Hey, who's the traitor here?

508
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,770
You're the traitor because you transferred first.

509
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,320
Me? When?

510
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,880
Don't you remember? That guy, that time.

511
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,090
A whole year later, nothing's changed.

512
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,770
A whole year later, you still won't explain.

513
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,220
- That guy– 
 - We're in the middle of an operation.

514
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,800
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

515
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,420
I know, Lieutenant Son Ye Rim.

516
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,220
Let go of that hand.

517
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,430
Be careful during the operation.

518
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,860
I can take care of myself, Lieutenant Son.

519
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,960
What's wrong with him?

520
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,630
It looks like a wild animal. We'll continue.

521
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,270
 Team Leader. It's this way.

522
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,160
 Found a shoe in the reed field that appears to belong to the missing soldier.

523
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,070
 We will be approaching Section 2-1 to look for the missing soldier.

524
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,470
Team Leader!

525
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,090
If there's this much blood, we need to find him quickly, Team Leader.

526
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,780
- Pigeon. This is Eagle speaking.
  - Found the shoe of the missing soldier.

527
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,620
 The reed field. We will enter to search now.

528
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,290
Come here.

529
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,360
 Emergency!

530
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,840
In Section 2-1...

531
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,590
 We detected a land mine explosion.

532
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,710
 Eagle. Looks like you're in a danger zone.

533
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,830
 Pull out quickly. Over.

534
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,270
- Movement detected at 1 o'clock (direction). 
 -  Suspicious person found.

535
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:43,130
Team Leader. Leo smells the missing soldier.

536
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,930
Leo's never been wrong. Trust me.

537
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,030
Go in, Team Leader.

538
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,820
He can't last long.

539
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,330
We will find the missing soldier and move out.

540
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,250
 Group 1, maintain the boundary.

541
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,890
Group 2 is under Lieutenant Son's command. Search the reed field with the dog.

542
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,560
 Move!

543
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,720
No, no.

544
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,760
No, no! Wait!

545
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,120
No, no, no, no!

546
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,290
No!

547
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,500
Is something wrong?

548
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,250
Looks like he is nearby.

549
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,240
Leo has never acted like this. He's too excited.

550
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,200
Leo, no!

551
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,120
Group 2, standby.

552
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,890
Leo! Wait!

553
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,640
Leo! Leo!

554
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,610
Stop.

555
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,480
If you move, I'll shoot.

556
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,200
What was that just now?

557
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,370
I don't know.

558
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:56,840
Team Leader. Team Leader!

559
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,050
Team Leader! Team Leader!

560
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,080
Four o'clock!

561
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,330
Lieutenant.

562
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,630
A suspected enemy is on the run at 1 o'clock.

563
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,770
Keep your guard up and continue searching for the missing soldier.

564
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,950
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

565
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,660
Leo, heel!

566
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,440
Heel.

567
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,050
Search.

568
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,490
Good boy.

569
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,040
 Come here.

570
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,660
Come here.

571
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,570
Good boy.

572
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,870
Attention.

573
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,720
Salute.

574
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:48,120
But did you see his neck wound?

575
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,850
It looks strange for a wild animal.

576
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,020
And on top of that, there's no sign of struggle.

577
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,490
Our communication with Group 1 has been cut off for now.

578
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,920
So I'll go to report to Group 1's Team Leader directly.

579
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,430
Group 2, until we get reinforcements,

580
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:06,040
maintain your position. Understood?

581
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,520
I'll come with you.

582
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,680
No. Sergeant Yong, stay with the private and secure the area.

583
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,320
Be careful.

584
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,050
What is that?

585
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,090
 Two o'clock.

586
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,650
Team Leader. We found Corporal Oh,

587
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:08,830
but he was already deceased.

588
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,470
Team Leader, the wild dogs are right ahead.

589
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,320
Are you sure those are dogs?

590
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,480
There are too many.

591
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,660
Leo!

592
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,170
What's wrong?

593
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,970
Is something there?

594
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:36,510
Lieutenant Son. Throw a flare at my signal.

595
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,630
- One, two. 
- Throw!

596
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,390
Fire!

597
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,640
Hey.

598
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,110
Damn.

599
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:30,960
 Land Mines

600
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:13,910

601
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:29,440
 One month prior. Sector 21

602
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,450
 Search

603
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,260
 - There's been an accident in Sector 2-1. 
 - Leo!

604
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,770
 It had to be there, of all places.

605
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,460
 The two of you saw him?

606
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,730
 You can do anything I ask of you, right?

607
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:35,640
 Mine removal?

608
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,480
 What brings you here?

609
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,030
 I'm Captain Song Min Gyu, leading the North Star Special Missions Force.

610
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,110
Something strange is happening to Corporal Oh's blood.

611
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:46,870
 Only his blood cells are changing.

612
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:50,110
 Is this related to the person who was found near him?
