 This drama is a work of fiction, and the related characters, names, agencies, groups, and situations have no correlation to the real world.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,830
 All scenes with animals were filmed safely with the help of experts.

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,730
Hurry!

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,530
Hurry and finish this!

11
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,660
Maek, go outside.

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,920
We're battling with the North.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,550
Be careful.

14
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,470
Stop shooting. Stop shooting.

15
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,410
 First floor. Domination complete.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,050
Put your gun down.

17
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,900
What?

18
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,990
Put your gun down!

19
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,720
Who are those people?

20
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,320
They are support troops who have the same goal we do.

21
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,460
The situation was urgent, so I requested them to come.

22
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,360
Wasn't this operation just for our team?

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,550
You never told us about additional members.

24
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,560
It's the Team Leader's judgment.

25
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,310
Do you have a problem with that?

26
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,570
How will you report this combat situation?

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,730
While carrying out duties as usual in the demilitarized zone,

28
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,970
when faced an unforeseen encounter,

29
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,510
our opponent can be eliminated according to the rules of combat.

30
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,780
Is that enough?

31
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,320
First, process the situation here quickly,

32
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,190
and begin pursuing the target along with the new members of our team.

33
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,230

 Final Episode

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,870
I will install the explosives in Basement Section 1 with Sergeant First Class Park, and the rest of you install explosives in the basement passageway.

37
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,290
Any questions?

38
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,400
Destroying the building was not part of our original plan.

39
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,060
What evidence justifies our installing explosives?

40
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,870
It's for just in case.

41
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,350
Did you obtain the item?

42
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,120
Hello? Is anyone there?

43
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,620
Please help me!

44
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,830
The North Korean soldiers were looking for the same substance.

45
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,700
The same substance?

46
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,880
 In 1997, the central agency was planning to do a grand thing for the cause,

47
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,560
 but a married couple of researchers took the key material and deserted the army. That is all I know.

48
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,210
 And he said that they took that thing and disappeared in here.

49
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,880
In 1997, they were doing nuclear testing in the North.

50
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,750
A married couple who were commissioned officers tried to defect to the South and brought the raw materials with them.

51
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,870
And they went missing, right in this area.

52
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,230
What?

53
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,540
Everyone is gathered here because they are looking for those raw materials.

54
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,210
And the combat a short while ago was because of that, too.

55
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,430
The 1997 DMZ incident in Sector 21

56
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,690
is definitely related to this.

57
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,370
Is this the right place?

58
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,860
What are you doing?

59
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,580
It has to be here, but why isn't it?

60
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,310
I will report the current situation by radio.

61
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,500
 The target definitely took it.

62
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,140
The Landmine Removal Team is in danger.

63
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,310
- I request an emergency radio message from HQ.
 - Are you alright?

64
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,170
I told you, please send them an emergency radio message from HQ!

65
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,640
Everyone in HQ was just deployed on a mission.

66
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,090
What? So they can't be contacted by radio?

67
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, all radio signals are blocked until midnight tonight because it's an emergency operation.

68
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,590
Does that make any sense?

69
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,300
We have to obey the command. All communication is blocked in this entire area.

70
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,210
Please listen to me. Assemblyman Lee Hyeok got a Special Mission Force...

71
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,310
they are soldiers disguised as a Special Mission Force.

72
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,430
We're sorry but this is an emergency operation, so we must forbid communication with civilians.

73
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,700
We will accompany you to your home.

74
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,030
No, I'll go by myself.

75
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,280
I'll go home now.

76
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,060
 Notice: 
 Telephone Service is Not Available in this Area

77
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,890
They blocked communication all the way here?

78
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,640
I found out. That guy has it.

79
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,530
The host target. We have to catch him alive.

80
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,030
So what about it?

81
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,300
What is your true reason for installing explosives?

82
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,040
All those explosives indicate that you want everyone in here to die.

83
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,910
Let me make my report, first.

84
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,300
The host target has the item.

85
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,340
What? Does that make sense?

86
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,020
And so?

87
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,420
Captain Song requested that the mission be changed from eliminating the target to capturing it alive.

88
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,230
Tell him to keep him tied up until I arrive.

89
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,340
And the rest... bury them.

90
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,200
I understand.

91
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,120
 Begin the elimination mission. Repeat.

92
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,500
 Begin the elimination mission. Repeat. Begin the elimination mission. Repeat.

93
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,350
 Confirmed.

94
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,490
What are you bastards doing?

95
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,010
This is different from what we previously talked about.

96
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,080
Landmine Removal Team! Landmine Removal Team! Please respond, Landmine Removal Team.

97
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,600
Sergeant Yong! Lieutenant Son Ye Rim! Please respond, I am Soo Yeong's mom.

98
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,980
Landmine Removal Team, please respond. Those in black uniforms can be considered the enemy.

99
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,610
Those in black uniforms can be considered the enemy. Please respond.

100
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,560
All this is for the Great Cause.

101
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,820
If you are acting on trivial emotions, you may not be exempted.

102
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,250
Landmine Removal Team, please respond. Those in black uniforms can be considered the enemy.

103
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,120
Those in black uniforms can be considered the enemy.

104
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,840
Please respond, Landmine Removal Team.

105
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,570
 Begin the elimination mission.

106
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,110
 Sergeant Yong! I am Soo Yeong's mom. Can you hear me?

107
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,320
 Those in black uniform with tattoos, regard them as the enemy.

108
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,440
 Those in black uniform with tattoos, regard them as the enemy. Respond, Sergeant Yong.

109
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,610
 Lieutenant Son!

110
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,520
Sergeant First Class Park!

111
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,860
Go inside.

112
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,850
Are you all right?

113
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,050
Who are those bastards?

114
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,740
Definitely not friendly forces, and they are not regular soldiers.

115
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,400
- Then?
 - I think they are mercenaries disguised as Special Mission Forces.

116
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,210
Then Team Leader? Is he on their side?

117
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,440
I'm not sure.

118
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,750
Take the lead.

119
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,480
Let's move him in there for now.

120
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,100
Sergeant First Class Park, please endure it just a little while longer.

121
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,660
We will leave here together, no matter what, so please don't worry.

122
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,090
I'll inspect the basement areas.

123
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,730
You confirm whether Team Leader is on their side.

124
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,510
Alright, I'll do whatever I can here.

125
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,290
Ye Rim, be careful.

126
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,690
Trying to stall for time will be useless.

127
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,790
This building has chambers, so it's difficult to find the right passage.

128
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,610
I think it will be faster if we split up into two groups.

129
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,260
Those in black uniform with tattoos, regard them as the enemy.

130
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,190
Those in black uniform with tattoos, regard them as the enemy.

131
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,530
Landmine Removal Team! Landmine Removal Team?

132
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,770
 First Lieutenant Son Ye Rim

133
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,060
Didn't you install explosives behind here?

134
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,990
What's with you guys? Are you suspecting me now?

135
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,290
Shoot!

136
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,890
Drop your gun. Against the wall.

137
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,460
Captain.

138
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,500
Captain.

139
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,470
Captain.

140
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,830
We are going to split up now.

141
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,820
You will leave here alive.

142
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,380
And I'm going to find the item I'm looking for, then leave.

143
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,610
What are you doing?

144
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,070
You will die if you do that.

145
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,780
You and I are traveling on different paths.

146
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,330
Ye Rim.

147
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,640
Drop your gun!

148
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,920
If you disobey, we will shoot.

149
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,120
I will count to three.

150
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,900
One.

151
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,460
Two!

152
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,280
Let go, s**t!

153
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,040
How nice to meet you, Yong Dong Jin.

154
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,110
No, aren't you Jo Dong Jin?

155
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,220
You bastard!

156
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,740
You impudent bastard.

157
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,230
So you don't know what situation you're in, do you?

158
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,400
Why did you do that?

159
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,960
Why did you do that, I asked you!

160
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,540
What? What do you mean?

161
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,630
Why did you shoot my father?

162
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,910
 This is Owl, Owl.

163
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,700
You can't understand when I speak to you nicely. You're just like your daddy.

164
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,050
Shut up, you bastard!

165
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,910
Ah, s**t.

166
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,450
What are you doing?

167
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,770
Pull the trigger.

168
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,700
Stop!

169
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,820
Don't do it.

170
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,290
- Why are you here?
 - Release these two people.

171
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,690
- You have lost your mind.
 - Untie them!

172
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,950
If you come a step closer, this bastard dies.

173
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,230
Everyone drop your guns if you want to leave here alive.

174
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,340
What are you doing, you bastard?

175
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,560
Please stop now!

176
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,120
Why?

177
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,360
Joon Seong.

178
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,810
 My son, you're amazing. You should earn a star in your dad's stead.

179
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,310
Lieutenant Lee.

180
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,530
When I saw the video,

181
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,270
I should have told you earlier.

182
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,670
I'm sincerely sorry.

183
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:25,920
I sincerely apologize.

184
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,490
Why?

185
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,190
Why... Joon Seong?

186
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,520
Why did you...?

187
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,880
Why?

188
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,990
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!

189
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,490
You!

190
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,320
Who are you?

191
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,190
Are you...?

192
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,480
 Hyeok, you should have stayed in headquarters.

193
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,100
 Why did you come to the rough frontier just to suffer?

194
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,640
 I already know that much without taking over, Jo Min Gook.

195
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,250
Jo Min Gook?

196
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,450
Hey, what did you just do? Huh?

197
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,800
No.

198
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,180
This is Owl, Owl.

199
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,520
Does this make any sense?

200
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,060
Hey,  you bastard.

201
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,080
If you're going to kill me, do it quick, you bastard!

202
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,920
Are you alright?

203
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,760
I'm fine, it just grazed me.

204
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,390
Wait just a moment.

205
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,140
Father.

206
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,550
 My son. What's wrong?

207
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,630
 I think Choco hates me.

208
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:37,600
 What? No way. Because you're scared of him, Dong Jin,

209
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,720
 Choco is scared, too.

210
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,670
 Animals are just like humans.

211
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,690
 They like people who are good to them.

212
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,510
 I want to be good to him.

213
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:53,030
 Show that heart to him with your movements.

214
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:59,400
 Here, hold this and hold out your hand to Choco slowly.

215
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,810
 Want to try playing with Choco?

216
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,420
 Take this, and try running over there. Go.

217
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,010
 My son, I have to go to a nighttime military operation.

218
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,140
 Next time, I promise to play with you all day long.

219
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,280
 Even if Dad isn't here, he's always watching you, Dong Jin. You know that, don't you?

220
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,150
 What did Dad say?

221
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,800
 Come here.

222
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:39,200
Why did we finally meet, like this?

223
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:06,510
Do you remember this picture? It's Ms. Hee Ra.

224
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,090
No, I won't accept this.

225
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,660
Please leave this place with me.

226
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,960
Let's go home together, please?

227
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,580
Please come home with me.

228
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,120
When you come home,

229
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,580
your wife,

230
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,530
your beloved Ms. Hee Ra is waiting.

231
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,980
Dong Jin.

232
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,780
Sergeant First Class.

233
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,240
No.

234
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,790
Are you alright?

235
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,930
Heel. Heel.

236
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:09,880
It's alright, it's alright.

237
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,750
Let's go.

238
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,620
 First Lieutenant Son Ye Rim&gt;/i&gt;

239
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,100
First Lieutenant Son, this is Kim Da Jeong. Are you all right? Are you safe?

240
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,670
 Yes, I am safe.

241
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,740
What a relief. That is such a relief.

242
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,670
Are you alright?

243
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,150
Oh, what to do?

244
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,490
How can this happen?

245
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,020
Do you know how worried I was?

246
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,700
Thank you for your radio communication.

247
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,420
You're all right, aren't you?

248
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,470
Thank you, Seonbae.

249
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,500
Oh no, Sergeant First Class Park.

250
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,630
Over here!

251
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,850
Please endure for just a little bit.

252
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,000
 Yesterday, there was an earth tremor in the demilitarized zone.

253
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,510
 Many people were concerned about it.

254
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,850
 However, no more aftershocks have been detected.

255
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,270
 We have clear weather today, perfect for an outing.

256
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,600
 But please be cautious of temperature changes.

257
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,300
 It's been ten days since Assemblyman Lee Hyeok has disappeared.

258
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,830
 The police have determined that they will begin investigating this as a missing person case.

259
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,250
 In other news, the surviving family members of the 1997 incident at Sector 21

260
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,110
 have requested a complete reinvestigation from the government.

261
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:15,330
 The government and military personnel, along with the disappearance of Assemblyman Lee Hyeok,

262
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:20,160
 have decided to completely reinvestigate the 1997 incident at Sector 21.

263
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,200
 The origin and content of the video that serves as the conclusive evidence,

264
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,620
 they will investigate after confirming it thoroughly.

265
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:33,960
We tried to catch the host target alive but failed due to the explosion.

266
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,720
Deceased Corporal Oh and the North Korean soldier target

267
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,800
both had bite marks from the mutated wild dogs.

268
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,460
Autopsies were performed on both and examined in detail.

269
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,860
But due to the failure of the mission, we couldn't find the origin.

270
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,920
Thank you for your final testimony.

271
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,840
You can leave now.

 Captain Jo Min Gook, who died while on duty during the reconnaissance mission that day,

 was promoted one rank posthumously.

 Lee Hyeok, who was once considered a strong candidate for the presidency is still missing—

00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,320
Yes.

286
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,970
I have to go to work to properly tell the truth.

287
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,580

Hello.

302
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,250
Please give me your Citizen I.D.

303

- Mr. Jo Dong Jin?
 - Yes.

307
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,850
The subject of your request is your father, Mr. Jo Min Gook, is that correct?

308
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,920
Yes, that's correct.

309
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,150
We've finished this step of the process. I'll contact you again.

We will enjoy it.

Oh, right. What about the wedding invitation?

317
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,720
I'll send it to your phone.

318
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,220
You're coming to, aren't you, Lieutenant Son?

319
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,730
Of course. And we're going to see each other every day, anyway.

320
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:11,960
It would have been nice if Team Leader and Assistant Team Leader were here with us today.

321
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,870
I know. Team Leader took such good care of me.

322
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,310
Oh come on, let's not talk about that on such a nice day.

323
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Anyway, Sergeant Yong, congratulations on your discharge.

324
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,930
Thank you.

325
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,630
Staff Sergeant Joo, eat well if you're going to keep working hard in the military.

326
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,470
Yes, Hyeong.

327
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,520
Wow, he calls me Hyeong now.

328
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,250
He does.

329
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:41,560
Just call him Hyeong comfortably. It's not hard.

330
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,920
Yes, I will call you Hyeong from now on.

331
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,960
I was really joking.

332
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,150
Please eat a lot, Staff Sergeant Joo.

333
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,870
Yes, Sergeant Yong.

334
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,560
Ah, right, also,

335
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,520
I forgot to tell you about our member of the Reserve Forces.

336
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,870
Hold on.

337
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,860
Maek, heel, heel.

338
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,020
Good girl.

339
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,240
What? How did that happen?

340
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,350
As my reward, she was also discharged.

341
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,960
Maek worked hard, too.

342
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,220
Not that hard.

343
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,020
Now she's working with me again.

344
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,600
Anyway, it's time for her to come, but she's not here yet.

345
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,180
Hello.

346
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,220
Seonbae.

347
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,070
You've come.

348
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,970
- Has everyone been well?
 - Yes.

349
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,950
Soo Yeong, come sit here.

350
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:32,020
Soo Yeong, how did you get so pretty, huh?

351
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,730
Lieutenant Son, you were so helpful with her treatment.

352
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,590
- Thank you.
 - You're welcome.

353
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,990
Ta-da.

354
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,700
What? Another one for Eonni?

355
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,980
No, sorry.

356
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,000
Here.

357
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,330
Are you giving that to me?

358
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,750
I'm so grateful. But I don't have a gift for you.

359
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,900
It's alright. Oppa, you just have to visit our village often.

360
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,100
Okay, I will.

361
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,090
Here, please eat

362
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,090
- while you guys talk.
 - We will enjoy the food.

363
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,300
We will enjoy the food.

364
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,950
Try it.

365
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,630
Wow, your cooking is great, just like we've heard.

366
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,600
Did my Dong Jin tell you that?

367
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,370
Yes, I bragged about my mom a bit.

368
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,710
Good job, eat up.

369
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,380
- We will enjoy it.
 - Please eat a lot.

370
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,290
Soo Yeong, you eat, too.

371
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,230
Try this.

372
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,620
Are you giving this to Mom?

373
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,150
This is tasty, why are you eating that, Ye Rim?

374
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,580
You should eat this.

375
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,500
It tastes great.

376
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,730
Come on, try it. Just a bite.

377
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,670
Stop it.

378
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,960
- This is the best, I told you.

379
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,970
It tastes good.

380
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,460
Yes, we will enjoy it.

381
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,820
Thank you.

382
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,760
 Yong Hee Ra Hangover Soup

383
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,280
You don't have to worry too much about Soo Yeong anymore.

384
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,280
The building collapsed, so there shouldn't be any more effects.

385
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,660
So radiation leaked from that building

386
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,630
and affected a few people in our village?

387
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:55,870
Yes.

388
00:50:55,870 --> 00:51:01,600
The CBR examined it and detected no radiation.

389
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,390
That is a relief.

390
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:07,430
But how did that happen?

391
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,730
In 1997, a commissioned officer from North Korea

392
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,830
was exposed to the radiation and hid in that building.

393
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:18,660
And he went through a mutation that also exposed Captain Jo Min Gook.

394
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,810
And wild dogs that went into the building were infected by Captain Jo.

395
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,570
And those wild dogs infected the North Korean soldier and Corporal Oh.

396
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,300
That is why the Landmine Removal Team was deployed.

397
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,830
So now there are definitely no more problems?

398
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:55,140
Yes, Cheongong-ri is now safe.

399
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,530
Mom.

400
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,620
Yes, Soo Yeong?

401
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,260
- Did you look for me?
 - Yes.

402
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,760
You should have been eating.

403
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,170
What is it?

404
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:10,660
I came looking for you because you weren't coming.

405
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,470
My Soo Yeong looks so pretty today.

412
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,870
 Please take good care of her.

413
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,980
 My wife and child who were on the boat?

414
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,400
 Why were you there?

415
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,070
 Your baby is probably alive.

419
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:03,180
No, it's alright. I don't have any memory of them.

420
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,330
Lieutenant.

421
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,840
This baby, please... so no one ever knows.

422
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,400
This child's name is Ye Rim.

425
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:41,360
 go to the South and be happy.

 What? They called Maek?

429
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,180
 Sergeant Yong, you've worked with Maek before.

430
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,890
 How can you call a dog that's retired?

431
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,080
 How old is she?

432
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,270
 She is seven years old.

433
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,150
 She's a bit old, so this should be her last mission.

434
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,600
 What will you do after you are discharged?

435
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,160
I've arranged to work at a wildlife rescue center.

436
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,050
Oh, nice plan. Your mother must be happy.
