 This drama is a work of fiction, and the related characters, names, agencies, groups, and situations have no correlation to the real world.

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,590
 This is Owl. Incident in sector two-one. Requesting backup.

10
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,320
She can't have gone far.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,400
- Find her!
 - Today is May 25th, 1997, 9:30 am.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,060
We'll begin transferring the defector to South Korea.

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,820
No!

 23 years later

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,430
 A private went missing at the GP (Guard Post).

16
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,740
 They say it seems like a wild animal.

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,750
 Investigate to make sure the animals in the DMZ aren't infected with rabies.

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,120
 Why all of a sudden another company's operations?

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,270
 If you go, I'll grant you special leave.

20
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,690
 Leo will get a special meal. I'll take care of the others too.

21
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,970
 It's an honor to carry out a mission with the search party. Let's—

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,010
 Let's talk after the operation.

23
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,710
 I have nothing to say to a traitor.

24
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,680
 Movement detected at one o'clock.

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,660
 Team Leader. Leo smells the missing private.

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,240
 If you move, we shoot.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,170
 - What was that just now? 
 - I don't know.

28
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,350
 Did you see the wound on his neck?

29
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,000
 I'll go to report to Group 1's Team Leader directly.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,980
 Episode 2

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,260

32
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,130
What's that?

33
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,780
 Two o'clock.

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,380
- Are you sure those are dogs?
 - There are too many of them.

35
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,500
Leo!

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,670
What's wrong? Is something there?

37
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,800
Lieutenant Son. Do you see those dogs?

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,260
Signs of rabies detected.

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,840
If we're bitten or come into close contact, we're exposed to the virus.

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,070
This situation calls for gun use.

41
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,290
Lieutenant Son. Throw a flare at my signal.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,150
One. Two!

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,570
Throw!

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,200
Team Leader! They're in range!

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,840
Fire!

46
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,670
No!

47
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,720
No! Leo!

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,880
Shit.

50
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,540
Leo! Leo!

51
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,440
Wait.

52
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,000
Leo, get up. Hyung is here.

53
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,050
Leo, get up!

54
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,550
Leo!

55
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,900
Team Leader! Team Leader...

56
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,230
Leo isn't breathing.

57
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,680
Leo... Leo isn't...

58
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,670
Please! Somebody answer, please.

59
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,200
Leo...

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,350
Team Leader!

61
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,350
No!

62
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,670
He's not breathing.

63
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,670
Leo!

64
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,470
Get him to the radiologist examiner's office.

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,490

Do it quickly.

Alright, alright.

Oh, Assemblymen, please don't overreact.

Someone might think we planned this out.

88
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,820
Alright. Politics lately is pathetic, right?

89
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,020
Always punching and fighting.

90
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,280
Now, the times have changed.

91
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,520
It's a time where even if we all work together, we can barely make it.

92
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,830
Isn't that right?

93
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,900
That's right.

94
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,640
I, Lee Hyeok, am a person who can end these pathetic fights.

95
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,810
I can achieve national unity.

96
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,560
- Who?
 - Lee Hyeok!

97
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,120
Yes. It's me, Lee Hyeok!

98

Lee Hyeok! Lee Hyeok! Lee Hyeok!

99
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Just a minute!

100
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
Assemblyman Lee Hyeok, I'm Reporter Kim Yu Ho from the Sound of Democracy.

101
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,440
There are people who demand the truth about the DMZ incident in '97 and North Korea's involvement,

102
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,090
so shouldn't you explain that before you run for president?

103
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,240
Alright. Calm down.

104
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,590
You said you were Reporter Kim Yu Ho?

105
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,110
- Yes.
 - Reporter.

106
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,000
Fake news is so prominent these days.

107
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,810
Reporter, you're not one of those people, are you?

108
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,040
Clarification of the truth of that incident.

109
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,540
Of course, I must provide that.

110
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,190
Yes. I will show you the truth.

111
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,730
This right here is the proof of that incident.

112
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,470
That day, all I lost was my leg.

113
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,990
But I also lost

114
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,950
my fellow soldiers.

115
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,360
My comrades in arms, who were like my family!

116
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,080
Truth?

117
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,090
That is the truth.

118
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,260
 Hyeok, you should have stayed at HQ.

119
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,080
 Why come all the way here to suffer at the battlefront?

120
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,010
 Are you sure she's a defector? Not an armed communist guerrilla?

121
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,970
Those dead soldiers were somebody's son,

122
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,390
somebody's husband, somebody's father!

123
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,600
Please do not insult

124
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,340
my deceased fellow soldiers with fake news anymore.

125
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,670
I lost my leg.

126
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,930
I lost my leg, but I'm proud of it!

127
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,240
Lee Hyeok! Lee Hyeok!

128
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,810
Lee Hyeok! Lee Hyeok! Lee Hyeok!

129
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:28,080
Lee Hyeok! Lee Hyeok!

130
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,840
Who's this?

131
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,870
Commander Han Dae Sik.

132
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,430
Long time no talk.

133
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,540
So what's going on, calling me all of a sudden?

134
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,280
Sector two-one?

135
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,780
It's okay.

136
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,620
It's okay. It's okay.

137
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,700
It's okay.

138
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,200
Hi!

139
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,750
Good dog. Stand. Good!

140
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,460
Good!

141
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,060
Good! Good.

142
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,480
 Leo! Okay, okay.

143
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,540
 Leo! That's right.

144
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,430
 Do you like that?

145
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,730
 Leo!

146
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,460
 Damn.

147
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,480
 Armed Forces Genetic Defense Command

148
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,420
Good work, Lieutenant Son.

149
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,130
We'll have to do an autopsy to be sure,

150
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,600
but currently, I assume it's shock due to excessive bleeding.

151
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,540
- Is there no relation to rabies? 
- Rabies?

152
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:04,230
The dogs killed in the operation had enough visible symptoms of rabies that they could be detected by the naked eye.

153
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,270
These are photos of the dogs.

154
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,510
Look at the blisters. Corporal Oh had the same marks.

155
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,440
If it's rabies, we can only know for sure after three weeks.

156
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,160
His wound was recent.

157
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,260
Have you seen anything like this before?

158
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,110
This appears to be excessive force.

159
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,850
Even to my eyes, it doesn't look natural.

160
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,080
Even just with blood and blister samples, can't you see that this could be a new type of rabies?

161
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,470
Maybe it's something that hasn't been reported yet.

162
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,300
Well, we can't rule that out.

163
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,140
I'll have to some more research.

164
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,780
- We'll look into it further.
 - Yes.

165
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,230
I think we need to quarantine the villages surrounding the GPs.

166
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,540
When we finish the report, I'm sure orders will come down.

167
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,140
Just in case Corporal Oh's attacker also had rabies,

168
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,230
we need to catch him quickly to prevent the spread of the virus.

169
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,390
- I need to go get questioned.
 - What?

170
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,130
It's simple. If something shows up, contact me.

171
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,570
Don't worry too much.

172
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,250
You see, animals,

173
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,140
just like humans, they like people who are good to them.

174
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,540
"I won't hurt you."

175
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,550
Show that through your actions, and approach them slowly

176
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,380
and they will lower their guard.

177
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,080
Byeok Joon! When you're the dog handler, remember that.

178
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,280
I'm sorry, Leo.

179
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,840
Unity!

180
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,150
- Unity.
 - Unity.

181
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,340
What will happen to Leo?

182
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,150
Military dogs. Do you hold funerals for them?

183
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,560
You're not in a position to worry about military dogs.

184
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,210
- If you step out of line, you could get thrown into military prison.
 - What?

185
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,900
Why? What did I do?

186
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,670
Sit down.

187
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,560
Please tell me.

188
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,340
My only crime was working my butt off during my one year and eight months in the military.

189
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,070
It wouldn't be enough to grant me special leave. Why would I get sent to prison?

190
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,120
Look at this guy.

191
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,940
I'm scheduled for discharge next week.

192
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,490
Please send me back to my unit.

193
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,880
Discharge? Are you dreaming?

194
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,850
Do you want me to tell you why must be put on trial?

195
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,760
Yes. Please tell me in detail.

196
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,560
Listen carefully so you don't stutter in front of a judge.

197
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,930
You said the team leader ordered you to stay in your position.

198
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,590
And why did you neglect the dog?

199
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,580
Loss of critical supplies due to your careless management. If we were at war, you could be executed for that.

200
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,470
What did you just say?

201
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,060
Careless management of  military supplies?  Supplies?

202
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,440
What the f*ck? He was a living thing.

203
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,570
- What? F*ck?
 - Yes. F*ck.

204
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,380
How dare you? Do you know where you are?

205
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,340
If you went on an operation that wasn't even planned right before discharge and risked your life,

206
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:04,440
and you lost one of your brothers and were told to go to the slammer instead of going on leave, would you quietly go?

207
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,500
This is absolute f*ckery.

208
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,410
I'm going to post this on the internet.

209
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,010
All kids these days use the internet as a threat.

210
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,640
Did your father teach you that?

211
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,840
I don't have a father.

212
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,100
My mother raised me.

213
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,600
So what?

214
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,910
Whatever.

215
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,750
Sign your name here and wait outside.

216
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,260
How old am I? You're still mentioning my parents.

217
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,310
 - You're just acting up because you're getting discharged soon, huh?
 - No, it's because I did nothing wrong!

218
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,160
 Keep thinking about whether you really did nothing wrong.

219
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,710
I'm busy.

220
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,300
How can you just leave? Huh?

221
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,730
Where were you at the time of the incident?

222
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,800
I was at a high-level military event.

223
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,890
You must have been briefed before the event.

224
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,650
I was.

225
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,830
But you just showed up?

226
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,130
It was an important event related to my promotion.

227
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,730
Why are you so confident, anyway?

228
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,200
You shouldn't be worried about a promotion. You could be dismissed.

229
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,820
I'm just telling you the truth because I don't have confidence in anything.

230
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,520
- What?
 - Drink up. I asked for it specifically for you.

231
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,340
Soldiers close to discharge only drink iced Americanos.

232
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,630
Then don't drink it.

233
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,980
I could hear you shouting from outside.

234
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,650
Are you mad because you might go to prison?

235
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,770
You usually just smile and laugh at anything.

236
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,000
He called Leo "military supplies."

237
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,730
But am I really going to prison?

238
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,070
They probably won't go that far.

239
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,160
If I go to prison, Miss Hee Ra (his mom) will faint from shock.

240
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,320
Is your mother well?

241
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,230
Yep, she's fine.

242
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,300
She asks me how you're doing sometimes.

243
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
Tell her that I'm doing fine.

244
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,380
Okay.

245
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,850
Hey. Did you come because you knew I was in the search party unit?

246
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,500
Is this the time for that?

247
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,080
No, so is it a coincidence?

248
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,290
It's a coincidence. I would have avoided you if I'd known

249
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,920
Wow. You really didn't know I was in the search party unit?

250
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,380
Well. You've never visited me, so that could happen.

251
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,000
You told me not to visit you.

252
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,770
So you really didn't come? Not even once?

253
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,350
That was when you began to betray me, huh?

254
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,860
I'm leaving.

255
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,430
Hey! Why do you always

256
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,870
avoiding finishing a conversation? That habit of yours.

257
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,320
I tried to speak. You didn't listen.

258
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,870
Okay, I'll listen now. Tell me.

259
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,210
Don't try to make up for it now.

260
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,570
But I'm curious to know why I was dumped.

261
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,270
Let's stop. I don't want to repeat that again.

262
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,130
Wait...

263
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,800
I told you I'd listen!

264
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,880
 Military Police

265
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,490
Yes, Director Moon.

266
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,700
The first blood sample you gave me,

267
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,970
Corporal Oh's blood, is doing something strange.

268
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,620
I'll send you a video.

269
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,220
Okay.

270
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,600
Yes.

271
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,370
It's changing.

272
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,960
That's what it looks like. But I've never seen anything like this before.

273
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,180
Me neither. Can rabies do this?

274
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,020
What about Private Kwon's blood, or the blood of the wild dogs?

275
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,870
There's nothing different about it. I'll keep watching over it and call you again.

276
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,520
Yes, thank you.

277
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,510
Wait here. In two days, you'll go to the High Military Court.

278
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,390
What will happen to me?

279
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,790
I haven't received any other orders.

280
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,410
And what's that ajussi's crime?

281
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,250
If it's the High Military Court, that means he's been accused of a brutal crime.

282
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,940
Please move me to another room.

283
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,420
Just wait here.

284
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,000
What?

285
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,820
The door—

286
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,530
Ajussi. I'm in a bad mood, so don't pick a fight with me.

287
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,890
Why is everybody like this to me today?

288
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,240
Just be quiet while you are here.

289
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,280
Looks like you're in a bad situation.

290
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:16,610
Let's do that. I like being quiet.

291
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,600
 Armed Forces Command

292
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,370
 Classified Document

293
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,530
 Classified Document

294
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,310
 Two major unsolved murder cases in South Korea...

295
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,670
Come over here.

296
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,080
Long time no see.

297
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,400
There's been an incident in Sector two-one.

298
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,070
What's so urgent?

299
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,830
It's been so long since we met. Let's have some soup and rice with soju.

300
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,050
This restaurant hasn't changed a bit even after decades have passed.

301
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,260
Do you remember this place? When we were on duty together?

302
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,220
Soup and rice isn't what is important right now.

303
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,630
Sit down, sit down. Let's eat together.

304
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,460
How are the wife and kids?

305
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,460
They're doing fine.

306
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,790
How old was your son?

307
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,620
He was a lot younger than mine.

308
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,450
I don't have a son. I have two daughters.

309
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,820
That's right, that's right. Daughters. Yes, daughters are wonderful.

310
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,760
Hey! I guess it really has been a long time.

311
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,930
Alright. So what's all the fuss about?

312
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,270
It's Sector two-one.

313
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,270
I've heard about this.

314
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,810
It happened there, of all places.

315
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,990
So? What does that matter?

316
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,980
What about that place? Why?

317
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,700
 Owl! Owl!

318
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,950
 Sergeant Kim! Sergeant Kim! Please, Sergeant Kim!

319
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,440
 Owl!

320
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,520
 What are you doing?

321
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,610
 You, me, and all the survivors here will face heavy punishment.

322
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,630
 Our lives are over. We'll be stripped of our uniforms and be dishonorably discharged.

323
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,890
 For DMZ operations, if we follow guidebook for rules of battle...

324
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,290
  Lieutenant Han is right.

325
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,500
 Sergeant Kim!

326
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,320
 Lieutenant Han! Lieutenant Han!

327
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,810
 Lieutenant Han!

328
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:23,250
Here we go. Let's have a drink and relax a bit.

329
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,580
Isn't the important thing to resolve this incident?

330
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,490
Your timid personality is the same as always.

331
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,460
You've aged more than enough. You should become more mature.

332
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,670
All this fuss because of Sector two-one?

333
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,940
Dae Sik. Do you still go to the psychiatrist?

334
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,290
It's been a while since I stopped taking meds.

335
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,690
Take them if you need to.

336
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:19,460
Wait. If it's Sector two-one, that's where the VIP event is happening.

337
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,980
I'll have to get involved.

338
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,120
Keep me updated, Commander Han.

339
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,990
 Did you see the wound on his neck earlier?

340
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,490
 It's certain that Corporal Oh's wounds are from the dogs.

341
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,860
 If the dogs and Corporal Oh have similar blisters,

342
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,960
 is it a strain that allows the virus to be transferred to humans?

343
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,890
 That person also

344
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,350
 appears to be related to all this somehow.

345
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,390
 Armed Forces CBR Defense Command

346
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,740
Unity! Lieutenant Son Ye Rim.

347
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,620
Yes, Commander.

348
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,290
Yes, I understand.

349
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,180
 Military Police

350
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,190
Wow, seriously.

351
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,380
I nearly died because of that crazy guy.

352
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,840
Am I not returning to base?

353
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,430
Wait—

354
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,240
Where am I going?

355
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,410
- Put him in.
- Wait, wait wait! Why?

356
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,340
Why? Give me some explanation!

357
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,750
Why did you come here?

358
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,410
Congratulations. Looks like you avoided jail.

359
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,890
We need to report directly to the commander.

360
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,030
The commander?

361
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,800
The chairman of the National Defense Committee is here too, so explain yourself well.

362
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,140
What? Who?

363
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:03,370
If Miss Hee Ra knew, she'd call it the honor of a lifetime.

364
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,680
Unity!

365
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,370
 General Han Dae Sik

366
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,000
Attention! Salute!

367
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,780
Unity!

368
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,680
Unity.

369
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,220
I'm Lieutenant Son Ye Rim of the CBR Capture Team.

370
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,080
I will report on the situation.

371
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,670
So the two of you saw him?

372
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,220
Yes, sir!

373
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,970
They brought the cameras that were attached to their military vests.

374
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,130
We'll take a look.

375
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,230
This video was caught on the camera just outside the 329th GP.

376
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,290
What's that?

377
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,840
We weren't sure until now, but

378
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,270
as you can see, in Sector two-one of the DMZ,

379
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,890
an unidentified person was spotted walking around.

380
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,080
Now, let's take a look at the action cameras attached to the military vests.

381
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,060
The military dog detected something and ran after it.

382
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,610
It looks like he ran into the unidentified person and was attacked.

383
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,720
Then he threw the dog into the mine field

384
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,780
and caused it to explode.

385
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,230
We should push the DMZ event back

386
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,530
until we catch that guy.

387
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,240
What kind of bastard is he?

388
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,640
That person,

389
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,110
if we'd caught him then, Leo might not have died.

390
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,340
I'm not sure, but it didn't feel like he was a normal person,

391
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,250
even in the video and from the feeling back then.

392
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,930
It's not your fault.

393
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,190
I'll drop you off. Get in.

394
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,170
Sector two-one.

395
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,520
Sector two-one...

396
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,390
Yes, Assemblyman.

397
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,570
It'll be best to resolve this quickly and quietly

398
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,570
so it doesn't reach the VIPs.

399
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,450
Resolve it within a week from your level.

400
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,230
 Yes, sir.

401
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,000
Do it properly, General Han.

402
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,730
Don't be afraid. Be more confident.

403
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,420
You're also a hero of this country.

404
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,880
 Dae Sik.

405
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,330
 Do you still see the psychiatrist?

406
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,020
Colonel Choi. Come into my room.

407
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,820
Is there a guy bright enough to lead a secret operation?

408
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,270
There is, but he's with the military police right now.

409
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,290
- Who is it?
 - His name is Captain Song Min Gyu.

410
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,550
Captain Song Min Gyu.

411
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,760
Do you know how worried we were when we heard you were taken to the military police?

412
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,290
We thought we'd never see you again.

413
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,460
Why would you worry? I didn't do anything wrong.

414
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,980
I thought you got in trouble!

415
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
Eat up, it's fish cake soup.

416
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,880
Your stomach needs to be full for your mind to be full too.

417
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,500
Dragon Snake. I'll find that bastard myself.

418
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,700
That's right. Who are we, anyway?

419
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,190
It's fine.

420
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,350
I'm just going to be discharged quietly.

421
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,380
Eat this.

422
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,680
This one tastes the best.

423
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,830
Eat up and be strong.

424
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,330
Bbong Rak.

425
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,150
You're the only one for me.

426
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,590
This really is delicious. You should eat too!

427
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,500
Okay, okay. You all eat too.

428
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,500
Hot!

429
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,930
Follow me, please.

430
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,540
Unity.

431
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,420
He's the commander.

432
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,810
It wasn't easy for me to ask this of him.

433
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,220
This might be your last chance,

434
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,120
so do well.

435
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,580
Thank you, Chief of Staff.

436
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,940
- Unity.
 - At ease.

437
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,680
Sit in the front.

438
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,480
I heard you were being stripped of your uniform 
 (dismissed).

439
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,320
Please save me.

440
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,660
I heard you're skilled.

441
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,400
Thank you, sir.

442
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,260
We're forming a special unit.

443
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,140
You will have to finish the mission quickly.

444
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,420
I'll make it a success no matter what.

445
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,000
Of course you will.

446
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,350
That's how you'll become a major.

447
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,990
Thank you, sir.

448
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,760
You can do anything I tell you to, right?

449
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,960
Yes, Commander.

450
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,120
I can do everything. Just say the word.

451
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,670
Their sacrifices of the past have brought us peace today.

452
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:50,200
To remember the noble spirit of sacrifice of the patriotic martyrs since 6.25 (Korean War began on 6/25/1950),

453
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,660
- 25 years ago it was built—
 - Hey, ajumma.

454
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,250
We're in a hurry. Explain it quickly.

455
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:04,380
What's this? Are you offended that hyungnim called you ahjumma?

456
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,120
- Alright, everyone—
 - Hyungnim, are you sick?

457
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,160
Why do you suddenly want be to educated about national security?

458
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,350
How could you understand my deep intent?

459
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,850
I wish she'd just explain quickly, right?

460
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,350
So, alright. Yes, yes, alright.

461
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:23,520
Of course, anyone must come here once if they're a citizen of Korea. What an amazing hyungnim.

462
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,190
Then, let's head outside!

463
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,830
Let's go outside.

464
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:35,720
What you see over there is the DMZ. The Demilitarized Zone. Across the border is North Korean land.

465
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,160
In two weeks, the South Korean president will visit here.

466
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,350
- He will be the first incumbent president to cross the GOP barrier. 
- Young lady, let's have a coffee. 
- Why are you doing this to me?

467
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,280
And the image of him spreading the word of peace—

468
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,220
  - Let's have a cup of coffee.  
- I wanted to live quietly, but this keeps getting on my nerves.

469
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,260
I'm not a bad person!

470
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,960
Hey.

471
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,990
"Hey"? Look at this ajumma and her bad manners.

472
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,870
Hey. You won't give the explanations you're supposed to give

473
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,910
but you're going to be rude to me without being afraid?

474
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:21,960
I'm tired. So look quietly, then leave, huh?

475
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,320
Hey! Ajumma!

476
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,110
You still haven't left?

477
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:40,010
I've got something to repay you for. How can I just leave?

478
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:50,550
There aren't any CCTVs here. Will you guys be okay?

479
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,110
What are you talking about?

480
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:57,470
Hey! Come here, lady. Follow me.

481
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,110
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. I said—

482
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,380
Wait, wait...

483
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:26,670
Ajumma. Ajumma, who on earth are you?

484
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,680
If you know, you'll get hurt. Take care as you leave.

485
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,360
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,850
- Are you leaving work? 
- Yeah.

487
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:53,830
Work hard!

488
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,510
Unity!

489
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,230
- Are you going somewhere? 
- Noonim!

490
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,330
The wife wanted something sweet, so I'm on the way to the market.

491
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:23,740
Must be nice. Newlyweds are all like that.

492
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,640
I'll be in trouble if I'm late, so I'll get going.

493
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,580
- Okay.
 - Take care.

494
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,970
Bye!

495
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,870
Must be heavy.

496
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,840
Su Yeong! Please stop.

497
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,470
I don't want to!

498
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,620
You can't go that far! You could get hurt.

499
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,860
Mommy's almost here.

500
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,080
I don't want to!

501
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,620
Hey!

502
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,670
Hey! You!

503
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,880
Honey! I tried to take her, but—

504
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,840
You. You didn't listen to Daddy again? Let's go.

505
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,880
I don't want to! I don't want to get a shot!

506
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,150
If you don't, you'll stay itchy! You don't like being itchy, either.

507
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,160
- I hate shots more.
 - It'll be over soon.

508
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,550
Honey. Should we have Su Yeong join track? She's super fast.

509
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,450
Should we?

510
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,800
Here. Let's go!

511
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,690
Ready, go!

512
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,810
I feel like I'm going to die.

513
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,980
C'mon. I'm going home in three weeks, what do you mean a mission?

514
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,830
I don't even have Leo. I can't.

515
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,210
Can't you just say I'm sick?

516
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,990
I never want to go there again.

517
00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:00,110
The way I see it, there's no doubt there's a soldier ghost there.

518
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:04,440
The order came down. Aren't you going to catch that guy?

519
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,790
I just want to go home in three weeks. I can't.

520
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,270
A new dog is coming.

521
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,890
How can we get to know each other and go on a mission in such a short amount of time?

522
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:19,800
Send a different dog handler.

523
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,800
What?

524
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,100
I really can't. Send me to prison instead.

525
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,980
Dragon Snake and Maek have already worked with each other.

526
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,150
How can you call in a retired dog?

527
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,880
I... I really can't go.

528
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,670
I know. I know how you feel, but...

529
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,390
an order's an order.

530
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,950
We'll have to push the DMZ event back

531
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,200
until we catch that guy.

532
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,920
Why me?

533
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Whose order is it?

534
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,690
It's the commander's order.

535
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:11,150
Just because he's a high-ranking officer, can he do this?

536
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,640
Hey. You know,

537
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,170
I'm sorry. I couldn't protect your younger brother.

538
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,210
We're going to catch that bastard, got it?

539
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,980
Look at me. You can do it, right?

540
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,450
Good dog.

541
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,990
Come on.

542
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,190
Unity!

543
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,800
I'm Sergeant Yong Dong Jin of Battalion 14 Search Party.

544
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,060
I'm a dog handler, and this is K3527 Soldier Dog, Maek.

545
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,240
I'm Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong of the 2nd Special Forces Division.

546
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,920
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin. Nice to meet you.

547
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,690
Hey. I'm Sergeant Park Gi Hyeong, a sniper in Air Force Special Unit 4.

548
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,800
Nice to meet you.

549
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:27,100
Not everybody's here yet. We can wait together.

550
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,270
Yes, sir.

551
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,990
What's his name?

552
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,780
Maek. It's Maek.

553
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,990
That's right, Maek. How old?

554
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,790
- Seven years old now.
 - Retirement age, huh?

555
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,300
Maek's old. This will probably be Maek's last mission.

556
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,200
Female or male?

557
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,190
Female.

558
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,750
She looks fierce.

559
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,420
Can I pet her?

560
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,790
Technically, no, but I'll allow it.

561
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,300
Heel! Usually, only the handler can.

562
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,060
- Then I won't touch her.
 - What?

563
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,240
You can touch her.

564
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,160
Maek, heel!

565
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,900
You can feed her this.

566
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,290
Unity.

567
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,330
I'm Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong of the 2nd Special Forces Division.

568
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,630
 Just be quiet while you're here.

569
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,400
 Looks like you're in a bad situation.

570
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,380
It's nice to meet you. Sergeant Yong.

571
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,500
A superior is calling you, why aren't you responding with name and rank?

572
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,640
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

573
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,640
I'm Captain Song Min Gyu, in charge of the North Star Special Missions Force.

574
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,360
Mine removal?

575
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,760
What does that have to do with me?

576
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,380
What brings you here?

577
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,630
You're a new face.

578
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,160
Mine removal?

579
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,940
Yes, ma'am.

580
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,450
I heard there was an accident at the GP, this must be why.

581
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,020
It couldn't have been a wild boar.

582
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,050
If you live here, you know at least that much.

583
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,550
Work hard.

584
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,370
I guess something is up.

585
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,950
 Armed Force CBR Defense Command

586
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,520
 Only Corporal Oh's cells are changing.

587
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,520
 Why?

588
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,890
 Restricted access

589
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,380
 Soldiers close to being discharged only drink iced Americanos.

590
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,410
 Then don't drink it.

591
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,740
Iced Americano. As if.

592
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,940
Corporal Oh. Corporal Oh.

593
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,540
 Traitor

594
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,620
When you enter this place, all private calls are restricted.

595
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,530
Yes, sir.

596
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,620
 Please take care of him.

597
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,890
 Lieutenant.

598
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,710
 Lieutenant Han. Are you okay?

599
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:19,600
 This child...

600
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,280
 So that nobody knows.

601
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,520
 Hello?

602
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,340
 This is Lieutenant Han Dae Sik.

603
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,630
 They're trying to take the baby.

604
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,520
 That baby...

605
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,090
 is dead.

606
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,990
 It was malnourished.

607
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,450
 Are you sure?

608
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,880
 I'm sure.

609
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,120
 It's better this way. It would have been difficult to take care of.

610
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,190
 Act as if this never happened, Lieutenant Baek.

611
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:21,200
 I understand.

612
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:36,610
 This baby's name is Ye Rim

613
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,830
I tried to stop her from becoming a soldier.

614
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:07,050

615
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:10,070
 Search

616
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,310
 How can a dead person come back to life?

617
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,410
 Lieutenant Son Ye Rim witnessed it herself.

618
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:16,060
 Lieutenant Han. Report to the special unit.

619
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,310
 If you find anything in Sector two-one, bring it to me right away.

620
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:23,040
 This mission's goal is to kill one unidentified man.

621
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,020
 Target found.

622
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,370
 Sergeant Yong! Sergeant Yong!

623
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,900
 Where is the special unit located?

624
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,180
 What happened?

625
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,520
 Something's showing up on the monitor.

626
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,260
 Don't move!

627
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,310
 Shoot!

628
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:36,730
 - This is communications security. 
- Sergeant Yong Dong Jin is missing?
