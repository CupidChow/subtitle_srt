 This drama is a work of fiction, and the related characters, names, agencies, groups, and situations have no correlation to the real world.

8
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,840
 All scenes with animals were filmed safely with the help of experts.

9
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,990
Hands up. If you move, I will shoot.

10
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,510
Team Leader?

11
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,740
Why is Team Leader here?

12
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,190
I'm in the middle of an operation.

13
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,130
Why are you guys here?

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,940
A young girl went missing in Sector 21.

15
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,440
So we are searching after receiving permission from the head office.

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,680
But why is a civilian in a military zone?

17
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,800
Did you report this, too?

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,210
- I couldn't contact you by radio, so I made the call.
 - You made the call?

19
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,820
We all agreed to it.

20
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,120
If there are problems, I will accept reprimand.

21
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,710
Captain Song, Assistant Team Leader and the other members have done nothing wrong.

22
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,620
I insisted on coming along.

23
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,420
I apologize.

24
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,680
But have you seen my Soo Yeong inside this building by any chance?

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,260
I did not. Is it certain that the child came this way?

26
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,630
Yes, we came this far thanks to Maek's pursuit.

27
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,880
Team Leader, we received a report from Lieutenant Son that there may be another target.

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,780
- Target?
 - Lieutenant Son is currently on her way here.

29
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,070
I will finish up the missing-person operation.

30
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,010
Please leave it to me.

31
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,540
Fine. It's difficult to navigate inside this building.

32
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,850
From this point on, you will follow Assistant Team Leader's commands, got it?

33
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,830
- We understand.
 - We understand.

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,450
I will inspect this building with Sergeant Yong.

35
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,340
Team Leader and Sergeant First Class Park, and Staff Sergeant Joo...
 - Yes.

36
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,610
My name is Kim Da Jeong.

37
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,830
... along with Kim Da Jeong, you will inspect outside this building and the surrounding areas.

38
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,650
- That's all.
 - I want to go in, too.

39
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,570
You cannot. Move. Enter.

40
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,810
Team Leader?

41
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,340
Please leave the inside to us, and please look outside, Seonbae.

42
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,820
Got it. Please look for her.

43
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,250

 Episode 8

45

46
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,920
Let's go, Sergeant Yong.

47
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,580
Soo Yeong?

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,920
Cheon Soo Yeong?

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,360
But can your child really come all the way here?

50
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,730
Soo Yeong is a very adventurous child. She takes after me.

51
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,570
I think she could have.

52
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,290
Did you say Soo Yeong was ten years old?

53
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,730
Yes.

54
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,090
I'm sure she's fine. Please don't worry too much.

55
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,440
For now, let's try going that way.

56
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,820
Staff Sergeant Joo, report the current situation.

57
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,580
We haven't noticed anything unusual at our current location.

58
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,000
Got it.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,020
We will be inspecting the building's basement.

60
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,570
Lieutenant Lee.

61
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,300
Lieutenant Lee?

62
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Staff Sergeant Joo? Staff Sergeant Joo?

63
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,320
Team Leader, I think our communication signal is weak.

64
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Sergeant First Class Park.

65
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,440
Sergeant First Class Park, the signal interference seems severe.

66
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
Is our radio communication working?

67
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,500
Assistant Team Leader and Sergeant Yong have entered the building.

68
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,420
Sergeant Yong, I see a door this way.

69
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,260
I will be entering now.

70
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,200
Found her.

71
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,800
What happened to you? Are you all right?

72
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,010
Yeah. Oh, where did it go?

73
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,220
Ahjussi?

74
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,060
Soo Yeong, who is ahjussi?

75
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,150
A nice ahjussi who rescued me.

76
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,700
Ahjussi rescued you?

77
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,840
Yes. This is his house.

78
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,230
What are you saying?

79
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,480
- Let's return to base for now.
 - Yes.

80
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,410
- Soo Yeong, let's go.
 - Yeah.

81
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,620
We found the missing child.

82
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,690
We will stop the search and return. That is all.

83
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,210
They found Soo Yeong? What? Where?

84
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's go.

85
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,020
Thank you. I am really grateful.

86
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,060
I told you, things will turn out fine.

87
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,160
We're glad she was found.

88
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,710
They are leaving the building's basement right now with Soo Yeong.

89
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,660
They were not successful in finding the target.

90
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,850
Team Leader, I brought the bacteriophage syringes.

91
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,250
There is a high possibility that this target is the host of the target we eliminated.

92
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,880
We made it with the highest possible concentration, so how about we give it a try?

93
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,190
Host? So it's even stronger?

94
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,270
That is what we think.

95
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,650
If so, will the high frequency have any effect?

96
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,650
Sergeant Yong brought a speaker.

97
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:20,810
We haven't had a chance to test it. All we can do is hope that it's effective.

98
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,040
Host...

99
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,560
But Soo Yeong,

100
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,790
that fist bump you did earlier. Did you teach that to him?

101
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,710
What?

102
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,540
You know...

103
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,620
When you did that? Like that?

104
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,410
No, Ahjussi did that first.

105
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,330
Ahjussi?

106
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,680
Lieutenant Lee, please take Soo Yeong and go up first.

107
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,210
No, you cannot stay here alone.

108
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,710
I just want to confirm the target's location and quickly go back up.

109
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,330
Then don't let your guard down.

110
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,020
Yes.

111
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,890
Hurry and go. Go.

112
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,180
- Soo Yeong!
 - Mom!

113
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,150
Come here. Are you all right?

114
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,400
Not hurt anywhere? Come here, let me see.

115
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,570
- What about Sergeant Yong?
 - He's chasing the target.

116
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,220
What?

117
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,480
We will all be entering now.

118
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,810
Team Leader, the basement is too dark, our safety cannot be assured, so we cannot all go in.

119
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,540
Then Lieutenant Son and I will go in. The rest of you guard the outside.

120
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,370
- I understand.
 - Move.

121
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,860
Let me see.

122
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,960
Are you all right? You're not hurt anywhere?

123
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm sorry, Mom, for not listening and coming all the way here.

124
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,660
If you know, that's enough.

125
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,030
But you can't punish Ahjussi.

126
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,340
- Ahjussi saved me.
 - Huh?

127
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,090
The ahjussi who lives in there.

128
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,990
Sergeant Yong? Sergeant Yong?

129
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,580
Lieutenant Son, prepare the bacteriophage syringe.

130
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,840
Stop. If you move, I will shoot.

131
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,980
- It's ready.
 - Move forward.

132
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,860
No, I told you, he's a nice ahjussi.

133
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,550
Ahjussi saved me, I told you.

134
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,420
You better tell me the truth, Cheon Soo Yeong.

135
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,420
Thank you, Ahjussi.

136
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,100
Ahjussi, do you know how I can go to Cheongong-ri from here? You can't talk?

137
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,520
Ahjussi?

138
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,790
How strange.

139
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,990
If it wasn't for Ahjussi, I would have been in big trouble.

140
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,640
 That fist bump you did earlier. Did you teach that to him?

141
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,990
 No, Ahjussi did that first.

142
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Um...

143
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,200
Fist bump.

144
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,240
You know, like this?

145
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,560
Yes, yes.

146
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,690
It's alright.

147
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,780
Sergeant Yong!

148
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,210
What's with you?

149
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,770
No, you must not.

150
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,490
This target, something is different about him.

151
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,360
What?

152
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,370
Team Leader, he got Staff Sergeant Joo.

153
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,060
Staff Sergeant Joo! What's wrong?

154
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:27,670
- What happened?
 - I was attacked by the target.

155
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,010
Can you move your legs?

156
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,010
I can't feel my legs.

157
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,980
I suspect a spinal fracture. It's a medical emergency.

158
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,100
This is North Star. There is one injured soldier.

159
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,550
We request a medical team to our operation site. That is all.

160
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,700
For spinal fractures, we must reduce his movements.

161
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,610
We should cover a ladder with a poncho to move him.

162
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,110
Just endure a little longer, Staff Sergeant Joo.

163
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,210
Maek, heel. No, no, no.

164
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,380
We reported it to the squadron. You can return home now.

165
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,300
Seonbae, you seem different in a military uniform.

166
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,740
Yes, it reminds me of the past.

167
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,100
I won't ever go there again.

168
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,150
It's a relief that nothing much happened.

169
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,580
If you ever try that again, I really won't go to look for you. You're so into military stuff.

170
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm sorry, I was scared, too. I won't do it ever again.

171
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,280
Is Soo Yeong sick somewhere?

172
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,160
They said she was exposed to some substance, but they don't know what. I don't know what any of it means.

173
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,640
She needs a complete physical exam they said, so we did make an appointment.

174
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,440
But she's always itchy, so we're worried.

175
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,830
Oh, Staff Sergeant Joo got hurt while rescuing Soo Yeong.

176
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,140
Could you let me know how he's doing?

177
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,940
- Yes, I will contact you.
 - Thank you.

178
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,790
Soo Yeong!

179
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,000
Dad!

180
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,370
Are you all right? You're not hurt anywhere?

181
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,130
How can you go there?

182
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,480
I was already punished a lot by Mom.

183
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,630
Were you? Then I won't punish you.

184
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,550
- Honey, are you alright?
 - I'm fine.

185
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,430
You've all been through a lot. Thank you.

186
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,960
Is Dr. Baek at the health clinic?

187
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,950
- He quit his position.
 - What?

188
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,990
He submitted his resignation suddenly, without saying anything.

189
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,150
So I'm in charge until a new manager comes.

190
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:14,280
He said he liked our village and planned to stay until he retired.

191
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,210
Our villagers all liked him, so it's regrettable.

192
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,210
I wonder why he quit suddenly?

193
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,720
Staff Sergeant Joo Moon Cheol is confirmed to have fractured his back.

194
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,600
It will take eight weeks for his full recovery, so he cannot participate in the military operation.

195
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,160
Was his family contacted?

196
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,040
Then I will do it first. Yes.

197
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,320
It seems that he was attacked in an instant.

198
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,560
No. The target did not attack him.

199
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,180
You saw it, and you still don't know?

200
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,000
I think it's an accident caused by the collision.

201
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,530
But Staff Sergeant Joo was injured.

202
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:32,250
If you look, you can see that the target is just looking at  Staff Sergeant Joo who had fallen down.

203
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,330
This target is very different from our previous target.

204
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,630
He doesn't seem to have any intention to attack.

205
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,800
Is that how he looked to you?

206
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,600
I didn't detect any difference between this target and our previous one.

207
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,900
What about you, Sergeant First Class Park?

208
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,710
Staff Sergeant Joo probably put up a defense because he thought the target would attack him.

209
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,860
And there was one other strange thing. Soo Yeong

210
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,910
said that a nice ahjussi rescued her.

211
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,840
So you want us to trust a child's words without any firm evidence?

212
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,430
Well, that's true, but to be honest, I also received help from him as well.

213
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,160
From the target?

214
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,860
A piece of the structure fell from the ceiling, so I was endangered.

215
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,700
But the target rescued me, I think.

216
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,960
Sergeant Yong, how the target moved and what behavior he exhibited,

217
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,380
write it accurately in the post-operational report.

218
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,850
Yes.

219
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,340
Because this happened while I was absent due to orders from the head office,

220
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,650
I find it very regrettable.

221
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,070
And even just for Staff Sergeant Joo's sake, let's finish this operation well. Got it?

222
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,590
- Yes, sir.
 - Yes, sir.

223
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,320
Everyone inspect your weapons. We will begin at 20:00 sharp.

224
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,950
Yes, I understand.

225
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,330
Never imagined I'd be back here again.

226
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,930
Dragon Snake.

227
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,960
Do we have to stay here longer?

228
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,220
Yes, it turned out that way.

229
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,890
Is it true that there is another target?

230
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,060
Oh, I'm about to really go crazy.

231
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,120
Then, what must be done?

232
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,210
What do you mean? They have to catch him.

233
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,930
I know.

234
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,330
So we have to stay here longer.

235
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,500
Ah, sh*t.

236
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,380
Another target? What is that, now?

237
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,850
Fortunately, we learned that before the Special Mission Force left. Please don't worry.

238
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,890
I will make sure to catch him before the Speech for Peace, no matter what.

239
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,240
You must. Of course, you must. North Korean soldier again?

240
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,690
That has not yet been confirmed.

241
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,760
What about the substance you said you would find?

242
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,460
It wasn't found at ground level, but I confirmed that a basement exists.

243
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,110
I'm sure that's where it is.

244
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,190
Can you get in there?

245
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,290
I must. I will do it. Please trust in me.

246
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,310
 The call was not connected. At the sound of the beep—

247
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,020
Oh, yes?

248
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,370
Yes, it's me.

249
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,160
Yes, I received the report.

250
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,190
We have to catch him before the Speech for Peace.

251
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,400
You are working so hard.

252
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,320
Did you give any orders to Captain Song?

253
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,040
Yes. It's not your concern.

254
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,520
You told me to monitor his relationship with the Commander.

255
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,490
And thanks to your surveillance, Captain Song is now on my side.

256
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,120
It's all thanks to you. Great job.

257
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,810
When will you withdraw from your candidacy for President?

258
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,410
I took care of it cleanly.

259
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,160
But in return, please withdraw from the candidacy for President, Father.

260
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,300
That is how all problems will be solved.

261
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,830
Yes, I understand, Joon Seong. I will do that.

262
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,230
Joon Seong, that isn't such an easy thing.

263
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,060
Do you know how many supporters I have?

264
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,950
Must I disappoint those people?

265
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,160
You really are a child who doesn't know anything.

266
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,950
But you promised me.

267
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,350
Let's stop this. I'm busy.

268
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,740
Have you heard that there is another target?

269
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,280
You're a Commander, and yet you are late with reports?

270
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,960
So there's another target.

271
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,030
The Speech for Peace for VIPs is coming up soon, so make sure to take care of it.

272
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,540
I gave some orders to Captain Song

273
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,850
so don't scold him too much.

274
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,250
But the North Koreans, really,

275
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,020
is something going on with them?

276
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,480
What did you do with the camcorder?

277
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,320
Are you still worried about that?

278
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,100
I now know why you can't stop taking those medications.

279
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,270
Just stay nice and quiet, Commander Han Dae Sik.

280
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,000
I thought about smashing you, like that camcorder.

281
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,390
But I'm leaving you alone because I still have some use for you.

282
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,130
You idiot.

283
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,280
Hurry and catch the target already!

284
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,880
Hey, Song Min Gyu, aren't you coming here right now?

285
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,920
I was about to report to you.

286
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,540
But there's another target, so how can I go?

287
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,440
Are you ignoring my command right now?

288
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,720
How could I do that?

289
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,260
I will visit you after I finish my duty here.

290
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,470
But I don't have the time right now, Commander.

291
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,000
Hey, Captain Song?

292
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,810
Cheon Soo Yeong, attention. Salute.

293
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,800
Unity. Thank you.

294
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,090
Unity. Soo Yeong, you must not go around alone, got it?

295
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,810
Soo Yeong promised she will never do that again.

296
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,850
Unni, this is a gift for you.

297
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,010
Wow, that is so precious to Soo Yeong.

298
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,040
It's alright, please take it. Soo Yeong hates to be indebted to others. She takes after me.

299
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,190
Thank you, Soo Yeong. I'll wear it well.

300
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,920
Don't lose it, Unni.

301
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,280
Please let me know if you hear news about Staff Sergeant Joo.

302
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,680
Ah, right. I forgot. I will bring the military uniform back to you.

303
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,230
Let's go. We'll be going now. Unity.

304
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,110
- Unity.
 - Unity.

305
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,510
Unity.

306
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,620
- We'll be going now.
 - Please get home safely.

307
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,420
 Is Soo Yeong sick somewhere?

308
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,320
 They said she was exposed to some substance, but they don't know what. I don't know what any of it means.

309
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,790
 She needs a complete physical exam they said, so we did make an appointment.

310
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,310
 But she's always itchy, so we're worried.

311
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:57,630
Department Head Moon, I think we need more research into how this substance affects humans.

312
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,760
We've discovered skin conditions and nosebleeds.

313
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,100
But I don't think everyone is affected in those ways.

314
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,390
Yes, please contact me.

315
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,510
 The substance and the target.

316
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,300
 Did the target interfere with my taking the substance?

317
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,510
 What's with you!

318
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,850
 This target, something is different about him.

319
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,500
 Promise?

320
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,860
Previously,

321
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,150
you asked me what my father did, right?

322
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,650
After middle school

323
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,730
I've never answered that question, not even once.

324
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,870
He had become a father to others (he remarried).

325
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,670
So I wondered if I could still call him "father."

326
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,190
He had

327
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,010
a strong grudge that he never earned a star because of his injured leg.

328
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,710
And perhaps it's fortunate,

329
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,790
but the children of that other woman had no interest in the military.

330
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,700
So if I...

331
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,930
If I made that dream come true...

332
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,990
 My kids are amazing.

333
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,140
 You should earn a star in your father's place, right?

334
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,120
then maybe he'd become my father again.

335
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,030
What are you telling me this for?

336
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm not sure.

337
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,340
I just wanted to tell you.

338
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,960
What do you expect... now...?

339
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,560
I am not interested in other people's families.

340
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,880
And I understand your desire to protect your father.

341
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,330
But still, what is wrong is wrong.

342
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,140
The 100th Anniversary of the International Woori Peace Award has announced

343
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,610
that this year's recipient will be National Defense Commissioner Lee Hyeok.

344
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,540
International Woori Peace Award is prestigious around the world.

345
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,610
And Lee Hyeok has become the first Korean recipient.

346
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,560
This has put him in solid contention for the Presidential election.

347
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,700
Aigoo, thank you, Assemblyman.

348
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,260
Yes.

349
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,440
Is anyone unhappy after receiving an award?

350
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,800
Yes.

351
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,710
Yes, yes. It's all thanks to you, Assemblyman.
  Ribbon: Military Commander Han Dae Sik
 Congratulations for your International Woori Peace Award

352
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,890
Yes. We must all work towards peace.
  Ribbon: Military Commander Han Dae Sik
 Congratulations for your International Woori Peace Award

353
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,280
Yes. Yes, goodbye.

354
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,520
What?

355
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,790
Han Dae Sik did what?

356
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,430
 Declaration of Conscience
 The 1997 Sector 21 incident is all lies.

357
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,770
Lee Hyeok's words regarding the incident are all the opposite of the truth.

358
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,020
Hey. Hey, you bastards!

359
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,200
You have to prove that we are all on the same boat now.

360
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,210
I saw you.

361
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,680
Take it. Take it!

362
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,450
I... I... I cannot do it.

363
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,480
What would a baby know?

364
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,790
Were you shocked?

365
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,770
Did I need to contact you before visiting you, Commander?

366
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,730
Oh no, of course not.

367
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,080
What were you writing so diligently?

368
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,780
It's nothing.

369
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,560
Declaration of Conscience, huh?

370
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,770
So that's why you contacted all the major media companies?

371
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,200
That you had something to announce?

372
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,080
Did you really think I wouldn't know, Dae Sik?

373
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,170
I can't continue to live feeling apprehensive, like this.

374
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,430
I want to tell the truth, resign from this position,

375
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,640
and live with my heart at ease.

376
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,450
I've never had a since comfortable day since that day.

377
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,200
Yes, you've been through a lot.

378
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,850
Now you should live comfortably.

379
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,780
I'm quite exhausted, too.

380
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,710
What happened back then,

381
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,620
I regret it.

382
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,780
I truly regret it as well.

383
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,990
I should have told the truth and paid for my crimes.

384
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,180
Yes.

385
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,330
You should have.

386
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,380
Do you mean that?

387
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,760
I guess I've aged, too.

388
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,960
I feel regret.

389
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,670
Rest well.

390
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,850
Hyeong-nim? Hyeong-nim? Please give that to me. Who are you, you bastard?

391
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,830
Hyeong-nim!

392
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,520
Hyeong-nim!

393
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,310
 (erasing a recording file)

394
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
Dragon Snake.

395
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,490
Isn't he the person who came to visit our base?

396
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,990
Oh, you already saw that.

397
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,000
Wow, how fascinating.

398
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
 Will the truth be buried? Assemblyman Lee Hyeok's Peace Award, who is it for?

399
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,430
How does this happen?

400
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,190
 Will the truth be buried? Assemblyman Lee Hyeok's Peace Award, who is it for?

401
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,600
I know that you just returned so you must be busy, but there are things that needed to be said.

402
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,710
The report that you submitted, Lieutenant Son.

403
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,070
You said a strange substance was found on the target.

404
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,690
And it makes me wonder if the targets turned into that because of the substance.

405
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,750
Please help me find the substance.

406
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,880
Why won't you answer me?

407
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,090
Team Leader.

408
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,410
I'm not sure why you are suddenly so fixated on a substance that we only suspect exists.

409
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,480
But now is the time to focus on dealing with another target.

410
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,780
In addition, Armed Forces CBR Defense Command has jurisdiction regarding all substances.

411
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,730
Oh, is that right?

412
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,810
Oh, but what do we do?

413
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,710
For this operation, I am your superior.

414
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,840
You see, I am someone who has nothing left to lose.

415
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,210
So I have to hold onto something.

416
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,400
So when this jackpot rolls in, I have to take it, don't I?

417
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,810
I think you should stop now.

418
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,720
How regrettable, Lieutenant Son. It would have been good if we went together.

419
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,270
But

420
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,430
do you think this is something that only requires my decision?

421
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,500
So find something and bring it to me.

422
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,080
 Military Commander Han Dae Sik was found deceased at a convalescent hospital

423
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,770
 Military Commander Han Dae Sik was found deceased.

424
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,540
 Commander Han was found in a convalescent hospital near Gyeonggi Province.

425
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,980
A medicine bottle was found.

426
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,860
There was no suicide note found at the scene.

427
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,180
It's been confirmed that he was suffering from depression.

428
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,890
The police said no evidence of homicide was found.

429
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,190
So he just dies suddenly?

430
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,490
So did he really have something to hide?

431
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,390
What's with this sudden twist?

432
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,210
Colleague, watch your safety and health.

433
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,830
We've received notice to keep quiet already.

434
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,740
Everyone is freaked out right now.

435
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,490
If we work according to the mood, we can't do our work.

436
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,330
Shouldn't we at least consider questioning this?

437
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,090
If you keep digging into this, you are digging your own grave. Take it easy.

438
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,460
Oh, a delivery for you.

439
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,650
Who sent this to me?

440
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,450
Maybe it was a Unabomber.

441
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,190
Be careful, it could be a bomb.

442
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,390
Oh, seriously.

443
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,140
Hey, a 6 mm videotape.

444
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,310
I did so much journalistic research with those in the past.

445
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,810
How am I supposed to watch this?

446
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,990
You probably have to do encoding.

447
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,190
Try going to the shopping district. They can make copies of it for you.

448
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,870
Owner? Just a moment.

449
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,030
Can you look at this for me?

450
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,970
Let's see.

451
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,620
This target appears different, but our goal is elimination, no matter what.

452
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,710
But must we kill him?

453
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:27,320
The command of the superiors is to kill, and we are here to carry out that command.

454
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,600
Does everyone understand?

455
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,080
- Yes, sir.
 - Yes, sir.

456
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,070
Go get ready.

457
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,490
Lieutenant Son?

458
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,520
The detector?

459
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,280
It's still on the way.

460
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,180
Make sure it arrives before we begin our operation.

461
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,660
Yes.

462
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,890
Miss Hee Ra, you already called me again?

463
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,460
Dong Jin, Mom will tell you everything later

464
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,300
so don't be shocked.

465
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,500
What do you mean?

466
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,820
I have to confirm what happened, too.

467
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,220
So I will tell you everything.

468
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,720
Just listen to me, okay?

469
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,950
Miss Hee Ra? What's this about?

470
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,060
 International Woori Peace Award

471
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,180
Commissioner.

472
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,840
What is it?

473
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,950
 A video of the 1997 DMZ firearms incident has been made public.

474
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,400
 The video depicts very different events compared to Assemblyman Lee Hyeok

475
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,860
 and Commander Han Dae Sik's account of the events, so it is having a huge impact.

476
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,620
 The soldier who appears to be Lee Hyeok in the video

477
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,890
 appears to be killing his other fellow soldiers and Captain Jo Min Gook who was said to have defected to the North.

478
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,850
 So this video is causing great shock.

479
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,130
 The military authorities and the police

480
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,010
 are currently evaluating the source and authenticity of the video.

481
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:17,560
And the investigation into the death of Commander Han Dae Sik has been reopened.

482
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,490
Please deliver this as quickly as possible.

483
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,500
Yes, sir.

484
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,400
This boy!

485
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,260
I...

486
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,290
I should have... I should have confirmed it!

487
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,860
Sergeant First Class Park?

488
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,770
What is it?

489
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,570
Lieutenant Lee's father...

490
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,640
What about him?

491
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,730
Please look at this.

492
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,760
 A video of the 1997 DMZ firearms incident has been made public. Huge impact.

493
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,910
What is it?

494
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,130
Please look at this.

495
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,150
Hold on, hold on.

496
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,070
No.

497
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,420
What is this now?

498
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,020
Have you seen Lieutenant Lee?

499
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,340
I have not. Has something happened?

500
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,490
Hold on. You stay here.

501
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,860
Wow, this is the full video, they said.

502
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,060
Isn't this daebak?

503
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,490
Hold on.

504
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,600
Rewind that a bit.

505
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,290
Stop.

506
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,090
What's wrong?

507
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,730
That is your mother.

508
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,990
What happened?

509
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,250
Please tell us.

510
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,290
I told you to speak. (speaks casually)

511
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,260
Answer me, you bastard!

512
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,690
Sergeant Yong, stop it.

513
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,590
Are you crazy?

514
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,530
What do you think you're doing?

515
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,930
Lieutenant Lee. Come in.

516
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,710
 Station Director, Jang Tae Soo

517
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,050
 Vice-Speaker, Jang Hyeon Soo

518
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,490
 The call was not connected. After the beep—

519
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,380
These bastards.

520
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,610
When you needed me...?

521
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,000
What's going on with Sergeant Yong?

522
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,470
It's a personal matter. I will take care of it.

523
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,650
I asked you what is going on, Lieutenant Lee.

524
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,800
Team Leader, please allow me to leave this operation.

525
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,990
What?

526
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,750
I will quit.

527
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,450
Please report it to the head office.

528
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,920
I no longer have the confidence.

529
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,760
I will make the decision. You're on standby.

530
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,860
I request you, please.

531
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,630
What happened?

532
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,660
I will send you the edited video soon.

533
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:52,030
Alright. It's perfect, no signs of tampering?

534
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,120
Yes.

535
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,550
Oh, and I've confirmed that no copies exist.

536
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,190
Good.

537
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,530
Yes, Assemblyman?

538
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:10,760
Colonel Choi Gi Seok, you are indeed my hidden card.

539
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,320
Just let me know if you need me.

540
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,270
Colonel Choi?

541
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:19,840
No, I mean, General Choi.

542
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,350
I will never die.

543
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,360
I'm going to turn this game board over.

544
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,330
So General Choi, please give me your special attention.

545
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,760
I am at your command.

546
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,530
I will contact you again when things are prepared.

547
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,260
Contact all the media companies and tell them it's all fabricated.

548
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,230
To scramble it as much as possible.

549
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,720
Yes, sir, I understand.

550
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:36,610
 June 1997

551
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,100
Lee Hyeok: Captain Jo, what is this sound?

552
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,800
Jo Min Gook: Be calm.

553
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,060
Radio.

554
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,400
This is Owl, Owl. We are moving in Sector 21. We detected gun sounds

555
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,540
near our forces. We are requesting confirmation of firearm use.

556
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,700
Our forces are in training.

557
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,840
Got it. Confirmed.

558
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,510
Everyone, move.

559
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,870
How far are we supposed to go in?

560
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,070
Hyeok, you should have stayed at the base.

561
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,100
Why come all the way to the border to suffer?

562
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,170
Captain, North Koreans have put poison in the creek waters.

563
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,790
- Okay, move.
 Lee Hyeok: What are you guys doing? Stop.

564
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:59,440
How can you decide without orders from headquarters?

565
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:06,940
You are the one who killed your fellow soldiers. You wanted to successfully induce the defection of a North Korean

566
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,260
and get promoted and a medal. That's why you did this!

567
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,640
In exchange for our lives!

568
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,930
This is Owl, Owl.

569
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,890
I'm not doing this so I can live, am I?

570
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,910
- Do you understand?!
 - Yes, yes...

571
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:48,010
Now we all share the same fate.

572
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,410
We've gotten on the same boat.

573
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,120
If you say something else later

574
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,460
I will kill you, just like this.

575
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,660
Captain Jo defected to the North

576
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,240
After doing this to his men.

577
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,960
What do you mean, this?

578
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,220
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

579
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,760
I understand. I understand. I understand.

580
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,800
 Joseon

581
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,770
My wife and daughter

582
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,220
who were on the boat?

583
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,610
Why were you there instead?

584
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,690
Your child

585
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,000
is

586
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,030
probably alive.

587
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:15,940

588
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,170
  Search
 - Preview -

589
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,670
I will reveal everything that happened that day.

590
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,760
- Team Leader, do you intend to kill your own men?
 - It's a command.

591
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,490
No one can know about Sector 21's operation, as instructed.

592
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:33,540
I will do this mission.

593
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,940
Sergeant Yong!

594
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,890
If you move, I will shoot.
