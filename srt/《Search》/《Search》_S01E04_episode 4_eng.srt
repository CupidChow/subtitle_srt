Be careful!

11
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,050
Cease fire.

12
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,990
How did you get here?

13
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,500
You should have called before you came here, at least. I was surprised.

14
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,660
Shhh. Be quiet.

15
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,860
What is it?

16
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,710
What happened here?

17
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,160
He went up that way.

18
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,440
What are you saying?

19
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,240
The target climbed the tree and went up there.

20
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,030
What are you doing? Follow the target.

 Episode 4

23
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,500
 Assistant Team Leader, returning to base with Sergeant First Class Park.

24
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,260
Standby.

25
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,920
Did you find anything?

26
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,110
We searched around for any trace but we couldn't even find a drop of blood.

27
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,290
He didn't leave any trace and disappeared like smoke.

28
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,580
It's not possible to comprehend this situation.

29
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,770
Sir, we have come too far.

30
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,900
- Let's withdraw and— 
 - What are you talking about?

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,970
You want us to withdraw already?

32
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,710
The North Korean DMZ Team can come down to our current location.

33
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:16,390
Sector two-one is close by. Let's go to a safe area and return after we contact headquarters.

34
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,210
Alright.

35
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,200
We'll move to sector two-one and reorganize there.

36
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,930
Military Dog Handler.

37
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,630
Let's go.

38
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,670
Team Leader.

39
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,600
I will collect some samples for a moment.

40
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,650
Let's move.

41
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,730
Sir. I've secured the perimeter.

42
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,810
First Lieutenant Lee, Sergeant First Class Park, and Staff Sergeant Joo stand guard.

43
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,440
- The rest of you should take a break.
 - Yes, sir.

44
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,940
I'm First Lieutenant Son Ye Rim from The Armed Forces CBR Defense Command, 24th Special Mission Battalion.

45
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,030
What happened to you earlier?

46
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,100
Why did you go alone?

47
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,870
I'm sorry. I got lost,

48
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,110
- but my walkie-talkie wouldn't work. 
 - Get your head on straight.

49
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,630
Will you take responsibility if one of our members dies because of you?

50
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,440
Honestly, It's not like I did that on purpose.

51
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,310
I tried my best to contact you.

52
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,970
- Are you talking back to me? 
 - Sergeant Yong.

53
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,050
That's enough.

54
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm not talking back to you. I'm just trying to explain that the situation could not be helped.

55
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,470
This punk.

56
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,480
Sergeant Yong.

57
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,340
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

58
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,810
If you leave formation again, you'll be punished under Military Law.

59
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,040
- Understood? 
 - Yes, Team Leader.

60
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,640
The dog handler will stand guard around the abandoned building.

61
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,480
Let's go.

62
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,950
I went through so much trouble earlier.

63
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,840
Forget it. Let's go.

64
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,370
Sir, we are unable to communicate.

65
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,640
I will try to fix it quickly.

66
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,820
Sir, I have an idea.

67
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,910
What is it?

68
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,610
There's a way we can subdue the target.

69
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,240
Let's hear it.

70
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,410
I don't know if it will work,

71
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,790
but what if we lead him towards the water?

72
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,070
- Water?
 - Because he has symptoms of rabies,

73
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,880
he might be afraid of water.

74
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,080
- Are you saying that the target is infected with rabies? 
 - Yes.

75
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,340
How are you so sure?

76
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,580
I'm sure you'll receive a report, but according to the research I found yesterday,

77
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,080
- the target was infected by the rabies virus— 
 - Team Leader.

78
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,180
I think we should ask for backup.

79
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,840
- Sergeant First Class Park. 
 - Yes?

80
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,220
If you're scared, you can sit on the sidelines.

81
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,650
You know that's not what I mean.

82
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,210
Sir, I agree with Sergeant First Class Park.

83
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,510
The target is faster than we thought.

84
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,680
We're going after the target again, lure him towards the valley, and make sure to shoot him.

85
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,720
- Staff Sergeant Joo. 
 - Yes, sir.

86
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,880
- Turn on the monitor and keep trying to locate it.
 - I understand.

87
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,380
Sir. Someone has to lure him towards the water.

88
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,280
I will do it.

89
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,080
It seems like the target has been coming after me, so I think it would be best for me to do it.

90
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,840
Maek and I will lure him.

91
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
Fine.

92
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,550
- Then the military dog and her handler will lure the target. 
 - Yes, sir.

93
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,100
I will make sure to catch you today.

94
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,980
Hurry up and come out, so I can catch you and get discharged.

95
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,680
Maek, come here. Go back to the Special Mission team now.

96
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,380
Hurry up and go.

97
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,050
Team Leader, I'm getting closer!

98
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,410
Team Leader! Darn it.

99
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,080
Sergeant Yong. Sergeant Yong?

100
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,650
I think he's outside the communication range.

101
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,220
Fire!

102
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,510
Cease fire.

103
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,870
Everyone assemble!

104
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,310
Team Leader, I think we should tell them about the target now.

105
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,350
Return the firearms and gather in the situation room. Understood?

106
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,090
Yes, sir!

107
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,340
- And First Lieutenant Son Ye Rim.
 - Yes, sir.

108
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,510
Don't speak before me and don't move before I give my answer.

109
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,310
Am I understood?

110
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,500
Yes, sir.

111
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,890
You heard him. Dismissed.

112
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,350
This is the CCTV footage from the CBR morgue.

113
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,640
Corporal Oh, who died in the DMZ, woke up after transitioning to a different state.

114
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,160
The changed Corporal Oh's movements were extremely fast. He was very strong.

115
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,490
In addition, bullets didn't subdue him easily.

116
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,370
During the GP 329 incident, the target attacked Corporal Oh.

117
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,060
But the target and Corporal Oh's cells both mutated in the same way.

118
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,340
Then the target also underwent this change?

119
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,650
That's a possibility.

120
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,000
Is it possible to kill him?

121
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,490
You have to sever the brainstem.

122
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,690
But the problem is that the target's too fast.

123
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,740
So we have to make him stop moving

124
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,950
and hit him with a few rounds in the back of the head. Then he'll die?

125
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:16,300
So you're saying that the target is some kind of monster?

126
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,860
No. He has unusual characteristics due to mutation—

127
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,850
Listen up.

128
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,130
The target isn't a monster or a wild dog. He's a North Korean enemy soldier.

129
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,610
Don't make things bigger than they need to be.

130
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,680
Team Leader. I saw it clearly.

131
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,940
I faced it directly and even saw it kill a North Korean soldier. It's not human.

132
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,250
The way it looks, you can't call it human.

133
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,820
Does it look weird?

134
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,080
Yes. I'll draw it.

135
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,060
- Sergeant First Class Park. 
- Yes?

136
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,380
Did you see?

137
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,270
It was really chaotic out there. I didn't see it.

138
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,650
Staff Sergeant Joo.

139
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,730
I didn't see it either.

140
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,640
If someone did see it, we can't ignore him.

141
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,410
For now, report to HQ what happened today.

142
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
- Staff Sergeant Joo.
 - Yes?

143
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,680
- Install an ABC monitor used during the operation in the situation room.
 - Yes, I understand.

144
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,500
I'll cross-check the rotations in the day. We'll finish this during an ambush tomorrow night.

145
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,010
We could die in this operation.

146
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,340
- Do not lower your guard and never move alone.
 - Yes.

147
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,380
Understood?

148
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,200
Yes, sir!

149
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
Yeah, this is Song Min Gyu. I'd like a favor.

150
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,350
There's a Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong in the commando regiment. Look into him for me.

151
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,870
Thanks. Let's have a drink later.

152
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,760
Are you okay?

153
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,360
What?

154
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,030
Yeah, I'm okay.

155
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,940
What about you guys? Are you comfortable?

156
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,230
Yes.

157
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,270
Well if anything comes up, let me know.

158
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,650
Hello?

159
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,590
Soldiers!

160
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,310
We need to set up barracks for Lieutenant Son. Can you do it?

161
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,030
Don't worry about it. I was thinking of that anyway.

162
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,830
Unity.

163
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,360
I wouldn't trust my health to a veterinarian.

164
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,150
They don't have enough medics to send one to us.

165
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,650
Are you going to stay like that until tomorrow?

166
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,350
She's dehydrated.

167
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,210
Take her when we go to the health center.

168
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,990
I was going to.

169
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,300
Did you get some sleep?

170
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,190
Well...

171
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,350
Yes, there's no way you slept.

172
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,240
After going through something like that, you would have tried to figure it out, no matter what.

173
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,890
And until you figured it out you probably didn't move an inch.

174
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,680
Right? Son Ye Rim?

175
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,010
Give me your hand.

176
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,610
Don't misunderstand. I'm going to sterilize it.

177
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,640
You didn't even tell anyone your wound was this bad, did you?

178
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,810
It's not that bad.

179
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
Stay still.

180
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,750
Hey, being consistent must be nice.

181
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,490
I haven't seen you in a year, and you haven't changed at all.

182
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,460
If someone changes, they die.

183
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,170
Right, if you change, you die.

184
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,610
Are you hurt anywhere else? Inside?

185
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,830
You want me to take my clothes off?

186
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,600
Hey!

187
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,330
You are saying such weird things. I'm just worried about you.

188
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,450
Forget it.

189
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,160
You really are very consistent.

190
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,150
It must be nice to never change.

191
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,000
Anyway, thanks. Take care of yourself, too.

192
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,460
Lieutenant Son!

193
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,910
Do you have some business with me?

194
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,000
It was so chaotic, I held onto this.

195
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,920
Thanks, Staff Sergeant Joo Moon Cheol.

196
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,150
 Joo Moon Cheol

197
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,530
Sergeant Yong. You know Lieutenant Son Ye Rim?

198
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,090
Yes, well. Yes.

199
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,180
How do you know her?

200
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,060
We went on a mission in GP 329 together.

201
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,450
That's right.

202
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,490
Are you interested in her?

203
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,630
I am. Why?

204
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,220
- Please take good care of me. 
- What are you talking about?

205
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,280
You can be my stepping stone.

206
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,940
What an amazing offer.

207
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,210
I'm so bored.

208
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,000
Are the gangsters not coming today?

209
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,040
 Atopy symptoms

210
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,370
 Atopy: a hereditary allergic predisposition

211
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,410
In our village,

212
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:59,420
three dogs and many hens have already gone missing.

213
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,330
But, our village isn't a place that just anybody can easily enter.

214
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,640
If that's the case, it's the act of an insider.

215
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,360
Or they might have escaped. Anyway,

216
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,520
let's consider all the possibilities.

217
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,440
We'll decide on an order and rotate on a crime prevention watch.

218
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,390
The youth groups decided,

219
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,300
so if you have any complaints, bring them up anytime.

220
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,610
Just tell us the order.

221
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,850
Let's do the ladder game.

222
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,980
Rock paper scissors!

223
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,100
Let's not do that.

224
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,300
Let's use the order of handsomeness.

225
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,380
Then I'm first.

226
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,760
- Get him!
 - Hey, why?

227
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,970
Bite your tongue.

228
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,750
Okay, this won't work.

229
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,400
- Let's do it by age order.
 - Then show your Citizen I.D.

230
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,710
Why? We're all friends here.

231
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,070
Some people might have early birthdays.

232
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,560
Okay. One, two, three!

233
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,980
- This bastard has an early birthday.
 - It's late!

234
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,180
- That's the same thing.
 - Huh?

235
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,830
Get him.

236
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,350
- Look at this bastard!
 - Why are you like this?

237
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,620
Why are you leading the meeting?

238
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,670
Who's the village leader? Who is the youth group leader here?

239
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,950
Hey, punk,

240
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,510
you're a busy newlywed.

241
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,290
So what? Why does that matter?

242
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,450
Hey. Oh!

243
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,810
Look at that!

244
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,620
Blood?

245
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,610
Wow! I'm jealous!

246
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,150
It's not like that.

247
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,750
Back in my day,

248
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,520
newlyweds always had nosebleeds.

249
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,200
It's not like that! Geez.

250
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,910
- She won't even let me near her.
 - Why not?

251
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,040
- Why not? What's wrong?
 - You two have problems already?

252
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,590
She wants to move.

253
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,560
Oh, Jae Sik! Of course, your wife might feel trapped here.

254
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,080
You should be better to her.

255
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,630
Lieutenant Lee. I was really thankful.

256
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,850
You were shocked today, right?

257
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,990
Don't let it sit in your heart too much. It could become a trauma.

258
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,230
Let's not be too scared.

259
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,140
There's a way to kill it.

260
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,190
 Yong Hee Ra Hangover Soup

261
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,670
Noona.

262
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,040
Maybe we chose the wrong type of business?

263
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,130
When the weather is warm, nobody comes to eat.

264
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,250
They'll come when it gets colder.

265
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,790
So optimistic.

266
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,810
Isn't Dong Jin using your credit card lately?

267
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,780
He's going into an operation.

268
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,730
So why are you staring at your phone so much?

269
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,880
It's a habit.

270
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,690
Noona. That's an obsession.

271
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,490
Hey! What do I have other than my son?

272
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,320
So what if I'm obsessed?

273
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,080
And I'm worried because he's almost discharged.

274
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,650
- Let's drink.
 - Cheers.

275
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,910
Welcome in. Are you a party of one?

276
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,340
How many years has it been?

277
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,740
 Now that you're confirmed the target with your own eyes, what do you think?

278
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,590
It's a lot stronger than Corporal Oh.

279
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,490
How can this have happened?

280
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,940
Did the water have any effect?

281
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,620
No, none.

282
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,910
The rabies logic has been broken.

283
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,300
So nobody else has been infected?

284
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,550
It should be that way.

285
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,850
Can I request an experiment?

286
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,280
Sergeant Yong.

287
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,250
Should we train? How about a fight simulation?

288
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,670
You know military martial arts, don't you?

289
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,690
I don't like to sweat so close to my discharge.

290
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,730
Don't back out.

291
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,700
How about earning special merit for the reconnaissance team?

292
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,540
How bothersome.

293
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,850
Let's do it.

294
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,420
Sergeant! Quick!

295
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,860
Fighting!

296
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:23,250
Yong Dong Jin! Yong Dong Jin!

297
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:35,410
Yong Dong Jin! Yong Dong Jin!

298
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,320
Lieutenant Lee! Lieutenant Lee!

299
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,800
Yong Dong Jin!

300
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:44,350
 Cheongong-ri Land Mine Removal Operation

301
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,730
Yes.

302
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,440
This is more serious than I thought.

303
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,040
I'll keep an eye on Captain Song Min Gyu.

304
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,070
Yes, sir.

305
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,340
That's right. No way someone from this neighborhood would do that.

306
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,700
Some bastard snuck in from outside.

307
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,000
The TF (Task Force) coming in unexpectedly is weird.

308
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,920
That the dogs and chickens keep getting stolen is weird, too.

309
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,190
Is a spy in town?

310
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,650
If he made it all the way in here, that means the entire place is vulnerable.

311
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,830
This isn't the time for me to be lounging around.

312
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,950
Honey. If you're tired, rest.

313
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,880
No.

314
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,950
We should get going. I have to change to go to the party.

315
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,410
Wow, look at the time, huh?

316
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,890
Anyway,

317
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,160
when I'm with you, time flies.

318
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,980
- Let's go.
 - Yeah.

319
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,430
Hand! Give that here, I'll hold it for you.

320
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,210
What should  I wear?

321
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,710
You're gorgeous in anything.

322
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,950
What? Did you have a strange dream again?

323
00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:00,060
That person coming by made me anxious.

324
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,860
What's made you anxious?

325
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,490
It was strange then, too.

326
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,000
The mine exploded first, it exploded later. He was talking gibberish.

327
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,070
Later, he said he didn't remember.

328
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,540
Would he have been right in his mind after witnessing that?

329
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,820
And that's what they concluded back then, too.

330
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,670
 Son! You're doing well, right?

331
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,560
Oh no, my Miss Hee Ra had another nightmare.

332
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,440
 I'm fine.

333
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,020
 I'm participating my last training, brilliantly.

334
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,500
 Love you.

335
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,810
I'll be back.

336
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,120
Look after her well.

337
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,120
She's a much more important member of the special task force than you are.

338
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,840
Yes, sir!

339
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,540
Did you do something wrong to the captain?

340
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,520
When I was at the Military Police, we waited in the same room.

341
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,580
- You picked a fight again?
 - Nah.

342
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,250
Fix that habit of yours, picking fights whenever you feel wronged.

343
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,080
You saw it too.

344
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,150
That person's a psycho. A lunatic.

345
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,470
I'm worried about our operation.

346
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,040
We have to entrust our lives to that kind of person.

347
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,020
How could you call Captain a lunatic? No wonder he's mad at you.

348
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,630
You haven't lost your skill.

349
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,310
We might need a sword more than a gun, so be prepared.

350
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,690
Hey, our target isn't human.

351
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,060
It's not a zombie, either.

352
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,710
Some kind of life form combined with an animal.

353
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,910
Don't try to define it yourself.

354
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:56,450
How can we fight the target when we don't even know what it is?

355
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,970
We have to abandon the thought that it's human.

356
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,830
Nothing's been scientifically proven.

357
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,730
Is this the time to argue about that?

358
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,670
Everybody says it's human because they didn't see it clearly, but what if something goes wrong?

359
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,930
Aren't we all at risk of getting infected?

360
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:14,070
Human to human infection hasn't yet been confirmed.

361
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,760
The wild dog, presumed to be the host, is already dead.

362
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,040
So we can't even be sure if it was infected.

363
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,990
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

364
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,910
They will continue to study it.

365
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,760
You just worry about capturing the target.

366
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,380
I saw it with my own two eyes, so it'll speed up the research.

367
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,320
So you didn't come here to save me, but because you were curious about that?

368
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,970
Why would I come to save you?

369
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,770
Good point.

370
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,980
 Cheongong-ri Health Center

371
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,770
 Consultation Room

372
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,020
Don't look at me like that. I'm not going to have mercy on you.

373
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,600
Should I give her vitamin K first?

374
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,320
Yes. Her leg wound didn't stop bleeding.

375
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,930
Aigoo. You must have had a hard time finding mines.

376
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:12,530
Is there anything else you need?

377
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,790
Please give her some fluids, too.

378
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,770
Okay.

379
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,330
Just give me a fluids set.

380
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,910
- And do you have a needle? 
- Yes.

381
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,400
Have you been medically trained?

382
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,300
A dog handler knows how to do that as well?

383
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:43,070
Well, you know. I picked up a few things from my seniors.

384
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,560
Sergeant, you should receive treatment too.

385
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,770
What kind of mine removal results in these kinds of wounds?

386
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,330
Did you fight with someone?

387
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,730
Something like that.

388
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,230
Have you been well, Doctor?

389
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:08,300
Yes, I've been well.

390
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,670
It's nice to see you.

391
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,180
I thought you'd have a lot to say when we met.

392
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,560
I always received your letters well.

393
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,120
Then why didn't you reply?

394
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,910
I'm a bit old-fashioned. I can't write very well.

395
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,410
Did you commit a sin against me or something?

396
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,270
Of course not.

397
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,330
I know. But you kept running away.

398
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,470
I looked for you so many times, but you were never there.

399
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,050
Doctor, I know you're not my father,

400
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,820
so you don't have to run away.

401
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,280
I just looked into you because I was curious.

402
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,690
I wondered what kind of person you are.

403
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:02,240
While I was in the orphanage, you sent all my living expenses and tuition.

404
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,960
Even presents.

405
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,250
So of course, I wanted to meet you.

406
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,820
You don't have to feel pressured.

407
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,410
If you're curious about your biological parents, I can tell you.

408
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,020
No, it's alright. I have no memory of them at all, anyway.

409
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,930
Please stay here, Doctor, so that I can come and greet you sometimes.

410
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,140
Thanks, Ye Rim.

411
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,610
Like this.

412
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,500
She's looking, right?

413
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,820
Through here. Put!

414
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:53,590
Good. Good job. Isn't that cool?

415
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,800
You've already captured all the women in this neighborhood?

416
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,580
What? What do you see me as?

417
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:05,360
There's only been one woman that I ever approached first.

418
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,130
Think whatever you want. I don't have any intention of clinging to you, asking you to believe me, like before.

419
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,400
After all, we're nothing to each other anymore.

420
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,210
If we're nothing to each other, why do you keep speaking informally?

421
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,350
Should I report that to Captain?

422
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,560
Was your personality always like this?

423
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,140
You're the one who liked me because of it.

424
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,930
That's right. I was a bit insane.

425
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,520
I don't know what came over me

426
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,700
that I liked you.

427
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:39,220
We're in the middle of an operation. Do not associate with civilians unless necessary.

428
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:45,600
Captain told us not to make the civilians uncomfortable around us, Lieutenant Son.

429
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,420
Let's go, Sergeant Yong.

430
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,390
She always calls me Sergeant Yong, Sergeant Yong. She's younger than me!

431
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,970
Maek, heel!

432
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,550
Kids, you can't pet the dog.

433
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,680
Come here! Come here!

434
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,100
- Eat before you go.
 - What?

435
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,240
- Today's my birthday. 
- Oh!

436
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,010
- We're fine.
 - Aigoo.

437
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,840
Eat before you go. You never come around here.

438
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,380
We're in the middle of an operation. We have to head back.

439
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,590
Quickly, come.

440
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,540
Please head in.

441
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,590
Soo Yeong! You!

442
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,640
Mine removal team!

443
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,820
Good to see you. Come inside!

444
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,440
You've worked hard, you should have a good meal.

445
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,450
It's okay. We'll head off now.

446
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,600
No! Soo Yeong?

447
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,100
Eat something, Oppa!

448
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,330
It's Grandma's birthday.

449
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,950
Oh, you shouldn't do this.

450
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,680
So cold-hearted.

451
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,510
Help.

452
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,580
We'll eat for 20 minutes and leave.

453
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,490
We'll just eat.

454
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,770
Okay!

455
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,200
Maek, heel!

456
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,480
Come here. Wait.

457
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,230
Don't touch her! Just watch with your eyes.

458
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,220
Okay!

459
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,340
Wait, ma'am. Why are you going into the shelter?

460
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,910
We have a lot of elders, if a war breaks out... our neighborhood has a tradition of feasting here.

461
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,260
Come down! Soo Young, hurry!

462
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,170
Okay!

463
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,830
What are you doing? Hurry!

464
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,150
Excuse us!

465
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:52,340
 ♫ Cha ra cha ra cha cha cha
 Cha ra cha ra cha cha cha  ♫

466
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,440
 ♫ No matter what, no matter what  ♫

467
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,620
Say hello, everyone!

468
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,750
They're here to eat, from the mine removal team.

469
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,180
Go on. Sit down.
  Happy Birthday, Grandma Kim Choon Nam!

470
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,270
♫  I will run to you whenever you want me to  ♫

471
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,620
♫  Day is fine, night is fine  ♫

472
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,330
♫  I will run to you whenever you want me to  ♫

473
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:14,480
You must have only had army rations to eat. Eat up.

474
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,240
- Thank you.
 - We will enjoy it.

475
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,110
Where are you from?

476
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,280
I'm Sergeant Yong Dong Jin from the Recon Battalion.

477
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,780
You seemed like a dog handler.

478
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,480
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,070
If it's Recon, do you know the legend of DMZ Gate 8?

480
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,640
The soldier ghost who couldn't differentiate between north and south and accidentally went to a GP?

481
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,680
How do you know?

482
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,180
That's how we tell the kids not to go outside the village.

483
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,480
I'm stationed at the CBR defense command.

484
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,860
They told us to get rabies vaccine shots. Is that why you're here, Lieutenant?

485
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,910
If you live here, you figure all that out.

486
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,010
Hurry and eat.

487
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,630
Min Jae, you step down. Young man, you sing.

488
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,710
Me?

489
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,860
Come up here and sing.

490
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,100
No, ma'am. I'm eating.

491
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,950
Sing for us! Sing for us!

492
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:27,440
Grandma likes new faces. Think of it as the price of the meal and sing.

493
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,290
Get up.

494
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,700
Do it.

495
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,620
Alone?

496
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,150
Do you want me to? You should, as a sergeant.

497
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,750
You used to be obsessed with karaoke.

498
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,410
- Even so, how can I— 
- It's an order.

499
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:43,940
Sergeant Yong.

500
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,980
"Sergeant Yong, Sergeant Yong," really?

501
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:52,020
If you can't sing, you won't be discharged. You will be a soldier for life.

502
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,720
Sing for us! Sing for us!

503
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,810
Come on out! Okay! Applause!

504
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,180
 Happy Birthday, Grandma Kim Choon Nam!

505
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:05,940
I'll just sing one song.

506
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:20,090
♫ The love that Mom gave me always felt awkward ♫

507
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:26,710
♫ Is that why love is so hard for me?

508
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:33,280
♫ My greed of not wanting to lose you ♫

509
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,160
♫ But there was a small beauty in it ♫

510
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:46,110
♫  I'm happy now, and that is why I'm anxious  ♫

511
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:52,570
♫  The ocean is always calm before the storm  ♫

512
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:58,920
♫   Can't catch on fire and burn quickly   ♫

513
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,820
♫   I'm cheering for love   ♫

514
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,980
♫   Youthful us   ♫

515
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:16,870
♫   Our age is not that apparent   ♫

516
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:22,980
♫   Because of the bright lights   ♫

517
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:30,680
♫   Our eyes are getting blinded  ♫

518
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,460
You scared me!

519
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,520
Maek, heel! Good.

520
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,010
- It must be heavy, let me carry it for you.
 - No, it's alright.

521
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:09,600
It's okay! This sergeant here has to take care of his dog.

522
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,350
Is it your first time in Cheongong Ri?

523
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,770
Yes, it's my first time.

524
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,110
- Yes.
 - Oh.

525
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:22,500
Is this Soo Yeong's father's hometown?

526
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,430
I wanted to return to farming.

527
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,720
So where did you stay before you came here?

528
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:34,010
After I had Soo Young, Incheon. Before that, I traveled a lot for work.

529
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:41,130
If it's traveling work, may I ask what kind of work you did?

530
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,240
Well, I did something.

531
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,710
It's a bit embarrassing in front of you to say, seeing where I'm at now.

532
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,740
Why? You look fine.

533
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:56,570
To be honest, I was shocked hearing your age.

534
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,170
Who would have thought?

535
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:03,890
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin! Jeez, you're a sweet talker to noonas.

536
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,470
I live alone with my mother, so I understand the heart of older women.

537
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:12,760
But never my peers.

538
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,810
That can happen. It's quite common.

539
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:20,600
Tell me if dating doesn't work out. So do you have a girlfriend?

540
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:26,340
My girlfriend... I don't have one.

541
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,120
After I got dumped a year ago, I haven't met anyone new.

542
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,190
Oh my. You look like you would be quite popular.

543
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,170
Don't say that.

544
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,920
That's the problem, you see.

545
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,280
Well, my Soo Yeong seemed disappointed too.

546
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,310
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin, what did you major in?

547
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:46,570
I was a veterinary student.

548
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,410
So a dog handler is perfect. You have two weeks left before discharge?

549
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,500
- Yes. 
- Must be nice.

550
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,700
We're here. Thank you, Soo Yeong's mother.

551
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,070
Of course.

552
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,040
Keep up the good work.

553
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,730
- See you later!
 - Yes, see you later.

554
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,500
You really have captured all the women in this neighborhood. That habit won't go anywhere.

555
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,260
Wow, Son Ye Rim. Are you jealous? Huh?

556
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,480
What?

557
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,530
What's wrong?

558
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,920
Come here!

559
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,170
What?

560
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,620
Son Ye Rim, right?

561
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,930
No, it's not.

562
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,350
I remember a year ago.

563
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:48,230
You cried and threw a fit because you couldn't contact her, even threatening to desert the army? That was her, right?

564
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,820
Is that true?

565
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,120
- C'mon! Don't ask me about that.
 - Daebak.

566
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,470
No, the other guys said you were acting weird since the last mission, but I didn't believe them.

567
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,850
So did you go on the North Star mission with her, too?

568
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:05,820
- That was coincidence.
 - You mean fate.

569
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,520
And you meet her again. Wow, you might even get sick of her.

570
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,390
But she's a lieutenant, and you're just a sergeant.

571
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,760
"I'm a lieutenant, and you're a sergeant."

572
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,520
- Hey, stop.
 - Okay, sure.

573
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,590
But be strong. You're a civilian in two weeks. What matter does rank have?

574
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,630
I agree.

575
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,900
If I really tried, why would I date her?

576
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,690
Why not? You should date her again. You look like you are not over her at all.

577
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,330
We can never end up together.

578
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,450
- Why? 
- Why?

579
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:39,080
You spoke formally again.

580
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,650
I'm sorry.

581
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,150
 First Lieutenant Son?

582
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:55,630
You must be exhausted. Here's some caffeine.

583
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,940
Thanks, Sergeant Choi.

584
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,220
Are you investigating the strange monster?

585
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,490
It's still too early to call it a monster.

586
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,850
It tastes good.

587
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:15,450
I'm actually a certified barista.

588
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:22,830
As a matter of fact, Sergeant Yong told me to take good care of you.

589
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,710
Now, if you'll excuse me.

590
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,630
- Seo Byeok Joon! 
 - Dragon Snake. 
 - Are you done?
 - Yes.

591
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,740
Come back safely. I'll have a special meal prepared.

592
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,770
A special meal? Bbrong Rak didn't say anything about that.

593
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,330
Yes. I'll be preparing it.

594
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,890
You are? What is it?

595
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,550
It's a special ramyeon passed down from my father.

596
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,360
Ramyeon? Sounds great. Thank you. Oh, right,

597
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,610
here, you can have these.

598
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,630
They're yours now. Keep your hands safe.

599
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,370
- You should use them.
 - It's alright.

600
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,370
I have lots of them.

601
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:18,250
Also, don't tell Lieutenant Son.

602
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,180
Hey! Why are you laughing?

603
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,800
Lieutenant Son is a cool woman.

604
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,470
I don't know what you did, but you should just apologize to her.

605
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,790
What did I do wrong?

606
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:36,550
Most men never know what they did wrong.

607
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,540
You bastard. Didn't you say you've never had a girlfriend before?

608
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,900
What do you know about women?

609
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,730
The ambush attack will take place at 10 pm. We will come back at 5 am tomorrow.

610
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,100
I believe that all of us have the same purpose right now.

611
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,760
We must catch it today.

612
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,070
- Understood? 
 - Yes, sir!

613
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,670
Here you go.

614
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,460
Thank you.

615
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,710
Staff Sergeant Joo, be careful.

616
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,510
Yes, you should also be careful, First Lieutenant Son.

617
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,730
I'll run to you whenever you need help.

618
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,580
That's reassuring.

619
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,460
Let's get going now.

620
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,170
Border situation?

621
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,200
Border situation in check.

622
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,490
What are you doing? You're just making ramyeon.

623
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,710
I have to make it well.

624
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,010
- You know, Byeok Joon? 
 - Yes?

625
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,700
Why do you have gloves on?

626
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,460
They're from Sergeant Yong. He told me to keep them on.

627
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,320
Dragon Snake, huh?

628
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,740
I'm going to sleep wearing them too.

629
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,740
What's the secret?

630
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,580
I can't tell you yet.

631
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,570
I will tell you after you taste it.

632
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,710
I wonder if they'll be able to get the zombie today.

633
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:46,120
It's not a zombie, is it? I heard that it flies over trees.

634
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,050
Hey, it's all in their head.

635
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:52,530
When people are afraid, their imaginations run wild.

636
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:57,430
It might as well be a monkey in an army uniform.

637
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,450
A monkey, you say?

638
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,750
Times like this, I'm glad that I'm a cook.

639
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,840
It must be so scary to be out there.

640
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,650
I'm worried about Dragon Snake.

641
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,860
You should be worried about the time you have left here.

642
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:13,520
He may be a dog handler, but I bet he's a star in there.

643
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,710
Why is it so noisy out there? Are the village dogs having a meeting today?

644
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,720
The dogs are especially loud today.

645
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,890
Hold on.

646
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,680
It's too quiet.

647
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:47,030
Can I ask you something?

648
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:52,450
When I was singing in the underground shelter, you just left.

649
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,540
What?

650
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:58,350
I thought it might've been because I was singing worse than usual.

651
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,900
- Well, you were never good. 
 - Hey.

652
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,250
Hey, that time, in the past,

653
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,550
when we went to karaoke together. I sang well back then.

654
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,410
Can you sing anything else besides that one song?

655
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,330
No, I only know that song.

656
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,490
I'm going to take a nap since nobody is here.

657
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,590
Take some rest.

658
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,860
I'm heading to the situation room to check on the radio.

659
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,870
- Alright, then. 
 - Yes, sir.

660
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,550
Byeok Joon?

661
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,220
- Yes.
 - Keep up the good work.

662
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,390
Yes, sir.

663
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,470
Sergeant Bong Rak?

664
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,840
You shouldn't move Dragon Snake's sleeping bag.

665
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:49,720
Dragon Snake is a sensitive sleeper—

666
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,550
No! No!

667
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,550
Sergeant Bong Rak?

668
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,430
Hey, Byeok Joon?

669
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,990
The target... is at the headquarters...

670
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,500
Say that again. Seo Byeok Joon!

671
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,650
Sir. There's a situation at the headquarters. I will return there.

672
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,930
The target has appeared at HQ. Everyone, go back right now!

673
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,700
Byeok Joon?

674
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,700
 Seo Byeok Joon?

675
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:26,060

676
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,820
 Search

677
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,360
 Sergeant Yong!

678
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,610
 A series of unfortunate events have been happening where our soldiers are being attacked by wild dogs.

679
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:46,260
 If we can't conclude this operation within 72 hours, we'll have to resign.

680
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,880
 Please let go. I'm going to go catch that bastard.

681
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,890
 Are they having night training? Doesn't it feel weird?

682
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,190
 Wh-Who are you?

683
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,550
 Leader, it's the target.

684
01:01:56,550 --> 01:02:00,420
 It'll be over for us if civilians find out about the target or if there are any victims.

685
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,400
 We have to stop it, no matter what.
