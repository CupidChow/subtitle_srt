 Search

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,900
 This drama is a work of fiction, and the related characters, names, agencies, groups, and situations have no correlation to the real world.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,080
 All scenes with animals were filmed safely with the help of experts.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,060
 We're going to form a special unit.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,680
 - Unity!
 - You have to finish the mission quickly.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,780
 This mission is to eliminate the enemy in one week.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,450
 The goal is to kill the unidentified man from this video.

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:00,840
 We have to lure the target to the village with Staff Sergeant Joo's radio.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,230
 Frequency.

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,890
 June 15, 2020.

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,120
 15:05. Target killed. Mission complete.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,800
 Have you seen that camcorder from last time?

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,010
 I haven't seen it.

19
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,910
 I don't know why something from 1997 is suddenly being detected

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,890
 but doesn't that confirm that the substance is there?

21
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,300
 You will find that and bring it to me?

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,870
 Lieutenant Lee's father is coming.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,580
 Why didn't you tell me?

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,730
 About my father, the presidential candidate? Or my father, the man in the camcorder?

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,180
 Communications just contacted us, and they said the CCTV captured a girl entering the DMZ alone!

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,230
 Didn't you feel something was different about him, compared to the target we killed?

27
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,190
 So that means there is another target?

28
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,720
 10-year-old Cheon Soo Yeong from the village is missing. The North Star Special Missions Force will begin searching.

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,190
 We're in the middle of an operation. Why are you here?

30
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,750
 They found Soo Yeong.

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,190
 Soo Yeong! Who's Ajussi?

32
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,300
 There's a high chance he is the host of the previous target.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,210
 There's something different about this target.

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,880
 We have to prove that we are in the same boat.

35
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,200
 Dae Sik, did you think I would not know?

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,570
 A video has been revealed of the guns fired during the 1997 DMZ incident.

37
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,640
 Assemblyman Lee Hyeok and Commander Han Dae Sik's statements

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,750
 are completely different, raising questions.

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,330
Wow, apparently this is the full video. Isn't that crazy?
   Episode 9

40
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,020
 You better erase this video.

41
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,240
 Wow, your wife is quite the beauty!

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,500
 Why are you filming this?

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,470
Hey, wait. Rewind that.

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,420
Stop.

45
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,290
What's wrong?

46
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,880
That person... that's your mother.

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,640
Shit.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,960

49
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,140
What happened?

50
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,320
Tell me.

51
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,300
Tell me. Answer me, bastard!

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,800
Sergeant Yong, stop.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,470
Are you crazy?

54
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,710
What are you doing?

55
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,830
Jeez.

56
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,640
Lieutenant Lee. Come.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,330
What's happened with Sergeant Yong?

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,820
It's personal. I'll take care of it.

59
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,130
I asked what happened, Lieutenant Lee.

60
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,280
Captain. Please take me out of this operation.

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,400
What?

62
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,440
I'll quit.

63
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,470
Please report it to the higher-ups.

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
I don't have confidence anymore.

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,810
I make the decisions. Be ready.

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,130
Please.

67
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,540
Are you the one who leaked the video?

68
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,750
Sergeant Yong's anger is not about the content of the video,

69
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,850
but that you deceived him.

70
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,400
Please confess.

71
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,880
That won't change who killed Sergeant Yong's father.

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,490
It's useless.

73
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,200
I don't agree.

74
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,720
Ms. Hee Ra.

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,780
 Dong Jin. I'm sorry.

76
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,210
What are you sorry for?

77
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,550
I'm sorry for lying to you.

78
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,940
I feel so wronged, Mom.

79
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,950
Don't you?

80
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,490
Mom, how did you bear this burden by yourself?

81
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:51,260
Dong Jin. I'm really sorry.

82
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,210
Don't be sorry anymore.

83
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,510
Mom, you won't need to be sorry in the future.

84
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,300
It must be hard, but please tell us.

85
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,510
I'm fine. It's not hard.

86
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,410
First, thank you for giving us the exclusive rights to cover this.

87
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,300
I'm curious about something.

88
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,930
What happened to that video?

89
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,430
We received a tip.

90
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,540
I don't know who sent it, but...

91
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,610
Did you know the late Commander Han Dae Sik?

92
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,560
Yes. After the incident in 1997,

93
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,710
a couple of months later,

94
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:17,370
he said he was a subordinate who looked into what happened to Min Gook.

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,190
Then he told me that Min Gook died.

96
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:27,820
After that, he visited us once a year for a while but stopped coming.

97
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,810
Recently, he came back and just ate before leaving again

98
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,980
with no other explanation.

99
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,080
 Noona. Isn't that Commander Han Dae Sik?

100
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,680
 What's up? It's been over ten years since he last visited.

101
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,460
 It's so unexpected.

102
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,610
I did get a strange feeling that day.

103
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,040
What about Assemblyman Lee Hyeok?

104
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,130
After the incident in 97, I went looking for him

105
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,140
because he was friends with Min Gook.

106
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,090
 Let me speak to him just once.

107
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,440
 Lieutenant Lee Hyeok was friends with my husband. Just let me see him once!

108
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,540
 There's no way that would happen! Why would my husband do that?

109
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,330
 Dong Jin and I are here, why would he leave us?

110
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:26,440
 Nobody believes me. Lieutenant Lee, you were his friend! Answer me!

111
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,450
After that, there were many times

112
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,500
I tried to meet him, but I was rejected each time.

113
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,510
Prepare for the press conference.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,070
At first, I wanted to know the truth,

115
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,880
but eventually, I had no choice but to give up.

116
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,630
Because I needed to raise a child.

117
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,570
I couldn't raise him as the son of a man who voluntarily defected to North Korea.

118
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,330
It was obvious what would happen to him.

119
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,530
So I entered him in my younger brother's family registry.

120
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,920
So he took the last name of his uncle. And he grew up properly and became a good person.

121
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,620
My son.

122
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,130
My son...

123
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,570
Please protect my son.

124
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,810
Are you okay?

125
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,170
I didn't know I'd learn about my father like this.

126
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,880
Now that I think about it, there's not much I know about him.

127
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,130
I asked my mom once

128
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,560
when I was younger,

129
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,000
but she didn't answer me.

130
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,770
That night,

131
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,890
I heard my mom crying.

132
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,670
I decided not to ask her again.

133
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,670
 Your wife is quite the beauty!

134
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,030
 Why are you filming this?

135
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,020
 I think Choco hates me.

136
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,970
 That's not it.

137
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,440
 I just want to be kind to Choco.

138
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,200
 You can show him your heart

139
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,850
 slowly, through your actions.

140
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,470
That video...

141
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,200
I leaked it.

142
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,340
Why did you do it?

143
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,680
I couldn't just leave it.

144
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,520
I'm sincerely sorry.

145
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,500
Well, it's not like you shot my father.

146
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,950
Don't ever forgive

147
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,680
my father.

148
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,490
 Search

149
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,750
Soo Yeong, take a spoonful.

150
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,270
What side dish do you want?

151
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,160
- This one.
 - Potatoes? Okay.

152
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,640
Good girl.

153
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,390
I think I better find another job.

154
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:07,100
- Why all of a sudden? 
- The '97 DMZ incident.

155
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,640
Lieutenant Jo Min Gook didn't defect to North Korea,

156
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,130
so all this time I've been saying something that wasn't true, as a museum commentator.

157
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,240
Hey, you can't quit that easily. Chew well.

158
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,340
If there's something wrong, you can just correct it.

159
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,810
Yeah. That can be meaningful, too.

160
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,670
For Captain Jo's family's sake, at the very least.

161
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,490
It's itchy.

162
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,220
Hey! Don't scratch it.

163
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,710
Uh oh, look at the scratches!

164
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,990
This won't do.

165
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,930
-  Ms. Hee Ra, what are you doing?  
- Preparing to open the restaurant.

166
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,340
You should rest a bit.

167
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,270
It's just another day. Nothing's changed.

168
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,170
It's not like your father has come back to life.

169
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,320
Are reporters bothering you?

170
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,160
I'm fine.

171
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,200
Your uncle is a great bodyguard.

172
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,900
There aren't many more days left until I can be your bodyguard.

173
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,470
Okay. Complete your mission and come back safely. That's my son.

174
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,930
I told your father this

175
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,070
on that day, too.

176
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,580
But that man didn't complete his mission or come back to me.

177
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:37,500
So you have to come back after completing your mission. Okay?

178
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,270
Okay.

179
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,150
See you at home.

180
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,580
 One, two, three. Kimchi!

181
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,740
Yes, I got your call.

182
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,610
Who is this?

183
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,350
Assemblyman, it's your son.

184
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,700
You bastard, where are you?

185
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,100
 It's your first time talking to me, right?

186
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,760
 Who are you?

187
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,600
- Why did you do it? 
- What?

188
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm going to reveal everything that happened that day.

189
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,700
You...

190
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,250
Who are you?

191
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,370
Captain Jo Min Gook of the South Korean military

192
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,210
is my father's name. I'm Yong Dong Jin.

193
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,960
 We'll have to push the DMZ event.

194
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,200
 We meet again, Military Dog Handler.

195
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,540
 Sergeant Yong Dong Jin!

196
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,820
So this bastard is...

197
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,870
Jo Min Gook's son?

198
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,990
 Assemblyman Lee Hyeok alleges the '97 footage was fabricated.

199
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,900
 Commander Choi Gi Seok

200
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,580
Unity. This is Captain Song Min Gyu.

201
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,080
You've been busy kissing up to both Assemblyman Lee Hyeok and the Commander.

202
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,700
- No, sir. 
- No, my ass.

203
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,100
Be careful. You just have to trust the Assemblyman.

204
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,610
We sent supplies to the village.

205
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:27,610
Yes, sir. I'll make sure to complete this operation and return.

206
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,360
I heard you guys are leaving after this operation.

207
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,990
Yes, sir. We're preparing to leave.

208
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,850
Don't worry about us.

209
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,110
I'm not that worried.

210
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,970
This operation will be hard.

211
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,990
- This is for you. 
- What's this?

212
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,360
Soo Yeong said to give this to the good looking oppa. It's for Maek.

213
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,780
Wow, I'm grateful.

214
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,520
Maek, eat this and don't be scared this time during the mission.

215
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,910
Okay.

216
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,850
Good girl.

217
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,540
Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong returned to HQ today.

218
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,570
Lieutenant Son Ye Rim will act as the assistant team leader for today's operation.

219
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,670
Then I'll begin the briefing.

220
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,810
This is the internal structure of the building Sergeant Yong has sketched.

221
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,220
Like you can see, the passageway to the basement is structured like that.

222
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,010
It'll be hard to get a visual or predict movement.

223
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,760
If we can't do that, it'll be hard to carry out the mission.

224
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,280
Yes. So why don't we install lights at the second entryway?

225
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,790
Lights?

226
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,610
Last time, it was hard to see the target from the place where we rescued Soo Yeong.

227
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,550
So for each room, at the entry, exit, and passageways,

228
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,620
we should install lights and space them out.

229
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,920
Then Sergeants Park and Yong, prepare to install the lights.

230
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,530
Okay.

231
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,660
As you know, for both the slain target and the contaminated wild dog

232
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,930
the same substance was detected during analysis.

233
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,210
Until now we had suspected a radioactive substance.

234
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,480
But although our team members were directly exposed during our last mission in which the target was killed,

235
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,280
we did not suffer from acute radiation syndrome.

236
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,000
As a result, we will need to capture the target alive for a detailed investigation.

237
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,830
The goal of today's operation is to eliminate the target.

238
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,040
Meaning, do not hesitate to shoot the target.

239
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,670
Team Leader, live capture of the target is our number one priority.

240
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,550
The commanders theorize it was North Korea's acts.

241
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,690
And after Staff Sergeant Joo was attacked by the target, he was seriously wounded.

242
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,940
The higher-ups made the order. We have no choice.

243
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:01,040
Carefully check the newly distributed gear, and exactly one hour from now we will start the mission.

244
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,630
Any questions?

245
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,500
None, sir.

246
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,620
What is it?

247
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,810
Please reconsider.

248
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,470
It was an order.

249
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,510
Whose order?

250
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,290
Let me tell you again, this is under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces CBR Defense Command.

251
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,430
I will file a report.

252
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,120
How many times must I tell you that it's our superiors' decision?

253
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,320
You must proceed according to official CRB procedure.

254
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,590
Do you want to be dropped from the operation?

255
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,220
Do you really think I don't know that you plan to find the substance and use it improperly?

256
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,100
Because of that one selfish ambition of yours, you're willing to lead innocent civilians and soldiers to their deaths?

257
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,650
If you keep causing problems, I will also report you to the superior office for disobeying orders.

258
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,930
You can go now.

259
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,860
As instructed, by tomorrow 6 am.

260
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,620
I've restricted communications in Gate 7, 329 GP, and all of Cheongong-ri.

261
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,880
No one will know about this operation in Sector 21.

262
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,800
Good. You did well.

263
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,710
I am giving you only one day to complete this operation.

264
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,640
Don't worry.

265
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,560
I want justice.

266
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,390
Justice, I said.

267
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,030
That boy.

268
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,610
What the hell do you think you are doing, you punk?

269
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,690
What are you planning to do?

270
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,990
What?

271
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,500
Did you also kill General Han Dae Sik?

272
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,330
Joon Seong.

273
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,870
Do you distrust your father so much?

274
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,380
I even lost my leg.

275
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,570
I exchanged my leg for his life.

276
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,690
After all that I did to save him!

277
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,210
How could have I known that he was doing such a terrible thing?

278
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,640
These are all lies from the groups that oppose me!

279
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,670
Please come to your senses, my boy!

280
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,600
Please!

281
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,110
There was only one reason I wanted to be a soldier.

282
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,160
To be acknowledged by you, Father.

283
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,130
But, now...

284
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,910
It means nothing to me.

285
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,740
Joon Seong. Lee Joon Seong!

286
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,200
Sunbaenim.

287
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,100
Where are you going?

288
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,810
Looks like we won't meet here again.

289
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,700
After this operation, I'll return to my original base.

290
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,330
Oh no, we will miss you.

291
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,160
Please come to my mom's restaurant later.

292
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,340
Yes, we'll make sure to stop by when Soo Yeong goes to the university hospital.

293
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,850
Unity!

294
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,570
Soo Yeong.

295
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,860
Doesn't this look good on me?

296
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,660
Has her skin condition improved?

297
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,540
No, it's the same.

298
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,520
I better take her to the university hospital.

299
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,380
Don't get hurt, okay?

300
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,050
Yes, thanks.

301
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,420
- See you later.
 - Okay.

302
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,090
Keep up the hard work.

303
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,790
It's on the house.

304
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,750
Thank you for the food.

305
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,520
It's so nice to hear that you served along with my Dong Jin.

306
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,410
But, how are you here?

307
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,280
Sergeant Yong bragged about his mom's cooking so much, so I thought I'd visit.

308
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,610
Is there any child who doesn't like his mom's cooking?

309
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,840
No, it's really delicious.

310
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,150
My son may seem aloof, but he's a thoughtful and filial son.

311
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,660
He never caused any trouble while he attended school

312
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,250
and he studied well, and he's going to become a veterinarian.

313
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,780
Ah, I miss him. He must be having a difficult time these days.

314
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,370
But, we will meet soon.

315
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,550
He said he'd be discharged right after his last mission.

316
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,390
Did he say he was going on his last mission?

317
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,910
Yes.

318
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,480
 No one will know about this operation in Sector 21.

319
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,000
 Good job. I am giving you only one day to complete this operation.

320
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,340
 Don't worry.

321
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,440
 I want justice.

322
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,410
 Justice, I said.

323
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,930
Something came up suddenly, so I better get going. I enjoyed the food.

324
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,320
No, no, no, you don't have to pay.

325
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,300
Then I will definitely come back later.

326
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,140
Sure.

327
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,340
The operation you're going to carry out today is to protect the security and peace of the DMZ.

328
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,680
Yes, we'll keep that in mind.

329
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,060
Sergeant Yong.

330
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,900
You can eliminate anything that interferes with carrying out the operation.

331
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,990
You will all become true patriots of the nation.

332
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,660
- Understood? 
- Yes, sir!

333
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,790
Nothing out of the ordinary.

334
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,480
Confirmed.

335
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,230
Maek, heel. Come here.

336
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,210
- Sergeant First Class Park. 
- Yes?

337
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,840
- Guard the first floor.
 - I understand.

338
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,760
Maek, heel.

339
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,980
We will each move into the planned positions.

340
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,890
Maek, heel.

341
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,660
Come here.

342
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,020
Ko Sang Min.

343
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,610
Maek, heel.

344
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,800
I'm sure it's here.

345
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,320
Everyone, assemble.

346
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,930
The passage to each room is more difficult than expected, and the field of vision is limited.

347
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,600
Once we complete installing the lights, we will continue to inspect the inside and outside of the building.

348
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,980
It appears that the target knows the interior of this building well.

349
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,450
It is certain that this is the target's hiding place.

350
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,980
I think it would be best to lie in ambush and capture the target alive rather than inspect the outside.

351
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,030
Then I will go observe the first floor to watch for trespassers and the movements of the target.

352
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,680
No, I'll do that.

353
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,150
Sergeant First Class Park, work on installing the lights.

354
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,460
I will go observe the underground rooms.

355
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,820
Sergeant First Class Park, please take charge of this location.

356
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,550
I will return here after the lights have been installed.

357
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,630
I understand.

358
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,770
 First / Stop

359
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,530
 I'm sure it's in the basement of this building.

360
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,060
What are you thinking about?

361
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:46,990
Coming here, I suddenly thought about my father.

362
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,790
It's strange that we came here.

363
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:55,910
And why it's the same location as the 1997 DMA incident. Isn't that a bit strange?

364
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,800
The skeleton we saw was more discolored than the previous target

365
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,050
and it was an old North Korean soldier's uniform.

366
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,380
Right.

367
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,740
So that would mean that many years have passed.

368
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,610
Just what did happen here?

369
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,730
The truth is, Soo Yeong's fist bump greeting, too...

370
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,190
Something about this place feels familiar.

371
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,730
Fist bump greeting.

372
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,200
When I was young, I was scared of dogs.

373
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,020
So Father taught me how to become friends with them.

374
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,820
 No, you're scared, so that's why Choco is scared, too.

375
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:01,550
 You just have to show your heart with your body movements, slowly.

376
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:08,200
My memory isn't clear, but every time we said goodbye,

377
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,350
I think we always did a fist bump greeting.

378
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,300
Well, it's very vague. I'm not sure.

379
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,090
A military dog handler who used to fear dogs? How fun.

380
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,170
I know, right?

381
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,940
Do you remember that time when we had a fight?

382
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:48,290
I didn't realize it then, but thinking back,

383
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,770
you were always sensitive whenever anyone brought up your father.

384
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,530
Yes, that's true.

385
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,930
The new special mission force will be on standby at HQ.

386
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,690
When you find where it is, open one extra communication channel and standby.

387
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,660
They already all withdrew?

388
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,040
Captain Song Min Gyu said he will send a signal right away when he finds the object.

389
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,460
We were able to connect with Captain Song Min Gyu by radio.

390
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,930
This is Scorpion, answer North Star.

391
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,470
North Star, confirmed.

392
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,900
What's going on?

393
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,090
I've confirmed the location.

394
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,460
Are you sure?

395
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,750
Yes, I am sure.

396
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:59,130
Got it. Wait for my next command.

397
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,270
Yes, I understand.

398
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,410
Yes, it's been taken care of.

399
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,500
We've destroyed anything that could become evidence.

400
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,700
Are you sure?

401
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,230
Yes.

402
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,040
Good.

403
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,770
Let's go.

404
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,850
What are you doing here? You should be judged by the law.

405
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,180
Take care of this.

406
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,100
Look here.

407
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,840
Let's withdraw.

408
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:05,570
 Sector 21 Vicinity

409
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,500
This bastard, Han Wook,

410
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,830
do you think we can catch him?

411
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:16,070
Shut up. We're just going where Han Wook tried to go.

412
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,580
We won't catch Han Wook. He's probably done for—

413
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,810
So that is why we're looking for a way to survive, aren't we?

414
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,750
Hurry and follow.

415
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,700
Is it over there?

416
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,090
There.

417
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,710
 We are entering.

418
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,340
I'm ready.

419
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,630
What?

420
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,390
How can such a complicated place become the target's hideout?

421
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:06,420
Who knows? Maybe the target possesses powers of perception.

422
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,670
Let's go in.

423
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,210
Comrade, this isn't the situation for us to enter.

424
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,730
Stop saying such weak things.

425
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,640
We need to find out however we can, don't we?

426
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,490
What are you doing?

427
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,340
Isn't this South Korean territory?

428
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,130
Does anyone own this land? The one who sets foot on it first is the owner.

429
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,040
But you should still be careful. You don't know what is in there.

430
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,130
I cannot go.

431
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,500
Are you crazy? Do you want to die?

432
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,330
You reactionary bastard, what do you think you are doing?

433
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,140
I told you, I cannot go in there.

434
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,860
I will tell our superiors everything you've done.

435
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,740
Alright.

436
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,150
Put your guns down.

437
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,200
Put your guns down, I said.

438
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:31,480
Let's withdraw, make our report, and then proceed.

439
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,800
You put your gun down.

440
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,290
Let's go.

441
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,550
You bastard.

442
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,370
I never liked you.

443
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:01,560
If you don't want to all die, stay alert.

444
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,170
Oh, s**t.

445
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,000
Follow me!

446
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:35,080
I couldn't confirm this before, but there is another passage out.

447
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,990
Team Leader,  there is another exit.

448
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,780
 Got it.

449
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,120
What is this?

450
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,070
Make sure to not touch it.

451
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,050
 One, two, three. Kimchi.

452
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,330
 Stop.

453
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,670
 Complete your mission and come home. Okay?

454
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:44,520
 Yes, see you at home.

455
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,740
 - Everyone report your positions.
 - Basement, Section 1.

456
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,420
It's near the exit.

457
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:16,050
Everyone assemble on the first floor. Four enemies are approaching, they appear to be DMZ police.

458
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,180
We will go up right away.

459
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,130
Yes, I understand.

460
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,670
Sergeant Yong, we must move now.

461
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,510
Sergeant Yong?

462
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,570
Raise your hand. If you move, I will shoot.

463
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,280
Can you help me?

464
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,640
I'm Dong Jin.

465
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,130
Do you remember this picture?

466
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,010
It's Ms. Hee Ra.

467
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,240
The bleeding has been controlled, so you will be okay.

468
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,100
Thank you.

469
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,080
How did you get in here?

470
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,910
We shouldn't have come

471
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:39,300
but we came to catch that traitor bastard...

472
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,790
There is a traitor in here?

473
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:49,100
Yes, that traitor

474
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,770
said he has some amazing item, and he even deserted the army

475
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:57,000
and kept wandering around.

476
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,700
Then he came to the central agency and brought us

477
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,690
and we had to wander around to catch this traitor

478
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,250
and that monster got our comrade.

479
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,450
Do you know what that item is?

480
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:18,800
According to the guy in the central agency,

481
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:25,160
in 1997, the central agency was planning to do a grand thing for the cause,

482
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:30,680
but a married couple of researchers took the key material and deserted the army. That is all I know.

483
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,410
And he said that they took that thing and disappeared in here.

484
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,190
But I cannot believe him.

485
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,360
Please send me back to the North.

486
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,670
I will go quietly.

487
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,880
Please wait here for a moment.

488
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:23,190
We're in combat. Hurry and come up.

489
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,340
What are you doing?

490
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,410
Hurry and kill them!

491
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,500
Maek, go outside.

492
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:06,080
We're battling with the North.

493
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,010
Be careful.

494
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,010
Stop shooting. Stop shooting.

495
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,430
 First floor. Domination complete.

496
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,110
Go.

497
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:16,910
Clear.

498
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,640
Put your gun down.

499
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,450
What?

500
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,600
Put your gun down!

501
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,830
Who are those people?

502
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:42,610
They are support troops who have the same goal as we do. The situation was urgent, so I requested them to come.

503
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,490
Wasn't this operation just for our team?

504
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,720
You never told us about additional members.

505
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,550
It's the Team Leader's judgment. Do you have a problem with that?

506
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,780
How will you report this combat situation?

507
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,080
While carrying out duties as usual in the demilitarized zone, when faced an unforeseen encounter,

508
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,550
our opponent can be eliminated according to the rules of combat.

509
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,250
Is that enough?

510
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:32,820

511
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:52,240
 Come here, Choco.

512
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,770
 Come here, Choco.

513
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,920
 Come here, Choco.

514
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:05,650
 Oh, I'm tired.

515
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,610
 You try it.

516
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,790
 - Me?
 - Yes.

517
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:15,070
 Yes, I accept your command.

518
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,060
 My son.

519
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,910
 What's wrong?

520
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:21,980
 I don't think Choco likes me.

521
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,890
 What?

522
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:27,000
 No, that's not true. You are scared, Dong Jin,

523
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,120
 so Choco is scared, too.

524
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,110
 Animals are just like humans.

525
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:34,740
 They like people who are good to them.

526
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,550
 I want to be good to him.

527
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:42,240
 Show that heart to him with your movements.

528
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,030
 Here, hold this,

529
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:48,690
 and hold out your hand to Choco slowly.

530
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,780
 There.

531
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,630
 Then sit like this

532
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,210
 and look into Choco's eyes slowly.

533
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,290
 Your eyes are so cute.

534
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:07,250
 There. Choco looked in your eyes, too.

535
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,420
 One, two, three.

536
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,010
 Kimchi.

537
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,340
 My son, I have to go to a nighttime military operation.

538
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,450
 Next time, I promise to play with you all day long.

539
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,680
 Even if Dad isn't here, he's always watching you, Dong Jin. You know that, don't you?

540
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,610
 What did Dad say?

541
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,850
 Ta-da.

542
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,470
 Be well with your mom.

543
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,990
 Dad will be right back. Okay?

544
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,270
 Search

545
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:09,900
 This wasn't an operation for just us?

546
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,220
 This is for just in case.

547
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,930
 The incident in Sector 21 is definitely related to this.

548
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:18,050
 I found it. That guy had it.

549
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:21,040
 Begin the elimination mission.

550
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,990
 All this is for the Great Cause.

551
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,770
 Land Mine Removal Team. Answer me.

552
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,260
 Ye Rim?

553
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,540
 Drop your gun!
