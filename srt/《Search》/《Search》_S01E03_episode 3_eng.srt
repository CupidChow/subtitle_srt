I think we lost the target.

Team Leader. Team Leader?

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,900
Where am I?

32
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,820
Maek.

33
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,120
We should find the team soon.

34
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,520
Maek, let's go!

35
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,880
 Sector two-one, missing person!

36
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,490
Unpack and we'll have a meeting in 30 minutes.

37
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,430
Yes, sir.

38
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,190
Look at the state of this dog house.

39
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,500
In.

40
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,160
That crazy lunatic was a captain?

41
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,360
I thought he was going to the Military Court. What if he's some kind of murderer? Why's he here?

42
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,730
And I have to continue to be near that lunatic?

43
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,820
Maek. I'm screwed.

44
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,560
By any chance, do you want to sleep with me?

45
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,090
Huh?

46
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,830
 First Lieutenant Son Ye Rim

47
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,710
 I missed your call. Is something wrong?

48
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,420
 Is something wrong? (Formal)

49
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,020
 Is something wrong? (Informal)

50
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,460
- This is unexpected.
 - Huh?

51
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,730
The elite CBR team's First Lieutenant Son is scared of needles.

52
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,730
Is there some story behind this?

53
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,490
Well...

54
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,180
Look at you, not telling me again.

55
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Lieutenant, sometimes I'm sad that you refuse to talk about yourself.

56
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,240
Do I do that?

57
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,820
Yes, that's right. Always.

58
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,980
Since I was young, what scared me most was needles.

59
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,630
I wasn't scared of much, but needles were scary.

60
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,450
Your parents must have had a hard time taking you to the hospital.

61
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,940
Yes.

62
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,960
I was the most scared of my dad.

63
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,930
Nagging, nagging, nagging.

64
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,420
I'll tell them to test it right away, so don't worry too much.

65
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,930
Okay.

66
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,760
- Thank you!
 - Yes.

67
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,230
Hey, military dog handler.

68
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,120
You came as a member of the special mission force?

69
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,060
Unity.

70
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,210
Yes, that's right.

71
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,810
Where's Captain Song Min Gyu?

72
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,770
He's inside.

73
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,500
Maek, heel!

74
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,250
Heel.

75
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,920
Hey. You must have had a great time in the military.

76
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,190
Yes, well, I did get lucky.

77
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,900
The dogs don't bite?

78
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,870
They usually don't.

79
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,410
Ready!

80
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,930
Good!

81
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,130
Good. Nice, Maek!

82
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,290
If you do this, she can bite.

83
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,230
Here.

84
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,220
Give me the ball.

85
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,260
You can head straight inside.

86
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,500
 Sergeant Yong Dong Jin

87
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,250
 Staff Sergeant Joo Moon Cheol

88
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,230
- Unity!
- Take a seat.

89
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,060
Yes, sir.

90
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,170
Company Commander, does this operation include reconnaissance and an ambush?

91
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,630
Hunting.

92
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,090
It'll be resolved as soon as we get drones in the air, right?

93
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,710
Yes, sir. But drone operations in the DMZ are impossible.

94
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,160
The area is under the control of CFC and there is a possibility that it may lead to conflict with the North

95
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,520
I got permission from the higher-ups.

96
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,830
Really? Then you don't have to worry.

97
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,880
If we can get drones up in the air, the hunt will be quick.

98
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,920
It won't even take a week.

99
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,720
I like your fighting spirit, Staff Sergeant Joo.

100
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,000
I will be sure to set up a reconnaissance drone with three surveillance cameras at a distance.

101
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,530
You'll know when you see it, but it has a wide field of view as well as a monitoring function.

102
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,090
So it will easily cover most of the main operation area.

103
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,630
Are your younger siblings attending school well?

104
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,410
Yes, sir!

105
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,370
I'm always thankful to you.

106
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,860
Thankful, it's nothing.

107
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,360
I heard you recommended me as a signaller, so I came right away without knowing what the operation was about.

108
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,480
What do you mean you don't know what it's about? I know you know it.

109
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,110
But who are the other members?

110
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,210
You're the only one I recommended. The rest were picked by the higher-ups.

111
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,570
Deputy Team Leader, Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong. He is a martial artist of distinction.

112
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,080
Sniper, firearms and explosives expert, Sergeant First Class Park Gi Hyeong.

113
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,270
And military dog handler, Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

114
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,640
Good! Good, Maek!

115
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,030
This is the action camera video taken from the dog's vest.

116
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,770
During the mission, the dog handler here saw the target and was the handler for the dog who passed away.

117
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,870
Since this team is a group of the most elite troops,

118
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,910
Dog Handler, you will act in a way that doesn't interfere with the mission.

119
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,590
Leo! Leo!

120
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,730
Leo, get up.

121
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,360
In this mission, the enemy will be annihilated within a week.

122
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,930
Our goal is to kill the unidentified person in the video.

123
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,800
Sergeant Yong, did you see the target directly?

124
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,390
What?

125
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,260
It was brief, but I did.

126
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,450
Is he a North Korean soldier?

127
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,380
I couldn't confirm that, but he was wearing a military uniform.

128
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,680
There's no way he's our soldier.

129
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,820
Why do we need to know that? It's all over when we capture him or kill him.

130
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,680
Staff Sergeant Joo is right. That's our only goal.

131
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,930
First, find out the target's movement.

132
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,550
He has been seen here, and here. Use these areas to find him, no matter what.

133
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,010
In addition, you will all be equipped with silencers for a possible battle situation.

134
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,780
Do we shoot to kill as soon as we see him?

135
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,100
Yes.

136
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,580
Then it should be all over with just one bullet.

137
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,320
Then will the search operation turn into a night ambush operation?

138
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,190
You will withdraw without lying in ambush, for now.

139
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,040
Analyze the topography and predict where the target will be.

140
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,320
Focus on setting up the unmanned surveillance cameras.

141
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,940
It won't take that long if we make good use of the observation devices.

142
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,400
It won't take more than one day.

143
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,870
Yes, let's not drag it out. It's a simple mission.

144
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,050
Once the enemy is annihilated, return to base immediately.

145
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,060
Everyone inspect your own equipment.

146
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,130
We will leave for our mission at 5 am tomorrow.

147
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,040
So that the Cheongong-ri villagers' lives are not disturbed,

148
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,950
don't say or do anything that may create unnecessary tension or fear.

149
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,040
Until the mission is complete, pretend to be a mine disposal squad.

150
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,340
Understood?

151
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,540
Understood.

152
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,010
These are the briefings of each operation.

153
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,170
Read them thoroughly and tonight by 10 pm,

154
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,550
they should all be destroyed under the Assistant Company Commander's command.

155
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,890
The paper next to you it is for your Last Will and Testament.

156
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,160
If anybody would like to withdraw from the mission, you may leave.

157
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,560
 Last Will and Testament

158
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,790
This is an important mission, but this is a bit bleak.

159
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,320
Right. We introduced ourselves to each other already.

160
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm Staff Sergeant Joo Moon Cheol.

161
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,630
Where are you from?

162
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,180
We're from the Special Forces Regiment, and he's from the Recon Battalion.

163
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,720
I'm in charge of recon and observation at the regiment company.

164
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,840
Drones specialist?

165
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,550
No, sir. It was just a little drone training after special forces training.

166
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,970
No wonder. Kids today are different.

167
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,230
Okay, let's do this.

168
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,100
These are just formalities.

169
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,690
Looking at the video, you must have been traumatized.

170
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,570
If you need my help, let me know.

171
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,260
Thank you, sir.

172
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,830
Something's on the monitor.

173
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,310
- What?
 - Is it Sergeant Yong?

174
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,020
- I can't confirm.
 - What's the location?

175
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,220
At 10 o'clock.

176
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,720
Isn't Sergeant Yong at 2 o'clock?

177
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,440
It's not Sergeant Yong. I don't see Maek, he's moving alone.

178
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,460
- Is it not the target?
 - It's a possibility.

179
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,640
We'll go to 10 o'clock. It might be the target.

180
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,800
Captain. Shouldn't we save Sergeant Yong first?

181
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,100
Assistant Company Commander, What's our mission?

182
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,910
We found the target, but are you saying you're not going to go?

183
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,360
Our teammate disappeared. I can't just leave him.

184
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,220
Sergeant Yong is a dog handler.

185
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,330
With the dog, he can make it back to the base.

186
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,060
We'll go after the target.

187
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,330
- Sergeant Joo. 
- Yes?

188
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,020
- Conceal our equipment.
 - Yes, sir.

189
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,370
 22 hours before the disappearance of Sergeant Yong

190
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,200
 Get the target quickly. Within a week.

191
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,330
 And if you find anything in Sector two-one,

192
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,740
 don't report it. Bring it straight to me.

193
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,680
 There's something more to this mission than just shooting the target.

194
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,550
 I have to find out what that is.

195
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,670
 Three days earlier, the day of Corporal Oh's disappearance

196
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,490
Unity.

197
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,510
 Comply with Regulations

198
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,100
We got in touch with Private Kwon's family.

199
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,900
But the family is wondering about the cause of death.

200
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,330
When the results come out, of course we should tell them.

201
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,570
It's just not out yet.

202
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,290
Yes, sir.

203
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,190
What about Corporal Oh?

204
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,110
Corporal Oh Jin Taek does not have any family.

205
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,420
We did find some extended family, so we are trying to contact them.

206
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,830
Take care of him.

207
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,250
Yes, sir.

208
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,040
Captain. Is it true that you're going to be investigated?

209
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,560
You are expected to get promoted to major in one month.

210
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,210
I'll be back.

211
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,060
And this. These were found on the scene.

212
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,910
They said it fell to the ground.

213
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,550
Did you check the contents?

214
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,900
I looked through it quickly, but I didn't see anything special.

215
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,290
We suspect they belonged to Corporal Oh or Private Kwon.

216
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,080
- Unity. You called for me?
 - Yeah.

217
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,950
Test the drone for radius and maximum observation time and then report back to me.

218
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,860
Yes, sir.

219
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,050
 It's the same. The map that came from Corporal Oh

220
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,640
 and this one are the same.

221
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,990
 How did Corporal Oh come back to life?

222
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,120
 Corporal Oh and the wild dogs were both infected with the same virus.

223
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,160
 I think there's a clue there.

224
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,780
The results on your blood came out.

225
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,060
There's nothing unusual.

226
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,840
So it would indicate that the virus doesn't transfer from person to person.

227
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,580
What are you going to do?

228
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,180
I was thinking of injecting some serum into this dead rat.

229
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,660
And?

230
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,600
I'm wondering if this is right.

231
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,310
It's not that difficult.

232
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,260
Wait!

233
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,550
Dragon Snake! Dragon Snake!

234
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,780
What?

235
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,620
What are you guys doing here?

236
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,280
We were relocated to the mine removal team.

237
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,930
I wasn't sure if you were here, but it's so good to see you!

238
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,300
I told you that he was here.

239
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,000
Wow, it's so good to see you, you bastards!

240
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,710
- I finally have lackeys!
 - What?

241
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,770
If you have any difficulties, let us know.

242
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,490
Of course, punk. Where are you guys sleeping? Stay with me.

243
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,870
Hey! Sleep with me!

244
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,030
What?

245
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,540
It's me!

246
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,490
Bbong Rak! Bbong Rak!

247
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,040
I have to feed Sergeant Yong until he's discharged!

248
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,860
I think I can finally live!

249
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,680
Bbong Rak!

250
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,390
Then I'll start making a communication line.

251
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,940
Go! You should work!

252
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,790
What do you want to eat?

253
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,720
I don't need to eat. Where are you sleeping? Stay with me!

254
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,420
- When did they go missing?
 - I don't know.

255
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,530
I went outside for a moment, then all the chickens disappeared.

256
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,950
How many did you have originally?

257
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,300
This whole pen was full of hens, but now they are all gone.

258
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,390
That is strange.

259
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,830
What about your wife? She didn't hear anything?

260
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,850
That damn TV. She said she couldn't hear anything over the TV.

261
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:29,090
Right here! They must have escaped through the hole!

262
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,190
Hyungnim. Our chickens are homebodies, they don't even go over there.

263
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,540
- What kind of chickens are homebodies? 
- It's true!

264
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,580
Hyungnim is right about that.

265
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,420
Aren't you being silly?

266
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,100
Wait.

267
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,480
Look, there is blood.

268
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,930
Looking at this,

269
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:53,500
It wasn't ripped open from the inside. It happened from the outside. So how did they come in here?

270
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,280
Did they fly in? Jump?

271
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,070
I've tried this before.

272
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,260
This hole. This hole is the problem.

273
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,630
I guess we won't be able to sleep tonight.

274
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,840
She's the type that can't stand being curious.

275
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,920
So why did you come? What are you doing this for?

276
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,730
I'm the village leader, I'll figure it out by myself.

277
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,430
It doesn't make sense medically.

278
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,230
I think we need to take a molecular biological approach.

279
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,570
It's clear that mutation of RNA has caused genetic changes.

280
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,320
I think that a thermal chemical reaction in the brain caused the deceased to come back to life.

281
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,110
Corporal Oh, and the lab rat, too.

282
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,830
When we cut off that part of the brain, they died for real.

283
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,210
This has never been reported to the academic community.

284
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,800
How do we explain this?

285
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,620
What about the risk of infection?

286
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,710
Up to now, we conclude that there is none.

287
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,020
But Corporal Oh's saliva got in my wound.

288
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,080
Her test results are completely normal.

289
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,800
But I will continue to monitor it.

290
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,640
We have to confirm whether or not the virus can be transmitted from person to person.

291
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,940
Yes.

292
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,110
Write a report for now.

293
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,030
If we are not careful, this can spread outside the DMZ to the general population.

294
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,380
Yes, sir.

295
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,920
What happened?

296
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,390
 A strong and prosperous nation relies on itself!

297
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,860
Hey!

298
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,530
Maek, I think we've crossed into North Korea.
  A strong and prosperous nation relies on itself!

299
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,110
Calm down. You can do it.

300
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,010
Heel.

301
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,160
No matter how we look at it,

302
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,940
it's too fast.

303
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,770
Comrade Han Wook risked his life by defecting to the south.

304
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,460
Why's he just standing there?

305
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,780
Hey! If you're so curious, go capture him yourself.

306
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,410
Punk.

307
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,040
What do we do? Do we report it?

308
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,910
If the higher-ups find out,

309
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,490
we're the ones who will die

310
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,310
- before we find Han Wook! 
- Hey, punk!

311
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,060
What happened? Did you see Han Wook?

312
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,590
- Well— 
- Comrade,

313
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,010
we'll die at this rate.

314
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,080
Let's head back for today, and come back tomorrow—

315
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,110
You bastard!

316
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,540
What are you saying?

317
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,780
Are you taking responsibility?

318
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,550
Look over there too.

319
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,700
 Hey, you better return quickly!

320
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,420
 Yes, sir!

321
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,870
Maek! Shh!

322
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,390
Hey! What are you doing?

323
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,600
Come quickly! Hurry!

324
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,190
Yes, sir!

325
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,140
 19 hours before the disappearance of Sergeant Yong

326
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,470
Maek, what's wrong?

327
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,650
Damn. That bastard!

328
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,580
- Are you okay?
 - Ah, Dragon Snake, ouch.

329
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,900
I slipped while trying to fix the communications line.

330
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,330
You should have been careful, punk!

331
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,270
Sorry.

332
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,700
No need to be sorry. Your bone's not broken?

333
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,380
- I don't think so. 
- Get up.

334
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,770
What's wrong?

335
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,550
Damn.

336
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,350
What?

337
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,420
- The drone operation will be difficult.
 - Why?

338
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,130
I think the North is interfering with our radio.

339
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,560
We didn't mess with theirs.

340
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
I didn't think of that.

341
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,910
I'll look into other options.

342
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,550
Hurry. We don't have much time.

343
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,330
Yes, sir. Captain?

344
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,040
Sorry. Team Leader.

345
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,520
Dog Handler Yong is deserting.

346
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,290
Why did you move alone?

347
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,720
Private First Class Seo Byeok Joon had collapsed, so I went to help him.

348
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,520
Without reporting it? Alone?

349
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,680
It was an emergency, so, I was going to take care of it first—

350
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,910
If you're a dog handler, just handle dogs.

351
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,060
Don't act rashly. Report everything. Understood?

352
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,470
Yes, sir.

353
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,470
Take responsibility for acting on your own.

354
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,240
So you have no objections to receiving punishment for that, do you?

355
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,680
No, sir.

356
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,710
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin. Are you being like this because you're close to your discharge date?

357
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,640
Sir, I—

358
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,270
Sorry. I ordered him to go.

359
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,640
I made the decision to take care of the injured first.

360
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,020
So you ordered it.

361
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,930
Fine.

362
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,530
In the future, I'll punish you immediately for leaving your station.

363
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:24,100
You will take responsibility in the future, too.

364
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,990
Yes, sir.

365
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,420
Lieutenant Lee. Thank you.

366
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,050
Don't mention it.

367
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,170
Be careful next time.

368
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,540
How's Private Seo?

369
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,780
We haven't even got a medic yet.

370
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,700
There's a local health center here. Shouldn't he go there?

371
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,100
I'll report it.

372
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,220
Yes, sir. Thank you.

373
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,210
The emergency aid was done well.

374
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,530
Our sergeant did it for me.

375
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,670
- Is that right?
 - Yes.

376
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,260
Let's see.

377
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,320
It's a slight sprain. You'll be fine after some rest.

378
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,800
Yes, sir.

379
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
Are you still looking for mines?

380
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,750
What? Ah, yes.

381
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,950
Yes, we're looking.

382
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,070
I'll get you some ice packs, so follow me.

383
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay.

384
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,540
I'll get going.

385
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,320
Okay.

386
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,980
 Doctor Baek, this is Ye Rim.

387
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,120
 I know you're in Cheongong-ri.

388
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,220
 I want to talk to you.

389
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,040
What?

390
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,810
Why the long face, when you're such a good-looking young man?

391
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,770
Did you get dumped?

392
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,390
Yeah, I got dumped.

393
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,470
Aigoo. Why were you dumped?

394
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,730
Is your personality trash?

395
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,770
Yeah, my personality must be trash.

396
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,860
You don't seem like it.

397
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,220
Hey, Oppa. Do you want to go out with me?

398
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,370
What?

399
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,540
My mom married well. I want to marry well, too.

400
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,190
My standards are high.

401
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,540
Let's see...

402
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,720
Hey.

403
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm ahjussi to you, not oppa.

404
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,060
And I'm older than you think.

405
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,750
You do look a little old, but you are just my style.

406
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,370
If you were just born a little later...

407
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,530
Kid. What's your name?

408
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,710
Cheon Soo Yeong.

409
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,720
Cheon Soo Young. That's a pretty name.

410
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,310
Oppa, what's your name?

411
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,340
Do you see it here? Yong Dong Jin.

412
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,210
Cool!

413
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,510
We're all done.

414
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,870
Are you his guardian?

415
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,460
Yes. What are you doing? I'll hold it for you.

416
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,120
It's an ice pack.

417
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,710
So is he okay?

418
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,700
Yes.

419
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,940
The doctor said I just need to rest a little.

420
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,920
That's a relief. Let's go.

421
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,420
Okay.

422
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,700
We will get going. Unity!

423
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,020
See you later.

424
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,510
Goodbye.

425
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,360
Hey, Cheon Soo Yeong!

426
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,950
- Daughter!
 - Why are you out here?

427
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,090
Huh?

428
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,940
I was itchy?

429
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,430
Really, I came to see the doctor cause I was itchy.

430
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,880
Should we go in to check?

431
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
The doctor is off work now.

432
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,920
I told you I'd send you to get military discipline training if you keep this up.

433
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,070
I won't do this anymore, starting tomorrow.

434
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,870
Aigoo.

435
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,520
Mom, I saw a really handsome oppa.

436
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,220
Are there any oppas like that in our neighborhood?

437
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,730
They're all octopus-looking guys.

438
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,410
Over there! The guy who came looking for mines.

439
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,720
- He said he came for that?
 - Yep.

440
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,520
Where did you meet him?

441
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,570
Just now, in the health center.

442
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,160
Oh, they don't have a medic yet.

443
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,080
How can a dead person come back to life?

444
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,950
The description of the phenomenon is right there. Rather than coming back to life,

445
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,780
we've concluded that it's temporary symptoms of brain activity.

446
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,960
Is this possible?

447
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,320
Is this possible?

448
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,610
I witnessed it myself.

449
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,330
Am I insane, or are you messing with me?

450
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,920
Be logical, logical! Does this make sense? Who would believe this?

451
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,250
So? Is there a possibility of infection?

452
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,910
There was transmission between animals and humans,

453
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,540
but it hasn't happened from human to human, yet.

454
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,230
Lieutenant Son Ye Rim herself was tested.

455
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,470
Who's that?

456
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,840
The lieutenant who reported via video last time.

457
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,480
Oh, her?

458
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,850
Why don't we send Lieutenant Son Ye Rim to Polar Star Special Missions Force?

459
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,890
If the DMZ target has the same symptoms,

460
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,900
what Lieutenant Son learned seems important.

461
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,290
Send her in.

462
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,850
Yes, sir.

463
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,510
- Turn the lights off on your way out. 
- Yes, sir.

464
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,780
Aigoo.

465
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,160
 I missed your phone call. Is something wrong?

466
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,190
Who's "Traitor"?

467
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,180
No, no. Hey.

468
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,020
Go inside first if you have something to do.

469
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,240
Who's "Traitor"?

470
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,920
Go inside, I said!

471
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,600
Yes, sir. Be careful.

472
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,360
Why's he so nosy?

473
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,270
Yeah, what?

474
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,430
I called because I thought you'd be waiting for my call.

475
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,750
Well, as an old friend,

476
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,650
I called because I was worried.

477
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,050
You usually don't even call at all during work. So when Son Ye Rim calls you,

478
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,050
that means something huge happened. That's why I called you back.

479
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,890
 Are you listening to me?

480
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,680
 Hello, Lieutenant Son?

481
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,190
Nothing's wrong. Bye.

482
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,290
What?

483
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,360
I worried for her as a fellow soldier, but look at her manners!

484
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,420
Unity!

485
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,510
Lieutenant Son. Do you have your combat uniform?

486
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,560
Yes, sir.

487
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,920
An order came for the DMZ operation.

488
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,900
You'll be joining sector two-one's task force in an hour.

489
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,670
As soon as you're ready, join them.

490
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,340
Yes, sir.

491
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,280
 KCST

492
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,560
 Radiation Meter

493
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,420
Where on earth is this?

494
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,370
That's a South Korean bastard!

495
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,660
- Get him!
 - Maek, heel.

496
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,000
Heel!

497
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,320
- It's not friendly troops.
 - It's the North Koreans.

498
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,290
Check the monitor.

499
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,840
Yes, sir.

500
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,750
Stop!

501
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,070
That bastard!

502
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,200
South Korean bastard!

503
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,980
I don't see anything.

504
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,030
We'll move towards the target.

505
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:06,410
Team Leader. Looking at Sergeant Yong's location of disappearance and the sound of the bullets,

506
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,160
I think Sergeant Yong is closer.

507
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,840
Assistant Company Commander, I won't repeat myself. The target is first.

508
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,780
Move to the target's location.

509
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,480
It's okay, it's okay.

510
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,930
Run! Hurry and run!

511
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,290
That way!

512
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,380
Look straight!

513
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,890
What?

514
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,390
Shit.

515
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,150
This won't do.

516
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,600
You can find my teammates, right?

517
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,960
The people dressed just like me.

518
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,080
You can find them, right? Go head that way.

519
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,660
Go! Go!

520
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,360
Go. Stay there.

521
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,010
 12 hours before the disappearance of Sergeant Yong

522
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,460
- Sit.
 - Yes, sir.

523
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,810
- The drone keeps failing?
 - Yes.

524
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:04,410
The North is interfering with our signals.

525
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,720
What about the camera?

526
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,680
That's also a bit vague. We decided to install them all anyway.

527
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,460
We will have to think of other ways to observe.

528
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,090
Sergeant Yong. Is the target that fast?

529
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,220
Yes, sir. About the speed of an elk?

530
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,630
What? An elk? That's it?

531
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,380
An elk can go 70 kph. They are really fast.

532
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,750
Staff Sergeant Joo! That's the curfew siren of Cheongong-ri.

533
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,890
Calm down.

534
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,820
The curfew in the DMZ village is from 10 pm to 5 am.

535
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,310
Is that right?

536
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,010
I'll collect these briefing materials.

537
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,900
Yes, sir!

538
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,340
Yes.

539
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,160
Lieutenant. I think you're a bit different than what I thought.

540
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,020
Really?

541
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:38,330
Your first impression is a bit sharp, but you're quite considerate.

542
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:44,340
So you're saying I look prickly, but my personality isn't?

543
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,180
Are you blood type A?

544
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,920
Sorry. I'm B.

545
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:17,430
I'm really curious. What year were you born, Staff Sergeant Joo?

546
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,400
Why do you want to know?

547
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,390
I was just curious.

548
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,680
I'm 22. Why?

549
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,260
What?

550
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,800
- So you enlisted as soon as you graduated high school, huh?
 - Yes.

551
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,180
I graduated from a military specialization high school.

552
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,460
- Born in 99?
 - I've dreamed of being a soldier since I was young.

553
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,420
Hey!

554
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,930
Sorry. That's so cool.

555
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,320
Why was that your childhood dream?

556
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,800
I wanted to fire a gun. That feeling when you pull the trigger is the best!

557
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,440
Don't joke around.

558
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,440
It's true.

559
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,030
What about you, Sergeant Park?

560
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:05,570
My father and grandfather were both noncommissioned officers.

561
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,510
So I just naturally became a soldier.

562
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:15,160
Sergeant Park, you're a soldier down to your bones. After all, shooting a gun isn't all about posing.

563
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,530
Are you saying that for me to hear?

564
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,030
No, sir. I'm complimenting Sergeant Park.

565
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,260
But all I heard is you saying that I'm only a soldier on the outside.

566
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:28,130
Staff Sergeant Joo. That's what they call a guilty conscience.

567
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,450
You're acting up cause your discharge date is coming up, right?

568
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,820
That's enough now.

569
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,840
The maknae about to get discharged picked the fight first.

570
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,360
The sergeant who's close to being discharged is always the scariest, to me.

571
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,560
Let's sleep, Staff Sergeant Joo!

572
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,160
Today's mission is to familiarize yourself with landmarks

573
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,290
and set up surveillance cameras where you believe the target may move.

574
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:13,560
If we see the target during our operation, shoot the target on sight.

575
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,560
- Understood?
 - Yes, sir!

576
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,900
Supporting soldiers are on standby. Deploy.

577
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,270
Bye.

578
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,790
It's not working.

579
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,410
Then just install cameras in the main spots.

580
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,680
Yes, sir.

581
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,320
- Dog handler.
 - Yes, sir?

582
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,090
- Take the lead.
 - Yes, sir.

583
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,380
Let's move.

584
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,950
Staff Sergeant Joo! Is this your first operation in the DMZ?

585
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:47,920
What are you talking about?

586
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,320
There are over 2,000 species of insects, 2,000 species of plants, and 50 species of mammals living in the DMZ.

587
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:59,520
Of the 260 endangered species on the Korean peninsula, about 100 of them live in the DMZ.

588
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,850
You must not step on anything, touch anything, or kill anything. Got it?

589
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,960
Yes—  (Formal)

590
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,900
No. I got it  (Informal) .

591
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,900
You don't know the value of life.

592
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,920
Be careful!

593
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,570
Team Leader? Installation complete.

594
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,680
Got it. We'll gather at the rendezvous and head to the search area.

595
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,840
 Sergeant Yong will patrol ahead with his dog.

596
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,510
 If you find the target, wait there and report.

597
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,860
Team Leader. Something came in the 2 o'clock direction.

598
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,690
Stay in formation.

599
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,570
- Target found ahead.
 - Are you sure?

600
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,120
I'm sure. The movement is the same as last time.

601
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,350
Isn't it the North Koreans?

602
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,450
It's the target for sure?

603
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,900
Sergeant Yong, are you sure it's the target?

604
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,120
Sergeant Yong! Sergeant Yong!

605
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,340
Sergeant Yong's communication is down. I think he's too far.

606
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,280
I'll find him and bring him back.

607
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,730
No. Stand your ground.

608
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,210
We have to find Sergeant Yong.

609
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,080
Let's determine the situation before we move.

610
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,780
Hey! Stop! If you move, I'll shoot!

611
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,240
Team Leader. I'll use my weapon. I found the target. Maek!

612
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,420
Sign! Good boy.

613
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,340
Team Leader. If I don't shoot, I'll lose the target.

614
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,470
Maek!

615
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,600
We have to find that bastard!

616
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,950
Attention!

617
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,440
- Unity.
 - Unity.

618
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,190
Unity.

619
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,660
I think I've met you before.

620
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,220
Yes. I was there when we looked for the missing person at GP 329.

621
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,730
Where are the special forces right now?

622
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,970
I couldn't hear you.

623
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,320
Where are the special forces?

624
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,920
They began at 5 am and are scheduled to withdraw at 12 pm. Including the military dog handler, there are five people in total.

625
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,670
The dog handler is Sergeant Yeong Dong Jin— No, Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

626
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,970
Yong Dong Jin?

627
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,680
Yes.

628
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,040
This is communications security.

629
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,460
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin is missing?

630
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,030
Don't move!

631
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,750
Put your hands up.

632
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:05,070
What's a South Korean bastard doing here?

633
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:11,370
I lost my way.

634
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:17,490
Are you aware of the rules of engagement at the DMZ?

635
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:22,130
Yes, well, I'm aware. But—

636
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,610
What are you doing, Comrade?

637
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,550
He knows the rules. Then shoot him.

638
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:31,390
Wait! I really just got lost.

639
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:34,490
I'll just—

640
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,650
Bastard!

641
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:39,530
Lee Seong Kwon, you shoot him.

642
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,040
Shoot him!

643
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,250
Shoot it!

644
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,280
Team Leader. I think we found Sergeant Yong.

645
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,870
Team Leader!

646
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,290
Sergeant Yong Dong Jin is missing?

647
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,230
What are you doing?

648
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,030
Are you going to go alone?

649
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,280
I don't think you should do this.

650
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,640
Be careful!

651
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:41,480

652
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,290
Listen carefully. Don't laugh.

653
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:08,920
♫ I always found my mom's love awkward ♫

654
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:15,380
♫ Is that why? It's always hard ♫

655
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:21,870
♫ Even in my greed of not wanting to lose you. ♫

656
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:27,100
♫ There was a little beauty in there ♫

657
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:34,770
♫ I'm happy now. That's why I'm anxious ♫

658
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:41,430
♫ Right before the storm, the ocean is calm ♫

659
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:47,830
♫ Can't catch on fire and burn quickly ♫

660
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:52,460
♫ I'm cheering for love ♫

661
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:58,370
♫  Youthful us  ♫

662
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:05,300
♫  Our age is not that apparent  ♫

663
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,470
♫  Because of the bright lights  ♫

664
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:18,090
♫  Our eyes are getting blinded  ♫

665
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,500
 Search

666
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,330
 He disappeared like smoke, no trace of him left.

667
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,640
 Team Leader. There's a way to subdue the target.

668
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,320
 Maek and I will lure him.

669
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,040
 Fire!

670
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,930
 He is definitely not human.

671
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,350
 Are you saying the target is some kind of monster?

672
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:51,580
 Don't be dramatic.

673
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,380
 It's more serious than we thought.

674
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,930
 We will retreat only this once. We will catch it at all costs.

675
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,600
 HQ... The target...

676
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,860
 Say that again! Seo Baek Joon!

677
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,100
 The target is at HQ. Everybody go back!
