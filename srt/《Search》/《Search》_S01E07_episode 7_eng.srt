 Assemblyman Lee, the target has been shot and killed.

I think you know what happens when military secrets are leaked to the public.

What happened today was a military secret.

17
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,490
Please make sure.

18
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,790
I got it.

19
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,130
Let's return.

20
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,020
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,070
Are you okay?

22
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,040
I'm fine.

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,380
But I'm curious about a lot of things.

24
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,950
I'm sorry. I can't tell you.

25
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,820
Okay. I'll make my own deductions.

26
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,200
Sunbae. Thank you. You were a big help to the operation.

27
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,160
I just did what I could do.

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,740
Sergeant Yong, that soldier is probably looking down from heaven. Relax.

29
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,860
Okay.

30
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,720

33
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,860
- Good work. 
- Likewise, Assistant Team Leader Lee.

34
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,780
Captain.

35
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,580
We're back.

36
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,710
Good work, everyone. I'm sorry I couldn't go with you.

37
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll return with the target's body.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,920
You worked with us, you should have a last meal before you leave.

39
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,600
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,340
Captain, you should have come and seen the target collapsing yourself.

41
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
You can say that again.

42
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,260
I was terrified because things went awry from the very start.

43
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,970
Sergeant First Class Park, it was really close, wasn't it?

44
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,370
Yeah, it really was.

45
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,220
Lieutenant Lee, is your ankle okay? Shouldn't you go to the health center?

46
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,540
I'm fine. I'll take care of it myself.

47
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,380
- Good work.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,300
Maek, have you been well?

49
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,030
Maek heel, come here!

50
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,260
Good girl. Heel! Good.

51
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,020
Are you okay?

52
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,320
You've worked hard. It's all over now.

53
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,720
Yeah. What about the info I requested?

54
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,910
 Commander Han Dae Sik has had a successful military career since the Sector 21 operation, right?

55
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,660
 There were some North Korean superior officers who were going to defect at that time.

56
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,120
 Senior Colonel Ko Sang Min and Major Ri Kyeong Hee.

57
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,960
 Senior Colonel Ko Sang Min is MIA and Major Ri Kyeong Hee died during the sector two-one operation.

58
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,950
 Maybe what the commander is looking for has something to do with that operation?

59
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,670
 I think Senior Colonel Ko Sang Min was trying to bring something to the South.

60
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:16,750
 I doubt he came empty-handed when he defected.

61
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,010
Thanks for all your help.

62
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,900
Something... Something?

63
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,630
1997... Sector Two-One...

64
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,310
 Commander Han Dae Sik

65
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,790
1997, Sector Two-One. Commander Han Dae Sik?

66
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,960
Unity. This is Captain Song Min Gyu.

67
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,630
What kind of bastard are you?

68
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,530
I was about to report to you. Target has been clearly hit and eliminated.

69
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,490
 - Camcorder! 
 - What?

70
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,610
I told you to bring it to me as soon as you found it.

71
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,490
Hey, you traitorous bastard. How long have you been working with Lee Hyeok?

72
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,450
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,300
This is why you can't work with people who don't know the fundamentals. Get over here immediately.

74
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,200
Yes, sir.

75
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,180
Camcorder?

76
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,990
 It is a military supply item that was lost in '97.

77
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,450
1997?

78
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,800
Sector Two-One, 1997.

79
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,610
Ms. Hee Ra, it's me. The operation is over.

80
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,810
Hello? Ms. Hee Ra?

81
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,540
 Why did you suddenly ask about your father?

82
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,700
 What does your father do?

83
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,550
 My mom runs the restaurant with my uncle. My father is gone.

84
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,630
 Sorry.

85
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,480
 Why are you sorry? It's not like you knew.

86
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,640
 My father has always played at home.

87
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,500
 That's why I'm always curious about what other fathers do.

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,710
 What a thing to be curious about.

89
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,260
 - Yes, I guess so.
 - So weird.

90
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,170
Did you have another nightmare? I shouldn't have asked.

91
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:40,650
I just... since I came to the military, I was curious. You know how men are.

92
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,040
 He was a good father.

93
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:52,240
To be honest, I remember a little of him. Not in detail, though.

94
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,310
And Ms. Hee Ra, I...

95
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,050
I...

96
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,340
I'm sorry for making you upset when I was younger.

97
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,160
I wanted to tell you then, but it took me ten years.

98
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,210
 My son, you've matured since you went into the military. What do you want to eat?

99
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,470
 When you are discharged, I'll show off my cooking skills.

100
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,890
It's fine. I used your credit card a lot.

101
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,090
Tell Uncle I said hello.

102
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,690
And both of you, please stop drinking.

103
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,880
Okay. Bye!

104
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,220
 Byeok Joon's Mother

105
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,960
Hello, Ma'am? This is Sergeant Yong Dong Jin.

106
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,630
Yes, yes.

107
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,710
We caught the wild dog that killed Byeok Joon.

108
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,630
Yes.

109
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,270
Yes, well. Don't worry too much.

110
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,320
We're all fine. Yes.

111
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,790
Come on out!

112
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,350
Please return home safely.

113
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,540
- Jong Ho.
 - You be careful of your wrist.

114
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,480
- Soo Yeong!
 - Mommy!

115
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,740
- This worked out well. 
 - Doctor.

116
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,830
Goodbye, sir.

117
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,850
What happened? We were so worried.

118
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,870
You've been worrying a lot about me recently.

119
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,720
I thought you weren't coming because of me.

120
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,820
Why wouldn't I come because of you?

121
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,880
Because I whined earlier.

122
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,500
Are you still itchy?

123
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm not itchy, but it's weird.

124
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,870
When are the test results coming out?

125
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,640
I asked them to do it as soon as possible.

126
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,800
Good job. Let's go home.

127
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,910
Were you scared without Gamja?

128
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,300
Daddy did it for her instead.

129
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,960
Did you get hurt?

130
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,210
Yes, just a bit.

131
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,500
It's going to sting if you get water on it.

132
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm trying to be careful.

133
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,080
Gosh.

134
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,710
How about you, Sergeant Yong?

135
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,030
I did get scratched up a bit, but I'm fine.

136
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,950
Take good care of your injuries.

137
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,620
Yes, sir.

138
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,330
Lieutenant Lee, did you see that camcorder from last time?

139
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,140
Camcorder?

140
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,580
Oh, that. I didn't see it.

141
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,630
I put it in my storage locker, but it disappeared.

142
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,640
Who would take something from your storage locker?

143
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,170
Besides, everyone was busy because of the operation.

144
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,200
I definitely placed it there.

145
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,130
Maybe you placed it somewhere else.

146
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,960
That's a military supply item, so I thought I'd report it to Captain.

147
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,680
You know, the video we got from it —

148
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,970
It seemed like a training recording to me. Don't worry too much about it.

149
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,560
No, it couldn't be. That was a real situation.

150
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,100
In my opinion, the 1997 DMZ case was fabricated.

151
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,530
That's not possible.

152
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,170
That's why this is such a valuable video.

153
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,880
That guy is pretending to be a national hero.

154
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,880
He killed his fellow soldiers and he's even running for the presidency.

155
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,820
We have to release this information, but we lost our evidence!

156
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,430
Aren't you overinterpreting things?

157
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,680
We finished the operation successfully, so you should head home.

158
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,380
That's more important, don't you think?

159
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,960
Here. You all worked so hard,

161
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,470
so I prepared a dish with the authentic tastes of Florence, Italy.

162
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,300
It is tomato spaghetti bolognese.

163
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,440
I would be "moo-cheok (mucho) gracias" if you all enjoy it.

164
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,830
You worked hard, man!

165
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,110
Enjoy!

166
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,830
You've all worked hard today. Enjoy our last meal before we return to our unit.

167
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,590
- Yes, sir! 
- Bon appetit!

168
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,910
Bon appetit!

169
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,610
Sergeant Choi, you should open a restaurant when you're discharged.

170
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,380
Before that, I'm considering gaining some experience at Sergeant Yong's mother's restaurant.

171
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,520
Your mother runs a restaurant?

172
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,590
- Yes. 
- Where?

173
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,470
The Samjung Intersection. It's near a very popular area.

174
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,400
I'll stop by when I'm on leave.

175
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,490
Please do.

176
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,640
First Lieutenant Son, will you be going with us?

177
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,150
If I have time, I suppose.

178
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,770
If you all come to our restaurant, in celebration of my discharge,

179
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,180
it will be my treat, courtesy of my mom. Please come.

180
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,890
What will you do when you're discharged, Sergeant Yong?

181
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,810
There's a rescue center for wild animals.

182
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,650
I'll be working there. I'll also be helping out at the restaurant.

183
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,980
You already found a job? That's cool, man.

184
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,220
Staff Sergeant Joo and I thought finding military jobs would be the best.

185
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,900
That's right.

186
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,510
Oh, yeah. Sergeant First Class Park, when is your wedding date? I heard from Staff Sergeant Joo.

187
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,940
Huh?

188
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,050
You're getting married? What the heck?

189
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,920
Yes. I will be getting married soon, yes.

190
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,520
Are you all right?

191
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,110
What?

192
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,870
Oh, yeah.

193
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,050
- You guys are good, too? 
- Yes, sir.

194
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,180
Well, feel free to let me know if something bothers you.

195
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:35,080
Hey, Honey. I'm doing fine, of course.

196
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,260
I'm sorry for making you do the wedding planning yourself.

197
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,620
Okay, once I get paid I'll buy you the clothes dryer this time.

198
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,920
- Congratulations, Sergeant First Class Park. 
- Thank you.

199
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,240
Why didn't you tell us?

200
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,810
Well, things were hectic the past few days,

201
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,660
and I guess I lost the right timing.

202
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,360
But, I think I was with you for a couple of months. Anyone else?

203
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,330
Yeah, I guess

204
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,740
I've taken part in many operations, but I've never done anything like this before.

205
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,980
So I think this will be an operation I'll never forget.

206
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,660
First Lieutenant Son, when will we see you again?

207
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:36,050
Hey, hey, hey! What do you all think about having a reunion at Sergeant First Class Park's wedding?

208
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,460
How about it, First Lieutenant Son?

209
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,510
Please send me an invitation.

210
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,090
I will.

211
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,160
Team Leader! It's our last day, so please give a speech.

212
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,530
- Yes, say something! 
- Give a speech!

213
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,970
Forget all the conflicts we may have had during our operations.

214
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,590
Just remember the success we obtained through our teamwork. Good work.

215
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,180
- Thank you, sir! 
- Thank you!

216
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,220
Eat up, everyone! Though I wasn't the one who prepared this.

217
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,030
Go back safely, and have a good discharge.

218
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,940
It was only for a few days, but it was nice to see you.

219
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,640
Are we not going to see each other again?

220
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,420
We have no reason to.

221
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,170
I'll call you once I'm discharged, so pick up.

222
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,410
It's because I have something to say. Not now,

223
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:04,090
but as a civilian.

224
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,690
Sure.

225
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,120
Go.

226
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,560

234
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,400
 Here. Teacher Baek from the Community Health Center said to give this to you.

235
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,670
 Happy birthday. I debated sending this for a long time. It's the reason I've stopped you from joining the military for a long time.

Has the target's body arrived?

241
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,890
I'll be there right away.

242
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,550
The cause of death is the severing of the brain stem. Very accurate.

243
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,780
That was no ordinary skill.

244
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,130
Sergeant Yong is no ordinary search team member.

245
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,600
Sergeant Yong?

246
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,650
Ah, the member who stabbed him with the bayonet.

247
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,820
We got the test results.

248
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,730
It matches the blood and cell samples that were collected at 329 GP.

249
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,360
It even matches all the other materials that were collected.

250
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,160
This is definitely the target we were examining before.

251
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,370
He also matches the shoe prints that were found at 329 GP.

252
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,570
He's not going to suddenly wake and bolt up, he is?

253
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,940
I've confirmed it.

254
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,360
Oh, just thinking about it...

255
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,610
Ah, if you look here, his bite mark is the same as Corporal Oh.

256
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,710
Yes, it's certain that both the target and Corporal Oh were both infected by wild dogs.

257
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,930
We estimate that only one wild dog was infected at this time.

258
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,290
If other wild dogs were infected, we would have more infected victims.

259
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,070
But we haven't confirmed any more.

260
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:11,080
It appears that the target was deserting and met that particular wild dog.

261
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,010
We just don't know where he was infected.

262
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:25,860
Do you think it's the blood that we collected in Sector 21?

263
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,490
You are correct. If you look here,

264
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,970
I told you, the same substance was found on everyone, right?

265
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,850
But from the wild dog, I even found the DNA of the blood from the last sample.

266
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,740
There were no bite marks on the wild dog.

267
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:50,700
So we can interpret that the wild dog was infected by a spray of fluid from the host.

268
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,750
So the rabies did cause a mutation.

269
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,750
And we've confirmed that a host exists.

270
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,250
But what I'm curious about is the status of the host.

271
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,400
The mutation happened because the wild dog was infected with rabies.

272
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,410
So the host may not have any rabies at all.

273
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,090
Right.

274
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,540
In any case, this means it's not over.

275
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,440
Have you seen anything else besides the target?

276
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,510
No, I have not.

281
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,910
 Yes, that man...

282
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,150
 Ah, never mind. I'll speak to you again about it later.

283
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,440

284
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,810
"The defection from 1997, is that really fabricated?"

285
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,920
It appears that at that time, his survivors even demonstrated, saying that he would never do that.

286
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,410
I remember seeing that on the news while I was a college student.

287
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,250
I think he had a wife.

288
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,570
And there were those who wondered why he would defect to the North leaving behind a wife and young son.

289
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,740
I see.

290
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,930
I heard that she still lives in Seoul.

291
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,940
And there were quite a few who helped the survivors.

292
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,980
I think people are talking about this again because of the upcoming presidential election.

I hear your father's coming, Lieutenant Lee?

322
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,860
How about we begin preparations? A guest is coming.

323
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,230
Is your father Assemblyman Lee Hyeok?

324
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,590
 It's that the video camera filmed people dying.

325
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,880
 And it seems that National Defense Commissioner Lee Hyeok is also there.

326
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,520
 I'm not sure who shot the gun, but I think he was definitely there.

327
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,930
 Sergeant Yong. We're in the middle of an operation, so let's take some rest for now. You can watch this later.

328
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:10,560
 Wasn't it Assemblyman Lee Hyeok who survived the incident back then?

329
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,770
 This has no relation to us, does it?

330
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,580
 Catching the target is our top priority.

331
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,000
Lieutenant Lee?

332
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,020
 Cheongong-ri Village Hall

333
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,410
Is he someone famous?

334
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,240
If things go well for him, he could even become President of Korea.

335
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,930
Hello.

336
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,970
I heard that you've contributed so much to a recent military operation.

337
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,990
You are all amazing.

338
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,110
Thank you.

339
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,300
We only did what we should.

340
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,120
Village Leader?

341
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,830
Yes, I am the village leader.

342
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:29,100
Such a young village leader. You are so cool.

343
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,670
And you, Mr. Candidate, you look much cooler in person.

344
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:40,040
That pose of a hero comes so naturally for you.

345
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,000
Is that so?

346
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,230
I must say, I don't dislike hearing that.

347
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,510
Yes.

348
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,140
I am honored to meet you.

349
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,090
You've been working hard.

350
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,590
- Our oldest resident.
 - Aigoo, Elder.

351
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,730
Who is that?

352
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,430
Let's ask him to take a picture with our Soo Yeong.

353
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,700
- What timing. 
 - Yes, you've been working hard.

354
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,530
Hello, my name is Kim Da Jeong. I work as the curator of the DMZ Commemorative Hall.

355
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,350
So I must explain the 1997 DMZ incident several times a day.

356
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,210
Is that so?

357
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,450
My greatest supporter was right here.

358
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,010
Can we ask you to take a photo with our daughter?

359
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,090
- Oh, of course.
 - Thank you.

360
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,170
- What grade are you in, Princess?
 - Third grade.

361
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,190
- Ah, third grade.
 - Let me take that for you.
 - Oh, thank you.

362
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,920
Honey, come here.

363
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,600
Why? Come on, hurry.

364
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,130
Why won't you be in this picture?

365
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,220
One, two, three.

366
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,370
Thank you, Assemblyman.

367
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,640
Me too, please? Yes.

368
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,410
This is our mother.

369
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,410
Look there, smile, Mom.

370
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,100
One, two, three.

371
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,490
Lieutenant Lee?

372
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,880
What?

373
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,970
Why... why didn't you tell me before?

374
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,870
About my father the presidential candidate, and my father who is in that camcorder?

375
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,100
Why do I have to tell you about that?

376
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,180
There is no evidence that the video in the camcorder is authentic.

377
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,890
I would prefer that you don't try to make something of this.

378
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,520
Yong Dong Jin, please pretend you never saw that.

379
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,040
Lieutenant Lee, you seem like a different person right now.

380
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,520
Unity.

381
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,150
Members of the special task force, you've been working very hard.

382
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,600
Captain Song Min Gyu.

383
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,840
Song Min Gyu, Captain.

384
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,380
I have heard that you are doing a good job.

385
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,110
Thank you.

386
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,630
You've worked hard, Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong.

387
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,200
Lee Joon Seong, Lieutenant. Thank you.

388
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,170
You've worked hard.

389
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,410
Park Gi Hyeong, Sergeant First Class. Thank you.

390
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,520
You've worked hard.

391
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,710
Joo Moon Cheol, Staff Sergeant. I am honored.

392
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,790
We meet again.

393
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,180
Military dog handler.

394
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,810
Yong Dong Jin, Sergeant. Thank you.

395
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,130
I heard that you made a huge contribution to the operation.

396
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,120
Thank you.

397
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,740
And our military dog's name?

398
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,300
It's Maek.

399
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,950
Maek.

400
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,530
She looks imposing.

401
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,440
First Lieutenant Son from CBR Defense Command isn't here?

402
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,650
She returned to base along with the corpse of the target.

403
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,200
Is that right? Very professional, as expected.

404
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,900
Everyone, you've worked very hard.

405
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,030
You are all proud soldiers of the Korean military.

406
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,310
Are you sure that no one watched that video?

407
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,370
I am the only one who watched it.

408
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,210
Alright.

409
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,760
Indeed, the air of this area is the same as ever.

410
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,480
Have you thought about what I spoke to you about?

411
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,840
Yes, Minister? Do what do I owe this pleasure?

412
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,770
Yes, yes.

413
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,100
Yes, I know.

414
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,080
Yes.

415
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,110
Yes.

416
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,680
My children, you look great.

417
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,180
You should earn a star in place of your father.

418
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,770
 Candidate No. 3, Assemblyman Lee Hyeok
 Marketing himself as a patriot, he has risen quickly
 Does he truly deserve to be President of Korea?

419
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,180
 Military

420
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,940
I do remember.

421
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,040
That happened in 1997.

422
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:50,110
The commissioned officer from the North and the materials all disappeared.

423
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,750
No one could find them.

424
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,970
So you are saying, that still exists?

425
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,720
Yes, Commissioner.

426
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,750
What you are looking at is a report submitted by First Lieutenant Son Ye Rim.

427
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,600
The substance was detected on the target, and while the substance was on him,

428
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,360
he was bitten by a wild dog with rabies which caused a mutation. That is the conclusion of the report.

429
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,610
My speculation is that the substance is near Sector 21.

430
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,670
I don't know why the substance that disappeared in 1997 is suddenly detected now,

431
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,710
but doesn't that confirm that the substance is in that area?

432
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,510
So?

433
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,920
You're going to find that and bring it to me?

434
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,180
Yes, sir.

435
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,260
How does that benefit me?

436
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,430
A way to defend yourself.

437
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,830
Of course, I know that you have enough defenses now,

438
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:58,850
but one who possesses this and one who does not, there is a big difference, isn't there?

439
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,270
I assume that you know this better than I do.

440
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,120
What do you think of me?

441
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,940
I know that you used Lieutenant Lee to monitor me.

442
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,420
And now you'll come over to my side?

443
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,210
I wanted to from before.

444
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,580
I simply did not have a chance to meet with you.

445
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,870
What is it that you want?

446
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,610
I want to be a commander.

447
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,900
So you're betraying Han Dae Sik?

448
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,550
This is not about betraying anyone.

449
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,290
You grew up under reduced circumstances.

450
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,110
I know that you climbed up from the bottom.

451
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,220
Choi Gi Seok or Han Dae Sik.

452
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,600
You couldn't get much from them, could you?

453
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,710
 May I request one phone call?

454
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,820
 Phone call? Found someone who might help you?

455
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,900
 Chief of Staff, I request a phone call.

456
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,040
 Why did you call me?

457
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,030
 If I am omitted this time, I am dead.

458
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,880
 A company commander like you, involved in things like that? Were you trying to get on someone's good side?

459
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,610
 Let's end this with you taking the fall.

460
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,940
 Min Gyu, maybe I can get you a job in the defense industry?

461
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:27,040
 Chief of Staff, you know all that I've done for you.

462
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,820
 That is why I'm offering to help you find a job.

463
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:37,440
 If you don't finish this operation in 72 hours, you will be dismissed from the military. Got it?

464
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,080
 Yes, sir.

465
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:45,810
 Sh*t, you lost several men and you don't even know what hit you.

466
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,130
 Get out.

467
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,670
My survival is what is most important to me.

468
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,770
Of course.

469
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,890
A man should have at least this much fighting spirit.

470
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,050
Being swayed by emotions is not a good look.

471
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,370
I like you.

472
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,500
I give you all my loyalty.

473
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,000
Alright, bring it to me.

474
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,480
And rewrite this report.

475
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,130
Remove everything about the substance.

476
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,430
Yes, Assemblyman.

477
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,480
Team Leader.

478
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,570
We have to do the disbandment ceremony. Where are you going?

479
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,900
I'm going to division headquarters to make a report.

480
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,320
Assistant Team Leader, you take care of the disbandment ceremony.

481
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:15,020
You can have this. Leave this, and you can take all this.

482
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,640
- Where is Team Leader?
 - He is busy with something else, so I will be doing it.

483
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,910
Everyone at attention.

484
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,500
Unity.

485
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,030
Unity.

486
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,730
I, Sergeant First Class Park Gi Hyeong and six other members of the North Star Special Missions Force finished our mission and were ordered to return to our units.

487
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,920
This is my report.

488
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,350
Unity.

489
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,140
Unity.

490
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,170
Everyone worked hard.

491
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,390
Park Gi Hyeong, Sergeant First Class. You've worked hard.

492
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,120
You've worked hard.

493
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,820
Joo Moon Cheol, Staff Sergeant. You've worked hard.

494
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,670
You've worked hard.

495
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,040
Yong Dong Jin, Sergeant.

496
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,910
You've worked hard.

497
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,110
Yes, Teacher, hello.

498
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,730
Ah, yes, yes.

499
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,040
Soo Yeong didn't go to school?

500
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,010
Huh? That can't be.

501
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:08,280
I saw her going to school with her friends this morning.

502
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,050
Oh, it's a squirrel.

503
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,390
Soo Yeong.

504
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,150
Go ahead, I want to look at the squirrel first.

505
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,710
Hey, let's go.

506
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,180
She went somewhere by herself?

507
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,860
Oh, I'm sorry, Teacher.

508
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:29,480
I'll find her and bring her to school.

509
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,100
Ah, yes, thank you, Teacher.

510
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:38,040
This girl, she takes after her mom and just can't 'take the main road.'

511
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,750
She keeps going off in other directions.

512
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,630
 The call was not connected, so it will be connected to voicemail.

513
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,250
What?

514
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,010
 The call was not connected, so it will be connected to voicemail.

515
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,570
Yes, Honey?

516
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,510
What? She didn't go to school?

517
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,490
This girl, she went off somewhere?

518
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,960
Then...

519
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,060
Well, she'll be marked late again. You know that she takes after me.

520
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,430
Yes, find her and send her school. Okay.

521
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,450
Yes, Jae Sik?

522
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,220
Noonim, I got a call from the squadron,

523
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,320
and they saw a young girl going into the restricted area on CCTV video.

524
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,760
It sounds like Soo Yeong.

525
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,180
The call won't connect...

526
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,230
Try calling Soo Yeong, please.

527
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,820
I kept calling Hyung Min Jae, but he won't answer.

528
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,660
- Soo Yeong!
 - Soo Yeong!

529
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,710
- Soo Yeong!
 - Where did this girl go?

530
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,110
- Soo Yeong!
 - Soo Yeong!

531
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,970
- Soo Yeong!
 - Soo Yeong!

532
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,400
Just in case,

533
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,870
what if

534
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,040
she really went in there?

535
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,890
If she did, that is a big disaster.

536
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,860
That's what I'm saying.

537
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,960
But we don't know yet, so let's search every corner of the village.

538
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,410
Jong Man, you go that way, I'll go this way.

539
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,860
Soo Yeong!

540
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:49,500
I reported it, but I think it might take a little time.

541
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,190
What are you saying? We are desperate.

542
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,880
Honey, should we report to the police?

543
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,570
If not, should I use the speaker to broadcast first?

544
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,330
No, no, just go to the Village Hall, first.

545
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,570
Hurry. Oh, really!

546
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,580
Ah, ah. We are looking for a child, Cheon Soo Yeong.

547
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:15,620
If anyone has seen a young girl, Cheon Soo Yeong, please contact Cheon Min Jae and Kim Da Jeong.

548
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,910
Soo Yeong!

549
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,080
Soo Yeong?

550
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,140
- What? Do you know that kid?
 - Call your Mom and Dad!

551
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,800
Yes.

552
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,050
Sergeant Yong.

553
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,620
Seonbae.

554
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,330
Our Soo Yeong... Soo Yeong...

555
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,800
Our daughter went into the DMZ by herself, they said.

556
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,050
What can we do about this? Please help us.

557
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:42,690
We can't go in their ourselves. So what do we do? Please help us.

558
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,880
Secured communication. This is North Star. I am Assistant Team Leader, Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong.

559
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,620
Current time is 09:50. A young girl named Cheon Soo Yeong from Cheongong-ri is missing. All members

560
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,710
of the North Star Force will begin to search the restricted area.

561
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,240
That is all.

562
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,060
Oh, what is going on?

563
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,510
This is North Star.

564
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,410
Has Captain Song Min Gyu gone through Gate 8?

565
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,770
We have no record of Captain Song leaving through Gate 8.

566
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,090
What?

567
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,630
Captain Song didn't leave through Gate 8?

568
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,260
 What is the identity of the host?

569
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,030
 Green?

570
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,140
 Red eyes?

571
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,590
 He had green eyes.

572
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,760
 So there wasn't just one target. There were two.

573
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,410
 Yong Dong Jin

574
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,480
Yes?

575
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,060
Lieutenant Son, you know that little girl in Cheongong-Ri? Soo Yeong?

576
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,020
She went missing in the restricted area.

577
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,640
What's up?

578
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,530
Sergeant Yong, at the 329 operation,

579
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,800
do you remember when the target was right in front of us?

580
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,540
Yes, I remember.

581
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,640
Do you recall what is different about him and the target we caught?

582
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:53,940
Different?

583
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,520
It's another person... I mean, it's another target.

584
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,740
What do you mean?

585
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,290
Their eyes were a different color.

586
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,520
It wasn't the red eyes we thought. Think about it.

587
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,210
Do you remember now?

588
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,870
That means that there is another target.

589
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,550
I wasn't sure before, so I didn't tell you.

590
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:25,030
But I collected a different blood sample in Sector 21.

591
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:29,540
I first thought it was from a long time ago, from something that no longer exists.

592
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,640
But I think there is high possibility that the blood belongs to the host.

593
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,290
Got it.

594
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,190
Lieutenant Lee?

595
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,060
Lieutenant Lee?

596
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,230
There is another target, they say.

597
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,180
What?

598
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,120
Lieutenant Son just told me.

599
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,910
So I packed a speaker, for now.

600
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:16,250
Special Mission Force members, searching for the missing girl is important. But confirming the existence of the previously unconfirmed target is important too.

601
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,050
- Yes, sir.
 - Yes, sir.

602
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,600
That he wasn't previously detected by our investigation boundaries

603
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:26,800
means that he is somehow superior than the target we killed.

604
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,930
Make sure to not lower your guard.

605
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,720
Hold on a moment.

606
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:35,240
Are you saying there is another one of those?

607
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,810
We can't be sure right now. We are investigating with that possibility.

608
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,350
Then I will go, too.

609
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,930
- Honey.
 - Seonbae.

610
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,410
Civilians cannot go in there.

611
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,540
Please wait. We will make sure to find her.

612
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,170
How can a mom just stand by and watch when her child has disappeared?

613
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:55,230
I saw him, too. This is a more dangerous situation than before, isn't it?

614
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:57,910
Please let me go, I request it.

615
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,240
After thinking about it, she knows this area better than any of us.

616
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:13,360
And she is a former member of the elite 709 troop.

617
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,440
She will be helpful to our operation.

618
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:55,640
 Biohazard

619
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,580
Is your ankle healed, Lieutenant Lee?

620
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,470
It's fine now.

621
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,630
Thanks for your concern.

622
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,850
Maek, heel. Come here.

623
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,170
But where did Team Leader go, anyway?

624
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,700
That's right. He doesn't even answer our calls.

625
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,380
Maek.

626
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,440
You like Soo Yeong, too, don't you?

627
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,820
Based on Lieutenant Son's opinion, we must be on guard and proceed cautiously.

628
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,540
Staff Sergeant Joo, begin recording now.

629
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,620
Yes, sir.

630
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,570
I'm sure it will be fine.

631
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,770
It's done.

632
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,580
Move.

633
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,670
What's wrong?

634
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,670
I think something is there.

635
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,260
Let's go.

636
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,640
Maek, Maek, let's go.

637
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,450
What's wrong with her?

638
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:36,480
I think we will have to leave Maek behind for now.

639
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,200
Come here.

640
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,880
- We're entering.
 - Yes, sir.

641
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,660
Hands up.

642
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,630
If you move, I will shoot.

643
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,530

 Why are you here, Team Leader?

648
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,590
 Why is a civilian in a military zone?

649
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,040
 Have you seen my Soo Yeong?

650
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,570
 We received a report that there may be another target.

651
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,840
 What happened to the substance you said you would find?

652
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,150
 I'm sure I know where it is.

653
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,310
 You're going to have to help me.

654
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:16,360
 Armed Forces CBR Defense Command has jurisdiction regarding all substances.

655
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,660
 The head office has ordered it to be killed. I am here to carry out those orders.

656
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,310
 Stop. If you move, I will shoot.

657
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,620
 There is something different about this target.

658
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,340
 Team Leader, he got Staff Sergeant Joo.
