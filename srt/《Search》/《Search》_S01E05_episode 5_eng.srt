 Episode 5

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,690
Why does tonight feel so unusual?

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:07,540

12
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,020
Aigoo.

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,370
Isn't the atmosphere tonight strange?

14
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,610
Why are the dogs barking so loudly?

15
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,060
That's why I came outside too.

16
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,260
Should we...

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,730
have a night patrol date?

18
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,560
Sounds good.

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,030
Let's go.

20
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,920
Byeok Joon!

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,650
Bong Rak!

22
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,820
 Restricted Area

23
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,370
Request backup! The target entered HQ!

24
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,230
Yes, ma'am!

25
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,710
Maek, stand down.

26
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,770
Byeok Joon.

27
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,130
What happened, punk?

28
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,310
Get a hold of yourself!

29
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,530
It's because of Sergeant Bong Rak.

30
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,530
What?

31
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,400
I thought he disappeared...

32
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,660
Sergeant Yong!

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,940
Maek, heel!

34
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,830
Are they having night training?

35
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,090
Seo Byeok Joon. Please, get a hold of yourself.

36
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,830
Say something!

37
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,070
Tell my mom...

38
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,400
Dragon Snake is nearby. He'll be right here soon.

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,590
Stay awake. Keep talking.

40
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,170
Dragon Snake, you know...

41
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,970
Seo Byeok Joon! Seo Byeok Joon! Get ahold of yourself!

42
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,540
Maek, heel!

43
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,990
Where did it go?

44
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,190
Byeok Joon.

45
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,910
Maek.

46
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,630
Sergeant Yong!

47
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,000
It seems like you've deserted your post.

48
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,530
No, I...

49
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,010
I heard a gunshot earlier. Did something happen?

50
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,070
Sergeant Yong. Return to your base.

51
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,140
Your teammates will worry.

52
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,570
- Okay. 
- You're almost out of here.

53
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,510
Be careful.

54
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,010
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,670
That look...

56
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,880
I recognize it.

57
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,780
 Check the target! Sergeant First Class Nam!

58
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,590
 Sergeant First Class Nam! Get a hold of yourself!

59
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,320
 Hey! Medic!

60
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,610
 Sergeant First Class Nam!

61
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,020
What?

62
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,410
What's this? Is it from some animal?

63
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,340
 Search

64
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,150
Hey!

65
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,390
Hey, what happened to Byeok Joon?

66
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,720
Oh, Byeok Joon.

67
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,220
Byeok Joon.

68
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,050
Byeok Joon.

69
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,150
Everybody on standby until we get further orders.

70
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,570
Assistant Team Leader, control the support soldiers and write an incident report.

71
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,890
Sergeant Yong, where are you going?

72
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,230
I'm going to kill that bastard.

73
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,680
Stop.

74
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,700
Let go of me.

75
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,800
I'm going to bring that bastard back here.

76
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600
- Stop!
 - Let go!

77
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,450
I can just bring him here!

78
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,830
We just have to catch that bastard.

79
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,170
I will, that bastard—

80
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,960
Captain, please understand. He lost a precious teammate.

81
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,890
Was he the only one?

82
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,790
I just have to catch the bastard that killed Byeok Joon.

83
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,320
I'll bring him back!

84
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,570
Me! That bastard!

85
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,700
I...

86
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,580
Check the location of the medic.

87
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,900
Gate 8. Report location of the ambulance.

88
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,710
Understood.

89
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,560
They'll arrive at HQ in three minutes.

90
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,170
Sergeant Choi.

91
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,870
Sergeant Choi Bong Rak.

92
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,770
Come here.

93
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,080
Explain the situation.

94
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,130
Team Leader, the situation report is important,

95
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,280
- but Sergeant Choi's condition right now— 
- What about his condition?

96
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,930
Is there something broken or torn?

97
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,830
There isn't.

98
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,960
He witnessed a fellow soldier murdered before his eyes.

99
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,690
That's why we have to investigate. You must have seen it clearly.

100
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,960
He's still in shock. Can't we investigate after he calms down?

101
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:40,530
Seo Byeok Joon and I were preparing to make ramen

102
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,930
and came to HQ, but something ran in and...

103
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,660
I think I fainted, I don't remember.

104
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,580
Is it the target?

105
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,370
Yes. It's just like the picture Sergeant Yong drew.

106
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,620
Yes. Even the video.

107
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,310
The target was definitely a person.

108
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
- Dead?
- Yes.

109
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,250
You bastard, are you going to carry out an operation like this?

110
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,970
I'm sorry, Commander.

111
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,850
I'll get the details from the control center—

112
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,520
Forget it! Forget it.

113
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,300
Tell Captain Song to come here right now.

114
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,490
Yes, sir. Unity!

115
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,330
Are you hurt anywhere?

116
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,760
No, I'm not hurt.

117
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,450
Okay.

118
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,640
The medics arrived.

119
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,230
Have them take the body with Sergeant Choi,

120
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,560
and we'll investigate this incident until we get orders from  Defense Command.

121
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,330
That's all.

122
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,600
What? Why aren't you leaving?

123
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,060
Team Leader. Why don't we send Sergeant Yong with them, too?

124
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,760
- We will have to meet with Private Seo's family. 
- Hey, Lee Joon Seong.

125
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,410
Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong.

126
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,570
What did you come here to do?

127
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,960
Did you come to carry out an operation or to challenge me?

128
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,860
That's not what I mean, is it?

129
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,150
I must carry out this mission perfectly.

130
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,360
Assistant Team Leader doesn't have any interest in the operation, and only acts emotionally.

131
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,130
So, what now? Huh?

132
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm sorry.

133
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,040
But I really wanted to ask you to do this.

134
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,450
You can't stay long. Make sure to move only in groups of two.

135
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,040
Yes. Thank you.

136
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,900
Let's go.

137
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,690
I brought it just in case.

138
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,740
Thank you.

139
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,400
Keep the village under tight security.

140
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,410
HQ was attacked.

141
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,660
There's a possibility that the attack range will grow larger.

142
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,720
Shouldn't the civilians prepare, too?

143
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,290
I agree.

144
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,640
We need to inform them to try to prevent damage.

145
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,800
- My decision— 
- Hey, Assistant Team Leader.

146
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,320
Then we can just explain to the civilians what the mine removal team needs to do and still maintain security.

147
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,150
You should be able to do that by yourself.

148
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Yes, sir.

149
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,740
 Chief of Staff Choi Gi Seok

150
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,720
Yes, this is Song Min Gyu.

151
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,910
 Entry Forbidden

152
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,600
Yes, it's me.

153
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,030
There was an accident.

154
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,390
It's more serious than we thought.

155
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,390
Captain Song Min Gyu went to report directly to the commander.

156
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,680
Yes.

157
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,010
It looks that way.

158
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,380
Don't accept the call.

159
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,230
What about Captain Song?

160
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,690
He should have left the base.

161
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,620
Tighten security at HQ.

162
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,720
Prepare briefing material about wild dog attacks for all of the people who were attacked so far.

163
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,240
Yes, sir.

164
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,920
 Ministry of National Defense

165
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,040
 Ministry of National Defense

166
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,620
I'm Commander Han Dae Sik.

167
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,260
First, there was a death at the GP for which

168
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,070
I would like to express my regret as Commander of the Armed Forces.

169
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,740
 Deep sorrow shown for the death of a GP soldier

170
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,830
A series of unfortunate events are happening where our soldiers are being attacked by wild dogs.

171
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,570
We will work hard to make sure this doesn't happen again. I'm sorry.

172
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,730
Commander. How many dogs are there?

173
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,140
 How many have died?

174
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,390
 Please tell us!

175
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,920
 Please give us a comment.

176
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,410
 Please tell us! Commander!

177
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,860
He can't even do one thing properly.

178
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,940
I can't believe I sacrificed my leg to save that man's life.

179
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,020
 Sergeant Kim!

180
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,500
 Lieutenant Han! Lieutenant Han, you bastard!

181
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,730
 Armed Forces Hospital

182
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,360
 Byeok Joon!

183
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,210
Come here.

184
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,740
We're here on behalf of the North Star Missions Force.

185
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,690
Are you going to meet his parents looking like that?

186
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,680
I got it.

187
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,390
Let's comfort them.

188
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,430
Okay.

189
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,900
I was with Private Seo Byeok Joon until the end.

190
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,210
He said he missed his parents.

191
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,310
Aigoo, our Byeok Joon.

192
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,420
He met a terrible father and couldn't even do what he loved.

193
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,720
I should have died first.

194
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,310
I should have died first...

195
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,460
Why? Why my kind child?

196
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,190
Ma'am...

197
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,060
Please stand up.

198
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,540
 - What does your father do?
- My mom runs the restaurant with my uncle. My father is gone.

199
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,530
 I'm sorry.

200
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,390
 Why are you sorry? It's not like you knew.

201
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,550
 My father plays at home all day.

202
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,510
 That's why I'm always curious about what other fathers do.

203
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,750
 What a strange thing to be curious about.

204
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,950
 I guess so.

205
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,650
 Strange.

206
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,410
Hello, Ms. Hee Ra? It's me.

207
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,040
Oh, my son. Everything is okay, right?

208
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,330
I had some time in the middle of the operation, so I called. Nothing new.

209
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,330
I saw the news. I heard soldiers died.

210
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,800
 I'm so worried.

211
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,910
Oh, the news?

212
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,390
That's not my base. It's a different base.

213
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,230
And Ms. Hee Ra,

214
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,220
About Father.

215
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,730
You said he was a soldier who died during a mission.

216
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,220
What?

217
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,980
Yeah. He was.

218
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,840
How did he die? What kind of mission was it?

219
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,350
Why all of a sudden?

220
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,470
I was just curious. You know.

221
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,860
Well. I shouldn't have asked.

222
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,660
 Ms. Hee Ra, I have to go now.

223
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,990
I'll see you after I get discharged.

224
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,500
Yep.

225
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,720
Why?

226
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,290
Dong Jin asked how his father passed away.

227
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,670
Why all of a sudden?

228
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:58,910
He never mentioned his father once after he turned 15.

229
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,690
Yong Dong Jin's puberty...

230
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,860
He refused to talk to you or me. It was quite difficult.

231
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,740
I think something happened. I'd better go see him.

232
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,450
Hey! Where are you going?

233
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,240
He's on an operation.

234
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,210
You can't visit him.

235
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,260
From the day that person came,

236
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,610
something kept bothering me. 
  HON NEWS Deep sorrow after the death of a GP soldier

237
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,170
 Welcome. Party of one?

238
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,760
 Hello.

239
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,510
 How many years has it been?

240
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,510
 Can I have a bowl of soup?

241
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,350
 Of course.

242
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,400
 Come right this way.

243
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,300
 How did you know our restaurant moved?

244
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,120
 Please give me a bowl of hangover soup and a bottle of soju.

245
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,800
 Of course. Just a moment.

246
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,120
 Noona.

247
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,170
 Isn't that Commander Han Dae Sik?

248
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,300
 Why? Hasn't it been more than ten years since he last stopped by?

249
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,090
 Yeah. It's unexpected.

250
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,680
 Thank you for the meal.

251
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,620
 Of course.

252
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,060
 Bye! Come again!

253
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,910
 What was that?

254
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,840
 If he was going to leave just like that, why did he come at all?

255
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,090
 Exactly.

256
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,270
Don't worry about it.

257
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,110
It's probably because he feels strange so close to being discharged.

258
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,760
Noona. Your blood sugar is low, right?

259
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,900
I'll make a cup of sweet coffee for you.

260
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,630
 He will do his best to prevent any further GP accidents.

261
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,440
Radioactive material?

262
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,930
Which blood sample?

263
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,880
There was a large amount detected in the blood sample you sent us later.

264
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,890
A very small amount was found in the target's blood.

265
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,130
 It's hard to find this in the DMZ,

266
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,590
 but we did find radioactive materials.

267
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,410
Yes.

268
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,900
Please look it over. I'll continue thinking.

269
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,170
 Why was radioactive material found?

270
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,880
 And that means the sample from the abandoned building

271
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,230
 and the sample from HQ are different.

272
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,200
Let's go. It's not the time for us to stay here like this.

273
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,870
Let's go.

274
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,570
Hey. Do you want to be dismissed from service right here?

275
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,400
No, sir.

276
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:32,220
Three days left. If you can't finish this mission in the next 72 hours,

277
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,210
you're fired. Got it?

278
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,580
Yes, sir.

279
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,160
And.

280
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,060
You really didn't find anything?

281
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:50,300
If you betray me, I'm sure you know that it won't end with just losing your job.

282
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,320
I really didn't find anything.

283
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,900
I even went to the Demarcation Line.

284
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,890
There wasn't a trace of anything left behind—no belongings or lost articles.

285
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,020
If you can tell me specifically what I'm looking for...

286
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,300
Military supplies lost in '97.

287
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,720
It's your last chance. No third try.

288
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,710
Yes, sir. Thank you.

289
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,940
Get up.

290
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,490
And. What's up with that bastard?

291
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,280
There are rumors that he's a North Korean soldier, or that he's not human. What is it?

292
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,660
He's a North Korean soldier who deserted his post.

293
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,790
How could a soldier become this way?

294
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,050
I'll find out quickly.

295
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Damn.

296
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,500
You've already lost a few men but you don't even know what you've been hit by.

297
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,790
Get out.

298
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,160
Unity.

299
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,730
We searched in a 500-meter radius, but couldn't find the camcorder.

300
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,700
It looks like it's been destroyed by the mine explosion.

301
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,690
Mother! What are you doing? Come quickly!

302
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,510
Look through the village while I talk to the civilians.

303
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,690
Find any trace you can. We'll rendezvous after the search.

304
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,100
Okay.

305
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,870
Like you've seen on the news, wild dogs came in

306
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,040
so we had no choice but to shoot blanks to scare them away.

307
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,410
We apologize for the noise in the middle of the night.

308
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,890
But a person died!

309
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,640
You don't have to worry.

310
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,690
We won't let the dogs come all the way into the village.

311
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,960
We don't worry about that. Who would protect Cheongong-ri without the soldiers?

312
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,220
- Isn't that right? 
- That's right.

313
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,520
Mine Removal Team.

314
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,870
I'm Assistant Team Leader Lee Joon Seong.

315
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,450
Yes, Lieutenant.

316
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,220
Are you saying these dogs are the same ones that they spoke about on the news?

317
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,940
Yes, that's right.

318
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,220
You came to remove mines but got bitten by a dog?

319
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,790
We couldn't detect whether it was friend or foe because it was during night duty.

320
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:44,350
Yeah. But if one dog comes in, they'll continue to come in.

321
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,470
So that's worrisome.

322
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,600
You said the cameras don't work.

323
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,140
They work in the village.

324
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,850
We are installing them just in case.

325
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,030
Oh, is that so?

326
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,590
Staff Sergeant Joo.

327
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,220
Yes?

328
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,420
What do you think the target is?

329
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,970
Do you think it's just a defected North Korean soldier?

330
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,950
It wasn't an ordinary wild animal, that's for sure.

331
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,010
What if

332
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,900
North Korea did experiments on living specimens?

333
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,240
Ah, I didn't think about that.

334
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,480
No way.

335
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,050
Then what do you think it is, Sergeant Park?

336
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,680
I don't know.

337
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,730
Whatever it is, I'm no longer sure that we can even get rid of it.

338
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,620
Seriously. I can't die here.

339
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,380
Are you scared?

340
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,180
As if!

341
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,490
Hey. If I was single, I wouldn't worry about this kind of stuff.

342
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,520
I'm thinking of using the extra fees we get paid and adding that to the wedding fees.

343
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,120
What? Are you getting married?

344
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,660
Yeah, I'm getting married.

345
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,560
I'll send you an invitation, so come and eat a meal.

346
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,870
Hey. We prepared expensive food.

347
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,210
Congrats in advance.

348
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,550
Thanks in advance.

349
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,720
What do you think of Team Leader and Assistant Team Leader?

350
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,330
What?

351
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,110
Is it a bit awkward to say because you're on Team Leader's side?

352
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,690
It's not like that.

353
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,290
I hate those who choose sides.

354
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:44,720
He was my first commander after I became a staff sergeant.

355
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,200
That's all, Sergeant First Class Park.

356
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,590
Sergeant Joo, I'm not saying anything about you.

357
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,480
I'm just saying I hate to see the two of them acting that way.

358
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,980
Someone died. We should be gathering our strength.

359
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,340
They're not even trying to flirt, but they're playing hard to get.

360
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,060
They should just fight like men.

361
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,140
It's uncomfortable.

362
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,300
What do you think?

363
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,050
It's not just dogs.

364
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,810
Isn't there also a person?

365
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,740
Like a North Korean spy who hid in our village, perhaps?

366
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,900
It's definitely not a spy.

367
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,220
Assistant Team Leader, let's head back.

368
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,580
We've found all traces of the dogs.

369
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,670
It's not a spy, but wild animals are dangerous. Please don't go out at night.

370
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,100
We requested help from the Civil Affairs Division.

371
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,650
Okay.

372
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,650
Are the dogs big?

373
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,850
What?

374
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,250
I wondered if their claws were big.

375
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,470
If the hole is this big, wouldn't its claws be big and strong?

376
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,260
That's what I thought.

377
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,540
If not, never mind.

378
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,240
Let's go.

379
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,850
We'll go back now.

380
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,750
Yes, it's me. It's Lee Joon Seong.

381
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,120
Who? Whose son?

382
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,590
So there was a reason he was such a jerk.

383
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,740
It's nothing. Yeah. Thanks.

384
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:04,720
Shit!

385
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,120
Attention.

386
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,870
We'll spread some intelligence and target-related orders that came from Defense Command.

387
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,600
Considering the recent trend of troop movement near the DMZ,

388
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,340
I've confirmed the target to be a defected North Korean soldier.

389
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,320
The Defense Command has ordered that we quietly take care of it within three days.

390
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,510
Team Leader. Some of the village animals have died or disappeared.

391
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,230
I checked the traces and it was similar to our situation.

392
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,800
So Assistant Team Leader, you're saying

393
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,970
that a defected North Korean soldier is wandering around among South Korean civilians?

394
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,050
Is that possible?

395
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,930
We have to be open to the possibility.

396
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,410
There was evidence that showed we can't be sure it wasn't the target.

397
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,340
Preparing a plan to ensure the safety of the Cheongong-ri citizens is urgent.

398
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,130
Okay.

399
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,570
Then you take care of that.

400
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,020
Set up a contingency plan and report back to me.

401
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,730
As soon as Lieutenant Son and Sergeant Yong return,

402
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,550
we'll have a briefing and implement our operation to eliminate the target.

403
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,830
Today?

404
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,310
Do we have any time to waste?

405
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:40,520
If a civilian gets hurt, that won't do, right? Lieutenant Lee?

406
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,180
What are you doing? Get ready for the mission.

407
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,860
Yes, sir!

408
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,480
 I think Captain Song Min Gyu found out about me.

409
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,670
 I'll focus on capturing the target.

410
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,260
 Sent

411
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,040
Village Leader, don't these belong to the soldiers?

412
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,890
What is it?

413
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,780
What's this?

414
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,520
What?

415
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,740
This is such an old model.

416
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,300
Hyungnim, let me look.

417
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,240
What do you know, punk?

418
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,210
I'm an 'early adopter,' you know.

419
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,390
This isn't what the kids today use. This is antique.

420
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,170
Give it here.

421
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,520
Hey, does this even work?

422
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,490
Hyungnim!

423
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,040
Bastard.

424
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:06,130
- Jae Sik. Did you do it— No, did you make up with your wife?
 - Why?

425
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,190
Your nosebleeds are happening left and right.

426
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,090
Blood again?

427
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,510
Wow, Jae Sik!

428
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,760
It's not what you think!

429
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,610
Sergeant Yong!

430
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,580
All of our hearts are heavy.

431
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,950
I know, Staff Sergeant Joo.

432
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,110
How was the trip?

433
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,280
Well, yes. I'm fine.

434
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,650
Did something happen during that time?

435
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,430
Nothing happened.

436
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,460
I don't know why the target came to the village.

437
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,090
Focus on yourself right now, Sergeant Yong.

438
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,540
Yes, ma'am.

439
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,390
Is he okay?

440
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,800
Nothing happened at the hospital?

441
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,070
He'll be okay.

442
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,010
Please look after him for the time being.

443
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,860
Of course we should.

444
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,930
He must have been shocked. Even we were.

445
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,300
Lieutenant Son, you must be tired.

446
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,070
Rest at least a little before we go out on the mission.

447
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,920
Okay. Thanks, Sergeant Joo.

448
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,100
Are you okay?

449
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,090
Byeok Joon's father is unemployed.

450
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:11,850
When I heard that for the first time, I just laughed and forgot about it.

451
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:16,640
But it was hard for Byeok Joon to be the breadwinner for his household.

452
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,770
But, out of nowhere,

453
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:31,000
I thought about my own father. I never even missed him that much.

454
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,070
You don't have a father?

455
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,530
Yes.

456
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,990
I heard that he was a soldier.

457
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,490
Really?

458
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,340
Yes.

459
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,950
Where on earth was this thing

460
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,390
that it's so unresponsive?

461
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,090
But I wouldn't be Cheon Min Jae if I just backed out now.

462
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,480
 Dad, I'm going to Mi So's place!

463
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,820
Soo Yeong, where are you going?

464
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,720
- To Mi So's. 
- Oh!

465
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,930
I'm going in that direction too. Let's go together.

466
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,970
Okay. But have that cool oppa and puppy been coming around?

467
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,090
Puppy?

468
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,570
Oh, the dog? The big one?

469
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,930
He hasn't been here in a while.

470
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,820
If the oppa and puppy come, please let me know.

471
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,580
- Let's go. 
- Okay!

472
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,350
- What's this? 
- A camcorder.

473
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,020
Camcorder?

474
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,670
Maek.

475
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,960
Maek, what's wrong?

476
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,040
She vomited.

477
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,060
Unity.

478
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,920
Captain. Maek just collapsed from exhaustion.

479
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,190
Exhaustion?

480
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,730
Yes. It was hot and she was very tired, so her condition isn't good.

481
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,960
Then she can't come on tonight's mission?

482
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,080
I think it's best for her to rest.

483
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,940
This is driving me crazy.

484
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm fine without Maek. I can do it.

485
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,940
Okay. Exclude her from today's mission.

486
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,030
Yes, sir. Unity.

487
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,600
Go on.

488
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,000
Don't leave her alone.

489
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,930
And this. These are nutritional supplements.

490
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,720
In an hour, give these to her.

491
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,920
But how do we give a dog medicine?

492
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,010
She's a good dog. Just open her mouth and put in on her tongue, and she will swallow it right away.

493
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,250
Is she in a lot of pain?

494
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,990
It's not like I can make porridge for a dog.

495
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,900
Please look after her.

496
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,750
Yes, sir.

497
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,560
So annoying.

498
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,010
They really are a crazy couple.

499
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,520
Don't they understand rank?

500
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,740
Who's the top of the village? The village head!

501
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:03,300
Me! On top of that, I'm the president of the youth group.

502
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,690
I'm so high up.

503
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,220
Strange.

504
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,690
The village is working in weird ways.

505
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,860
Seriously.

506
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,340
Who is it?

507
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,860
Who on earth did this to you?

508
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,070
What a mess. Why does this keep happening?

509
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,000
- Disinfect it.
- Jae Sik.

510
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,340
Did you see anything?

511
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,200
A monkey.

512
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,680
I couldn't even see it and it did this to me. It hurts!

513
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,910
What is he saying? Damn.

514
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,280
It wasn't a dog, right?

515
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,980
It was a person?

516
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,640
A man in a soldier's clothes...

517
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,400
It's fine as long as he's alive.

518
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,730
Attention! The soldiers say it's dogs, but I don't believe that.

519
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,390
For sure, there are traces of humans.

520
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:06,250
They might not tell us the truth because they're soldiers.

521
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,540
But, we have to protect ourselves.

522
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,320
So after long consideration, I've asked you to gather here like this.

523
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,830
Jae Sik was attacked.

524
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,380
If you don't want to cooperate with the emergency task force,

525
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,580
you may leave now.

526
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,390
Then, we all agree.

527
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,530
Nobody knows our village as well as we do.

528
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:37,320
Unless it's an internal affair,

529
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,460
whether it's an alley or a dog hole,

530
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,260
we know this place better than any thief.

531
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,100
This area. This is where the cattle and pig pens are gathered.

532
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,800
I'll call this place Area 1.

533
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,740
This is where we dig the trap and set up the ambush.

534
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,610
Group One! Group 1 digs a hole about three meters deep.

535
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:00,230
Group Two! You secure the ambush location.

536
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:04,780
And we don't have professional weapons, so please bring your farming tools.

537
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,310
- Got it?
 - Yes, ma'am.

538
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,060
After we regroup again, I'll delegate more tasks.

539
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,150
Exactly 30 minutes from now,

540
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,460
we will start. Dismissed!

541
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,570
Dismissed!

542
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,240
So cool!

543
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,980
You're dope!

544
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,320
She's no joke. I've known her for ten years,

545
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,060
but I've never seen her like that. So cool.

546
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,640
Her tone is so cool.

547
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,020
My Da Jeong used to be a master sergeant in the special forces.

548
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,380
It's a whole story, so don't bring it up unnecessarily.

549
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,640
 12 Years Ago

550
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,270
 Team Leader! We have to wait until backup arrives.

551
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,960
 Cover me.

552
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,490
 What do I do?

553
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,350
 Check the target.

554
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,250
 Sergeant Nam! Check the target!

555
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,060
 Sergeant Nam!

556
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,820
 Get a hold of yourself. Are you okay?

557
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,530
 - Team Leader
- Request a medic!

558
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,260
 Are you okay?

559
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,820
 I went too far. I'm sorry, Tae Sik.

560
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,030
 It's alright.

561
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,950
 Hey! Call a medic quickly!

562
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,530
 Tae Sik! Sergeant Nam!

563
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,510
 Sergeant Nam!

564
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:56,770
 Sergeant Nam! Get a hold of yourself!

565
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,010
 Hey! Medic!

566
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,970
 Sergeant Nam!

567
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,330
What?

568
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,970
I saved it for you.

569
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,040
 Please have a successful mission. I'll prepare a special meal.

570
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,300
 - I'm preparing it. 
- You?

571
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,010
 My father taught me this special ramen recipe.

572
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,500
 Oh! Ramen is great. I'll eat it well.

573
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,100
I should have stayed with him until the end.

574
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,090
What are you talking about?

575
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,550
It's not your fault. It's all over.

576
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,960
Let's get revenge so we can send Byeok Joon off peacefully.

577
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,790
We just have to catch that bastard.

578
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,420
- Hey, Hoon!
 - Yes?

579
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,720
- Min!
 - Yes.

580
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,930
Keep your guard up.

581
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:13,400
The target could come again.

582
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,180
- Got it?
  - Yes, sir.

583
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,090
Team Leader!

584
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,090
What's wrong?

585
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,830
It's the target.

586
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,560
Where is this?

587
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,930
The C-branch outside of the village.

588
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,790
Team Leader, the village is in danger.

589
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,720
If the civilians find out about the target's identity or there are any casualties, we're all done for.

590
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,420
We have to stop it no matter what.

591
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,870
Contact the Civil Affairs Department and tell them to widen their boundaries of vigilance.

592
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,290
Okay. I'll get on it.

593
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,590
 Alright, there's a change to our operation.

594
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:53,230
 It's currently 17:50. Assistant Team Leader. Sergeant Park. Sergeant Yong.

595
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,700
 Search the town center under the guise of a night patrol.

596
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,670
 The rest, chase the target with me.

597
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:01,350
 We don't have any dogs with us. Be aware of that. Got it?

598
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,920
 Yes, sir!

599
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,090
Move.

600
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,080
Soo Yeong!

601
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,660
Oppa!

602
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,120
Why are you here and not at home?

603
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:35,580
I was going to play at Mi So's, but it's too boring, so I'm going back home.

604
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:40,290
It's dangerous. Hey, I'll drop her off and come right back.

605
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,200
- Soo Yeong, let's go. Where do you live? 
- Over there.

606
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,800
C'mon.

607
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,770
Yay!

608
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:57,090
We'll search the Village Hall and move onto the next area.

609
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,040
I'll buy you something delicious, so let me borrow you for a second.

610
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,000
- What are you doing? 
- Stop talking and come.

611
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,080
- Are you kidnapping me? 
- Shh!

612
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,620
Hurry!

613
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,290
Step on it!

614
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,170
Soo Yeong.

615
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,960
You should go quickly.

616
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
- Where did you say you lived? 
- Over there.

617
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,640
Over there?

618
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,170
Are your mom and dad home?

619
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:42,660
I bet they aren't.

620
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,730
Yeah? Then as soon as you get home, lock your doors.

621
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,730
Wait until your parents come. Okay?

622
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,410
Why?

623
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,900
A stupid soldier ghost might come. Right?

624
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,660
Oppa, you believe that story?

625
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,600
Even my friends don't believe that.

626
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,260
I'm telling you to be careful.

627
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,540
- Where? Here? 
- Yep.

628
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,970
- A present. 
- What's this?

629
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:14,940
- Go in quickly. 
 - Bye, Oppa!

630
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,570
- Lock the door! 
 - Okay!

631
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,310
Thanks!

632
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,330
Here. Battle food.

633
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,940
Take it.

634
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,390
You should eat up.

635
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,300
Are you fighting somebody?

636
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,730
Here, wear this.

637
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:48,820
I'll fight, so you just keep an eye out.

638
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,150
How is your vision?

639
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,430
I had Lasik.

640
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,220
Nice.

641
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,170
Tie it here once more.

642
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,160
Keep digging.

643
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,620
Good, good.

644
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,940
Got it.

645
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,780
Assistant Team Leader, I'll return now.

646
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,180
 I'm observing the surroundings with Sergeant Park.

647
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,090
-  Let's meet at the Village Hall.
  - Okay.

648
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,420
What's this?

649
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,840
- Move out of the way. 
- Everybody quiet.

650
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,920
Mine Removal Team.

651
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,820
Why are you here, Soo Yeong's mother?

652
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,430
Who is this?

653
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:14,360
I'm Kim Da Jeong. I live in Cheongong-ri.

654
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,800
For a mine removal team, your equipment...

655
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,640
So what are you all really doing here?

656
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:50,670
- Sergeant Park. 
- Yes.

657
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,630
Check Sergeant Yong's location.

658
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,650
Yes, sir.

659
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,820
 What are you doing? Shit!

660
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,200
 Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

661
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,710
 Drop the gun!

662
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,100
 Drop the gun!

663
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,840
 What are you doing?

664
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,700
 No!

665
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,550
Yes. It's me.

666
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,020
 I'm in an operation at the village.

667
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,820
 Captain Song Min Gyu has returned to base.

668
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,370
He was adamant that we must finish the mission in three days.

669
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,910
 - So it looks like Han Dae Sik chewed him out.
  - Yes.

670
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,060
 He should do at least that much.

671
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,300
Okay, Joon Seong. Are you okay?

672
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,240
Looks like I've sent you on a dangerous mission. I'm sorry.

673
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,790
I'm fine,

674
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,590
Father.

675
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:29,290

676
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,570
 Search

677
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,860
 Mine removal team. What are you hiding?

678
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,620
 Lieutenant Lee. Doesn't this look like the '97 DMZ incident?

679
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,600
 There was a video taken at sector two-one.

680
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,280
 Bring it to me.

681
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,940
 Team Leader, I found a way to eliminate the target.

682
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,200
 Think of this as the last resort of the Cheongong-ri Operation. Target has appeared.

683
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,100
 Answer. Corporal Hong, raise the volume!

684
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,660
 I think this machine is broken.

685
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,380
 Ye Rim!

686
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,350
 Right now!
