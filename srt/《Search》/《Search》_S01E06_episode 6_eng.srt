 Jung Soo Jung

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,440
 Moon Jung Hee

00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,170
 Search

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,120
 This drama is a work of fiction, and the related characters, names, agencies, groups, and situations have no correlation to the real world.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,900
 All scenes with animals were filmed safely with the help of experts.

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,040

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,850
- Sergeant Park.
 - Yes?

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,910
Check Sergeant Yong's location.

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,820
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,000
 What are you doing?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,720
 Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,460
 Drop the gun!

16
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,560
 Are you not going to drop the gun?

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,150
 Put the gun down!

18
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,920
 Drop the gun!

19
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,760
Yes. It's me.

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,110
I'm on a mission at the village.

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,920
Captain Song Min Gyu returned to the base.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,520
He was adamant that we must finish the mission in three days.

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,180
 - So it looks like Han Dae Sik chewed him out.
  - Yes.

24
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,140
 He should do at least that much.

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,350
Okay, Joon Seong. Are you okay?

26
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,410
Looks like I've sent you on a dangerous mission. I'm sorry.

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm fine,

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,630
 Father.

29
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,200
Sergeant Yong!

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,750
Yes!

31
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,020
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,450
I was getting ready to return.

33
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,500
We have to go back immediately.

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,190
Let's go.

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,260
Mine removal team.

36
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,060
Why are you here, Soo Yeong's mother?

37
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,870
Who's this?

38
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm Kim Da Jeong. I live in Cheongong-ri.

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,300
For a mine removal team, your equipment...

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,160
So what are you all really doing here?

41
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,220
Please return to your homes.

42
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,160
We will, whether you tell us to or not.

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,120
But what are you hiding?

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,860
Civilians live here. You have to tell us the truth.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,370
I thought our Assistant Team Leader already debriefed you.

46
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,130
Didn't you see the news?

47
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,130
Wild animals with rabies came all the way to the village?

48
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,590
Yes, ma'am.

49
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,730
Then we can't stay still.

50
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,260
A hundred people live in this village. Children, too.

51
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,860
We'll make sure nobody gets hurt.

52
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,290
If you're still curious, please go through the correct procedure.

53
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,970
We'll answer it through there.

54
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,930
Procedure.

55
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,790
I will, then.

56
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,340
- Retreat.
 - Retreat.

57
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,430
Let's return.

58
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,320
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,960
Who are those people?

60
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,530
Civilians we met in the daytime.

61
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,930
That woman earlier went to the barn with Assistant Team Leader.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,190
We barely stopped her from reporting to the police.

63
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,600
She won't be easy to deal with.

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,320
The civilians are so worked up. We can't just hide this operation.

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,430
We'll regroup with Assistant Team Leader and continue searching the village.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,030
Attention. Salute.

67
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,100
Cheon Gong.

68
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,630
- Good work. 
- Can we just leave?

69
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,290
Did Soo Young make it home?

70
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,200
What? Wasn't she at Mi So's?

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,560
- I told her to go home ahead of us. 
- Are you crazy?

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,330
Go quickly, quickly! Soo Yeong!

73
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,960
 Search

74
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,000
Where on earth are you going?

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,230
- I'll be right back. 
- It's after curfew, it's dangerous.

76
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,530
I need to look into something.

77
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,430
Look after Soo Yeong. I'll be right back.

78
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,570
I'll prepare a midnight snack!

79
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,330
Ma'am!

80
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,730
Ma'am, are you alright?

81
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,890
Captain. It's the civil affairs officer.

82
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,660
Wait.

83
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,130
I'm Captain Song Min Gyu from the mine removal team.

84
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,800
What?

85
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,260
Yeong Jin took leave from the military.

86
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,560
Ma'am. Look here.

87
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,530
Yeong Jin is doing well in Seoul, we confirmed it.

88
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,260
Ma'am. Did you really meet Yeong Jin in the storage room?

89
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,170
Yes. My youngest was wearing his military uniform

90
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,550
and was fixing his radio.

91
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,370
Military uniform?

92
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,530
Jae Sik, did you see anything?

93
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,330
Military uniform. A man in a military uniform...

94
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,340
Military uniform.

95
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,270
Is she hurt anywhere?

96
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,900
She's fine.

97
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,040
Captain. It's HQ.

98
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,930
- Yes.
  - From the surveillance footage, it looks like the target fled the village.

99
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,440
What?

100
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,270
Okay.

101
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,130
The target left the village.

102
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,390
Let's move out.

103
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,910
I'm back.

104
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,070
You're back?

105
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,050
How is she?

106
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,890
I think she's feeling better.

107
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,470
Really? That's a relief.

108
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,040
So pretty.

109
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,210
Thanks.

110
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,880
She's such a good dog.

111
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,420
Yeah! I said so!

112
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,970
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

113
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,580
You told me not to leave her alone, so I stayed here so long- I think I'm going to die.

114
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,710
I should go, too. House!

115
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,870
Thanks.

116
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,730
What about Maek?

117
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,440
She's a lot better now.

118
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,570
You've only just returned, and you're already on a mission and Maek is sick. It has to be rough.

119
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,120
No, I'm fine.

120
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,910
We should finish it up fast.

121
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,030
Yes, sir.

122
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,180
Attention. Stay alert as there's no telling when or where the target may appear.

123
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,780
- Staff Sergeant Joo. 
- Yes, sir.

124
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,140
You'll be standing guard with me. Dismissed.

125
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,670
I suppose you should hurry and repack the gear.

126
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,860
Hopefully, we'll get the target soon.

127
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,810
I'm sorry, Sergeant Joo. I should not have brought you here.

128
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,440
It's alright, sir. I would have been upset if you hadn't asked me to come.

129
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,350
No matter what, I'll catch that punk and find out what it is.

130
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,770
I know how hard you've had to work to come this far.

131
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,530
You're up for promotion to major,

132
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,150
and I know that there must not be any setbacks.

133
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,950
But does anything ever go my way?

134
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,130
I hope we get that punk and that you get your promotion.

135
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,990
Thank you, Staff Sergeant Joo.

136
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,930
 Sergeant Kim! Wake up!

137
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,340
 The baby is safe.

138
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,080
 Hey, Lee Hyeok! What did you just do? Answer me!

139
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,780
 I was about to die! What was I supposed to do?

140
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,620
Lee Hyeok?

141
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,640
 I'm afraid the DMZ event must be postponed until we catch this guy.

142
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,500
 Hey. What are you going to do now?

143
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,480
 - What do you mean? 
 - How are you doing to report this situation?

144
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,110
 How else? I'm the company commander. I will report it.

145
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,960
 Once this is reported as a firearm accident, we'll all be done for.

146
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,210
 Hey, Lee Hyeok. What is it that you're trying to say?

147
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,570
 I'm not saying this just because of my promotion.

148
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,550
 If we are unlucky, you, me, and all the guys who have survived this will be punished.

149
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,650
 We will be dismissed and be dishonorably discharged. We'll be doomed!

150
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,890
 Have you lost your mind?

151
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,570
 What's this? Unbelievable.

152
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,900
 Captain Jo. You need to make a decision now. How will you report this?

153
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,300
 What do you mean, how? I'll report the truth!

154
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,010
 Hey, Captain Jo Min Gook.

155
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,970
 Let's be honest.

156
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,110
 This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't tried to make a deal with the North.

157
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,480
 We should have shot them as soon as we found them! Don't you agree?

158
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,870
 According to the rules of engagement during the operations in the DMZ—

159
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,540
 - What? 
 - First Lieutenant Han is right.

160
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,000
 This is all your fault.

161
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,900
 You are the one who killed our soldiers.

162
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,020
 I know you wanted to take the defector to the South

163
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,820
 so you could get a promotion and a badge at the risk of our lives!

164
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,880
 What? Am I wrong?

165
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,190
 Come to your senses, you punk.

166
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,180
 I'm sorry. I have to report the truth.

167
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,400
 This is Night Owl.

168
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,890
What are you watching?

169
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,710
First Lieutenant Lee.

170
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,070
Why so surprised?

171
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,500
Is it fun? Let me see.

172
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,400
It's not like that.

173
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,780
What is it?

174
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,590
It's that the video camera filmed people dying.

175
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,440
What?

176
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,770
Doesn't it seem like the 1997 DMZ incident?

177
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,400
The incident where a commissions officer crossed over to North Korea.

178
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,700
And it seems that National Defense Commissioner Lee Hyeok is also there.

179
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,970
I'm not sure who shot the gun, but I think he was definitely there.

180
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,340
Sergeant Yong. We're in the middle of an operation, so let's take some rest for now.

181
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,320
You can watch this later.

182
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,950
Wasn't it Assemblyman Lee Hyeok who survived the incident back then?

183
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,450
The commissioned officer who killed the entire squad and defected to North Korea—

184
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,530
It might be a video of a war simulation.

185
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,980
It also looks like the video is quite old.

186
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,930
Right. It is, but...

187
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,600
Ahh, I can't remember his name... Jo—

188
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,690
This has no relation to us, does it?

189
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,950
Catching the target is our top priority.

190
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,400
Yes. You are right.

191
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,360
Since it's a military item, shouldn't I report it to Captain Song?

192
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,530
But thinking about it, it wasn't found at HQ.

193
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,710
Everyone is preoccupied right now, so you should keep it for the time being.

194
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,400
There will still be time to report it after the operation is over.

195
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,330
And we'll search the area again. So get some rest while you can.

196
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,950
Yes, sir.

197
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,330
 Congressman Lee Hyeok

198
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,750
 Soo Yeong's mother definitely recognized the target.

199
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,070
 Dear First Lieutenant Son Ye Rim, it is Moon Ji Won

200
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,240
 Though we aren't able to determine the composition of the radioactive material,

201
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,870
 I think I found a way to incapacitate the target.

202
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,040
 Director Moon, please hurry over to Cheongong-ri.

203
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,380
Team Leader.

204
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,130
A way to eliminate the target was found.

205
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,340
These are the mutated cells of the Corporal Oh and the target.

206
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,890
While the KCST Command was conducting cell mutation research,

207
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,120
a unique, unidentifiable substance was discovered.

208
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,130
- A substance? 
 - Yes.

209
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,160
A radioactive substance? From which blood sample?

210
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,350
A large amount was detected in the later sample

211
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,500
while a small amount was found in the target's sample.

212
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,980
Though we haven't found what this substance is yet,

213
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,530
how we can cause critical damage to the target—in other words,

214
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,320
we discovered a way to eliminate the target.

215
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,640
What does that mean?

216
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,500
The cells have died.

217
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,280
Although testing hasn't been fully completed,

218
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,760
I've determined that it is worth attempting.

219
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,690
Sir, why don't we go ahead with it immediately?

220
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,110
The syringe for this bacteriophage is at the KCST Command.

221
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,110
For now, I've contacted the chief researcher, Director Moon Ji-won.

222
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,120
There's no need to stall. Tell her to come immediately.

223
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,950
First Lieutenant Son, here.

224
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,720
We have only tested it a few times, so I am not sure of its efficacy.

225
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,800
No, it's okay. It's worth trying. Thank you so much.

226
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,140
Yes.

227
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,570
We have a problem though.

228
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,630
The syringe must directly be administered to the central nervous system.

229
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,380
However, based on the target's pattern of movement, that won't be easy.

230
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,930
And we don't have a lot of the bacteriophage either.

231
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,860
- I shall do it!
 - I shall do it!

232
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,950
Look, we have just two days left.

233
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,850
Whoever does it, move forward knowing that it is our last resort.

234
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,380
First, bring in the bacteriophage.

235
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,590
Yes.

236
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,820
As for the rest of you, think of how to accurately hit the target in the brain with the syringe. That's all.

237
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,370
Yes.

238
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,560
Wow, it looks like you're having the time of your life. Look at you all furry and plump.

239
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,470
Dragon Snake, you have a visitor.

240
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,260
We have visitation here?

241
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,520
The visitor is asking you to sneak out quietly.

242
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,280
What is this?

243
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,130
Sergeant Yong, you can't do anything without notice.

244
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,990
Then how about we go together as a two-person group, First Lieutenant Son.

245
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,390
I thought only Sergeant Yong would come, but both of you are here.

246
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,870
Are you guys a couple?

247
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,820
It's because of yesterday, isn't it?

248
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,570
I just need someone to talk straight with me. 
 Restricted

249
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,600
And I thought you'd be the most honest with me, Sergeant Yong.

250
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,800
Still, you can't call him out whenever like this.

251
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,090
I know. That's why I asked him to sneak out.

252
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,130
Are you here to surveil him as a two-person group?

253
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,580
Here. Dr. Baek from the health clinic asked me to give this to you.

254
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,310
Thank you.

255
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,910
Explain to her well.

256
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,350
Yes.

257
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,540
 Happy Birthday. After much deliberation, I decided to send this to you.

258
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,760
 It's the reason I discouraged you from becoming a soldier.

259
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,050
Sergeant Yong.  Are you okay?

260
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,220
You looked like you lost a comrade in arms.

261
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,120
Yes, well...

262
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,740
I've lost a comrade in arms, too, so I understand how you feel.

263
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,630
 Tae Sik. Sergeant First Class Nam.

264
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,490
Sergeant First Class Nam!

265
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,500
Send him off well and bury him deep in your heart.

266
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,510
What do you mean that you've also lost a comrade in arms?

267
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,430
It's a bit embarrassing, but I'm also a former soldier.

268
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,820
Pardon?

269
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,150
No wonder.

270
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,370
Where did you serve?

271
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,550
- Unit 709. 
 - Unit 709, isn't that the elite unit?

272
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,180
What's the use?

273
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,670
Due to my lack of caution, I lost a subordinate.

274
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,520
Seonbae, have you also

275
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,620
buried him deep in your heart?

276
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,620
Yeah. Anyway, I dropped by just because.

277
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,060
I know I'm just being a nosy ajumma, but after that day I was worried.

278
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,350
Thank you so much, Sunbae-nim.

279
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,380
So you're really not going to tell me?

280
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,810
It seems serious enough that someone died.

281
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,960
And it seems that our village isn't safe from it.

282
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,780
Uhh, the thing is,

283
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,280
it's military classified, so I can't really say in detail.

284
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,670
But we're going to catch him so none of the villagers are harmed.

285
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,780
You seem very dependable.

286
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,530
So it's a person, isn't it?

287
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,390
- How to tell you this, uhh, I'm not exactly sure. 
 - Sergeant Yong.

288
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,030
Yes, I'm coming. Also

289
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,140
you said you were at the DMZ Memorial Hall, right?
 - Yeah.

290
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,980
Then do you remember the 1997 DMZ incident?

291
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,520
If it's about that, I recite that event by memory every day.

292
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,030
That military commissioned officer who defected to the North...

293
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,350
- Captain Jo Min Gook? 
 - Yes, that person.

294
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,990
Never mind. I'll speak you in detail later.

295
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,340
This seems like a much bigger operation than I had thought.

296
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,880
I hope nothing bad happens.

297
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,450
 Is the 1997 Sector 21 Hero Real?
 (Content: There is doubt because there is no evidence of heroism except the verbal testimony of the two survivors.)

298
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,430
Son.

299
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,350
Second Lieutenant Lee Joon Seong.

300
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,870
I'm sorry, son. I was too busy to even attend your promotion ceremony.

301
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,780
It's okay.

302
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,390
You look incredible.

303
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,990
You're going to earn some stars in your father's place, right?

304
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,100
That's my boy.

305
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,190
Take a seat.

306
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,090
Assemblyman. Your approval ratings have risen 3 percent more since yesterday.

307
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,090
Is that so?

308
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,810
 Lee Joon Seong

309
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,390
Yes, Joon Seong?

310
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,120
I saw what you did

311
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,430
in 1997.

312
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,460
In 1997?

313
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,840
 We're going to keep quiet, about what happened here forever.

314
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,780
 I'm not doing this just for myself, am I?

315
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,070
 Understood?

316
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,770
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

317
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,360
 From now on, our fates are forever linked. We're on the same boat.

318
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,380
 If you dare to say anything else later, I will kill you.

319
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,400
 Like this.

320
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,010
 Captain Jo.

321
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,540
 Captain Jo voluntarily fled to the North

322
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,510
 after killing his own men.

323
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,170
What are you saying?

324
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,030
The DMZ Hero is a lie.

325
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,300
Joon Seong, what do you mean? What are you talking about?

326
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,160
Sector 21, 1997.

327
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,220
There's video footage of everything that happened there. Did you know?

328
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,740
That can't be true.

329
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,690
Find the video and bring it to me.

330
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,700
Bring it to me!

331
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,980
Did you really do those things?

332
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,640
- Did you? 
  - No.

333
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,230
He was the one to betray our country first.

334
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,070
Joon Seong, you're my son.

335
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,990
Find that video and bring it to me, no matter what it takes.

336
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,950
Joon Seong? Answer me, Joon Seong!

337
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,890
Joon Seong!

338
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,280
Tell Han Dae-Sik to come to my office right away!

339
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,960
Yes, sir.

340
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,700
Why have you asked to see me?

341
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,270
Why are you being this way?

342
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,360
You punk! What did you film?

343
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:39,160
- Pardon? 
 - You incompetent fool. How dare you stab me in the back?

344
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,490
Yes, Dr. Baek.

345
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,090
What? She even has a fever?

346
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,200
I can't figure out the cause.

347
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,150
I will pick Da Jeong up on the way. So you should go home.

348
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,460
I would prefer going with you.

349
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,180
Da Jeong said she would go.

350
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,980
It's unnecessary for you both to go to the hospital.

351
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,370
I'm sorry. Go to the hospital with your mom.

352
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,620
Okay, Dad. Take care of the house while we're gone.

353
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,890
Alright, I will.

354
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,180
I'll see you later. Don't worry too much.

355
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,130
Let's go. Stand up. Good girl.

356
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,300
- See you later. 
- Okay.

357
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,620
Have a safe trip, Soo Yeong.

358
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,710
These speakers are so old.

359
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,530
Maek. You just have to let me know how you feel. Okay?

360
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,630
That's it. Good job.

361
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,570
Are you all right?

362
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,580
Okay.

363
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,000
Hey. Look here.

364
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,900
These footprints coming from the thicket

365
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,970
are for sure the direction the target went.

366
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,740
Are you hearing me?

367
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,430
Ah, what is it?

368
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,620
What is it?

369
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:49,600
The plants they are growing here are called dieffenbachia. Dogs hate the scent of them.

370
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,630
So that's why the footprints are along the waterway?

371
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,850
Look over there.

372
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,000
We have a better view of the Taegeukgi from here.

373
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,290
So?

374
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:08,850
Why did the target only take this route to appear at Cheongong-ri?

375
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,330
Because he wanted to defect.

376
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,220
That's the reason he kept coming down?

377
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,800
Correct.

378
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,430
If we piece together all of our current information,

379
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,860
the target infected by an animal with rabies.

380
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,520
then the virus mutated into a unique organism.

381
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,420
If you look at the screen,

382
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,030
I have noted the route the target used and where he appeared.

383
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,320
If you look, you'll notice his route is on only one side.

384
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,570
This is because on one side there is a swamp,

385
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,290
and on the other side there are trees. The trees

386
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,360
growing there are aromatic, like acacia trees.

387
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,640
Generally, canines sensitive to smells

388
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,560
usually avoid areas that have intense scents.

389
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,730
So we can create an operation to lure him.

390
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,620
Wait. You're saying you want to lure him, again?

391
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,990
Even when we follow his traces

392
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,720
and chase him, we always turn up empty-handed.

393
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,740
So we'll drag him out to Cheongong-ri.

394
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,460
Luring him into the village is dangerous. Civilians live there.

395
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,580
Drones and cameras can't be used in the demilitarized zone.

396
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,330
But, if we lure him to the village, we'll be able to determine his general location.

397
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:26,140
There's nothing we can do if the target doesn't come to the village, but he's coming there on his own.

398
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,180
It's a great opportunity for us.

399
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
We have two syringes of bacteriophage.

400
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,170
Furthermore, we have the difficult task of having to hit the target accurately.

401
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:41,290
For this to be possible the target has to be pinned down.

402
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,780
You're right.

403
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,190
But there's a way to make sure he doesn't move.

404
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,410
In the valley last time, Staff Sergeant Joo's radio...

405
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,980
Audio frequency.

406
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,840
I tested it earlier. If we amplify radio communications through the speakers,

407
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,790
and stimulate the target's hypothalamus, we can briefly stun him.

408
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,860
We can inject the bacteriophage in him then.

409
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,800
That's right.

410
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,660
For how long will he be stunned?

411
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,760
When I tested it on Maek, it was around 15 seconds,

412
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,380
However, it won't be as long with the target.

413
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,750
I just have to shoot him during that time.

414
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,810
Yes, sir.

415
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,000
The operation may be feasible, but I'm concerned that have to do it in the village.

416
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,510
Since tit's like this, why don't we share information with the villagers and coordinate together?

417
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,230
I think it's a win-win.

418
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,200
Let's say we cooperate with the villagers. What will you do if one of the villagers leaks the information?

419
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,820
We won't be able to keep it secret forever.

420
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,640
I know, but headquarters still thinks the target is a runaway North Korean DMZ Team soldier.

421
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,750
That means they will categorize this as a military operation against North Korea.

422
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,890
Because of this, we must avoid bringing the citizens into it.

423
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,590
How long are you going to go on about a runaway soldier? You know it's not true.

424
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,950
I agree we should share some of our information,

425
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,220
but I'm opposed to luring him to the village.

426
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,960
I agree with Sergeant Yong's opinion too.

427
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,240
The residents here are better acquainted with the area and its geographic features than we are.

428
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,960
What if one of the villagers gets hurt?

429
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,280
We can make certain they don't.

430
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,070
We can have the villagers evacuate to the air raid shelter first and start the operation after that.

431
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,250
Has most everyone arrived?

432
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,100
- Hurry up. 
 -You can go in.

433
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,860
All right.

434
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,660
- She said they're almost all here. 
 - Is that so?

435
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,310
Okay, everyone gather up.

436
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,220
What's happening?

437
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,170
Nothing big.

438
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,200
Don't worry, it's not a big thing.

439
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,520
It's not hard to cooperate with the villagers.

440
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,000
There are lots of people who will assist us.

441
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,370
Fine. We'll begin Operation Cheongong-ri.

442
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,620
Starting now, cooperate with Sergeant Yong.

443
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,030
Staff Sergeant Joo. Please get all the drones we have.

444
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,780
Do you think the drones will fly okay this time?

445
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:01,260
If we fly them above 30 meters we'll lose GPS signal, so we'll have to fly them low.

446
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,760
Okay.

447
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,340
Are things going okay?

448
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,720
Yes, they are.

449
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,430
It's a piece of cake.

450
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,220
Hey, you... Do you think the location is correct?

451
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,570
Tighten those bolts.

452
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,370
Staff Sergeant Joo, how's the location?

453
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,650
Move it slightly to the right.

454
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,950
To the right. Keep it attached and just turn it a bit.

455
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,820
Turn it a bit.

456
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,480
How's the installation of the speakers?

457
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,440
We've finished installing them along the expected route of the target.

458
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,390
What are your thoughts? Here's the final location.

459
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,390
- It's good. 
- Yes.

460
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,690
- Hey, Bong Rak. 
 - Yes.
 - Come here. Okay.

461
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,430
See this? We've got to clean it up.

462
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,340
Ah, I see.

463
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,280
Lieutenant Lee!

464
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,450
Lieutenant Lee! Are you okay?

465
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,200
I'm  okay.

466
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,150
Do you want me to look at it?

467
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,230
It's not that bad. Let's go.

468
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:15,910
The doctor at the hospital said you'll get better soon. So let's endure it for a bit. Okay, Soo Yeong?

469
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,520
Why don't you want to go to the air-raid shelter?

470
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,320
- I want to go home. 
 - Come on.

471
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,240
It's just for a little while. We practiced this before.

472
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,960
I don't want to go.

473
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,880
You always go anywhere without any fear.

474
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,690
I'm surprised there is a place you don't want to go.

475
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,890
You'll be with Mom and Dad.

476
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,260
- You will be with your friends too. 
 - I don't want to.

477
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,690
Aren't you embarrassed? Doctor is here.

478
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,530
I even let you play video games.

479
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:49,800
It's likely because she has a fever and isn't feeling well.

480
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,910
Should I bring your doll?

481
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,020
Yes, bring my doll.

482
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,790
She's in elementary school, but she still needs her cuddly toy.

483
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,610
Then should we stop by your place?

484
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,320
- It's fine. I don't want to trouble others.

485
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,580
I will quickly visit our home. Please wait for me there with Soo Yeong.

486
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,080
Okay.

487
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,200
You can drop me off over there.

488
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,490
- Wait for me there, okay? 
 - Okay.

489
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,760
See you.

490
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,990
I'm winning all your money today.

491
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,130
Jae Sik is on a roll today.

492
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,820
You punk.

493
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,260
- Are you cheating? 
 - I'm just lucky.

494
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,730
- Hold him. You punk. 
 - I'm not cheating.

495
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,580
- I just got lucky. 
 - Dad!

496
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,420
Thank you. Oh, Soo Yeong.

497
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,750
Are you okay?

498
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,730
- Where's your mom? 
 - She went to get my doll.

499
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,960
You were whining again, right?

500
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,950
I don't want to be here.

501
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,830
It's aright. I'm also here.

502
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,520
By the way, I hope your mom can get back here soon.

503
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,450
She's the last person you should be concerned about.

504
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:29,460
I saw her earlier and she looked like she was prepared to ship out to Iraq.

505
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,870
You punk. You'd better look after your wrist.

506
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,990
Soo Yeong, let's get inside. Come on.

507
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,690
Sir, I also want to participate in the operation.

508
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:46,800
Don't. Stay in the situation room.

509
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,490
You could endanger other members.

510
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,220
Assistant Team Leader, watch the monitor in the situation room and radio us.

511
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,170
Now, move out.

512
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,940
I know I need to get it done in one try, but in case I fail,

513
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,540
please help me out, First Lieutenant Son.

514
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,340
Do you see the monitor?

515
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,950
When you turn this first one on, it goes up. This is number two,

516
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,580
- four and five. You can see they all went up. 
 - Yes, sir.

517
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:21,440
- The target has appeared. It's moving as we expected. 
 - Number one.

518
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,540
Luring the target, first step is successful. Target has entered the village.

519
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,540
Targetjust entered the first alleyway.

520
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,640
- Luring the target, second step is successful. 
  - Get ready, Corporal Hong.

521
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,110
Corporal Hong, turn up the volume!

522
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,840
Sir, I think the equipment is broken.

523
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,010
Staff Sergeant Joo, get ready.

524
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,240
Staff Sergeant Joo, how's it going?

525
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,780
Staff Sergeant Joo, respond. How's it going?

526
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,510
 Respond, Staff Sergeant Joo.

527
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,150
It appears that there is a problem.

528
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,720
Wait.

529
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,010
Now!

530
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,800
What?

531
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,440
Where did it go?

532
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,950
Ye Rim!

533
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:46,840
June 15, 2020. 15:05.

534
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,460
Target killed. Operation closed.

535
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,360
Yes. It's me.

536
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,670
 I told you to bring it to me.

537
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,400
I took care of it cleanly.

538
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,750
This never happened.

539
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,710
I prefer to confirm it myself.

540
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,390
Good job, Son.

541
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:27,740
You will definitely rise to the position I couldn't rise to.

542
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,580
What about the thing I asked you about?

543
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,850
 Commander Han Dae Sik has had a successful military career since the Sector 21 operation, right?

544
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,270
 There were some North Korean superior officers who were going to defect at that time.

545
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,770
 Senior Colonel Ko Sang Min and Major Ri Kyeong Hee.

546
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:11,540
 Senior Colonel Ko Sang Min is MIA and Major Ri Kyeong Hee died during the sector two-one operation.

547
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:15,620
 Maybe what the commander is looking for has something to do with the operation?

548
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,300
 I think Senior Colonel Ko Sang Min was trying to bring something to the South.

549
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,200
 I doubt he came empty-handed when he defected.

550
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,640
 But I don't know anything else because the documents were destroyed.

551
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,740
Okay, I appreciate it.

552
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:37,680
Something... something...

553
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,240
1997... Sector two-one...

554
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,510
 Commander Han Dae Sik

555
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,510
'97, sector two-one, Commander Han Dae Sik?

556
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,610
Unity. This is Captain Song Min Gyu.

557
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,180
What kind of bastard are you?

558
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,000
 I was just going to report to you.

559
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,110
Target has been clearly hit and eliminated.

560
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:09,870
 Camcorder!

561
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,050
What?

562
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,270
I told you to bring it to me as soon as you found it.

563
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:17,120
Hey, you traitorous bastard. How long have you been working with Lee Hyeok?

564
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,060
What are you talking about?

565
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,310
This is why you can't work with people who don't know the fundamentals.

566
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,780
- Get over here immediately. 
 - Yes, sir.

567
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,020
Camcorder?

568
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,660
 It is a military supply item that was lost in '97.

569
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,160
The lost supply item from '97?

570
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:51,990
 One month ago. Sector 21

571
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,890
 Comrade Commander.

572
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:02,610
 We're only a step away from the South Korean region.

573
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,600
 What are we going to do?

574
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,970
 That little...

575
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:17,000
 Why does he keep circling the MDL (Military Demarcation Line)?

576
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 Hand me a gun.

577
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,810
 That punk!

578
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,480
These are the articles of the deceased that were discovered on site.

579
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,270
 They were dropped at the site of the event.

580
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,130
 The maps are alike.

581
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:08,020
 It's there. Sector two-one.

582
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:16,660

583
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,640
 Search

584
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,750
 That's the actual situation. We have to report it, but the proof has disappeared.

585
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,050
 What do you want?

586
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,920
 I want to be a commander.

587
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,310
 Noona, they say the CCTV's caught sight of a little girl entering the restricted area!

588
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:37,270
 Cheon Soo Yeong, ten-year-old girl missing in Cheongong-ri. We will begin searching the demilitarized zone.

589
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,240
 Another blood sample was found at Sector two-one.

590
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,700
 The fact that it wasn't detected by our search zones means it is superior to the target we hit.

591
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,680
 Hands up! If you move, we shoot.
