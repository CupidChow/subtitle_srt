00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,724
(Application for Consensual Divorce)

2
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,593
She said every day of married life
was hard for her.

3
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,962
So she's choosing divorce?

4
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,664
It can't have been an easy decision.

5
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,567
Every married couple entertains
the idea of divorce at least once.

6
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,702
You should have done more
to convince her to go back.

7
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,105
- And you call yourself a parent.
- Chul Soo's hand...

8
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,541
What about his hand?

9
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,178
I'm just saying they're far beyond
the point of convincing.

10
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,514
Darn. What a mess of a household.

11
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,189
- Hello?
- Hey. Why is Sa Rin's phone switched off?

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,991
Is there something going on?

13
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,260
Sa Rin's asleep. I'll call you later.

14
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,502
(Promises between Sa Rin and Gu Young)

15
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,273
Tell me whatever you need. I'll do it all.

16
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,075
Let's discuss how we should go about this.

17
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,515
We haven't kept a single promise.

18
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:35,315
Walking the Olle Trail seemed
to solve problems in movies and dramas.

19
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,621
It's just exhausting.

20
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,548
(Episode 12,
Do You Vow to Be a Good Daughter-In-Law?)

21
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,227
Mother was harsh too...

22
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,196
to suggest we visit my mom
a week before the holidays.

23
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,097
How could she say such a thing?

24
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,535
Let's work on them one at a time.

25
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,554
What is it? Isn't Mi Young home yet?

26
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,756
The one we're expecting isn't here,

27
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,692
and the one
who has no business here is visiting.

28
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,693
What does that mean?

29
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,195
Wait. Gu Young and his wife wouldn't...

30
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,635
Please try some cake.

31
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,408
Is Sa Rin upset with us?

32
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,311
She didn't come for dinner at Chuseok.

33
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,847
And now she's not responding
to messages or phone calls.

34
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,983
It's nothing like that.

35
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,085
She sent you here alone today too.

36
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,489
Sa Rin didn't send me over here.
I came on my own.

37
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,362
Mom, Dad.

38
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,130
I'm here to let you know...

39
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,300
that since we came here first for Chuseok,

40
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,336
we'll be going to
Sa Rin's mom's place first for New Year's.

41
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:39,606
That's fine.
Visit her before the new year.

42
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,443
That's not what I meant.

43
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,945
We'll spend New Year's Day there,

44
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,115
and we'll come here the day after.

45
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,417
That makes no sense.

46
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,353
How can there be only the son
and no daughter-in-law...

47
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,557
in a household that holds
memorial services on holidays?

48
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:58,625
Just a moment.

49
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,062
Are you saying that
you won't be here either?

50
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,333
- That's right.
- What do you mean?

51
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,768
Did Sa Rin put you up to this?

52
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,871
Not at all. This was my idea.

53
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,740
We're a couple.
We should split holidays evenly between...

54
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,677
Young people these days
want to split everything evenly.

55
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,979
Then you should contribute equally
to buying your home...

56
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,647
and running the household.

57
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,852
Do you think you can split your lives
equally like you can a piece of fruit?

58
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,587
There's no backing down or compromising.

59
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,922
It's always Sa Rin backing down
and compromising.

60
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:32,092
Did she say that? That she's the one
who backs down and compromises?

61
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,660
What do you mean by that, Mom?

62
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,697
Stop. I can't stand any of you right now.

63
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,833
What's the point of raising children?

64
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,836
One of them wants a divorce of all things.

65
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,007
If you think you're so great,
you can do whatever you please.

66
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,142
Just live however you want!

67
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,554
Mom? What does he mean by divorce?

68
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,357
I understand what you're saying.
You can leave now.

69
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,527
- Mom...
- If that's how you two really feel,

70
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,196
I'll discuss it further with your father.

71
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,075
Gu Young.

72
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,312
All your father and I want...

73
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,315
is for you, your brother, and Mi Young...

74
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,451
to live happily
with your respective partners.

75
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,654
That's all we want.

76
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
Mi Young.

77
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,263
What are you doing here?

78
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,978
So much has happened recently.

79
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,647
Spending time with Mom and Dad...

80
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,050
for the first time
in a really long time...

81
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,753
has made me realize things I never knew.

82
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,824
My mom, Park Ki Dong,

83
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,793
has been living only as a mom,

84
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,630
as Mu Nam Chun's wife,

85
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,667
and only as a daughter-in-law
to the Mu household.

86
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,136
I'm sure Mom...

87
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,374
was just "Park Ki Dong"
at some point in her life too.

88
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,313
But she was always
too busy being "Mi Young's mom."

89
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,817
It must have been hard for her.

90
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,525
I tried my best
to fulfill those roles well,

91
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,294
and I struggled a lot.

92
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,296
But then everything exploded in my face.

93
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,665
No one ever said I needed to do well.

94
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,035
I was never intimidated or threatened.

95
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,673
But I finally figured it out
after pushing myself to come this far.

96
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,342
Before I was a wife,

97
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,711
or a daughter-in-law,

98
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:40,881
I was just myself.

99
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,419
Fulfilling those roles well...

100
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,822
didn't lead to my happiness.

101
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,027
(Away from workshop)

102
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,968
(Ojo Furniture Workshop)

103
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,976
I thought I'd stop by
while I was in Jeju, but you're not in.

104
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,612
Please contact me when you get this note.

105
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,547
From Min Sa Rin.

106
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:27,928
You should go over there first.
You can visit the week before holidays.

107
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,330
If you really had a problem
with what my mom said,

108
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,666
you should have said something.

109
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,702
- Why are you only mentioning it now?
- How could I say anything?

110
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,937
Why couldn't you?

111
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,675
I wonder why I couldn't say anything.

112
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,875
How did you know I was here?

113
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:51,211
You mentioned that
you've always wanted to stay here.

114
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,681
I've had a place in mind for a while.
Isn't it gorgeous?

115
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,150
I've always wanted
to stay somewhere like this.

116
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,152
You remembered.

117
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,388
I thought about how you would have felt...

118
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,990
for the first time as your husband.

119
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,561
Then why were you just going to leave?

120
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,968
Because I think what I thought was obvious
isn't as obvious anymore.

121
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,438
I thought that finding my wife
who left home...

122
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,774
and bringing her back...

123
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,710
was the obvious thing for a husband to do.

124
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,447
But seeing you here alone...

125
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,716
made me think I might be wrong.

126
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,718
What did you see?

127
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,988
I saw the true Min Sa Rin.

128
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,263
Not my wife.

129
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,134
Not my parents' daughter-in-law.

130
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,271
I didn't see you as any of that.

131
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,177
You were just you.

132
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,448
I could finally see you for who you were.

133
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,557
I'm still trying to figure it out.

134
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,927
No matter how much
I try to think from your perspective,

135
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,864
I can't become you.

136
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,635
Even so, Sa Rin.

137
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:25,973
I will always...

138
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,475
walk ahead for you to follow.

139
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,248
On that dark knight,

140
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,384
you were walking behind me.

141
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,920
My feet were bright...

142
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,457
with the light you were shining on them,

143
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,894
and that kept me on the right path.

(Regional Moving Company)

145
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,702
Is that everything?

146
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,272
- Is it all loaded?
- Yes. We'll make our way over now.

147
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,374
- We'll see you there.
- See you there.

148
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:02,643
Let's go!

149
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,486
Let's go!

150
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,065
- Nam Chun.
- Hello.

151
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,201
You're here early.

152
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,038
How did Yong Il's move go?

153
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,340
They called to say
they arrived in Cheongsong.

154
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,279
Jeez. It's upsetting to see you
pour your own shots.

155
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,747
Thanks.

156
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,518
What will they do for a living there?

157
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:45,986
They'll run an orchard.

158
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,589
His agricultural venture
was nominated for something,

159
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,191
so they'll receive
a three-year settlement grant too.

160
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,630
- What about your wife? Is she okay?
- Don't even mention her.

161
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,399
She's been sulking and sobbing
in bed all day.

162
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,435
I can't stand it.

163
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:04,171
- Is Mi Young still staying with you?
- Yes.

164
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,039
I can't stand her either.

165
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,311
Nam Il...

166
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,548
Where did we go so wrong?

167
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,350
Why are the kids doing this to us?

168
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,720
Did we ask them to take us in
or help support their siblings?

169
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,656
All we want is for them
to have happy marriages.

170
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,993
- Is that too much to ask?
- Indeed.

171
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,564
We wanted the best for them, so we opened
up our home and raised our grandchild.

172
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,999
They're so ungrateful.

173
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,735
They moved out
because they couldn't do as they pleased.

174
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,504
I guess it's just what children do.

175
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,874
- Drink up.
- Okay.

176
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,793
(Gu Young)

177
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,302
The Sa Rin that I love...

178
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,939
gets frizzy hair when it rains...

179
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,941
but still likes the sound of rain.

180
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,677
When she gets stressed out...

181
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,212
Two caramel macchiatos, please.

182
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,147
She drinks two caramel macchiatos.

183
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,383
And she loves the work that she does.

184
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,687
You were all these things
before you married me...

185
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,489
and then experienced things
you'd never done before.

186
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:31,959
I'll work even harder to make sure...

187
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,428
you never stop being yourself.

188
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:39,600
"It's your natural role as a wife,
a daughter-in-law, and a woman."

189
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:42,703
I'll stop assuming those are your duties.

190
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,072
I'll reject those gender stereotypes.

191
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,474
Enjoy the rest of your holiday.

192
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,210
I'll be waiting for you, Sa Rin.

193
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,816
(Jeju Furniture Workshop)

194
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,752
Hello, sir?

195
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,261
Are you sure I'm not disturbing your work?

196
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:10,397
Not at all. You came
just as I was ready to take a break.

197
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,668
I was at a redevelopment site
and picking up reclaimed wood...

198
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:15,769
when you came by yesterday.

199
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,538
I didn't know you did upcycling.

200
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,040
We're interested in that too.
We should collaborate.

201
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,441
Sounds good to me.

202
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,677
Are you traveling alone?

203
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:25,679
Yes.

204
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,985
The trees must have had a hard year.
There are so many pine cones around.

205
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:36,123
Sorry? Do trees make pine cones
when they have a hard year?

206
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,025
Oh, you didn't know?

207
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,030
Pine trees produce many pine cones
when they're in poor health.

208
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,135
You know how restaurants
hang light bulbs on their pine trees?

209
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:51,505
Then there'll be an abundance
of pine cones that year.

210
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,909
The trees produce lots of seeds
because they sense they might die soon.

211
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,080
Pine trees tell us when they're in pain.

212
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,618
They're such demanding trees.

213
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,388
But you see them everywhere,
and they suit all settings.

214
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,791
It's quite strange, don't you think?

215
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,037
I thought it was the obvious choice.

216
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:29,109
Yes, Mother.

217
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:32,479
- There's nothing left for Sa Rin.
- It's fine. I don't like kiwi fruit.

218
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,182
Putting my loved ones first.

219
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,150
You'll have another grandchild in no time.

220
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,052
And pushing my feelings aside...

221
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,154
for their sake.

222
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,724
Everyone said...

223
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,860
that's just how things are.

224
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:51,064
Perhaps we were all
locking ourselves away...

225
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,568
within those obvious expectations
and standards.

226
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,238
Pretending we're okay when it hurts...

227
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,374
In the end,

228
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,976
the thing that made me hesitate...

229
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,046
may have just been myself.

230
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:17,991
Look what came for you.

231
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:19,893
What is it?

232
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,329
I think it's from
the owner of the workshop on Jeju Island.

233
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,064
Thank you.

234
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,801
I wonder what he's sent
just for our darling Ms. Min.

235
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,574
(Milan Furniture Fair)

236
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,080
Oh, my gosh!

237
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,250
It's an invitation
to the Milan Furniture Fair!

238
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,287
I heard he was participating,
but I didn't expect to get an invitation.

239
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:51,091
- You've always wanted to go there.
- Yes, so much!

240
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,060
The dates are perfect too.

241
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,929
You've been saving up vacation days
to take a long break two weeks from now.

242
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,866
So the only thing I need to do
is book my flight tickets?

243
00:19:58,932 --> 00:19:59,933
- Right now.
- Right now.

244
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,514
I've made whole radish kimchi.
Pick it up on your way home.

245
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,222
Has Gu Young told you?

246
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,692
We're having
Father's 70th birthday party a week early.

247
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,030
- Sorry?
- He said he'd call you in the afternoon.

248
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,265
He must have been busy.

249
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,634
Uncle's family is busy,

250
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,669
and Gu Il's have plans that day too.

251
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,438
So we agreed to hold it a week ahead.
It'll be two Saturdays from now.

252
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:40,140
Two weeks from now?

253
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,342
You don't work on Saturdays,
so it should be fine, right?

254
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,380
It's an invitation
to the Milan Furniture Fair!

255
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,249
You've been saving up vacation days
to take a long break two weeks from now.

256
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:52,986
What is it? Are you busy that day?

257
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:00,827
That day...

258
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,964
We can't have you miss
your father-in-law's 70th birthday party.

259
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:07,801
Hye Rin has changed the reservation date,
so it's settled for the week after next.

260
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,743
I can't make it, Mother.

261
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:18,679
What?

262
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,448
I need to go to Milan
for a furniture exhibition.

263
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,317
Where? Milan?

264
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:26,186
It's an exhibition
that I've always wanted to see in person.

265
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:29,556
It's my dream to exhibit
my furniture designs there one day too.

266
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:36,697
I'll be going now, Mother.

267
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,237
And thank you for this, Mother.

268
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,543
An exhibition?

269
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,145
(Flight reservations)

270
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,882
(Milan)

271
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,319
That evening
after notifying my mother-in-law,

272
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:03,257
I made a bold move and booked my tickets.

273
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:05,626
And two weeks later,

274
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,996
I boarded my flight to Milan
with a light heart.

275
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:13,166
No. I wanted to board that flight.

276
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,571
It's not like anyone stopped me
and told me I couldn't go.

277
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,774
It was my own hesitations again...

278
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:24,077
that prevented me from going to Milan.

279
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,285
Here you go. It's for your flight ticket.

280
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,820
I hope you'll be able to go next year.

281
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:38,125
And like that, instead of solely trying
to live up to others' expectations,

282
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,227
I slowly began to make my way...

283
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:43,530
to living a life for myself.

284
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,937
Gu Young!

285
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:54,174
Next will be the wedding vows
and declaration of marriage.

286
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,311
Do you, Min Sa Rin,

287
00:22:57,678 --> 00:23:01,114
take this man, Mu Gu Young,
to be your husband...

288
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:03,817
in sickness and in health?

289
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,519
Do you vow to be a good daughter-in-law?

290
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:07,855
Sorry?

291
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,324
Will you be a good daughter-in-law?

292
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:21,368
No.

293
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,303
I refuse...

294
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,639
to be a good daughter-in-law.

295
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,842
(I thought it was natural
to prioritize my loved ones...)

296
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:30,544
(and push my feelings aside
for their sake.)

297
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,315
(I'll work hard so that
you can always be yourself...)

298
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:36,583
(and not just a daughter-in-law.)

299
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,019
(Special thanks to Park Soo Young)

300
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,555
(You've grown up so well.
You're my reward for all my hard work.)

301
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,791
(Where did we go so wrong?)

302
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,628
(All we want is for them to have
happy marriages. Is that too much to ask?)

303
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,533
(What else would I do at home?
That's what I'm here for.)

304
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,103
(My family comes first now.)

305
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,704
(Who says that's the way
it's meant to be?)

306
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,709
(I struggled a lot.
But then everything exploded in my face.)

307
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:19,760
(We're cheering for all of the
Sa Rins and Gu Youngs of the world.)
