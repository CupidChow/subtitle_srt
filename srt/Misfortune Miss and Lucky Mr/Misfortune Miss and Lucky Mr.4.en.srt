00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,850
Am I dead?

Can't I go back anymore?

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,510
Take a guess.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,180
Don't cry.

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,180
You're not dead.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,610
I have terrible luck.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,310
And now even you're teasing me.

17
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,410
Become Gu Yichen's personal assistant,

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,380
and you'll have more time
and chances to approach him.

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,910
How do I contact you?

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,380
Hey.

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,910
Don't go.

22
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:14,410
Where are you?

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,080
(My luck stat increases.)

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,910
(Did I change the plot?)

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,310
You're awake?

26
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,850
You're fine.

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,110
Mr. Gu,

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,184
you should ask me, "Are you all right?"

29
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:39,680
Not answering that for me.

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,810
If you're fine,

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,780
see yourself out.

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,210
What time is it?

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,380
6 PM.

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,550
The ceremony started at 1 PM.

35
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,180
You've been here
for the past five hours?

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,810
I didn't stay here for you, anyway.

37
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,280
(He refuses to admit it.)

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,650
(That's cute.)

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,810
Hey.

40
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,810
I haven't talked to you
about the compensation.

41
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,180
I'd like to apply for the position
of your personal assistant.

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,780
There's no such position.

43
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,880
You can set up one.

44
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,350
Please think about it, Mr. Gu.

45
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,650
I don't need a personal assistant.

46
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,280
Yes, you do.

47
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,010
I can help you acquire the Wei Group.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,910
You don't seem to care for Wei Yunjiao

49
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,250
sincerely.

50
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,450
Obviously, you're after something.

51
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,994
So,

52
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:28,050
we can pretend to be close

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,580
and cover your ambition
to acquire Wei Group.

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
You're pursuing Ms. Wei

55
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,266
for your acquisition.

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,410
That's such a jerk.

57
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,048
What do you mean?

58
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,256
How do you know about my plan?

59
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,866
Oh.

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,421
It's dizzy.

61
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,280
Is that a yes?

62
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,480
I've connected to Gu Yichen's
security system

63
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,280
and made some alterations.

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,050
According to my precise calculation,

65
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,180
in 45.58 seconds,

66
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,410
Shen Qingge will
reach Gu Yichen's place.

67
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,580
When you press this button,

68
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:44,710
Shen Qingge will be identified
as an intruder

69
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,110
the moment she presses the doorbell.

70
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,850
I want to embarrass her.

71
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,580
20 seconds more.

72
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,510
If everything goes as planned,
you'll soon hear her scream.

73
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:04,410
Five,

74
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,680
four,

75
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:07,550
three,

76
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:08,910
two,

77
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:10,250
one.

78
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:17,780
What's going on?

79
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,580
Nothing has happened.

80
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:28,090
(Power outage)

81
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,250
Jiao,

82
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,650
the system shows there's a power outage
in this neighborhood.

83
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,510
Can't you be useful for once?

84
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,760
I can't believe there's a power outage
in this fancy residence.

85
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,110
Bad luck.

86
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,725
The power outage isn't part of the plan.

87
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:53,704
I didn't know either.

88
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:54,453
I don't care.

89
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,650
You must think of another way.

90
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,450
I can't let this woman
get too close to Chen.

91
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,061
All right.

92
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:02,965
I'll figure something out.

93
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,165
I'll try.

94
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,024
It's too late.

95
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,910
Mr. Gu.

96
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,510
Gu Yichen.

97
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,680
Anyone home?

98
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,380
(This jerk is so hot.)

99
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,780
(What a shame.)

100
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,850
(Hold on.)

101
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,157
(Now is the best opportunity
to find his luck stat.)

102
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,488
(Is it bad to do this?)

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,280
(Well,)

104
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,106
(luck stat is very important.)

105
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,997
(Anyway, I'm in the novel.)

106
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,080
(I can't care about so much.)

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,480
(Oh no.)

108
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,269
(Did he catch me?)

109
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,832
(No way.)

110
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,917
(He has a weapon.)

111
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,510
(Luckily, I have...)

112
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,250
(Drat.)

113
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,750
(I'm so careless.)

114
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,050
That woman?

115
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,810
(I'm here to work.)

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,350
(Why do I have to hide?)

117
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,780
It's you.

118
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,250
No, not me.

119
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,350
Woman,

120
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,510
you're playing with fire.

121
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,162
Luck stat!

122
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,080
What are you talking about, woman?

123
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,570
It's so high!

124
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,125
That's amazing.

125
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,840
You're really the luckiest man
in this world.

126
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,150
You broke into my house
and harassed me.

127
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,450
I caught you red-handed.

128
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,580
Mr. Shen,

129
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,085
is there anything you have to say

130
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,050
before the police arrest you?

131
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,149
Don't call the police.

132
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,010
I came here to report for work.

133
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,397
Nice.

134
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,146
Ox-Head and Horse-Face?

135
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,980
Am I dead?

136
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,810
Am I revived?

137
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,800
Where are my glasses?

138
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,210
Shen Qingge,

139
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,101
are you afraid?

140
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm not talking to you.

141
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,810
Where's Mr. System?

142
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,910
Does he give me any hints?

143
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,832
Shen Qingge,

144
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,800
fess up your plan,

145
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,821
and you'll be able to atone
for your sin.

146
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,950
Understood?

147
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,310
What plan?

148
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,117
I just want to know
how much luck stat I have left.

149
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,810
Speak up.

150
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,445
Who's your motive
to approach Gu Yichen?

151
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,613
Weren't you the ones who ordered me
to approach Gu Yichen?

152
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,237
You better explain this.

153
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,501
How could I possibly do that?

154
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,298
It's your own problem.

155
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,328
(What is Wei Yunjiao doing here?)

156
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,780
It's him.

157
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,950
He ordered me to do it.

158
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,610
Shen Qingge,

159
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,512
don't try to trick us.

160
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,402
Zhao Moran,

161
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,952
explain yourself.

162
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:09,120
Why did you tell Shen Qingge
to approach Chen?

163
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,016
Ms. Shen,

164
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,557
you're slandering me.

165
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:14,877
Zhao Moran,

166
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,005
don't think I don't know
what kind of person you are.

167
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:20,832
I can see you through.

168
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,408
Watch your words.

169
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,509
You're not welcome here.

170
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:25,210
Leave.

171
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,350
Qingge,

172
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,850
if you leave Chen,

173
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,080
I'll give you anything you want.

174
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,010
This money is enough for you to live
comfortably for the rest of your life.

175
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,010
Take it.

176
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,368
He's my beloved.

177
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,650
Money alone

178
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,592
isn't enough.

179
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,674
You!

180
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,528
Just you wait.

181
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,960
Qingge,

182
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,440
I was just

183
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,645
playing along with Ms. Wei.

184
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,664
But you ought to hold on tight

185
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,600
to Gu Yichen.

186
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,880
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

187
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,780
How do you know I'm here?

188
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,544
We were meeting Mr. Gu
at his place.

189
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,080

Ms. Shen,
