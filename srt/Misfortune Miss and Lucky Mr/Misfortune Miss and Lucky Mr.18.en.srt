=Episode 18=

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,730
I wasn't kind to her.

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,760
Is she trying to get revenge on me?

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,360
Don't worry.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,360
I'm here.

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll keep you out of harm's way.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,760
Okay.

16
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,400
Don't sit too far away.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,330
She's here.

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,000
People who are in love
have a better complexion.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,230
You look so pale.

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,330
(She's concerned about me.)

21
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,960
(It seems like there's hope.)

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,430
(She still can be the heroine.)

23
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:45,930
Ms. Wei,

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,500
what I'm about to tell you

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,930
might be hard for you to understand,

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,030
but I hope you'll do as I say.

27
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,800
If not,

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,850
the consequences can be unpredictable.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,560
Are you trying to threaten me?

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,634
I'm not threatening you.

31
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:57,700
I'm helping you.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,030
For what?

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,730
For the sake of Gu Yichen

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,800
and you.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,730
I don't belong to this world.

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,820
I came into this world

37
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,320
on the day Gu Group acquired Shen Group.

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,150
I thought you were going to
say something else.

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,700
Apart from this, you're going
to tell me about luck stat, right?

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
(How does she know that?)

41
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,200
(Forget it.)

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,350
(It's not important anymore.)

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,930
Since you know everything,

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,300
I'll get to the point.

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,600
I don't want to listen to your nonsense.

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,160
This is the world of a novel,

47
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,000
but it doesn't go as planned.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,430
Everything has gone out of control.

49
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,760
Perhaps

50
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,030
only you can save this world.

51
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,230
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,530
I don't understand.

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,310
Do you care about Gu Yichen?

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,949
If you sit on your hands
and do nothing,

55
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,400
the first one to disappear will be him.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,300
Disappear?

57
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,100
Where's Chen going?

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,760
You can think of it as

59
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,560
he'll die.

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,760
This is impossible.

61
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,930
Yichen is the luckiest man
in this world.

62
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,760
No one can hurt him.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,800
It's because of me.

64
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,960
My appearance

65
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,800
has changed your storyline.

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
At first, I approached Gu Yichen

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,177
to gain luck stat from him.

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I didn't have any bad intentions.

69
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,860
But then, I realized I liked him.

70
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,000
I thought I was an exception

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,999
and could break through the dimension
to be with him.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,620
However, he has become
unluckier since then.

73
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:18,560
That's when I realized

74
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,600
I was too selfish.

75
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,160
For my own luck and feelings,

76
00:03:23,798 --> 00:03:24,830
I actually hurt him.

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Gu Yichen will become even unluckier

78
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,200
and more accidents will happen to him.

79
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,800
To save him,

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,160
I must leave tonight.

81
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,560
But he's too unlucky now,

82
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,230
someone has to protect him.

83
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,960
Ms. Wei,

84
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,700
you're his partner in this novel.

85
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,660
Perhaps

86
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,530
only you can...

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,900
But...

88
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,200
But I like someone else.

89
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,300
You said that Chen is
going through a tough time,

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm very sad about that.

91
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,900
But now,

92
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,360
I care more about Zhao Moran's feelings.

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,430
No.

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,560
He's the antagonist.

95
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,600
He's the villain.

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,330
His only goal is
to bring Gu Yichen down.

97
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,700
He's kind to you

98
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,350
because he wants to
take over the Wei Group

99
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:05,360
and destroy the Gu Group.

100
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,230
Don't believe in him.

101
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,600
Not a word.

102
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,230
Ms. Wei,

103
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm begging you.

104
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,630
I was too capricious before.

105
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,930
But now,

106
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,500
you're the only one in this world
who can help him.

107
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
Why should I trust you?

108
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,830
Because I know your complete persona

109
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,100
and things only you know.

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,200
Did you buy her nonsense?

111
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,930
She's obviously mad.

112
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,200
How could someone with the right mind
say things like that?

113
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,830
But she knows about my childhood.

114
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,460
Gu Yichen also knows

115
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,130
about that.

116
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,800
They're together every day,

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
so they'd talk about it.

118
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,330
But

119
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,030
if Chen talks about me with Qingge,

120
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,230
and she remembers me,

121
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,400
that means she's not a bad woman.

122
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,130
Besides, Yichen's luck seems
to be getting worse.

123
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,030
Chen this,

124
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,100
Chen that.

125
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,530
What exactly am I to you, Wei Yunjiao?

126
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,030
Don't be mad.

127
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,730
If what Qingge said is true,

128
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,760
this is a serious matter.

129
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,330
I can't just stand by
while they're in danger.

130
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,500
I told you,

131
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,560
Shen Qingge is a madwoman.

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
Why are you still believing her?

133
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:33,900
Fine.

134
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,050
You say you want to help him.

135
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,700
You tell me, how are you going to help him?

136
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,800
How?

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,430
I...

138
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,830
I can't think it through now.

139
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,400
I need time.

140
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,730
Wei Yunjiao, look at me.

141
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,100
You want to help Gu Yichen
even though he's unlucky.

142
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,030
But when I was struggling alone,

143
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:55,800
has anyone ever helped me?

144
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,500
Huh?

145
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,200
If Gu Yichen is worth saving,

146
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,030
but what about what he owes me

147
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,300
and my family?

148
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,230
Who will repay them?

149
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,200
Who?

150
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,960
You?

151
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,230
Fine.

152
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,530
Since neither of you
wants me to be well,

153
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,430
then none of us will.

154
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Zhao Moran.

155
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,730
Zhao Moran.

156
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,730
Zhao Moran.

157
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,630
What are you planning to do, Zhao Moran?

158
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,630
Zhao Moran!

159
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,350
What are you trying to do, Zhao Moran?

160
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,330
Don't do silly things.

161
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,130
Zhao Moran.

162
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,400
Don't hurt Chen, Zhao Moran!

163
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,060
The subscriber you've dialed
is unreachable.

164
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,530
Please try again later.

165
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,220
What took you so long to buy breakfast?

166
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,250
You didn't pick up either.

167
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm worried.

168
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,630
Ms. Wei.

169
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,100
Chen,

170
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,730
I have something to talk to you.

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Please come in.

172
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
Chen,

173
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,430
what happened to your head?

174
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,430
I bumped into something yesterday.

175
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:46,930
So

176
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:49,830
you're no longer lucky?

177
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,330
How did you know?

178
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,100
Have you ever liked me?

179
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,960
What are you trying to say?

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Chen,

181
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,560
I always thought I really liked you.

182
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:06,230
But then,

183
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,000
I secretly watched you and Shen Qingge,

184
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,630
and I finally realized

185
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,930
what love truly is.

186
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,000
Now,

187
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,760
I think I've found someone
who's more suitable for me.

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,330
He knows me

189
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,900
and spends time with me.

190
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,100
Even though I'm capricious

191
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,960
and do things he doesn't like,

192
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,360
he never leaves me.

193
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,200
So,

194
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:31,300
Chen,

195
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,030
if he does something bad,

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,030
could you please spare him

197
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,230
for my sake?

198
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,830
Who's the man you like?

199
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,030
Zhao Moran.

200
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,230
But

201
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,030
he might do something bad to you and Qingge.

202
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,430
What makes you say that?

203
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
This morning,

204
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:54,400
Qingge asked to meet me.

205
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,730
I took Zhao Moran with me.

206
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,400
But

207
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,500
she said a lot of things
I couldn't understand.

208
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,900
To sum up,

209
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,630
Chen, you're not as lucky
as you were before.

210
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,100
Why did she tell you that?

211
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,200
Qingge told me
she would disappear tonight

212
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,000
and wanted me to protect you.

213
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,730
She also said

214
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,960
that Zhao Moran is a bad guy.

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,630
I mustn't believe in anything he says.

216
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,400
Zhao Moran was furious.

217
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,530
I'm afraid he might do something
to harm you both out of rash.

218
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,660
Where's she?

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,160
I can't reach out to her.

220
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,760
I don't know either.

221
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,400
I'll go with you to find her.

222
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,930
Maybe we can find her.

223
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,500
Let's go.

224
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,260
All right.

225
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,260
Shen Qingge!

226
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,700
Shen Qingge!

227
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,630
What should we do, Chen?

228
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,530
Where do you think she might be?

229
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,130
Let's check the security footage.

230
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,700
You and Gu Yichen
are so deeply in love with each other.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,300
How can you bear to leave him?

232
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,500
You're not going anywhere.

233
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,630
Zhao Moran,

234
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,900
what are you up to?

235
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,600
After tonight,

236
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,200
you'll go back to him

237
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:25,700
and bring him more bad luck.

238
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:31,360
Zhao Moran!

239
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,830
Mr. System.

240
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,500
The seven-planetary alignment
will happen tonight.

241
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,360
You must go back.

242
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,030
Okay.

243
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,700
I will.

244
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I've informed Gu Yichen
to come save you.

245
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,200
No.

246
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,300
He can't come.

247
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,230
Qingge,

248
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,800
in fact,

249
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,960
when your luck stat reaches 5,000,

250
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,200
you can go back once
the seven-planetary alignment appears.

251
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,100
But I don't want to

252
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,530
be trapped here anymore.

253
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,155
It has been more than ten years.

254
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
I've seen many travelers,

255
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,460
only you have

256
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,160
come this far.

257
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,900
I lied to you

258
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,800
that you need 100,000 luck stat
to go back.

259
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,600
It's because

260
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,860
I want you to take me away.

261
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,230
But Gu Yichen can't come here.

262
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,730
He has bad luck now.

263
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,400
Something is bound to happen
if he does.

264
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,930
Mr. System,

265
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,330
I can take you back.

266
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,339
We'll leave tonight.

267
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,300
No hesitation.

268
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,900
But he really can't come here.

269
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,100
No one else can save you
except for him.

270
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,530
If you're stuck here,

271
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,960
none of us can go back.

272
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You can call the police.

273
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,500
Call the police.

274
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,700
I can't contact anyone from this world,

275
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,960
nor can I intervene in the story.

276
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,800
Qingge,

277
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,530
tonight,

278
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,460
we must go back.

279
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,360
Then how are you going
to tell Gu Yichen?

280
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,660
How are you going to tell him?

281
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,800
How?

282
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,900
