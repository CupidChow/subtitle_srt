I do.

I know her very well.

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,880
She lives in 221.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,010
Go find her now.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,010

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,140
I know they'd come after you.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,180
They should come after me.

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,310
It's my fault.

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,180
I didn't settle their debts in time

33
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,640
after acquiring the Shen Group.

34
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,610
I'll handle it properly soon.

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,480

36
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,010

39
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,780

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,940

come after you,

if I stay at your place,

45
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,940
I can be there whenever you need me.

47

Is the job I gave you not convenient?

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,240
No.

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,280
I didn't mean that.

61

and do your best
to gain luck stat from him.

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,240
There's a bathroom in your room.

63
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
Yes, there is.

64
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,410

65
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740

71
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980

72
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,240

so many termination agreements?

188
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,680
How are you managing our clients?

189
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,440
Mr. Gu,

190
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,780
since you were taken in
for investigation,

191
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,440
rumors have been spreading
that Gu Group isn't clean.

192
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,010
Today's news,

193
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,040
the Shen Group's financial issues,

194
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
and Qingge's negative public image.

195
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,210
Because you...

196
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,040
It's because of both of you,

197
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,280
the clients have lost confidence
in Gu Group's future.

198
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,940
Mr. System,

199
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,580
are you there?

200
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,180
I really need you.

201
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,780
Can you appear?

202
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,240
Seems like I need to figure out myself.

203
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,680
Hey.

204
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,840
Shen Qingge,

205
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,340
can you be more sincere
when you ask for help?

206
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,840
