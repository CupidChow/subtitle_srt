Let's meet him now

16

and get him to honor his promise

17
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,510
Why would he invest in the company?

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,110
Because we're getting engaged.

19
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:19,410
You know quite a lot, Ms. Shen.

20
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,040
Is there anything else
you'd like to remind me of?

21
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,840
(I messed it up tonight.)

22

has affected the funding.

25
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,040
But it was the driver

26
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,980
who took me out
to the outskirts of the town.

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,740
I barely managed
to escape and come back.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
Gu Yichen,

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,680
let's meet the gentleman right now

30
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:48,180
and get him to invest in the company,

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,140
okay?

32
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:53,110
Ms. Shen,

33
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,310
there's no need
to humble yourself so much.

34
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,210
Gu Yichen,

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,710
why are you saying that?

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,240
I ran three hours

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,410
across half the town

38
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,940
just to fulfill your wish.

39
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,110
Are you giving up
over a little setback?

40
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,380
My wish?

41
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,380
What about yours, Ms. Shen?

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,380
My wish

43
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,580
is to be with you.

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,980
Why did you look into my wardrobe?

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,740
Didn't we talk about this?

46
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,210
How long are you going
to keep fooling me?

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,910
Where are you from?

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,410
Why did you approach me?

49
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,280
What do you want?

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,410
Who sent you?

51
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:54,780
Did you do all this for the luck stat?

52
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,140
Holding hands adds 30,

53
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:58,710
a hug add 50,

54
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,780
a kiss adds 500,

55
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,310
and double the stat if I fall for you.

56
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:03,540
Ms. Shen,

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
you've calculated everything so well.

58
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,280
Gu Yichen,

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,340
I admit

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,740
that I approached you
with an intention in the beginning.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,610
I thought you were an obnoxious,
overbearing president.

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,780
But the closer I got to you,

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,240
the more I...

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
You had this bag

65
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,580
to get close to me, didn't you?

66
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,510
Ms. Shen,

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,780
you've planned every step
so meticulously

68
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,780
and made me fall for it.

69
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,980
Calm down, Gu Yichen.

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,780
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

71
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,980
Ah!

72
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,280
We'll talk this out,

73
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,340

74
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,533
Gu Yichen,

75
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,010
I hate it so much
when you act like an overbearing boss.

76
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,010

77
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,980

78
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:00,010

79
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:01,010
that you'd know the entire truth

80
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,940
with a few words?

81
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,280
Tell me everything, then.

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,980
Do you think

83
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,510
they'll break up this time?

84
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,740
