(He's been controlled by Mrs. Gu.)

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,218
(The only solution to family
business problem is to go public.)

12
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:05,933
Ahem.

13
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,458
Are you worrying about
the company going public?

14
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,490
How do you know?

15
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,298
Is it still far off?

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,026
(In the novel,)

17
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,253
(the biggest shove behind the Gu Group's
public listing comes from a gentleman.)

18
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,680
(Gu Yichen wins the bet)

19
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:33,080
(by marrying Wei Yunjiao,)

20
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:34,832
(and the company finally goes public.)

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,213
(If I could keep this main plot,)

22
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:40,586
(maybe there's still a chance
for everything.)

23
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,920
(I could also make peace
with Mr. System.)

24
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:44,837
(I can't worry too much.)

25
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,160
(I need to give it a shot.)

26
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,893
Have you ever met anyone
or had a strange encounter?

27
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:53,933
You should sleep now.

28
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:55,413
I'll take care of it.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,090
Try to recall.

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
Have you

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,590
made a bet before?

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,930
About marriage and investment.

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,060
There's this gentleman.

34
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,648
He's my mom's friend.

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,394
I made a bet with him.

36
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,260
What if he becomes your investor?

37
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,590
Ah!

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,360
Shen Qingge,

39
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,960
are you all right?

40
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,890
You're afraid of thunder?

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,130
I'm not.

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,860
Don't be afraid.

43
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,690
I'm here.

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,830
Gu Yichen,

45
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:16,630
thank you.

46
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,660
Qingge,

47
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,460
you just reminded me.

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,460
If we can get
the gentleman's investment...

49
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,430
How would you know about
my bet with him?

50
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,190
Qingge,

51
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:14,090
is my coat inside the wardrobe?

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,970
You can't look at it.

53
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,230
Why not?

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,830
It's a custom here.

55
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,630
Women keep their private items here.

56
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,960
Men shouldn't look at them.

57
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,714
I don't think I've heard about this.

58
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,562
Your clothes were prepared by the maid
and placed in the cloakroom.

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,850
Of course, I don't know about this.

60
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,813
That's true.

61
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,613
I'll keep that in mind.

62
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,690
Gu Yichen,

63
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,090
are you ready?

64
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,190
The opponent you're facing today
is your grandma.

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,260
It's getting colder.

66
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:57,530
Gu Group

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,260
needs to face a change.

68
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,490
Everyone here has been
following the Gu family for years.

69
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,760
Today, I gather you all here

70
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:18,630
for an important announcement.

71
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,460
Something has gone wrong
with the Gu Group,

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,860
so I need to make a tough decision.

73
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Gu Yichen,

74
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,390
starting today, I'll take control

75
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,490
of everything you have in the Gu family.

76
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,560
Grandma is right.

77
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,490
Something did go wrong
with the Gu Group.

78
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,790
Since you agree with me,

79
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,290
proceed as I say.

80
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,230
Meeting adjourned.

81
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,230
Grandma,

82
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,560
you're the problem.

83
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,560
Everyone here has contributed
significantly to the Gu Group.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,170
Over the years,

85
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,730
the Gu Group has treated you unfairly.

86
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,853
Every year,

87
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,098
you have to submit
increasingly higher profits.

88
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,960
I wonder if any of you
feel dissatisfied with this.

89
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,386
Have you ever thought

90
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,888
that maybe you should withdraw
from the company

91
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,430
and stop contributing to the Gu family?

92
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,930
Mr. Li,

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,890
is that what you're thinking?

94
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,030
Mr. Gu, don't joke with me.

95
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,130
Mr. Gu, why not get to the point?

96
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,912
My point is

97
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,146
the Gu Group is like a cake,

98
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,490
and I want to make it bigger.

99
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,430
I'll get the company listed this year.

100
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,360
That way, you'll benefit
from the dividends of your shares.

101
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,630
Your potion of the cake will grow.

102
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,930
What do you all think?

103
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,562
Yichen,

104
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,230
why does the Gu family have
to go public?

105
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,760
The company has remained unchanged
since your grandfather's time.

106
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,256
It can't be changed.

107
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,390
Even at the cost
of sacrificing everyone's benefit?

108
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,660
Is it?

109
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,190
Everyone, don't be fooled
by this young man.

110
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,546
As for this year's profit
from each subsidiary,

111
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,660
I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

112
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
Everyone,

113
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,685
will you choose to become
the owners of the Gu Group

114
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,533
and share in its mutual benefits,

115
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,224
or continue struggling with the profits
you're required to submit each year?

116
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,856
I believe you have your answer.

117
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,290
He's right. We should listen to Mr. Gu.
It's mutual gain.

118
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,990
Mr. Gu,

119
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,630
it's not that we don't believe you,

120
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,360
but the Gu Group isn't ready
to go public yet.

121
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,930
We'll face a lot of difficulties.

122
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,790
What will you do

123
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,430
when those difficulties appear?

124
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,790
I have my ways.

125
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,630
You just need to wait for the results.

126
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,360
Anyone can make empty promises.

127
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,610
Yichen,

128
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,109
you're too young.

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,060
I'll make my promise here.

130
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,630
If the company can't go public
within a year,

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,860
I'll step down from the position
for someone more suitable.

132
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,213
Since you've said that,

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,621
we'll wait for the good news.

134
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,060
How can Chen suffer
in this kind of place?

135
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,490
Go

136
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,698
and bring him down.

137
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,730
He'll stay at my house.

138
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,930
Why don't you go yourself?

139
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,400
I don't want to see that jinx.

140
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:04,730
Is this the method you came up with?

141
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,630
Yes.

142
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,430
No way.

143
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,330
He can't stay at your house.

144
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,130
Why not?

145
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,560
No means no.

146
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,909
You promised you'd help me.

147
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:14,026
Don't break your promise.

148
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,260
I can do anything for you,

149
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,190
but he can't stay at your place.

150
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,130
Why not?

151
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,464
It's my house,

152
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,860
not yours.

153
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,990
This is a matter of principle.

154
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,390
I'll be mad if you don't help me.

155
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:27,930
One,

156
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,090
two.

157
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,660
Please go and get him down.

158
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,282
Please.

159
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:37,106
Go now.

160
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:38,120
Zhao Moran.

161
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,760
Fine.

162
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,660
Go ahead.

163
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,390
(Why did I get so worked up?)

164
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,530
(Have I)

165
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,890
(fallen for her?)

166

Hold hands+30, Huga+50, Travel, Mrs. Gu)

167
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,218
Shen Qingge,

168
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,405
