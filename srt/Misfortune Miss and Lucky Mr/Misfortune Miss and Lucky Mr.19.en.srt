Jiao,

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,170
wait here.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,000
If I don't come out in an hour,

13
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,270
call the police.

14
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,040
No.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,200
I'm going in with you.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,870
With me there,

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,170
Zhao Moran won't go too far.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,300
This place is dangerous.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,140
Don't worry.

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,670
I'll take care of myself.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,540
Let's go.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,440
Come on.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,970
Chen,

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,550
let's split.

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,550
It'll be faster this way.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,700
Be careful.

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,840
You still came.

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,800
Even Jiao knows you're leaving.

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,310
You should leave now.

30
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,570
This place is too dangerous.

31
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,750
You're going to lose
more of your luck stat,

32
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,200
and more things will happen to you.

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,800
I still hope you're the lucky guy
as you were.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,340
To me,

35
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,670
without you,

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,999
it's meaningless
even though how lucky I get.

37
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,710
You'll die.

38
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:57,340
I'm not lying.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,470
If so, let me die

40
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,740
in your arms.

41
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,500
Well, well.

42
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:14,000
How touching.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,270
I'm so moved.

44
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,440
Zhao Moran,

45
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,000
release Shen Qingge.

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,817
I'll give you

47
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:22,970
anything you want.

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,840
Give me?

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,970
Hmph!

50
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,170
How generous of you, Mr. Gu.

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,500
The Gu family's business

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,770
was established
by many generations of the Zhao family.

53
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,600
Who are you to give me that?

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,140
You shouldn't have threatened me
with Shen Qingge.

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,500
If you want anything,

56
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,340
we can negotiate.

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,140
Negotiate?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,150
Negotiate how the Gu family

59
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,400
tramples on the Zhao family

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,640
and kicks us out of the board?

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
That I didn't harm Shen Qingge,

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,209
but she slandered me in front
of Wei Yunjiao?

63
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,627
Zhao Moran,

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,547
I was telling the truth.

65
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,680
If Wei Yunjiao marries you
without knowing the truth,

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,725
she'll have a tragic life.

67
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:01,900
Shen Qingge,

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,270
you're spewing nonsense!

69
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,440
I took a second to think,

70
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,270
if everything goes as you say

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,400
and we're in the world of a novel,

72
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,400
I'll eliminate you both

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
and become the hero
of this world, right?

74
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,600
Zhao Moran,

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
you're insane.

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
Even if this is a novel,

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,467
you can't decide on others' lives

78
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:31,000
however you want.

79
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,300
Besides,

80
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,418
being the hero

81
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,846
isn't about doing evil things

82
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:36,940
but having true charm.

83
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:37,823
Charm?

84
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,284
What's that?

85
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,428
Let me tell you.

86
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,670
Whoever manages to leave this place
is the one with true charm.

87
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:45,940
Shen Qingge,

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,270
I used to hate Gu Yichen.

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,000
But now,

90
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,700
I think it's you.

91
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,270
Gu Yichen!

92
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,240
Zhao Moran!

93
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,540
- Zhao Moran!
- Gu Yichen!

94
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,940
Zhao Moran.

95
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,640
Don't do silly things, Zhao Moran.

96
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,970
Qingge,

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,870
leave now.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,070
Now.

99
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,600
Leave.

100
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:14,870
Zhao Moran,

101
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:18,140
is hurting Yichen and Qingge

102
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:19,740
something you really want?

103
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:23,570
Bringing Gu Yichen down is my mission.

104
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:32,640
Have you ever thought
about why you're doing this?

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,540
Qingge said

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,234
the author made you

107
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:41,572
approach me and use the Wei Group
to defeat Chen.

108
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,240
But you've been so kind to me,

109
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,270
I don't believe you feel nothing for me.

110
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,467
If our life is a novel

111
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,770
and we're all fictional characters,

112
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,240
our missions

113
00:04:58,518 --> 00:05:00,670
are something the author forced on us.

114
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,100
Zhao Moran.

115
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,140
Look at me, Zhao Moran.

116
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:08,840
Chen and Qingge have the courage
to break the shackles.

117
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,040
Let's be brave

118
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,270
and face our hearts,

119
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,470
okay?

120
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:41,040
(Theater in use)

121
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:54,300
Lily.

122
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,870
Hello,

123
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,640
Qingge.

124
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,170
I have good news for you.

125
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,700
Our IPO application has been approved.

126
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,370
You and Mr. Gu worked so hard for this.

127
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,870
Finally, it's happening.

128
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,070
All right, Lily.

129
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:07,440
Got it.

130
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,500
Are you with Mr. Gu?

131
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:11,100
He didn't pick up.

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,170
This has never happened before.

133
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,970
I'll tell him the good news later.

134
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,812
If so, I'll send my blessings

135
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:21,800
to you and Mr. Gu in advance.

136
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,840

(Theater in use)

138
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,740
Ms. Shen,

139
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,440
Mr. Gu is out of danger,

140
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
but

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,770
there's no sign of him waking up.

142
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,870
Will he stay in a coma forever

143
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,140
and end up as a vegetable?

144
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,470
That's possible.

145
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,700
During this time,

146
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,040
you can spend more time with him

147
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,764
and talk about your memories

148
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,870
to stimulate his brain.

149
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,131
Perhaps it might increase
his chances of waking up.

150
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,518
All right.

151
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,492
