10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,028
So

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,943
after you saved that kid,

12
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,706
you've been staying
in the commoner neighborhood?

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,491
No wonder Lily and I couldn't find you.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,615
Maybe the people here
are also fictional characters.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,252
They may not be lucky,

16
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:03,092
but every one of them

17
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:05,484
is genuine with each other.

18
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:06,921
Yes.

19
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:09,373
Qingge,

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,517
is there any beef entrails shop
in your world, too?

21
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:14,358
Yes, there is.

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,930
Can you tell me about your world?

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,070
My world?

24
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,234
In my world,

25
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:30,063
I'd never dare to ride a Ferris wheel.

26
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,370
Let's go then.

27
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,810
Let's try it.

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,210
No.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,440
I have terrible luck.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,182
Something might go wrong

31
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:41,310
with the Ferris wheel.

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,110
Don't worry.

33
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,910
I'm with you.

34
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,010
Let's go.

35
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,010
Qingge,

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,570
look over there. Is it beautiful?

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,910
Yes.

38
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,070
Gu Yichen,

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,940
I have something to tell you.

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,610
Mr. System tells me

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,770
that if we're together,

42
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,770
the system of this novel will collapse.

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,610
The only way to prevent more incidents

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,410
is to restore the main plot.

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,140
But

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,370
I like you.

47
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,410
Gu Yichen,

48
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,370
I don't want to give up.

49
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,640
What's the main plot of the novel?

50
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,440
After you're with Wei Yunjiao,

51
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,110
you get funding to go public.

52
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,210
This is impossible.

53
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,770
I don't use marriage alliances
to go public.

54
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,940
I knew it.

55
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,140
I always have bad luck.

56
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,440
Something would definitely go wrong.

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,910
It's my fault.

58
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,010
I got you involved.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,940
It's fine.

60
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,910
Don't be afraid.

61
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm here.

62
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,940
You've said a lot.

63
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,510
Do you want to hear my thoughts?

64
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,010
I've been trying to verify

65
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,510
if what you said was true
these past few days.

66
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,710
I drove to the seaside.

67
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,010
and realized

68
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,570
that my life is just a script.

69
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,870
Even so,

70
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,310
I saved that child without thinking.

71
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,689
However, even though I know

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,210
I'm a fictional character

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,940
and that you're from another world,

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
so what?

75
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,940
Qingge,

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,170
ever since you came into my life,

77
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,810
I've truly felt what life is.

78
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,510
Everything I do comes from my own heart.

79
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,170
It's not arranged

80
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,540
or manipulated by the author.

81
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,110
So

82
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,370
you don't blame me for lying to you?

83
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,010
Of course not.

84
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,970
After all, you approached me
with an intention.

85
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,140
Hmm.

86
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,340
Do you want a chance to make it up?

87
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,110
How?

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Stay.

89
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,040
Don't leave me.

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,170
Don't leave this world.

91
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,640
It's because you're here,

92
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,710
and you've made me feel secure.

93
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,170
That's why

94
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,340
I'm willing to stay.

95
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,610
What's wrong?

96
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,940
I'm so moved by their love.

97
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,640
What?

98
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,140
Moved?

99
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,170
We've been setting up traps for them,

100
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,340
but they never doubted each other.

101
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,310
Instead, they're even more in love
after resolving their misunderstandings.

102
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,010
That's the kind of love stories
I read in novels.

103
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:33,520
Zhao Moran,

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,895
don't you think so?

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,840
Hmm?

106
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,040
I do.

107
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,940
Don't just look at me.

108
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,640
Try this.

109
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
How does it compare to hotel desserts?

110
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,970
How could it
be compared to hotel dessert?

111
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,540
Hey.

112
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,110
What do you mean?

113
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,310
Just by the look, yours is way better.

114
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,470
Jiao,

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,570
I bought two movie tickets.

116
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,370
Let's watch a movie later.

117
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,310
It's a revenge movie.

118
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,840
I don't want to watch those anymore.

119
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,210
I don't want to take revenge, either.

120
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,040
Actually, I don't know why

121
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,910
I have to target them.

122
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,810
They are engaged.

123
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,370
It's natural for them to be together.

124
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,910
Nothing's wrong with that.

125
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,840
So

126
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,010
you don't like Gu Yichen anymore?

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,010
I think I only like him

128
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,340
because everyone says
we make a good match.

129
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,010
But he has never spent time with me,

130
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,310
helped me,

131
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,840
or been with me

132
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,040
when I'm helpless.

133
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,610
- But I did.
- But you did.

134
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,940
Try this.

135
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,370
(Crap.)

136
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,140
(I'm done for.)

137
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,710
How does it taste?

138
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,710
What do you think of me?

139
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,510
Tomorrow,

140
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,240
I'll take you to meet my dad.

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,370
No. No way.

142
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,710
Don't get blinded by love.

143
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,510
I have to take revenge.

144
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,740
I have to take revenge.

145
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,810
Sir, I'm sorry.

146
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,640
I didn't mean it.

147
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,497
If you need me to compensate for it,

148
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:52,070
I...

149
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,840
It's all right.

150
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,870
Please get back to your work.

151
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,510
All right.

152
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,040
Do you need to change this?

153
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,540
I'll manage.

154
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,570
Why is my life-saving bag here?

155
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,440
I've been encountering
accidents recently,

156
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,740
so I used it.

157
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,840
(He has noticed his bad luck)

158
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,910
(and have made preparations for it.)

159
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,210
What's wrong?

160
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,470
(So his luck stat)

161
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,710
(could be used up by me.)

162
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,110
Qingge,

163
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,540
I've been thinking
about how I should propose to you.

164
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,510
I decided

165
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,410
to do it in a private space

166
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
where we could be honest
with each other.

167
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,640
I want to let you know
that I'm a living person,

168
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,240
not a fictional character
controlled by others.

169
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,410
Thank you for giving me a new life

170
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,510
and letting me know
what it feels like to be alive.

171
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,010
Thank you for promising
to never leave me.

172
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,370
I'll spend the rest of my life

173
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,040
giving you everything you want,

174
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,640
including myself.

175
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,310
Shen Qingge,

176
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,110
will you marry me?

177
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,110
(Turns out)

178
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,040
(Gu Yichen's luck stat isn't limitless.)

179
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,510
(I drain his luck stat.)

180
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,770
I need some time alone.
