=Episode 2=

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Woman,

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,200
what did you do last night?

12
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,300
Who put you up to this?

13
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,300
Can you not ask harsh questions?

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,740
That's very rude.

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,940
Woman...

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,440
Gu Yichen,

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,570
nothing happened between us last night.

18
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:10,768
Also, I have a name.

19
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:11,870
I'm Qiu...

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,770
Shen Qingge.

21
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:15,170
Don't call me woman.

22
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:18,072
Also, we were just sleeping together.

23
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,429
I didn't take advantage of you,

24
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:21,048
petty man.

25
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,608
I'm the president of Gu Group.

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,170
How could you...

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,340
You can't just act however you want.

28
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:29,600
Shen Qingge is your fiancee.

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,470
Even if something did
happen between us,

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,740
what's there to be afraid of?

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,669
If you dare, don't break off
the engagement,

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,570
and don't be a jerk.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
Who are you calling a jerk?

34
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,712
Stay mad if you want.

35
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,100
I'm going to sleep.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,870
Remember to wake me up before you leave.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,648
This woman is such a pain.

38
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,890
Mr. Gu, you're young and talented.

39
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:02,770
I've heard a lot about you.

40
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:05,016
You're so ambitious and insightful...

41
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:07,840
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:11,000
Is that all you can say
every time you see me?

43
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:22,900
My fiancee.

44
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:24,437
She's clingy.

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,840
She always plays games with me.

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,500
Seeing how close you both are

47
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:30,800
gives me the confidence
to hand over the family project to you.

48
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:34,600
All these years,

49
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:36,464
Qingge has taught me a lot

50
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,274
about love,

51
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,136
family, and responsibility.

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,573
I'll have my staff send
the contract over soon.

53
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,114
I'll have to trouble you
to review the details.

54
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,610
With you around,

55
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,368
we'll surely work well
on Mr. Wang's project.

56
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:55,032
Let go.

57
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,008
I taught you about love,

58
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,900
family, and responsibility.

59
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,402
You're playing with fire.

60
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,600
Could it be

61
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,740
that when he gets mad,

62
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:10,500
I can't get any luck stat?

63
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:11,685
Fine, I'll let go.

64
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,240
Petty man.

65
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,340
You're already so lucky.

66
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:17,270
Why are you always mad?

67
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,240
You even show your client a cold face.

68
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,800
Can you just smile a little?

69
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,570
Come.

70
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:22,300
Have a seat.

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,400
Let's talk.

72
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,200
Now is my personal time.

73
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,740
You need to make an appointment
in advance.

74
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:29,340
Shen Qingge is your fiancee, you know?

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,540
You want to marry me?

76
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,253
That's out of the question.

77
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,340
(He's so obnoxious.)

78
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:46,640
Wait for me.

79
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
It's dangerous.

80
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,200
Someone suspicious intrudes.

81
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:03,470
Does Mary Sue story include
action scenes as well?

82
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,040
Gu Yichen?

83
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,640
Why are you behind me?

84
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,440
Shen Qingge?

85
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:14,685
You still haven't given up on Chen?

86
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,920
(This must be the spoiled)

87
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,792
(and totally out-of-character heroine,)

88
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,989
(Wei Yunjiao.)

89
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:25,645
(If I want to survive here
as Shen Qingge,)

90
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:28,280
(I mustn't be a doormat
for just anyone can step on.)

91
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,466
But

92
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,554
Chen hasn't called off the engagement
with me yet.

93
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:35,540
You!

94
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,930
What a lively day today.

95
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:43,442
So many people here.

96
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:44,669
Oh,

97
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:45,776
Mr. Gu is here, too.

98
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,472
(He's the big bad in the novel,
Zhao Moran.)

99
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:50,442
(Due to grudges
from the past generation,)

100
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:51,970
(he has been disguised himself)

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,162
(and determined
to bring Gu Yichen down.)

102
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:55,464
(If you ask me,)

103
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:57,808
(he's a dapper villain.)

104
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:58,877
(It's better)

105
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:00,842
(to stay away from him.)

106
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,029
Shen Qingge,

107
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,114
this is the president's elevator.

108
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:06,576
Instead of using an employee elevator,

109
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:07,576
what are you doing here?

110
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,208
Why are you here, Qingge?

111
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,440
As an employee of Gu Group,

112
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,500
you should follow the employee rules.

113
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,989
This isn't a place for you.

114
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,653
(This heroine is so irritating.)

115
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,870
(Such a perfect match
with the egocentric Gu Yichen.)

116
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,229
(I'm going to take her down a peg.)

117
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,397
I have something to ask you.

118
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:27,141
We talked about it last night,

119
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:28,370
didn't we?

120
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,490
From here to my office,

121
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:36,029
you have one minute.

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,192
Chen.

123
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,640
Bye-bye.

124
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:49,989
Ms. Wei,

125
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:50,509
nice to meet you.

126
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,392
I'm the vice president

127
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,765
and also Shen Qingge's
direct supervisor.

128
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,270
Oh,

129
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:01,288
really?

130
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:03,968
I wonder if you have time now, Ms. Wei.

131
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,176
I'd like to talk to you.

132
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:08,434
Of course.

133
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,570
(To be fair,)

134
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,000
(when I take a closer look,)

135
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:21,445
(he's quite good-looking.)

136
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:25,240
(Too bad Ma Xiaoting
wrote him as a jerk.)

137
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:26,832
(What a shame.)

138
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:28,410
Shen Qingge,

139
00:06:28,994 --> 00:06:30,488
you have 30 seconds left.

140
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:33,274
Gosh.

141
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:34,437
Shen Qingge,

142
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,150
you're so unlucky.

143
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,050
Nothing won't happen to the elevator.

144
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,090
How do you know?

145
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,790
Because I'm born this way.

146
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,990
(Not only is he a jerk,
but he's also blindly confident.)

147
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,890
Ms. Shen,

148
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,920
what's it you want to say?

149
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,250
My patience has limits.

150
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,390
Mr. Gu,

151
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,120
as everyone knows,

152
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,250
under your protection,

153
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,990
the Shen family has become part
of the Gu Group,

154
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,250
while I,

155
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,290
an heiress of the family business,

156
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,858
have turned into an employee
anyone can bully.

157
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,350
I'll make amendments to that.

158
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,590
I'm not done yet.

159
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,990
(Zhao Moran will no doubt
cause trouble for me.)

160
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,450
I request a transfer

161
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,520
to become your secretary.

162
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,320
Woman,

163
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,950
don't push your luck.

164
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,450
I just want to survive here.

165
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,890
If you can let me join
the president's office,

166
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,390
I'm willing to call off the engagement.

167
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,090
(This woman is cunning.)

168
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,590
(She must resent me
for calling off the engagement.)

169
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,290
(If I can keep her around me,)

170
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,320
(I can prevent her from doing
anything that might harm the company.)

171
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,650
I'll think about it.

172
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,350
Move side.

173
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,720
I'll move aside if you say yes.

174
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,590
(This woman is so clingy)

175
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,450
(and always embarrasses me.)

176
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,250
(She may become a threat
if I don't keep an eye on her.)

177
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,050
Lily,

178
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,320
she's one of the secretaries
from now on.

179
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
Help her get settled

180
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,720
and start work as soon as possible.

181
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,050
Yes.

182
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:22,090
(Their stats are high, even though
they're only Gu Yichen's secretaries.)

183
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,250
Ms. Wei, perhaps I can help you
to get what you want.

184
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,790
If you can make me
the wife of the Gu Group's president,

185
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:35,350
I'll give you what you deserve.

186
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,450
There's an important contract signing
next week.

187
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,090
Are you interested?

188
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,950
Will that woman go?

189
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,720
She will.

190
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,090
I look forward to our cooperation.

191
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,650
Me too.

192
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,498
The wife of Gu Group's president?

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,650
Once I make you mine

194
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,490
and take over the Wei Group,
the Gu Group will disappear.

195
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,190
Shen Qingge,

196
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,190
bring yesterday's meeting minutes
to my office.

197
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,220
Okay.

198
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,290
Do people in this novel

199
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,520
have to compete for a water bottle
used by their boss?

200
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,150
Qingge,

201
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,250
you can have Mr. Gu's luck this time.

202
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,842
One more

203
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,744
cart?

204
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:55,370
Mr. Gu always won the grand prize.

205
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,245
Consider this as your welcome gift.

206
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,946
(Is the novel's world this absurd?)

207
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:04,936
Oh, right.

208
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:05,620
Qingge,

209
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,637
your job responsibilities include
signing documents and parcels,

210
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:09,490
transferring calls,

211
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,290
receiving guests,

212
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,082
and arranging and coordinating
meeting rooms.

213
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:12,750
Can you remember?

214
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,590
Yes.

215
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,590
(Ma Xiaoting has never worked a day
in her life.)

216
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,320
(A receptionist can handle all of this,)

217
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,220
(yet she arranges so many secretaries
for Gu Yichen.)

218
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,850
(Fine.)

219
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,890
(I'll do whatever it takes
to get close to Gu Yichen.)

220
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:29,420
(No one should take my job away.)

221
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,178
Hey,

222
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,173
have you played Minesweeper before?

223
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,990
(I'm so clever.)

224
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,820
I understand you have concerns
about this project.

225
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,790
Let's find a time to meet
in the next couple of days.

226
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,120
What do you think?

227
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,250
See you, Prof. Gao.
