10
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,650
(Is he going to do something to me?)

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,450
Mr. Gu,

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,220
it's illegal to confiscate
employees' phones.

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm now your first contact.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,907
Open your favorite, and call me.

15
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:10,532
You're saying this as if you'll pick up
my calls anytime.

16
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:12,370
(A Gu Yichen)

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,620
I always answer

18
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,250
work calls immediately.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,450
As my personal secretary,

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,590
you should inform me
once anything happens.

21
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,320
Besides,

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,520
you need to answer my call anytime.

23
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:29,177
From now on,

24
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:30,520
I hope you won't ignore my calls

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,920
like you did just now.

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,550
What's that smell?

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,820
Mr. Gu,

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,120
it's my perfume.

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,150
Stop using cheap perfumes.

30
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,690
I'll pick a brand for you.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,690
(The president Ma Xiaoting created
is too controlling.)

32
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,290
Yes?

33
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,850
Mr. Gu,

34
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,120
would you like some candies?

35
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,350
I never eat ordinary food.

36
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,620
I'll take this.

37
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,750
Mr. Gu,

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,490
is there anything you want?

39
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,950
Everything you're wearing today
doesn't suit you.

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,466
Your previous style was fine.

41
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,420
Also,

42
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,850
send the acquisition notice
to Wei Group by tonight

43
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,750
and copy me on it.

44
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,050
Understood?

45
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,090
Understood.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,920
My costumes

47
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,890
don't work on him at all?

48
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,290
This is serious.

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,690
How Shen Qingge is going
to handle this mess?

50
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,720
Mind your own business.

51
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,690
Stay out of the mess.

52
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,590
Shh.

53
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,090
Qingge.

54
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,320
Well.

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,120
It's all right.

56
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,994
Considering your relationship
with Mr. Gu,

57
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:29,220
he won't call you out.

58
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,550
Besides, you're holding
the Gu Group's shares.

59
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,050
I believe he won't fire you.

60
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,720
Why would he fire me?

61
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,120
He won't.

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,320
Think on the bright side.

63
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,490
Lily,

64
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,750
what has happened?

65
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,350
You don't know yet?

66
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,850
What should I know?

67
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,550
Let me ask you.

68
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,020
Did you send an email
to Wei Group yesterday?

69
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,190
I did.

70
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,650
What we're working on
is the Wei Group acquisition plan,

71
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,090
but the email you sent said

72
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,720
it suspends the acquisition.

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,020
What?

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,550
I just used the template

75
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,450
and forgot to edit it.

76
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,490
Not only that,

77
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,920
you also copied all employees
of Wei and Gu Groups.

78
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,420
Oh no!

79
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,920
I'm so dead!

80
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,920
Someone's calling me.

81
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,820
Mr. System,

82
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,220
where are you?

83
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,490
Mr. System.

84
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm so dead.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,290
Gu Yichen must be furious.

86
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,350
My poor luck stat.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,950
This is a misunderstanding.

88
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,990
I'll give you a reasonable explanation.

89
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,690
Mr. Gu.

90
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,490
Coffee?

91
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,650
Oh.

92
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,590
Yes?

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
She went downstairs.

94
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,420
Perhaps she's off to buy coffee.

95
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,890
Act smart.

96
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,490
All right.

97
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,450
I'm hanging up.

98
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,250
I'm done for.

99
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,250
I've made a serious mistake.

100
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,350
Gu Yichen won't let it slide.

101
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,150
Even if he does, Wei Yunjiao
will come after me.

102
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,520
Have you searched everywhere?

103
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,620
No news yet?

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,150
All right, got it.

105
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,920
Keep looking.

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,550
Did you get her?

107
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,650
No.

108
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
Miss,

109
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
we got her.

110
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,490
The place you arranged is safe.

111
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,550
Make sure you teach her
a lesson properly.

112
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:37,680
(A Gu Yichen)

113
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,520
(I believe Gu Yichen)

114
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,220
(might pick up)

115
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,815
(and call the police.)

116
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,790
Don't worry.

117
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,090
No one has seen us.

118
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,550
Young girl,

119
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,150
are you afraid of being here alone?

120
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,020
Want some company?

121
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,550
Misters,

122
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,690
did you get the wrong person?

123
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,720
No.

124
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,020
We want you, Shen Qingge.

125
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,850
Why are you abducting me?

126
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,550
Track this number right now.

127
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,420
The faster, the better.

128
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,320
Shen Qingge always makes me worry.

129
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,220
Shen Qingge messes up the collaboration
between Wei and Gu Groups.

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,950
That equals messing up my engagement
with Gu Yichen.

131
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,150
I must deal with her properly today.

132
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,650
Make sure there are no loose ends.

133
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,250
If Gu Yichen finds out,

134
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,020
you and Gu Yichen will be through.

135
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,150
Don't worry.

136
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,350
I hid her in the Shen family's
abandoned factory.

137
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,820
Chen will never find her there.

138
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,590
Very well.

139
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,650
I need to be somewhere else.

140
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,390
Please excuse me, Ms. Wei.

141
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,490
Feel free to order me
if you need any time.

142
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,929
Okay?

143
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Let's go.

144
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,250
(Wei Yunjiao is so simple-minded.)

145
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,823
(If anything were to happen
to Shen Qingge)

146
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,120
(and she couldn't marry Gu Yichen,)

147
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,690
(Wei Yunjiao will marry him instead.)

148
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,250
(If I lose Wei Yunjiao,)

149
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,620
(all the silly things I've done with her
will be for nothing.)

150
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,393
You have a pretty face.

151
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,850
Wouldn't it be a shame
if it got scarred?

152
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Don't come any closer.

153
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,420
My fiance won't let you get away.

154
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,150
Ha ha ha!

155
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,150
Do you think he'll still want you
when your face is disfigured?

156
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,750
(If they're going to hurt me,)

157
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,320
(with my luck stat,)

158
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,750
(respawning is the best method.)

159
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,050
(But would it be easier
to die from falling)

160
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,220
(or from being stabbed?)

161
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,590
Shen Qingge,

162
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,520
why aren't you in the office?

163
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,620
What are you doing here?

164
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,220
They brought me here.

165
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,050
Wow.

166
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,650
Is this what that's called
the 9999-plus premium luck?

167
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,720
No one said someone came
to save this woman.

168
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,550
Should we retreat?

169
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,720
I haven't received any orders.

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,350
Go.

171
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,490
I didn't expect this.

172
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,390
Gu Yichen.

173
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:42,890
Who sent you?

174
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,090
If Gu Yichen dies,

175
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,520
I will...

176
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,420
Mr. Gu,

177
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,290
you're injured.

178
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,020
I'm good.

179
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,220
Why are you here?

180
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,720
I heard it from those in the office.

181
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,550
I was worried about you, so I came here.

182
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Don't let them get away.

183
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,920
All right.

184
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,820
Qingge,

185
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,920
take care of Mr. Gu.

186
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,820
I'll go after them.

187
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,990
Wei Yunjiao,

188
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,350
look at what you've done.

189
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,420
