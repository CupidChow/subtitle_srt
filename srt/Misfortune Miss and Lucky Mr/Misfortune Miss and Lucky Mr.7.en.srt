=Episode 7=

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,370
Why did you come here alone?

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,961
You're smart.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,994
Why did you risk yourself?

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,070
If you died,

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,900
what would I do?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,770
(She's worried about me.)

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,740
I went through so much
to get close to you.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,170
Things are finally happening for me.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,100
But you're dying now.

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,870
It must be my bad luck

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,070
that drags you down.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,240
(She's cute when she cries.)

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,540
It's my fault for sending
the wrong email last night.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,570
But if you die,

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,940
I don't know how I should make it up.

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,240
Gu Yichen, please stay alive.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,100
I'll do anything you say.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,470
Mr. Gu,

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,870
do you have any last words?

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,800
I'll pass on the message

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,040
for you.

31
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,170
What?

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,870
You're fine.

33
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,040
Why were you lying there?

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,500
After intense activity,

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,070
I need to rest for a while.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,940
Jeez.

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,500
I was worried sick.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,355
I remember someone saying

39
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,470
that if I stay alive,

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,070
she'll do anything I say.

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,340
Don't even think about it.

42
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,670
As I requested before,

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,840
when I ask, you come.

44
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,240
Don't leave my side.

45
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,700
Mr. Gu,

46
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,300
it's my fault for sending
the wrong email last night,

47
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,340
but I really didn't mean it.

48
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:43,837
If I...

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,740
The email wasn't sent wrong, though.

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,900
What?

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,740
A few companies that used to work
with Wei Group

52
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,570
turned to us after knowing

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
we had dropped the acquisition.

54
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,840
We can use this chance
to lower the acquisition price.

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,870
That way, we're one step closer
to going public.

56
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,400
What do you know about that?

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,900
I read the novel.

58
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,100
What?

59
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,137
What I'm saying is

60
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm the heiress of Shen Group,
after all.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
I'm a top business management graduate
from overseas.

62
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,070
Honestly, I used to have such ambitions.

63
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,640
Sadly, the Shen Group
wasn't capable enough.

64
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,540
So,

65
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,070
I know exactly

66
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,170
the reason behind every step you take.

67
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,500
(I didn't know)

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,870
(she knew me so well.)

69
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,700
Why are you so happy?

70
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,440
The company is going public.

71
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Of course, I'm happy.

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,400
Do you know how important
today's banquet is?

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,040
Huh?

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,040
Why is this ugly plate here?

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,770
Replace it.

76
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,570
Yes.

77
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,640
Abalone.

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,570
Lobster.

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,900
How heavy is the lobster?

80
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,370
1.5 kg.

81
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,740
Anything less than 2.5 kg
is unacceptable, you know?

82
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,470
This wine...

83
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,870
After Gu and Wei Groups collaborated,

84
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,900
Mr. Gu probably will...

85
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,670
I know.

86
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,840
He'll call off the engagement with me

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,340
and get engaged to Wei Yunjiao.

88
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:12,570
Well.

89
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,340
Don't be sad.

90
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:15,570
Look at how arrogant she is.

91
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,970
Mr. Gu won't like her.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,886
You don't know

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,744
how anxious Mr. Gu was

94
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,940
when you went missing yesterday.

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,302
Really?

96
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,655
Yes.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,142
Honestly, I think you and Mr. Gu
are more compatible.

98
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,840
Ah.

99
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,800
How am I supposed

100
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,908
to gain luck stat from Gu Yichen
in the future?

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,204
Mr. System,

102
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,668
can you tell me

103
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,169
what I should do?

104
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,500
No way.

105
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,540
Lights in a five-star are
actually voice-activated.

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,446
Occupied.

107
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,972
I just want to be alone.

108
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,543
Why are you here?

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,040
This is the ladies' room.

110
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,140
So you did hear me

111
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,540
every time I called you?

112
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:29,600
He he.

113
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,370
Not every time.

114
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,840
What's it?

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,970
How can I help you?

116
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,140
I don't want Gu Yichen and Wei Yunjiao
to get engaged.

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,570
Be kind.

118
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,140
How is that not kind?

119
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,370
This is nothing but a world
made up by Ma Xiaoting.

120
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,540
And you're living in this made-up world.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,191
So, how do I go back?

122
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,193
It's not the time for you
to know that yet.

123
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,070
What should I do from now on?

124
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,270
According to the original plot,

125
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,770
Gu Yichen and Wei Yunjiao
will get married.

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,340
Don't tell me...

127
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,300
What?

128
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,470
You've fallen for Gu Yichen?

129
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,150
How could that be?

130
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,940
He's obnoxious,

131
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,970
disloyal, controlling, and egocentric.

132
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,306
How could I possibly like him?

133
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,040
Qingge,

134
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,940
it's fine to gain luck stat from him,

135
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,640
but don't fall for Gu Yichen.

136
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,970
Otherwise, you'll end up like me.

137
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,900
Oh?

138
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,570
Nice shoes.

139
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,240
Mr. System,

140
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,840
what's your story?

141
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,240
No.

142
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,840
The price for the little mermaid
to fall in love with the prince

143
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,270
is that she ends up becoming bubbles.

144
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,940
In the novel's world,

145
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,970
anyone who falls in love

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,070
always winds up badly.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,970
Qingge,

148
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,300
where did you go?

149
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,170
Come and help
keep an eye on the desserts.

150
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,640
All right, Lily.

151
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,970
Why are you here so long today?

152
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,108
You always leave in such a rush

153
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:30,370
without even finishing talking.

154
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,700
If you aren't guilty about something,

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,140
you won't try to chase me away.

156
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,481
By the way,

157
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,440
given your current pace
of collecting luck stat,

158
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,970
you won't need
the life-saving bag anymore.

159
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,000
Really?

160
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,240
That's great.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Wow.

162
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,370
(This is amazing.)

163
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,570
(It's so great to be a taste tester
for a banquet.)

164
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,540
(Forget those annoying things.)

165
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
(Let me enjoy this first.)

166
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,770
Qingge, you came here uninvited.

167
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,070
I'm an employee of the Gu Group,

168
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,700
so I'm invited as well.

169
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,500
Is it?

170
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,500
An employee of the Gu Group?

171
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,140
You adapt well, Qingge.

172
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,840
Seems like you're not affected

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,770
by the low-price acquisition
of the Shen family.

174
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,570
Wei Yunjiao,

175
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,900
if you're here
to blame me for the email,

176
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,900
I'll apologize.

177
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm not as shameless as you.

178
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,540
Speaking of which,

179
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,640
there's one thing
I need to thank you for.

180
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,970
After today,

181
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,470
I'll become Chen's fiancee.

182
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Take a guess.

183
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,600
After I join the Gu Group,

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,740
what's the first thing I'll do?

185
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,570
I'm

186
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,400
not

187
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,100
interested.

188
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
You!

189
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,870
Chen,

190
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,339
she pushed me!

191
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,270
Mr. Gu Yichen,

192
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,700
someone has reported tax issues
in your company.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,970
Please come with us
for an investigation.

194
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,900
Please.

195
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,240
Chen.

196
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,940
(If I had known this would happen,)

197
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,340
(I would've asked the inspectors
to wait for just two more minutes.)

198
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,740
(That way, when Gu Yichen
chose Shen Qingge,)

199
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,440
(I could've taken this opportunity
to help Wei Yunjiao.)

200
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,900
(I could've killed two birds
with one stone.)

201
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,640
(What a bummer.)

202
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,670
It's all right.

203
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,370
Please enjoy the banquet.

204
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,100
Carry on.

205
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,170
(No one cares about me.)

206
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,621
(I want to go to the hospital too.)
