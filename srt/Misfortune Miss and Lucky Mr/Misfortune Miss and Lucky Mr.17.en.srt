10

No.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,550
Don't destroy the novel.

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,000
You knew that I'd used up

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,580
all of Gu Yichen's luck stat, did you?

14
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,750
I warned you.

15
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:02,380
You kept taking the wrong steps.

16
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,210
What should I do now?

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,510
I just want to give him back
his luck stat.

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,380
You disappear,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,750
and this world will return
to its right track.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,050
What do you mean by that?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,750
Gu Yichen and Wei Yunjiao
are getting married?

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,810
This is impossible.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,950
Haven't you realized
how serious things have gotten?

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,710
I just want to return him his luck stat.

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,350
If I can take his,

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,550
he could take mine as well.

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,480
I don't mind.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,550
I'm willing to be unlucky.

29
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,850
As long as I can be with Gu Yichen,

30
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,580
I'm fine no matter how unlucky I get.

31
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,910
Do you think you're Ma Xiaoting

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,750
and that you have the privilege
to change the system?

33
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,380
Wake up.

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,810
Stop being stubborn.

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,610
Your luck stat is already
close to 10,000.

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,500
Once the next seven-planetary
alignment happens,

37
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,580
you can return to the real world.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,850
But

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,650
I've promised Gu Yichen I'd stay.

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,750
Is there really no other way?

41
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,380
You see,

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,310
I'm an exception in this world.

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,850
My luck stat wasn't even ten
when I first arrived here,

44
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,250
but I'm doing fine now.

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,110
Is there a possibility

46
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,980
that I can change the world,

47
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:03,810
that the novel won't collapse,

48
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,710
and that no one will get hurt?

49
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,350
I told you before.

50
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,500
If the little mermaid falls in love
with the prince,

51
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,550
she'll turn into bubbles in the end.

52
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,610
The prince ends up with the princess.

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,410
He'll never remember

54
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,950
that a little mermaid
goes through so much

55
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,510
just to be on land.

56
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,650
Can't the prince

57
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,650
be with the little mermaid?

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
Because

59
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,210
I was that bubbles once.

60
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,210
I was that little mermaid.

61
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,950
Like you,

62
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,350
I accidentally came
into a novel's world.

63
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,610
There,

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,510
I met a girl.

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,380
She was gentle and elegant.

66
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,180
She was the main character in the novel.

67
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,410
I thought

68
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,680
my princess would be her.

69
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,900
In fact, I wasn't even
a supporting character.

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,800
I was just a throwaway character
in that novel

71
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,810
who died three minutes
after my appearance.

72
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,950
What happened then?

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,580
Just like you,

74
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:15,600
I thought I could change the world

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,410
because I came from the real world,

76
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:22,510
but no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't compare to the hero.

77
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:26,180
In the end, I was trapped here

78
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,250
and became Mr. System.

79
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,650
Qingge,

80
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,950
I know the truth is hard to accept,

81
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
but believe me,

82
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,410
the best way to maintain this world is

83
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,750
that you follow the original storyline.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,850
Otherwise, when Gu Yichen's
luck stat hits zero,

85
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,710
he'll die in this novel.

86
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,228
You won't even be able

87
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,180
to see him alive

88
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,350
and be with Wei Yunjiao.

89
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:19,250
Was my proposal too reckless?

90
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,380
Qingge,

91
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,010
I'm serious.

92
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,350
Of course, it was too reckless.

93
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,450
One should build their career
before starting a family.

94
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,750
Now that the Gu Group is in a mess,

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,110
I'm not marrying you
and living an uncomfortable life.

96
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,380
I want to live in that big house.

97
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,410
This place is too rundown.

98
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,380
Grandma agreed to the bet.

99
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,110
We can move back anytime.

100
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:47,150
Taking Gu Group public

101
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,450
is my ultimate goal.

102
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,380
Whether or not
I'm a fictional character,

103
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,910
this is something I want to do.

104
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:55,950
Let's work together

105
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:57,650
to make your dream come true.

106
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,080
Then,

107
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,410
make me the happiest bride.

108
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:13,580
(Once the Gu Group goes public,)

109
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,250
(I'll return to my world)

110
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,010
(like what Mr. System said.)

111
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,680
Mr. Gu.

112
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,610
What's this?

113
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:43,350
A secret manual.

114
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,150
It helps us solve our current problem.

115
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,550
You want the company
to go public soon, right?

116
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,750
These are small public companies
we can acquire.

117
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,980
Acquire small public companies?

118
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,380
Ma Xiaoting doesn't
do any research at all.

119
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,450
Do you know her?

120
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,980
I don't,

121
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,580
and I don't want to.

122
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:05,910
Why not?

123
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,750
She's a terrible author.

124
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,450
She put me through so much.

125
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,310
I think the story is pretty good.

126
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,580
But why should we
acquire public companies?

127
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,550
We can gain control of their shares
through an acquisition

128
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:26,910
and then restructure the assets.

129
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,380
This way, our company
can go public quickly.

130
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,550
This is indeed a quicker way.

131
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:31,980
Right.

132
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,950
Mr. Gu, if you're on board with this,

133
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,950
I'll prepare proposals
for negotiating with these companies.

134
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,980
(I have to keep my distance
from Gu Yichen from now on.)

135
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:50,850
Why have you been avoiding me lately?

136
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,530
What's your dream about?

137
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,880
(Oh no.)

138
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:02,750
(Luck stat.)

139
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,780
Mr. Gu,

140
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:07,980
I've printed out the documents
for tomorrow.

141
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,180
I'll go get it.

142
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,780
Why have you been avoiding me lately?

143
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,550
I didn't.

144
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,310
You did.

145
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,580
Don't avoid me anymore.

146
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,010
Sit beside me during the meetings.

147
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,580
Hold my hand when we go out.

148
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,710
Did you hear me?

149
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:34,650
Can I go fetch the document now?

150
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,580
(If his luck keeps dropping,)

151
00:08:57,075 --> 00:08:58,650
(he'll start to get injured.)

152
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,580
Hey.

153
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,850
Let's order coffee.

154
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,810
(I'd like to see
how you sign the contract)

155
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,180
(with an incomplete document.)

156
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,350
Why are some pages missing?

157
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,110
We've prepared backups.

158
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,210
Could something have happened
to Gu Yichen?

159
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,180
Can we swap rooms?

160
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,410
What happened?

161
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,580
I fell off the bed just now.

162
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:27,480
Your bed is lower.

163
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,380
Endure it.

164
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:55,580
It'll be done soon.

165
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,610
You see,

166
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,010
you're a man.

167
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,250
Can you be braver?

168
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:05,180
I...

169
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,580
I've never been hurt before.

170
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,610
I'll be gentle.

171
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,110
Don't move.

172
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,210
I'm leaving.

173
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,280
You can sleep now.

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,400
Call me if you need anything.

175
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,550
Don't go.

176
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,980
Or

177
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,110
can you go after I fall asleep?

178
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:00,410
Is that okay?

179
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,150
Okay.

180
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,480
Gu Yichen,

181
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:56,310
you shouldn't have suffered for me.
