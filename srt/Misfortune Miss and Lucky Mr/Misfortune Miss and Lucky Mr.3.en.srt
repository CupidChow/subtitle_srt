Mr. Gu, I didn't mean it.

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,910
I'll pay for it
with next month's salary.

12
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:01,429
Where's the document?

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,910
Here.

14
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:07,928
Mr. Gu,

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,250
are you thirsty?

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,557
No.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,253
Well.

18
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:12,050
Are you tired?

19
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,220
Do you need coffee?

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,690
No.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,050
How about hungry?

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,220
Want some breakfast?

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:18,890
No.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,976
Mr. Gu,

25
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:20,750
- are you...
- No.

26
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,389
(Where is his luck stat?)

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,350
(On his palm?)

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,853
Mr. Gu,

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,237
do you have any aches or pains?

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,018
Do you need a massage?

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,848
Ouch!

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,150
Mr. Gu,

33
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,590
it's my heart that's hurt.

34
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:50,090
(What's going on?)

35
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,090
(There's no luck stat on his palm.)

36
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,050
Woman.

37
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:58,150
(My luck stat rises again.)

38
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:00,120
(What's wrong)

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,520
(with this woman?)

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,290
(She's cute.)

41
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,390
What look is that?

42
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,390
What look?

43
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,790
Like this.

44
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,050
You're baring teeth,

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,890
not smiling.

46
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:17,320
Why should I smile?

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,750
People smile when they feel good.

48
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,821
When you get something
you've always dreamed of,

49
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,090
you just can't help but smile.

50
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,125
I never need to dream to get
what I want.

51
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,390
So, being too lucky isn't
something to be happy with either.

52
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,453
I suddenly feel bad for you.

53
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,264
No one has ever dared
to talk to me like that.

54
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,650
You're challenging me again.

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,450
(Is he mad again?)

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,650
(I better slip off now.)

57
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,650
The jam faces upward, please.

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,850
Seems like my luck stat
is far from enough.

59
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:06,780
(Mary Sue plot)

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,113
(Physical contact)

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,104
(Searching for allies in this world)

62
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,650
(How to travel back to the real world?)

63
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,620
I've been trying all day,
but it hasn't even reached 100 yet.

64
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,050
My progress is too slow.

65
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,706
Mr. System,

66
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,150
are you there?

67
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,520
Mr. System.

68
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,384
Mr. System.

69
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,320
What should I do to bring you out?

70
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,150
Do I really have to gain luck stat
by myself?

71
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,536
It smells nice.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,650
What cologne does he use?

73
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,450
I don't use cologne.

74
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,890
Impressive.

75
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,990
Not really.

76
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,490
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,450
I'm wiping the table.

78
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:45,190
I'll pay for it with my salary
after next month.

79
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,750
Hold on.

80
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,350
If I'm not wrong,

81
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,850
you came here

82
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,650
to prove that

83
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,350
you wouldn't do anything
to harm the Gu Family.

84
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,381
But your actions so far
don't seem to align with your words.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,520
Lily asked me to bring that box to her.

86
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,020
Look.

87
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,990
I can't reach it.

88
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,350
I'm doing my job.

89
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,150
But I really can't reach it.

90
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,954
(Gu Yichen approaches me.)

91
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:26,552
(My luck stat...)

92
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,082
He smells nice.

93
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,306
The box.

94
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:38,420
(Why did that darned Ma Xiaoting have to
make him such a charming jerk?)

95
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,790
(What a shame.)

96
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:42,050
(What a shame.)

97
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,220
Yes!

98
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,050
Mr. System.

99
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,620
Is that bag useful?

100
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,750
Yes.

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,820
Very useful.

102
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,690
Do you have other information?

103
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,990
Tell me more.

104
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,820
Who else can give me more luck stat
besides Gu Yichen?

105
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,205
Obtaining luck stat from Gu Yichen

106
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,220
is a special perk from the author.

107
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,890
What more do you want?

108
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,150
So I can only stick to one person?

109
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,701
Is Gu Yichen not good enough?

110
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,150
It's not that.

111
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,749
But how can I gain more luck stat?

112
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,138
And how many luck stat do I need
to go back?

113
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,058
Also, my luck stat...

114
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:27,730
Your luck stat is still far from enough.

115
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,037
Stop asking so many questions.

116
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,106
The priority now is
to stick to Gu Yichen

117
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,440
and survive here.

118
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:35,790
Not this again.

119
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,250
The rain stops.

120
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,317
Just how high his luck stat is?

121
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,864
(How unlucky.)

122
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,690
To avoid being late,

123
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,950
may I use Mr. Gu's elevator?

124
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,620
Well, I'll use the staircase.

125
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:45,412
Mr. Shen,

126
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,490
please behave.

127
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,150
(For my luck stat,)

128
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,750
(there's no need to feel ashamed.)

129
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,220
Mr. Gu.

130
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,588
Chen,

131
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,150
I have something to talk to you.

132
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,690
I didn't know
you liked your fiance so much.

133
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,420
You're a bad guy.

134
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,020
I'm not talking to you.

135
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,820
Qingge,

136
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,901
for tomorrow's signing ceremony,

137
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:20,650
the client

138
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,350
is the company the Shen family
once worked with.

139
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,420
So

140
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,220
Chen wants you to attend it
as a shareholder.

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,520
Me?

142
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,020
With only 0.05 of the shares?

143
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,720
Yes.

144
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,350
Even the smallest shareholder
is still a shareholder.

145
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,120
Qingge, are you not happy
because it's too little?

146
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,190
Forget it.

147
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,290
I'm a jinx.

148
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,220
Something's bound to go wrong.

149
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,520
You must be joking, Qingge.

150
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,590
Chen has agreed to have you handle

151
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,420
the opening ceremony
before the contract signing.

152
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,920
(That's an important task.)

153
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,190
(Why would he assign me instead?)

154
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:56,920
(According to the plot,
it should be Wei Yunjiao.)

155
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,250
(She gets hurt
when the ball electrocutes her.)

156
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,790
(That's why she grows closer
to Gu Yichen.)

157
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,050
(But)

158
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,850
(if I get hurt instead,)

159
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,950
(perhaps it can bring me closer
to Gu Yichen)

160
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,690
(and boost my luck stat.)

161
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:17,750
Qingge,

162
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,350
just say yes.

163
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,690
All right?

164
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:23,350
Fine.

while the pounding hearts
at the starting point

carry our hopes for success.

170
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:32,584
(Seems like)

171
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,029
(Ma Xiaoting has written
a lot of scripts for sports events.)

172
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:36,658
Next,

173
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,750
let's welcome the shareholder
representative of Gu Group,

174

Shen Qingge, to start
the signing ceremony.

175
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,420
Make sure everything goes as planned.
