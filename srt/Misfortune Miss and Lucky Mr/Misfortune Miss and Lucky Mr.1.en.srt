=Episode 1=

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,830
(He is)

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,176
(Gu Yichen,)

12
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:50,110
(the youngest president
in the history of the Gu Group.)

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,910
(However, every acquisition he's made
was through marriage alliances.)

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,230
(He's a complete jerk.)

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,110
(She is)

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,568
(Wei Yunjiao,)

17
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:00,882
(the daughter of the Wei Group,)

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,269
(but she's petty and mean.)

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,350
(The dialogue in the novel
is royally ostentatious.)

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,390
(Overall,)

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,890
(this is a poorly written
Mary Sue novel.)

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,750
(Production: Gu Group's President
Falls in Love with Me)

23
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:17,362
Does anyone disagree with the publication
of this novel that I recommended?

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,350
Now, raise your hand.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,590
So it's unanimous.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,456
Meeting adjourned.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,710
An astronomical spectacle,
the seven-planet alignment,

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,590
will appear later tonight.

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,190
By the time...

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,070
Ms. Shen,

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,390
we're through after this dance.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,109
You're on your own from then on.

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,026
I'll arrange a meeting

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,794
to talk about calling off
our engagement.

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,590
(Gu Yichen?)

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,790
(Why am I dreaming about this novel?)

37
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,430
Wake up, Qiu!

38
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:58,426
Miss,

39
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:00,037
I know

40
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:02,752
you can't accept the fact
that Chen is calling off the engagement.

41
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,310
But love

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,030
isn't about first-come-first-serve.

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,469
In love,

44
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,037
the one who isn't loved

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,144
is the extra.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,357
What?

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,021
I'm Qiu,

48
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,301
a novel editor at a publishing house.

49
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:20,384
I criticized

50
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,677
a novel written
by the chief editor's relative,

51
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:23,989
"Gu Group's President
Falls in Love with Me,"

52
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,442
and so I was demoted
to the reception desk.

53
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,310
Now,

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,506
it seems like I've entered
the novel's world

55
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,480
and become the unlucky
supporting character, Shen Qingge.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,218
I live in the only house
my parents left me.

57
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,984
This is the last property
Mr. and Mrs. Shen left.

58
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,560
I'd say this is a total rundown.

59
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,437
There's a string of numbers on my palm.

60
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,509
It decreases by one
every time I respawn.

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,688
Perhaps this is
my available respawn count.

62
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,050
Jeez,

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,594
what a tough luck.

64
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,184
Yeah.

65
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:00,373
Tough luck, indeed.

66
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:01,072
Who?

67
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,568
Who's there?

68
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,701
Who's there?

69
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:19,394
Calm down.

70
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,197
Put the broom down.

71
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:25,338
I'm responsible for

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,925
taking care of people like you
who accidentally entered novels.

73
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:30,760
I'm Mr. System.

74
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:33,576
I believe you've read the novel.

75
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,557
Let me guide you
on how to survive in this world.

76
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,037
No need.

77
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,117
Just tell me how I can go back.

78
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,002
Don't interrupt.

79
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,904
The numbers on your palm

80
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,136
aren't your respawn count.

81
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,070
It's luck stat.

82
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:46,666
This is a special perk from the author.

83
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,080
Every time you die due to bad luck,
you'll respawn.

84
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:52,130
However, your luck stat is too low.

85
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,717
With a few more respawns,

86
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,568
it'll zero out,

87
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,821
and you won't be able to revive again.

88
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:57,510
That means

89
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,664
I'm going back.

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,549
That means you'll never go back.

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,930
You'll end up like me,

92
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,984
wandering in this virtual space
and stuck in service.

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,496
It's even worse
than fictional characters.

94
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,992
You...

95
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:12,520
That's not your concern.

96
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,109
If you want to go back,

97
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,418
you have to raise your luck stat
as quickly as possible

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,645
and survive in this world.

99
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:20,360
What's a luck stat?

100
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,160
It's a value everyone in this world has.

101
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,037
The average is 1000.

102
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:26,293
The higher your luck stat,

103
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,210
the luckier you are.

104
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:27,950
The lower it is,

105
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,498
the unluckier you become.

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,858
Is it the number above everyone's head?

107
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:36,298
You can only see it
when you put on the glasses.

108
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,110
So

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,229
you need to protect
your glasses carefully.

110
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Ma Xiaoting must've made a mistake.

111
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,082
You should join the main plot now.

112
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,757
Play Shen Qingge

113
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:46,989
and approach Gu Yichen.

114
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,954
You can only gain luck stat from him.

115
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,386
I don't understand.

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,114
Why should I trust you?

117
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,829
Don't trust me then.

118
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,650
And don't bring this bag with you
when you go out.

119
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,736
Bad luck will follow you forever
until you die

120
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,576
and your respawn count hits zero.

121
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,114
Perhaps I'd finally have a company.

122
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,474
This bag?

123
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,205
Where's he?

124
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,490
I'm not done asking.

125
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,280
How can I gain luck stat from him?

126
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:19,621
I have to get close to Gu Yichen.

127
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,056
He may be good-looking,

128
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,026
but he's a jerk.

129
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:27,298
He's going to call off the engagement
with Shen Qingge.

130
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,109
Will it be dangerous

131
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,429
if I approach him now?

132
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,714
What are all these?

133
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,029
There's Gu Yichen's address here.

134
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,765
Approaching Gu Yichen

135
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,536
is an easy task.

136
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:03,360
(Security Desk)

137
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,221
Ma'am,

138
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,650
this is a private residence.

139
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:08,045
Do you have an appointment?

140
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:11,442
Well,

141
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:12,549
I'm here for Gu Yichen.

142
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,008
Do you have an appointment?

143
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:19,872
Come on.

144
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:21,549
Please show your ID.

145
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,330
Come on.

146
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:24,781
Please cut me some slack.

147
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:26,394
The residents here pay for my salary,

148
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:27,474
so no.

149
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,330
You're handsome, but you're not kind.

150
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,426
What a waste
of such an astonishingly handsome face.

151
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
For real?

152
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,037
For real for real.

153
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,226
Cool.

154
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:42,424
Hey.

155
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,530
What floor again?

156
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:45,682
Eighth floor.

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,470
(He sleeps so deeply.)

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,150
(Now is a good opportunity.)

159
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,450
(So when I get close to him,)

160
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,070
(I can gain luck stat.)

161
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,866
(This is a cakewalk.)

162
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,376
(Looks like physical contact
is the quickest way to gain luck stat.)

163
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,070
Yes!

164
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,430
No one can stop me
from gaining luck stat today.

165
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:54,752
Woman,

166
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,941
