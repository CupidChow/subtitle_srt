10
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,259
(Gu Yichen's grandma wants to see me.)

11
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:55,592
(This wasn't in the plot.)

12
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,781
(I've changed the plot.)

13
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,381
(Could this be the system collapse)

14
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:02,645
(Mr. System mentioned?)

15
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,551
Don't worry, Qingge.

16
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:15,781
Grandma saw the news

17
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,021
and wants to meet you.

18
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:17,896
Hmm.

19
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:32,781
(This must be the lady
who raised Gu Yichen.)

20
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,381
(Looks like she prefers Wei Yunjiao
over me.)

21
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:38,651
(Don't be afraid.)

22
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,481
(Qiu,)

23
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:41,781
(show your confidence as a traveler.)

24
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:47,181
Don't be afraid.

25
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,139
I'm here.

26
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:58,421
Qingge, the Shen family started
with the tea business.

27
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,451
Why don't you serve the tea for Grandma

28
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,381
before the meal?

29
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:10,551
Qingge,

30
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:11,651
please.

31
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:15,951
(So here's the trap.)

32
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:21,821
Thank you, Ms. Shen.

33
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:57,851
Grandma,

34
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:59,021
here's your tea.

35
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,321
Grandma,

36
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:10,281
Qingge hasn't met you before,

37
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,051
so she didn't know your preference.

38
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:13,121
Allow me

39
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,151
to serve the tea for you.

40
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:15,951
This is not how you should behave
at the dining table.

41
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,951
Did I teach you that?

42
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,151
I...

43
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:22,681
Say no more.

44
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:24,951
Jiao will do it.

45
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,451
All right.

46
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:34,481
Grandma only uses a Zisha tea cup.

47
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:37,751
Here.

48
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,351
Grandma,

49
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,121
here's your tea.

50
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:40,421
Very well.

51
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:49,521
Yichen,

52
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,051
the daughter-in-law of the Gu Group

53
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,651
must be decent

54
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,221
and presentable,

55
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:58,021
just like Jiao.

56
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,451
You can't simply marry a woman

57
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:03,851
for the sake of business.

58
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:09,021
(This old lady is trying
to intimidate me.)

59
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:12,381
(I'm not someone who backs down easily.)

60
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,000
Grandma,

61
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:17,701
I didn't know your preference,

62
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,419
but I'll take it more seriously
next time.

63
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,851
Ms. Shen,

64
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,081
there won't be a next time.

65
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:28,251
Grandma,

66
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,951
didn't you ask to meet Qingge?

67
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:32,851
I did.

68
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:35,096
But I realized

69
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:39,151
she didn't meet the requirement
of being my granddaughter-in-law.

70
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,851
Qingge and I like each other.

71
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:46,721
We're going to...

72
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,589
Grandma,

73
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,581
if I have done anything wrong earlier,

74
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,621
please enlighten me.

75
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:54,216
Mr. Shen,

76
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:58,881
you're in no place to speak here.

77
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,067
Grandma.

78
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,067
Mrs. Gu,

79
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,651
respect goes both ways.

80
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:06,224
If you have prejudices against me,

81
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,389
I'm afraid everything I do

82
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,581
will seem wrong to you.

83
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:11,651
Prejudice?

84
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,621
Ms. Shen, you have quite a sharp tongue.

85
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:20,251
The Gu family has been carefully
managed the business

86
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:24,681
with our quality service
and the trust of our clients.

87
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:28,493
It's never about those romance scandals

88
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:31,357
or unresolved debts.

89
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:33,451
Ms. Shen,

90
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,881
the Gu family doesn't welcome you.

91
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,551
Please see yourself out.

92
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,512
(There's so much resistance)

93
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:41,951
(to change the storyline.)

94
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:43,951
(Perhaps this family banquet)

95
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,081
(is just the beginning.)

96
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,621
Grandma,

97
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:57,621
those rumors have hidden reasons.

98
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,281
Please don't believe them.

99
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,421
Also, someone should stop
spreading rumors.

100
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,283
Yichen,

101
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,981
are you not listening to me now?

102
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:10,851
Grandma,

103
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,951
please excuse me and Qingge.

104
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,632
Chen.

105
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:25,408
Mr. Gu,

106
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,107
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,521
Mrs. Gu said from today now,

108
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,251
you can't use this car to go to work.

109
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,151
Mr. Gu,

110
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:45,921
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:48,651
Mrs. Gu will be using your office today.

112
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:50,681
Please go to another office.

113
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:18,551
Did Gu Yichen buy you these?

114
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,992
Wearing crystal shoes

115
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,281
doesn't make you a Cinderella.

116
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:24,421
You won't know.

117
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,951
When I first arrived here,
my luck stat wasn't even ten.

118
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:30,151
It's 2,500 now.

119
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:32,681
Are you ignoring my warning?

120
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:37,181
You must follow the original storyline.

121
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,081
Let Gu Yichen get engaged
to Wei Yunjiao.

122
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:42,208
You can go

123
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,351
and convince him yourself.

124
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,181
Shen Qingge,

125
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:47,081
are you not afraid
of the serious outcome

126
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:48,751
just for the sake
of a fictional character?

127
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:52,281
The storyline has been altered
because of you.

128
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:53,751
You need to put it right,

129
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:55,051
or the system will collapse.

130
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:56,312
Mr. System,

131
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,475
is there a possibility

132
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,261
that my appearance in this world

133
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,221
is to change the story?

134
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,019
Everyone thought this way
when they came here.

135
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,448
Isn't Mrs. Gu's attitude obvious enough?

136
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,424
You'll never receive blessings

137
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:09,829
if you change the storyline.

138
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:11,251
Wake up.

139
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:13,551
But

140
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,411
I just can't.

141
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:18,763
I'm sorry,

142
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:19,581
Mr. System.

143
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:22,291
I just want to be with Gu Yichen.

144
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:25,951
If you keep doing this,

145
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,651
there'll be more unpredictable things.

146
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,149
Shen Qingge,

147
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:33,351
are you able to handle that?

148
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:35,821
I want to give it a try.

149
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:38,251
Get out of here!

150
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:50,421
Mr. Gu,

151
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:52,451
we're just following Mrs. Gu's order.

152
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:53,981
Please don't make things
difficult for us.

153
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,451
Mrs. Gu said

154
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:57,081
this house must be vacated in an hour.

155
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:00,421
How dare you!

156
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:18,721
It's all right.

157
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,181
You can come to my place.

158
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:21,921
It may be shabby,

159
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:24,881
but at least it's a place to rest.

160
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:47,981
Come on in.

161
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,621
Your apartment

162
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,421
is unique.

163
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,281
You can just say it's rundown.

164
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:09,221
It's all right.

165
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,981
I was too unlucky back then,

166
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,481
so I didn't buy any furniture.

167
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,681
But it's enough

168
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,651
for our basic needs.

169
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:17,421
Actually, I've always been curious

170
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:18,951
about what's in this.

171
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:24,481
This is a first-aid kit I used
when I had tough times.

172
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,651
But now I have you.

173
00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:29,981
I don't need it anymore.

174
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:51,081
I can't believe Chen would rather
suffer at this kind of place

175
00:10:51,221 --> 00:10:52,781
than apologize to Grandma.

176
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,951
What's so great about Shen Qingge?

177
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:57,481
Tell me about it.

178
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,081
You're better than her.

179
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,321
Of course.

180
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,381
You have good taste.

181
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,951
(She's cute.)

182
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,125
Gu Yichen

183
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:10,351
has just temporarily lost his mind.

184
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:11,421
Think about it.

185
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,248
He's been living in a comfortable life
since childhood.

186
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:15,081
How could he possibly tolerate this?

187
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:18,851
He won't be able to last
more than a couple of days.

188
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:19,951
Hold on.

189
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,197
Chen's place is big,

190
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,989
so they sleep in different rooms.

191
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,721
But this is a shabby, tiny space.

192
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:27,281
Where are they going to sleep?

193
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,464
No way.

194
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:34,109
You have to separate them.

195
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:36,240
They can't live together.

196
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,021
Help me.

197
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,681
Help me.

198
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,681
All right.

199
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,051
Help me.

200
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,621
Okay.

201
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,521
