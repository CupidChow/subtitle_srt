=Episode 10=

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,630
You've finally appeared.

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,330
What do you want to ask?

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,370
How much luck do I need to go back?

13
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,600
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,226
Please.

15
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,736
Please tell me.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,453
Ten thousand.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,500
That means I can't go back anytime soon.

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:12,970
Shen Qingge,

19
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,800
do you remember the plot
of the scandal chapter?

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,670
Gu Yichen and the Gu Group's endorser
are having a scandal.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,130
But now the world
has gone further off course

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,470
because of you.

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,898
If so, the only way to help Gu Yichen
and the Gu Group

24
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,270
overcome this crisis

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,470
is for me to call off the engagement.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,270
That's originally your plot.

27
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,770
You shouldn't have

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,200
changed the plot.

29
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,970
I, Shen Qingge,

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,100
have already broken off
my engagement with Gu Yichen.

31
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,230
All my behaviors from now on

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,870
have nothing to do with Gu Yichen
and the Gu Group.

33
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,970
Thank you for your concern.

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,270
This world has gone further off course

35
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,200
because of you.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,770
You shouldn't have

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,330
changed the plot.

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,970
It's said that the man in the photo
is Gu Group's vice president.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,630
When did this start?

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,870
What's your relationship now?

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,130
Will you still stay in the Gu Group?

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,270
Do you still hold shares
in the Gu Group?

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,570
It's also said you're now living
in an old apartment.

44
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,189
Now that you've called off
the engagement without the breakup fee.

45
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,500
How will you improve your life?

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,900
(What should I do now?)

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,330
(I didn't expect there would be
so many questions.)

48
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,630
It's reported

49
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,530
that the debt problem of the former
Shen Group hasn't been resolved.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,570
Do you have anything to say
to the contractors?

51
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,270
The debt problem of Shen Group...

52
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,570
The debt problem of Shen Group

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,434
is also the debt of Gu Group.

54
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,500
Stop pushing yourself.

55
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,700
Ms. Shen and I haven't broken off
our engagement.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,800
On the contrary,

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,100
we're deeply in love with each other.

58
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,670
I have to cut off
my relationship with you

59
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,370
to help resolve the Gu Group's crisis.

60
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,370
We don't need you to sacrifice
your reputation for that.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,528
Ouch.

62
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,630
What?

63
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:29,270
You're hurting me.

64
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,270
What do you say about the photo?

65
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,170
Ms. Shen is a decent lady.

66
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,100
The photo

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,770
is a distorted truth

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,770
meant to damage her public image.

69
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,170
As for the facts,

70
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,270
please look at the screen.

71
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,400
What you see now

72
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,370
is a gentleman

73
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,230
offering a helping hand

74
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,186
to Ms. Shen.

75
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,670
So please don't believe
in baseless rumors.

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,700
Shen Group's debt issues

77
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,070
will be taken care of by Gu Group
one by one.

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,397
Ms. Shen is my fiancee.

79
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,200
She's the sole mistress of the Gu Group.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,570
As for those with motives,

81
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,930
I don't care what chaos you're trying
to create with this photo,

82
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,930
targeting Ms. Shen means targeting me.

83
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,300
Even if I have to give up

84
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,730
everything I have,

85
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,400
I'll keep Ms. Shen safe.

86
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,870
(I didn't expect such a tacky
president trope I despised)

87
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,800
(to feel so satisfying.)

88
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,570
I know you're upset now.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,800
It's fine.

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,070
I'll lend you my shoulder.

91
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,070
I'm not upset.

92
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,900
I've already figured something out.

93
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm all ears.

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
Just wait for the show.

95
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,970
(Has she started getting smarter)

96
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,370
(under my influence?)

97
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,130
- Actually, you didn't have to do that.
- Actually, you didn't have to do that.

98
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,509
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,530
Are you hungry?

100
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:13,930
What would you like to eat?

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,888
I'll take you to a good place.

102
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,900
(Mr. Quan Beef Entrails)

103
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,100
Welcome.

104
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,930
Please have a seat.

105
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,906
Sir,

106
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,800
I'd like to have one of everything

107
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,400
from the menu.

108
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,030
Uh,

109
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,800
this place only serves one kind of food.

110
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,870
That's the been entrails.

111
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,200
Got it?

112
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,130
I need to clear the area for my meal.

113
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,800
Clear the area.

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,530
He's crazy.

115
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,100
You're very willing to eat
with everyone,

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,800
right?

117
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,293
Employees like us

118
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,200
always share things we like together.

119
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,930
Everything is on Mr. Gu tonight.

120
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,500
Please eat anything you want.

121
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,700
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

122
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,900
On you?

123
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,500
That's right.

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,562
Mr. Gu, let me help you.

125
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,901
Come.

126
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,530
Here.

127
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,240
This is yours.

128
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,570
Please enjoy.

129
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,970
Hmm.

130
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,470
Gu Yichen,

131
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
you're smiling.

132
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,070
I can't believe you're smiling.

133
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,500
I think I understand
what happiness feels like.

134
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,070
The joy of sharing?

135
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,496
It's not that.

136
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,600
I smile because I'm happy.

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,861
When you finally get something
you've dreamed about,

138
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,378
you can't help but smile.

139
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,470
Hmm.

140
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
What's the point of smiling?

141
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,470
You smile when you're happy.

142
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,470
When you finally get something
you've dreamed about,

143
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,930
you can't help but smile.

144
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,130
This beef entrails

145
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,500
is surprisingly delicious.

146
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,800
Why aren't you answering?

147
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,690
(Grandma)

148
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:09,900
Hello, Grandma.

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,600
All right.

150
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,570
Grandma wants to see you.

151
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,470
Huh?

152
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,500
The target is crossing the road.

153
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,600
Why are you here?

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Did you hear what I said
on the walkie-talkie earlier?

155
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,270
Ms. Wei,

156
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,470
Shen Qingge has used this road every day
for the past two weeks.

157
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,900
Do we still need to follow her?

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,400
The enemy's weakness is often
exposed unexpectedly.

159
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,296
The next plan.

160
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,330
Burn it after reading.

161
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,100
Understood?

162
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
Understood.

163
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,370
Over.

164
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,830
