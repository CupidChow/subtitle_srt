=Episode 13=

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,400
Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,060
Let's go.

12
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,288
This way, please.

13
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,730
Chen, you've changed a lot.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,100
Why?

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,060
Do you have good news for me this time?

16
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,460
Right.

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,700
I'd like to invite you
to my engagement ceremony.

18
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,630
That's great.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,500
Looks like I'm going to lose the bet
we made before.

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,930
Right.

21
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,630
Bet?

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,760
The Gu Group plans to go public,
and we need your cooperation.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,730
Gu Yichen's engagement
will help the company go public?

24
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,700
What kind of girl is she?

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,530
Upright,

26
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,730
kind,

27
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
brave,

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,400
and she knows me.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
She knows you?

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,360
Looks like she loves you very much.

31
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,430
We're in love with each other.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,760
Where's she?

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,330
Bring Ms. Qingge here.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,530
Should we serve the dishes now?

35
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,860
All right.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,260
The subscriber you've dialed
is unreachable.

37
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,400
Please try again.

38
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,200
Seems like this isn't your true love.

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,330
There's something urgent
I need to take care of right now.

41
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,130
It's all right.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,930
We'll meet again after that.

43
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,630
I must do this.

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,900
Mr. Gu,

45
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,100
I found out something.

46
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,938
I think

47
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:14,960
you need to know the truth.

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,300
I need to find Shen Qingge now.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
Let's talk on the way.

50
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,500
(Today's very important to Gu Yichen.)

51
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,230
(I can't mess this up.)

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,106
(Let me rehearse what I'm going to say
to the gentleman.)

53
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,800
Hello, sir.

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
I'm Shen Qingge,

55
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,360
Gu Yichen's fiancee.

56
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:35,760
Since the Gu Group
acquired the Shen Group

57
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,630
and helped them overcome difficulties,

58
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,230
I've become luckier.

59
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,230
No.

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,100
I've become happier.

61
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,730
We're going the wrong way, sir.

62
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,260
Sir.

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Isn't the Huaqiao Hotel downtown?

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,530
Where is this place?

65
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:13,900
Stop the car, sir.

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,000
Drop me off here.

67
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,530
Stop, sir.

68
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,760
I want to get out here.

69
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,230
There's a signal blocker in the car.

70
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,530
You won't be able to make calls.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,400
Ms. Shen,

72
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,600
please sit tight.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,300
I won't hurt you.

74
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,560
But if the car goes out of control,

75
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,230
the consequence isn't what we want.

76
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,900
Please, sir.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,830
Today's very important to Mr. Gu.

78
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,000
I need to be there.

79
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,430
Please send me back.

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,560
What do you want?

81
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,500
I'll give you anything you ask for

82
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,230
after today.

83
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm begging you, sir.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,600
Let me go back.

85
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,760
Where is this place?

86
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,960
Where am I going?

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,630
Qingge should've left home by now.

88
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,530
Why did you bring me here?

89
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,030
Mr. Gu,

90
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,560
aren't you going to invite me in?

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,330
Qingge,

92
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,330
are you home?

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,160
Sir,

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,230
please open the door.

95
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,930
Hey.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,760
Sir,

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,430
please open the door.

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Sir.

99
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,100
Hey.

100
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,234
The president of Gu Group

101
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,830
is actually living here.

102
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,760
I feel bad for you.

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,330
What are you trying to get at?

104
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,830
What are you doing?

105
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,030
Do you know what's inside this, Mr. Gu?

106
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,100
According to Ms. Shen's custom,

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,200
men shouldn't open women's wardrobes.

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,900
What are you trying to do?

109
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,230
Ms. Shen has been using you.

110
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:38,520
(Luck stat to go home: 10,000,
Hold hands +30, Hug+50, Travel, Mrs. Gu)

111
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,030
Hey.

112
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,642
That ruddy novel has been
torturing me for the past week.

113
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:49,100
I was transferred to the front desk
because of it.

114
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,330
Can you stop talking like Gu Yichen?

115
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,330
So,

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,500
we can pretend to be close

117
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,930
to cover your ambition
to acquire the Wei Group.

118
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,030
How did you know my plan?

119
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,060
How did you know that the company
was going public?

120
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,430
I read the novel.

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,760
I've noticed

122
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,700
that when I get close to you,

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
everything goes smoother for you.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,900
This is my first aid kit
during my tough time.

125
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,030
Now that I have you,

126
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,900
I don't need it anymore.

127
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,230
Have you ever made a bet?

128
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,400
About marriage and investment?

129
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,560
(Turns out)

130
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,500
(she gets close to me)

131
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,830
(not because she loves me.)

132
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,960
Hey.

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
I beg of you, sir.

134
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,741
Sir.

135
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,834
Sir.

136
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:47,360
All right.

137
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,730
(Gu Yichen,)

138
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,930
(wait for me.)

139
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,500
(I'm coming for you.)

140
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,648
Gu Yichen,

141
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,530
I thought I'd never see you again.

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,500
You have no idea

143
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
where the driver tried to take me.

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,100
