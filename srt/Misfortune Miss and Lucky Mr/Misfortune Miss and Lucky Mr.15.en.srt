Young man,

46
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,410
what's your name?

47
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,650
We'll surely repay you.

48
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,136
I just happened to save him.

49
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:49,010
Without him,

50
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,010
I wouldn't know
how to carry on with my life.

51
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,310
(Even if Shen Qingge says
this is a fictional world,)

52
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,650
(the love of this mother
for her child is real.)

53
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,750
(Could this be fake?)

54
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,410

It's going to rain. Let's go home.

57
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,880
Let's go.

58
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,234

- Let's go home.

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,544
So this is the life of ordinary people.

Chen,

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,848
I brought you an umbrella.

62
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:43,965
Big brother,

63
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:45,749
thank you for saving me in the water.

64
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,110
The rain stops.

65
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,018
Boy,

66
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
where did you get this umbrella?

67
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,912
A big sister over there
asked me to give you this.

68
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,110
Thank you.

69
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,910

76
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,510
Mr. Gu, do you want to
clear the area today?

77
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:08,450
Two bowls, please.

78
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,350
Sir, one bowl, please.

79
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,950
One bowl?

80
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,720
Okay.

81
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,410
All right.

82
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,350
I saw on the news this morning
that someone drowned.

83
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,250
I found your handband at the scene.

84
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,150
I thought I'd never see you again.

85
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,536
Ms. Shen, there's no need

86
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,310

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,810
Can you please listen to me?

88
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,210
Why?

89
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,780
Have you found a new reason

90
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,380
after a day?

91
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,750

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,510

94
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:53,680
Do not quarrel.

95
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,446
Lucky stat is the basis

96
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,223
