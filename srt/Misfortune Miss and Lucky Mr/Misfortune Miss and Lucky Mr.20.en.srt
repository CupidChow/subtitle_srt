10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,970
Many astronomy enthusiasts
in the city gathered

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,240
to witness a once-in-a-lifetime
astronomical event,

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,520
the seven-planetary alignment.

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,000
Here are some images

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,840
of the event captured by our reporter.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,600
Could it be that I've traveled back?

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,640
Or...

17
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,600
Was it a dream?

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,670
Is everything in the dream fake?

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,840
Yes.

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,370
It must be.

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,400
But Gu Yichen is so handsome.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,240
Oh no!

23
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:33,860
(8:30 AM Alarm)

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,170
I'm going to be late!

25
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,800
Your glasses broke,

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,440
so I got you a new pair.

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,700
So this isn't a dream.

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
It's real.

29
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,570
Mr. Ma,

30
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,570
I need to see Ma Xiaoting now.

31
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,070
Qiu,

32
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,500
it's not that I don't appreciate
your talent.

33
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,300
But young people

34
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,900
need more training.

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,700
The front desk

36
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:14,240
is actually a better fit for you.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,400
Mr. Ma,

38
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,040
as the chief editor,

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,940
you should know

40
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,440
this novel is so bad that it won't sell
even with great promotion.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
The publisher would lose money.

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,170
You shouldn't say that.

43
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,970
Let me tell you.

44
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,240
I have a way to make this novel better

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,170
and make it a success in every way.

46
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,070
What do you say?

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,370
Young girl,

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
don't get

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,400
too full of yourself.

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,770
If I fail,

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,500
I'll hand in my notice

52
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:48,170
and take all the blame.

53
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,740
You won't lose anything.

54
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,870
Anyway, the novel can't be any worse
than it already is,

55
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,770
right?

56
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,240
What do you mean?

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,100
Is my novel that bad?

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,082
You're Ma Xiaoting?

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,300
Yes, it's me.

60
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,354
Ha ha ha.

61
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,100
What's this?

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Qiu.

63
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,700
Qiu,

64
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,300
well, we're working in the same company.

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,240
Let's talk nicely.

66
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,240
You see,

67
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,700
if you have anything...

68
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,440
Mr. Ma,

69
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,000
you use the company's resources

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,670
for your own benefit.

71
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,640
I don't think

72
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,500
you want others
to know about this, right?

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,040
Show me

74
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,522
your script.

75
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Qiu,

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,770
I can show it to you,

77
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,070
but

78
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,970
you must keep it a secret
before publication.

79
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,540
I will.

80
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:54,018
(Final chapter)

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,040
Why don't you come in?

82
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,070
Jiao,

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
I've made mistakes.

84
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:11,800
I hurt you.

85
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,700
I...

86
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
I don't deserve you.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,770
I'll decide on that myself.

88
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,300
Didn't I tell you

89
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,670
I'd wait for you to come back?

90
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,400
You've already been punished
for the mistake you made.

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,770
Let's start over.

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,870
Okay?

93
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:59,580
(Final chapter)

94
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,140
What do you think, Qiu?

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,640
It's not bad, right?

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,000
You know,

97
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,770
I'm a cultured person.

98
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,250
I'm nothing like the kind you thought.

99
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,040
Let me ask you this.

100
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,070
Where's Gu Yichen?

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,470
Is he awake?

102
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,970
No.

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,970
Is he dead?

104
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,370
No.

105
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,470
I removed him.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,240
You removed him?

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,570
Isn't Gu Yichen the hero?

108
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:42,070
I did some research.

109
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,840
Young people nowadays

110
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,970
don't like the cold and overbearing
president type.

111
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,570
You see, Zhao Moran

112
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,640
is cruel,

113
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,640
arrogant,

114
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,800
and rebellious.

115
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,510
Finally, he learns from his mistake
and gets back together with his girl.

116
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,550
That's more interesting.

117
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,270
It's way better
than the stoic Gu Yichen.

118
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,754
You don't know Gu Yichen at all!

119
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,770
You don't know Ma Xiaoting.

120
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,070
What about Mr. System?

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,570
How did he get back here?

122
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,000
What's that?

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,460
I didn't write anything about that.

124
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,144
It's the Mr. System.

125
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,570
Mr. System.

126
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,000
Next time, I'll...

127
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,840
Next time, I'll ask Ma Xiaoting
to add this character in.

128
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,400
Hmph!

129
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,770
