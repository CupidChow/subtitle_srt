10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,060
What a waste.

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,720
(This jerk comes and goes
as he pleases.)

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,520
(But I still need his help.)

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,120
Mr. Gu,

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,460
I've recovered now.

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,660
I'm ready for the new transfer.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,760
The doctor said you're stressed out.

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,620
It's advisable to rest for a week
before you start working.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,890
Your glasses are broken.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,560
I got you a new pair.

20
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,720
Mr. Gu,

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,890
would you like an apple?
I can peel it for you.

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,690
Ah!

23
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,693
Mr. Gu.

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,460
Mr. Gu.

25
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,090
Mr. Gu.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,490
It's not what you think.

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,620
Why did Mr. Gu suddenly pass out?

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,260
Mr. Gu has hematophobia.

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,520
What?

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,490
Does he faint often?

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,460
Mr. Gu usually doesn't see blood.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,790
Not until he met you.

33
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,890
All right.

34
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,220
I know I have terrible luck.

35
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,160
What are all these doctors doing here?

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,860
Isn't this kind of care
for terminally ill patients?

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,190
This is a privilege for Gu Group.

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,920
(The president Ma Xiaoting created)

39
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,320
(isn't a flawless fictional character.)

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,490
(He's handsome.)

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,690
Water.

42
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,520
Slowly.

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,320
Mr. Gu,

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,390
I'm sorry about that.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,620
I didn't know you had hematophobia.

46
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,390
I'll make sure my wound is bandaged
before you see any blood.

47
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,890
I also didn't know

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,860
you were living a life like that.

49
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,220
You have terrible luck.

50
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,260
Not that terrible.

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,820
I'll be all right
with the life-saving bag.

52
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,420
I've washed grapes. Would you like some?

53
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,860
I still can manage that.

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,090
It's not hard.

55
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,290
Here you go.

56
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,022
(Heart flutters)

57
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,390
Here you go.

58
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,390
Qingge,

59
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,090
you're so happy to see me.

60
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,820
I'm not now.

61
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,890
Where have you been?
I've been through a lot.

62
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,890
I have many tasks to work on.

63
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,790
My time for every novel is limited.

64
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,790
Your luck stat breaks 200, so I came.

65
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,190
Does that mean you show up
every time it breaks 100?

66
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,890
Let's get to the point.

67
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,020
You should know how to gain
luck stat from Gu Yichen, right?

68
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,890
Well,

69
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,760
according to my experience,

70
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,720
staying by his side

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,790
or touching him could gain luck stat.

72
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,560
What else?

73
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:13,890
What else?

74
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,090
Shen Qingge,

75
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:19,060
the quickest way to gain luck stat

76
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,290
is to make Gu Yichen's heart

77
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,690
flutter for you.

78
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,290
(Heart flutters)

79
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,590
What are you wearing?

80
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,602
Am I sweet?

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
Get out.

82
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,420
What?

83
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,760
Get out of the car.

84
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,690
Don't be mad.

85
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,990
I'll get out of the car.

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,190
I thought bossy bosses
like this kind of thing.

87
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,220
Book me a suit
for tomorrow night's banquet.

88
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,760
Then go change

89
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,790
your clothes.

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,560
So he doesn't like cute style.

91
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,577
Guess I need to proceed with Plan B.

92
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,690
I look forward to our cooperation.

93
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,660
Me too. See you.

94
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,490
Mr. Gu.

95
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,420
Woman,

96
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,860
what is this?

97
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,560
Mr. Gu,

98
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,260
aside from your work hours,

99
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,890
have you ever thought about
your simple life back in school?

100
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,990
What are you getting at?

101
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,560
Let me show you a rainbow.

102
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,760
I'm not interested in rainbows.

103
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Come with me.

104
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,590
Sit.

105
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,390
Where's the rainbow?

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,020
(Gosh.)

107
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,660
(He's getting mad again.)

108
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:13,190
(He's in the wrong spot.)

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm so sorry, Mr. Gu.

110
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,820
But there really is a rainbow.

111
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,060
(She's kind of cute.)

112
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Boring.

113
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,820
Also,

114
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,290
go change out of your ordinary uniform.

115
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,490
He's so hard to please.

116
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,460
It's fine.

117
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,090
I've prepared something more romantic.

118
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
I'll surely make you fall for me.

119
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,890
Shen Qingge,

120
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,820
what are you up to again?

121
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,960
Mr. Gu,

122
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,420
I have something to tell you.

123
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,360
We'll talk tomorrow.

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,090
Mr. Gu,

125
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,990
it has to be tonight.

126
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,420
Mr. Gu, please sit.

127
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,460
What's this?

128
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,731
Look, Mr. Gu.

129
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,460
(She's put in quite an effort.)

130
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,060
Boring.

131
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,490
When can I try on the suit
for tomorrow's banquet?

132
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,089
Suit?

133
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,590
(Oh no.)

134
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,455
(I was too focused on preparing this)

135
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,390
(that I forgot about the task.)

136
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,820
Well.

137
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,560
I've picked a few options at the store.

138
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,960
You can try them there.

139
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,490
I'm the president of Gu Group.

140
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,420
They always provide
door-to-door service for me.

141
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,420
I'll go get it done right now.

142
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,660
Mr. Gu, please return home first.

143
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,990
I'll send the suits to your place.

144
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,420
I've already tried all possible ways
to please Gu Yichen.

145
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,790
Why has my luck stat barely increased?

146
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,360
(A Gu Yichen)
If he doesn't like those three costumes,

147
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,020
I'm sure my mature look
will impress him.

148
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,560
Mr. System,

149
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
are you there?

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,660
I need your hints.

151
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,390
What kind of girls does Gu Yichen like?

152
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,990
Throw your phone away
if you don't answer calls.

153
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,290
It's only two of us here.
Stop playing the bossy boss.

154
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,890
