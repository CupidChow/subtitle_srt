10
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,220
(Why is it him?)

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,150
(The villain.)

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,080
You're awake?

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,750
I brought you to the hospital
from the banquet.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,480
Where is

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Gu Yichen?

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,880
Well, Mr. Gu...

17
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,850
How dare you mention Chen!

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,380
He was taken away by the inspectors!

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,354
It must be you behind this, jinx!

20
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:11,980
Right?

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,020
Even if you want to separate us,

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,750
you don't have to use
such dirty tricks.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,450
Hey.

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,050
No.

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,750
Calm down.

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,750
Let's talk nicely.

27
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,350
Calm down.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,580
You're Chen's personal assistant.

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,780
You know very well
if he's clean or not.

30
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,650
Even if Chen likes me,

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,020
he's been kind to you, right?

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,750
Why was Gu Yichen taken away?

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,380
Also, who tells you that he likes you?

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,280
Are you saying that he likes you?

35
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,250
With your face

36
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,350
and your character.
Are you really any better than me?

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,980
Why would Chen like you?

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,250
Stop dreaming.

39
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,180
Yes, you're right.

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,420
You're the best.

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,650
You're perfect.

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,680
Tell us, Zhao Moran.

43
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,850
Yes.

44
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,280
You have the nicest character.

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,380
There's no need to argue with her.

46
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,120
Right?

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,780
You see,

48
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,620
her head is hurt.

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,980
Don't waste your time on her.

50
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,480
I don't know that Gu Yichen
had financial issues.

51
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,080
There must be some misunderstands here.

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,750
Shen Qingge,

53
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,780
stop pretending to be nice.

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,780
Don't stop me.

55
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,480
Ms. Shen,

56
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,120
take a rest.

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,650
I'll take Ms. Wei outside
and calm her down.

58
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:22,800
Shen Qingge! You!

59
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,626
Enough.

60
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,350
Why was Gu Yichen taken away?

61
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,350
(Ms. Shen may be foolish,)

62
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,350
(but her taste and standards
are to my liking.)

63
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,080
(I guess it's not so hard
to please her.)

64
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,450
Zhao Moran,

65
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,620
why did you stop me?

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,750
You even saved her at the banquet.

67
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,880
Are you actually on her side?

68
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,020
She passed out

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,880
at the banquet.

70
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,950
If we hadn't saved her,

71
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,980
Mr. Gu would've thought we were
bullying her when he returned.

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,980
It'd affect his impression

73
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,680
of you.

74
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Besides,

75
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,750
this is a hospital under the Gu family.

76
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,520
Do you think Mr. Gu wouldn't know

77
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,880
what you do to Shen Qingge?

78
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,220
Do you know why

79
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,220
Mr. Gu doesn't care about you?

80
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,228
Why?

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,950
Because he was born with privileges

82
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,150
and luck.

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,080
His life has been smooth sailing.

84
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,250
He hasn't faced any setbacks.

85
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,080
That's why it's hard for him
to rely on people around him.

86
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,750
But Chen is amazing.

87
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,650
Why would he rely on me?

88
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,550
If we create some problems for him

89
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,180
and you show up to stand by him
when he needs help,

90
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,750
what do you think he would think?

91
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,650
Naturally, I'll become the wife
of the Gu Group's president.

92
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,620
Once this is done,

93
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,280
I'll give you what you want.

94
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,550
(You are what I want.)

95
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,780
Mr. Gu,

96
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,150
Ms. Wei's ward is to the right.

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,680
(Wei Yunjiao was injured at my banquet.)

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,850
(Out of courtesy,)

99
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,220
(I should visit her.)

100
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,020
Mr. Gu,

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,050
Shen Qingge's ward is to the left.

102
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,380
(I should check on Shen Qingge first.)

103
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,120
(Wei Yunjiao has done so much,)

104
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:19,942
(even humbled herself,)

105
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:20,820
(for the acquisition.)

106
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,780
(I owe her a lot.)

107
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,080
(But Shen Qingge's injury
is much more severe.)

108
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,950
Chen,

109
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,680
you must be here for me.

110
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,550
Let's go.

111
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,280
Chen, you've lost weight.

112
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,580
It must've been a tough time for you.

113
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,180
How's your injury, Ms. Wei?

114
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,480
Why are you talking to me
like a stranger, Chen?

115
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,420
You're not calling me Jiao.

116
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,580
Tell me if you need anything.

117
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,150
I'll get it for you

118
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,931
as long as I'm capable of that.

119
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,842
Chen,

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
I don't want anything.

121
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,150
I just want you, Chen.

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,080
You should rest well.

123
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,950
I'll visit you when I have time.

124
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,450
Chen,

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,050
what have I done wrong?

126
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,620
You weren't like that.

127
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,680
You always say yes
to anything I ask for.

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,220
Didn't I tell you?

129
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,320
Tell me

130
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,080
if you need anything.

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,280
Are you angry with me
because of Shen Qingge?

132
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,080
No.

133
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
If so,

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,350
when will you call off the engagement
with her?

135
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,550
I've thought about it.

136
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,950
It's not right to use marriage

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,750
as my business tool.

138
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,420
I can't go down the path anymore.

139
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,550
Ms. Wei,

140
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,120
this isn't fair to you either.

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,080
Chen,

142
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,380
I don't want to hear that.

143
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,780
I'll pretend you didn't say that today.

144
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,650
When we meet next time,
you'll still be my Chen.

145
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,950
I don't feel like eating.

146
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Take it away.

147
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,180
Why not?

148
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,020
Because Gu Yichen is still...

149
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,220
You're back.

150
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,380
(She truly cares about me.)

151
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,620
Did they do anything to you?

152
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,620
Did you sleep well

153
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,480
or eat well?

154
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,350
Have you lost weight?

155
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,180
Why were you taken away?

156
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,280
Is there something wrong
with the company?

157
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,850
Which question should I answer first?

158
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,220
Anyway,

159
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,250
you're back.

160
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,580
That's all that matters.

161
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,780
If I can't see you again,

162
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,550
I'll start having bad luck.

163
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,950
How's your injury?

164
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,850
I'll be fine

165
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,050
as long as I see you.

166
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,750
I'm all right now.

167
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,680
I can be discharged.

168
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,450
You should rest up for now.

169
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,450
I'll give you a month's leave.

170
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I don't want to.

171
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,050
I want to work.

172
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,220
How can you work in this condition?

173
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,680
Didn't you say I should show up
whenever you call

174
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,450
and stay by your side at all times?

175
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,220
I don't need that right now.

176
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,380
No, you do.

177
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,820
I can start with something small first.

178
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,050
I don't want to leave your side
for a second.

179
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,280
(If I don't stick with you,)

180
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,550
(my luck stat will drop.)

181
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
All right?

182
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,620
(There's still someone in this world)

183
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,380
(who cares about me.)

184
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,532
Look at what you've done.

185
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,750
With such a large company

186
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,750
and so many accounts,

187
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,620
can't you find any problem with it?

188
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,120
There's none?

189
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,250
How could that be?

190
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,420
I didn't expect him
to be released so quickly.

191
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,050
Fine.

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,220
The Gu Group's account is clean, huh?

193
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,780
Then you'd handle the mess
left by the Shen Group.

194
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,620
Do me a favor.

195
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,250
Go to No. 102, Xinglong Street,

196
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,050
to find Shen Qingge.

197
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,020
This should be the place.

198
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,780
I think so.

199
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,520
Right?

200
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,980
Yes, it is.

201
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,550
She owes us so much money.

202
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,250
Don't let her get away.

203
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,180
Right. Otherwise, we can't
get our money back.

204
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,420
Go this way if we ask for money.

205
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,180
Who are you looking for?

206
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,150
Well.

207
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,950
Young girl,

208
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,050
can you tell us

209
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,220
what we should do about our situation?

210
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,980
Company A hired us
for a construction project,

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,350
but they ran out of funds
halfway through,

212
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,950
so the project was halted.

213
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,950
Then, Company B acquired Company A.

214
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,680
You see,

215
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,120
who should we demand our payment from?

216
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
Company B, of course.

217
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,180
Company A won't have money to pay you.

218
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,620
But the daughter of Company A's owner

219
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,880
is engaged to the owner of Company B.

220
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,150
That's easy. You can get the money
from the daughter.

221
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,950
Do you know Shen Qingge

222
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,220
and where she lives?

223
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,575
(Oh, my.)

224
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,321
(They're after me.)

225
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,620
