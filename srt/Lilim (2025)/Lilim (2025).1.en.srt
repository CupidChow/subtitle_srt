1
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,013
Tomas.

2
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,351
Tomas, listen to me.

3
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,103
Listen to me.

4
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,316
We need to leave.

5
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,151
Now.

6
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,155
Issa…

7
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,033
Why did you do that? Why?

8
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,499
I already told you.

9
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,337
I had to do it, Tomas.

10
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,548
I had to.

11
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,094
He can't hurt us now.

12
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:52,542
<i>Another rally at the university</i>
<i>was dispersed today.</i>

13
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>Things got heated with the students…</i>

14
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>Police quickly arrived</i>
<i>and settled the situation.</i>

15
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,886
<i>I'm telling you, folks, we really</i>
<i>need to be more vigilant,</i>

16
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,681
<i>especially with all these</i>
<i>instigators around,</i>

17
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:11,311
<i>they're always up to something.</i>

18
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,148
<i>My advice? Just keep</i>
<i>a cool head and we'll all be fine.</i>

19
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:19,319
<i>Relax! We're used to this, am I right?</i>

20
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:26,451
<i>And in other developments,</i>
<i>coming in straight from Manila,</i>

21
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,663
<i>a lunatic threw a grenade on stage</i>
<i>during the opposition party's speech</i>

22
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:36,335
<i>resulting in two deaths,</i>
<i>and possibly injuring six others.</i>

23
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,795
<i>My God.</i>

24
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>According to authorities,</i>
<i>stricter measures</i>

25
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:46,846
<i>will be implemented around the area</i>
<i>to secure the venue's next event…</i>

26
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:51,934
<i>Meanwhile, during the summer season,</i>
<i>people are likely to face challenges.</i>

27
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,397
<i>We might experience temporary brownouts</i>
<i>more frequently because of this…</i>

28
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,151
This looks like the place.

29
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,903
Where are we?

30
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,657
Do you remember the stories
Mom used to tell us?

31
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:11,370
How she loved playing
hide-and-seek among trees like these.

32
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,333
Before she passed away,
I remember her telling me

33
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,711
how she would sometimes imagine
running away to this place

34
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,422
whenever Dad would hurt her.

35
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,884
But why are we here?

36
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,222
You told me that
we're going to Grandma's house.

37
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,475
- We can't, Tomas.
- But…

38
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,687
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
- I'm not stupid!

39
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,314
I know what you did!

40
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,857
You're a murderer!

41
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,610
I already told you. I had to do that!

42
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,694
No!

43
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,322
You didn't have to!
I don't want to stay with you!

44
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,116
I'm not coming with you!

45
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,034
Let me out!

46
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,204
Tomas, can't you understand
that I'm protecting you?

47
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,164
Tomas, come back!

48
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,459
Tomas!

49
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,465
Tomas!

50
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,971
Tomas!

51
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,600
Tomas?

52
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,977
Tomas!

53
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,909
Tomas!

54
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,669
Tomas?

55
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,643
Hello?

56
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,358
Anybody home?

57
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,602
Tomas?

58
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,440
Tomas!

59
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,603
Calm down, my dear.

60
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,772
Please forgive Gabriel,

61
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,316
he didn't mean to scare you.

62
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,573
I just needed help.

63
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,617
The door was open,

64
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,578
- so I thought--
- This orphanage rarely gets visitors.

65
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,748
We get careless sometimes,
and forget to lock the doors.

66
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,543
But that won't happen again,
right, Josephine?

67
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,339
Yes, Sister Marga.

68
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,802
Wait…

69
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,514
Who are you and where did you come from?

70
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,143
Helena, can't you see that she's scared?

71
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,272
I know what I'm doing, Trining.

72
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,864
You're hurt. What happened?

73
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,244
It's nothing.

74
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,289
I tripped and fell.

75
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,124
I saw something.

76
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,710
What did you see, child?

77
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,133
Nothing. For a second, I thought…

78
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,135
But where did you come from?

79
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,887
Why did you come here?

80
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,723
Helena, that's enough.

81
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,851
Tell us your name.

82
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,939
It's Issa.

83
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,735
I'm just looking for my brother, Tomas.

84
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,946
Our car broke down on the highway.

85
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,867
He ran into the forest
and I couldn't catch up to him.

86
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,705
Didn't you say this was an orphanage?

87
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,373
Where are all the children?

88
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,088
Tomas.

89
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,965
Tomas!

90
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,218
Tomas!

91
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
Are you okay?

92
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,310
Don't ever run away like that again.

93
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,398
We found the child wandering outside.

94
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,818
His memory is hazy,
maybe you can talk to him.

95
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,698
I insist that you stay the night.
There are no shelters nearby.

96
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,578
Tomas…

97
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,789
I'm here now.

98
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,167
It's okay.

99
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,690
Tomas…

100
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,696
You didn't tell them anything, did you?

101
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,784
Don't worry.

102
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,161
I'm here now.

103
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,548
Your room.

104
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,013
I'm glad Sister Marga
let you stay the night.

105
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,058
There are some old clothes there,
you can wear them.

106
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,772
Is someone else staying in the room?

107
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,568
The last person who stayed here
had to leave in a hurry.

108
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,904
Don't mind her things.

109
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,019
Lord, it's me again.

110
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,396
Please protect me and Issa.

111
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,066
Forgive her for what she has done.

112
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,449
What are you doing?

113
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,244
Don't you pray?

114
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,705
Pray? What's that?

115
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,750
Is that kind of like what the sisters do?

116
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,045
It's how I talk to the Lord.

117
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,715
To thank Him, and to ask for His help.

118
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,761
You worry too much.

119
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,764
We're safe here at the orphanage.

120
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,060
Some of the kids are even
lucky enough to get adopted.

121
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,063
I had a friend, his name's Patrick.

122
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,608
He left recently.

123
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,195
But at least he has a family now.

124
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,698
Hey, Nilo!

125
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,576
Keep it down! I can't sleep!

126
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,530
Don't worry, the children are asleep.

127
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,532
Have you finished cleaning?

128
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,160
Careful, let's not wake our new guest.

129
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,608
It is good that Mother has eaten.

130
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,110
These past few nights have been calm.

131
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,864
Not for long. We need to be prepared.

132
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,368
Don't lose faith, Sister,
for it is written.

133
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,412
- Dim the lights.
- Yes, Sister.

134
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,870
Sir.

135
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,185
Mr. Sevilla's office called.

136
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,604
She hasn't been to work since yesterday.

137
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,565
She's not answering her calls either.

138
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,610
We called their grandmother,
the kids aren't with her either.

139
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,446
The Corolla's gone, too.

140
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,032
Maybe the two of them went on a road trip.

141
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,161
Then we should go, too.

142
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,372
We need to find them quickly.

143
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,327
Everyone, listen up.

144
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,913
We have new guests today,

145
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,999
Issa and her younger brother Tomas.

146
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,210
They'll be staying here for awhile.

147
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:02,839
I trust everyone remembers their manners

148
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,426
and are respectful
towards our new friends.

149
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,552
Move it!

150
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,391
I apologize for the simple food.

151
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,394
It's the only thing we can afford
on our budget at the moment.

152
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,980
It's surprising how few of them
actually get adopted.

153
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:25,237
Many of them are children
of <i>desaparecidos</i> or rebels.

154
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,407
The money given by
your church isn't enough?

155
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,663
We are not funded by any church.

156
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,665
We merely rely on donations,

157
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,668
mostly from supporters
sympathetic to our cause.

158
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,717
Good thing you picked up
this one, Sister Marga.

159
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,137
We've been waiting for
a new friend to play with.

160
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,139
Prinsipe.

161
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,813
Don't mind him.

162
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,692
Prinsipe can be
really troublesome at times.

163
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,653
He's a bad influence on the other boys.

164
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,202
I've noticed something.
Are there only boys here?

165
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,622
Have all the girls been adopted?

166
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,418
There are only eight of us sisters.

167
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,336
I'm sure you'll understand,

168
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,299
we can't traditionally educate them
on certain matters.

169
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,386
Instead, we make sure that
they grow in an environment

170
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,847
where they cannot be
plagued by perverse thoughts.

171
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,518
Please, allow me.

172
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,649
- Are you finished?
- Thank you.

173
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,288
- You're nasty!
- Why, was it small?

174
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,374
Hell no. It was big!

175
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,296
You wench! Sister might hear us.

176
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,135
We'll handle the dishes.
Just leave it there.

177
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,178
Hello.

178
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,014
Why are you all alone?

179
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:03,395
Don't you want to join your friends?
They're having lunch.

180
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,774
By the way, I'm Issa.

181
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,568
What about you? What's your name?

182
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,957
What are you looking at?

183
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,817
Ezekiel.

184
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,194
Return to the hall.

185
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,196
And you…

186
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,284
Sister Marga's waiting for you.

187
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,578
I'm sorry.

188
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,888
I can't thank you enough, Sister Marga.

189
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,849
I honestly don't know where
Tomas and I would have ended up

190
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:25,352
- if you hadn't helped us.
- It's no burden.

191
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,689
But I sense that you still have
something you want to tell me.

192
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,153
I wanted to ask if…

193
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,031
we can stay here indefinitely.

194
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:42,202
I wouldn't be this desperate
if our situation wasn't so hopeless.

195
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,579
No need to explain.

196
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,707
We do not judge here.

197
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,627
Look at them.

198
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:56,007
Many of us…
chose to abandon the city life.

199
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,052
To escape the chaos
fate had in store for us.

200
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,471
Here, in our new home,

201
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:05,266
we found peace in pursuing
a new beginning.

202
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,106
I'm not sure how long
we'll have to stay, Sister.

203
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,526
You may leave any time you want.

204
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,237
We're willing to help you
in any way we can.

205
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,285
If…

206
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,998
I can't find a way to fix our situation…

207
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,338
would it be possible…

208
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,551
for you to get Tomas adopted?

209
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,766
I don't have the heart to leave Tomas,

210
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,602
but I don't think I can…

211
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:57,485
Whatever was broken can be fixed, Issa.

212
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,199
But if it comes down to it,
we will take care of Tomas.

213
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,705
Thank you, Sister.

214
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,956
Thank you.

215
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,340
These rooms are for storage.

216
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,302
We use them mostly to
store our reading materials.

217
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,681
Past the mess hall is our cellar.

218
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,489
Gabriel, get a move on.
Sister Josephine's waiting.

219
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,035
Gabriel is a hard worker.

220
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,704
It's a shame he gets picked on often.

221
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,307
Whose room is that?

222
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,852
That is Mother Mirasol's room,

223
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,271
she's our oldest member here.

224
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,856
She's confined to her room,

225
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,441
we rarely bother her,

226
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,277
except for occasions
like council meetings.

227
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,240
You're forbidden from entering that room.

228
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,869
So, there are nine of you here?

229
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,249
Sister Marga said
there were only eight of you.

230
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,676
You can start cleaning
Sister Marga's office.

231
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,389
We all have a part to contribute here.

232
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,229
Slow poke!

233
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,315
All right, enough of this crap.

234
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,234
It's getting boring.

235
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,195
Listen up!

236
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,239
You know the drill.

237
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,033
Who wants to be Mother Mirasol?

238
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,960
Since you're the new kid, Tomas,

239
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,796
you have to be Mother Mirasol.

240
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,632
Put that on.

241
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,303
Who's Mother Mirasol?

242
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,557
Mother Mirasol?

243
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,686
She's the beast that roams the orphanage,

244
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,522
looking for children to eat for dinner.

245
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,152
Hurry up! Put that on,
and start chasing us.

246
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,164
What are you waiting for? Chase us!

247
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,168
Prinsipe's getting angry.

248
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,252
Coward!

249
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,921
You're useless!

250
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:10,303
<i>Mother Mirasol is coming</i>

251
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:14,474
<i>She'll eat you</i>
<i>And spit out your bones</i>

252
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,936
<i>Mother Mirasol is coming</i>

253
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,481
<i>She'll eat you</i>
<i>And spit out your bones!</i>

254
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,446
Are you okay?

255
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,533
We can play another game if you like.

256
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,899
Careful now.

257
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,530
It is up to us women
to protect this place.

258
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:15,118
It's a dangerous time, I'm sure you
understand why we can't be too careful.

259
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:20,832
We use that to fend off wild boars
from the forest as well.

260
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,046
So, please don't wander outside,
especially when it's dark.

261
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,590
Let Tomas know as well.

262
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,885
We wouldn't want to mistake him
for a pesky boar.

263
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,556
I hope not.

264
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,775
Do you watch movies, Sister?

265
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,114
We have no time for such distractions.

266
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,202
It's more important for us
to tend to the kids.

267
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,832
Finish up here, dinner will be ready soon.

268
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:16,596
<i>The search continues for the two siblings</i>
<i>responsible for the murder of their…</i>

269
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,697
Your turn! That's it!

270
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,415
Hey, look, it's Tomas.

271
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,212
Hey, Tomas!
Quit being a coward and show us.

272
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,297
Prove to us that you're a man.

273
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,301
- No way.
- Why? Are you hiding something?

274
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,720
That's enough, Prinsipe.

275
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,806
Leave Tomas alone.

276
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:05,561
What's it to you? Is he your boyfriend?

277
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,029
Now what? You want to punch me?

278
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,073
Go on! Punch me!

279
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,908
Coward!

280
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,537
Maybe you need your sister
to stand up for you.

281
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,082
You think I'm scared of her?

282
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,878
You should be scared of her.

283
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,091
She'll kill you and cut off your penis.

284
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,304
How long have they been in there?

285
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,393
Hurry up and get to bed already!

286
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,104
Weakling!

287
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,196
I'm so tired, today was a lot.

288
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,449
But I can't complain,
we got everything we need here.

289
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,375
About our secret,

290
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,504
you haven't told anyone, have you?

291
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,550
Don't ever tell anyone, okay?

292
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,928
I don't like it here.

293
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,722
I want to leave.

294
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,851
But we're safe here, Tomas.

295
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,729
Why can't you understand that?

296
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,358
You're the one who killed father…

297
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,329
I will fix this.

298
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,123
Just trust me.

299
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,132
Have you seen, Tomas?

300
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,067
Tomas?

301
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:47,987
Tomas.

302
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,161
To avoid lice.

303
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:02,293
I'm sure he doesn't mind,
Sister Marga. Right, Tomas?

304
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,422
It's finished, you can go.

305
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,722
See? It suits you.

306
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,890
The hair on the floor,

307
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,933
can you clean it up?

308
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,948
Sister Marga…

309
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,847
I told you not to carry it on your own.

310
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,642
- I didn't mean to.
- That was our last statue of her,

311
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,060
and you broke it!

312
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,813
Trining?

313
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,029
Start walking, Trining.

314
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,864
Don't you dare scream.

315
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:22,641
Every step I take is for you.

316
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,062
This suffering, I offer it to you.

317
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,949
You who saved us

318
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:43,454
from the sins of this world.

319
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,496
Trining!

320
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:49,084
- Trining, what are you doing?
- Don't touch me!

321
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,633
- What are you doing to her?
- Let her be.

322
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,051
She needs to suffer.

323
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,306
Every drop of blood,

324
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,352
I offer it to you…

325
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,938
for us…

326
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:59,863
She symbolizes the struggles of all women.

327
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,284
The first wife of Adam.

328
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,663
She is known by many names,

329
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,374
but to us, she is Lilith.

330
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,544
The bane of men.

331
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,339
Our beloved mother.

332
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,599
You know, Issa,

333
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,935
I always wonder…

334
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,565
how Catholics are able
to believe in stories of saints…

335
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,987
of saints growing back their eyes
after they have been plucked out.

336
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,991
Female saints growing beards.

337
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,869
Saints who are said to
have defeated dragons.

338
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,788
They sound absurd.

339
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,125
But like them…

340
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,920
we, too, believe in the stories of Lilith.

341
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,009
This absurdity is part of our faith.

342
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,263
"The first wife of Adam."

343
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,358
A symbol for the struggles of women.

344
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,457
Lilith.

345
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,228
It's time, Tomas.

346
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,609
I apologize.

347
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,028
You're new, so we had to test you.

348
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,532
Now, I'm giving you
another chance to prove yourself.

349
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,791
Later, get a bra and panty
from the laundry room.

350
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,756
If I do this, will you leave me alone?

351
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,466
Don't, Tomas!

352
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,551
You don't need to do this.

353
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,553
This is no joke.

354
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,224
But you had to do this, too, right?

355
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,772
Good boy.

356
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,280
Make us proud.

357
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,907
Be careful downstairs.

358
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,305
Sister!

359
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,685
A child is missing. It's Tomas!

360
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:16,271
This is dangerous!
Mother might catch his scent!

361
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,988
Who started this nonsense?

362
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,537
You?

363
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,049
What now?

364
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,344
So, no one's going to admit to it?

365
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,975
Do I really have to name someone?

366
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,856
It was me, Sister.

367
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:56,496
We made it clear last time that you
won't be given a second chance, Prinsipe.

368
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,499
What are we going to do with you?

369
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,254
You went too far this time, Prinsipe.

370
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,507
You put Tomas in danger.

371
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,009
It's a good thing we found him.

372
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,890
I'm so done playing with these kids.

373
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,769
They're a bunch of fools!

374
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,355
I want to get out of here.

375
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,204
Sister.

376
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,125
This is our fault.

377
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,797
As I told you before,
we're being too lenient with them.

378
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,176
We shouldn't let this pass.

379
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,806
And what do you suggest we do
as punishment, Helena?

380
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,732
It's too early for that.

381
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,276
He's not ready.

382
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,914
Tomas.

383
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,334
What happened last night?

384
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,338
Did you try to run away again?

385
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,759
I can't remember much.

386
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:37,680
I… saw something.

387
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,768
My head hurts.

388
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,398
Everything's going to be fine.

389
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,688
Tomas, you need to eat.

390
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,662
Sister May,

391
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,332
bring out the ice candy for the children.

392
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,460
We have wonderful news!

393
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,589
Prinsipe, are you ready to leave?

394
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:40,762
We have found a family both ready
and worthy to adopt you.

395
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,640
Hear that?

396
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,600
I'm finally getting out of here!

397
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,543
It was our previous superior
who taught us how to make those.

398
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,338
Is it your first time tasting that?

399
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:24,472
Before our mom died,
she used to make us ice candy.

400
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,890
But she doesn't use coconut.

401
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,644
Tomas, how are you?

402
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,981
Did you see something last night
that you want to share with me?

403
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,654
What did you see?

404
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:43,908
I saw a pair of eyes.

405
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,494
Bright ones.

406
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,622
Long fingers.

407
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:56,754
Sometimes our imagination plays
tricks on us, especially in the dark.

408
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,466
But to tell you the truth,

409
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,010
I believe every word of it.

410
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,513
- Really?
- Of course!

411
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,516
But it wasn't
a monster you saw last night.

412
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,144
This place…

413
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,731
holds many secrets.

414
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,776
This isn't a simple orphanage.

415
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:23,656
It was built on top of a miraculous site.

416
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,367
The home of an angel.

417
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,328
An angel of love.

418
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,876
I believe it is that very angel
that you saw last night,

419
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,004
not a monster.

420
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,674
Don't worry, she had
no intentions of hurting you.

421
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,179
Because angels…

422
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,598
don't hurt innocent people
like us, do they?

423
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,101
No, they don't.

424
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,192
It's time, Prinsipe.

425
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,242
Take care, Prinsipe.

426
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:35,997
Take care.

427
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,418
- Bye, Prinsipe.
- Take care! Don't forget about us!

428
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,700
Where are we going?

429
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,661
You have to say goodbye to Mother Mirasol.

430
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,275
Okay.

431
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,820
Make sure to whisper in her ear,

432
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,865
Mother can't hear too well anymore.

433
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,956
Sister Helena!

434
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,707
Sister Helena!

435
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,877
You have to say goodbye to her.

436
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,255
If you don't say goodbye,
we won't let you leave.

437
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:30,695
Hurry up, Prinsipe.
Your new family is waiting for you.

438
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,762
Oh, mother of the shade…

439
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:59,890
who came into this world alone…

440
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,686
rid us of our chains, oh, Mother,

441
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:07,064
for you bear the divine wrath.

442
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:13,195
From the veil of twilight,
you call us forth…

443
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:22,371
to resist and to reign,
from ashes to ashes.

444
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,750
In your image,

445
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,128
we seek enlightenment.

446
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,840
From darkness where we were born,

447
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,177
grant us the strength…

448
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:39,555
to win back your throne.

449
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:13,440
Gabriel, what happened in that room?

450
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,900
I heard shouting.

451
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,820
Do you know what did they did to Prinsipe?

452
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,783
Do you know anything about this orphanage?

453
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,578
Are we in danger? Tomas and I.

454
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,038
Please, I have to know!

455
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,017
Gabriel!

456
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:17,213
Tomas.

457
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,174
Can we talk?

458
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,555
We have to leave now.

459
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,893
You were right, something's wrong here.

460
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,020
We need to leave.

461
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,105
I don't understand.

462
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,400
After all this time…

463
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,152
you suddenly want to leave?

464
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:45,491
It was a mistake to come here.

465
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:50,454
I was… I was just following
what Mother said…

466
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,789
to go here when…

467
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:54,083
Tomas, please listen to me!

468
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,752
Prinsipe's gone.

469
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:59,713
The other kids won't bother me anymore.

470
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:03,550
You said we were safe here.

471
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,471
Why should I believe anything you say?

472
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,395
I admit…

473
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,733
I hid a lot of things from you, Tomas.

474
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,408
I was supposed to leave you here.

475
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:34,123
I hoped that…
you could find another family.

476
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:41,672
You were going to leave me?

477
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,591
But I won't.

478
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,428
I'm not going to leave you anymore.

479
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,888
We're both leaving this place, okay?

480
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:54,768
Issa…

481
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,147
Sorry.

482
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:02,067
I didn't do anything
when father was hurting you.

483
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,530
I'm sorry that I was weak.

484
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,075
Tomas.

485
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,871
I don't want to hear you
saying these things.

486
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,086
Whatever happened in the past,

487
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,048
whatever will happen,

488
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:27,217
we will face it together.

489
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,473
- Together, always.
- Together, always.

490
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,516
So here you are.

491
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:37,478
We've been looking for you two.

492
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:40,939
We have good news again.

493
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,193
Issa, let's talk upstairs.

494
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,239
We found a family for Tomas.

495
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,785
I'm telling you now,

496
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,079
he will be picked up later tonight.

497
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,123
Sister Marga,
we've actually decided to leave.

498
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,710
I found a temporary shelter
where we can stay,

499
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,129
just until I sort out our problems.

500
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,426
Let's stop lying to each other.

501
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,847
We both know how grave your situation is.

502
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,641
The truth is…

503
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,728
I know a lot of things about you, Issa.

504
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,726
She was our previous superior.

505
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:01,812
Esther.

506
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:08,152
None of us assumed
that she would be the first to leave,

507
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,736
all because of sympathy.

508
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:12,531
The sympathy she had for an infant orphan.

509
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,491
Mom?

510
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,203
Do you even know
the meaning behind your name?

511
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:20,998
Isabel!

512
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,001
The one pledged to God.

513
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:29,590
I told her there wasn't
any other name befitting for you.

514
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,719
And now, it's time for you
to know who we are.

515
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,347
We are the Lilim.

516
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,144
Servants of Lilith.

517
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,903
You can never leave this place…

518
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,347
Sister Marga made it clear,
the boy can't leave.

519
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,948
It's Sister Marga!

520
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,084
Where's Issa?

521
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:49,503
Find her!

522
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,675
Hey, over here! Help us!

523
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,554
Help! In here!

524
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,181
Please help!

525
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,269
Good afternoon, Sister.

526
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,443
Help me! Help!

527
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,653
Help us!

528
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:22,072
Help!

529
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:28,203
We're really sorry for this, Sister.

530
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:31,164
What those siblings did was horrible.

531
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:32,666
They sound dangerous.

532
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,544
Based on the car we found on the highway,

533
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,714
it looks like they fled to this forest.

534
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:41,883
Sister.

535
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,011
Are you sure you didn't receive any--

536
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,513
Not a single soul.

537
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:50,225
Our doors are always
open to those in need,

538
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,060
but we have nothing to hide.

539
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,188
I have answered all your questions.

540
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,109
Wait…

541
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,653
May we come inside?

542
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:02,946
The orphans,

543
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,741
we were hoping to talk to them.

544
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:32,017
Sister Helena.

545
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:35,145
You're far too pretty to be a nun.

546
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,232
Sister.

547
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,406
You have nice paintings.

548
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,242
Those are all donations.

549
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,536
The kids. Where are they?

550
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,747
I really need to talk to them.

551
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:56,666
- Should I go with you?
- It's okay. I got this.

552
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:43,839
Don't be scared.

553
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,632
I'm a cop.

554
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,025
Darwin!

555
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:12,594
Be gentle, sisters, you might wake her.

556
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,557
She's still resting from her last feast.

557
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,561
But she will regain her strength.

558
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,104
Mother hungers for more.

559
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:25,857
Prepare the offerings.

560
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,589
Don't waste your strength.

561
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:53,468
The rope's too thick.

562
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,262
They might as well be handcuffs.

563
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:59,766
Please! Tomas needs our help!

564
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:01,768
Try getting out!

565
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:04,854
Shit! They took my gun.

566
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:11,277
Are you a cop?

567
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:17,325
I'm Fred.

568
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,996
- You must be…
- Issa.

569
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:23,748
And…

570
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,208
And Tomas…

571
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,085
He's your…

572
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:29,462
My little brother.

573
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:33,800
Were you looking for us?

574
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:37,887
Yeah.

575
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,226
What the hell took you so long?

576
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,688
They killed…

577
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:51,359
Those women killed my partner! Damn them!

578
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,986
Who the hell are they?

579
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,115
Cult members.

580
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,034
Lunatics.

581
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,871
But it's not them I'm afraid of.

582
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:07,417
What do you mean?

583
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:11,963
I saw…

584
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:15,967
I saw a…

585
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,804
I saw the severed arm of a child.

586
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:24,267
Those nuns aren't
the only ones living here.

587
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:35,779
What do you want?

588
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,655
What do you want?

589
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:39,699
Let go of me!

590
01:24:40,366 --> 01:24:41,826
Let go…

591
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:48,708
Wait…

592
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:52,545
Where are you taking me?

593
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:54,923
Where are you taking me?

594
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,009
Please, don't hurt the children.

595
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,303
Let go of me!

596
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:58,736
There are those who say
that we devotees of Lilith…

597
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,613
are all bound for hell.

598
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:02,699
At first,

599
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,120
I was terrified of that.

600
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,713
But now, I no longer fear
the flames of hell.

601
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:21,801
This power… can be yours as well.

602
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:28,266
Just open your heart

603
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,685
and accept her.

604
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:48,453
But you are not Lilim.

605
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,289
Marga was wrong about you.

606
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:54,125
You don't deserve to be here.

607
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,045
You are weak!

608
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,771
Don't you worry about Tomas.

609
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,566
He's lucky.

610
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,026
Because unlike you,

611
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,906
he has something
to offer our beloved Lilith.

612
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:38,670
We will offer every drop of his blood
for our new beginning.

613
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:17,083
Issa!

614
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:19,585
- Issa!
- Hurry up!

615
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,129
My sister! Where is she?

616
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:23,881
- Let go of me! Where's my sister?
- Shut up, you brat!

617
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:29,721
Don't you want to join your new family?
They're waiting for you!

618
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:31,723
Come here!

619
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:39,856
Mother!

620
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:42,233
We give you this offering once again.

621
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,362
Regain your strength,
so that you may rise again.

622
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:49,407
The world is ready for your return.

623
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,908
Beloved mother!

624
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:57,350
Gabriel.

625
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,311
Gabriel…

626
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,564
Save the kids, okay?

627
01:30:04,273 --> 01:30:05,691
I have to go get Tomas.

628
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:07,318
All right?

629
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,383
Don't worry.

630
01:30:31,425 --> 01:30:33,219
The end is near.

631
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:37,431
I see her in you.

632
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:39,976
Esther…

633
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:45,857
You're both brave.

634
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,734
So full of hope.

635
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:53,948
But we are all part of her plan, Issa.

636
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,868
What is written shall be fulfilled.

637
01:31:01,205 --> 01:31:03,082
No one can leave!

638
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:08,588
That's right.

639
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:10,631
Don't look away.

640
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:16,345
Don't you dare look away
when you are in her presence.

641
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:22,518
The fourth seal has been opened.

642
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:26,981
Everything is set.

643
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,567
I have fulfilled my role.

644
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,863
Mother, give me strength…

645
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:40,745
Get down there!

646
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:42,455
Stop squirming!

647
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:44,707
Let me go!

648
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:09,041
Don't be scared.

649
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,170
It is almost finished.

650
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,173
She will deliver us now…

651
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:22,972
to where there is no more suffering…

652
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:25,099
No more pain.

653
01:33:26,642 --> 01:33:28,602
For it was written…

654
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:36,152
She won't stop until
everything is under her shadow.

655
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,447
The old God has forsaken us.

656
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:42,283
It hurts…

657
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,328
Tomas…

658
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,455
You have to hide.

659
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:03,114
Tomas.

660
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:07,785
Get out!

661
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,081
Tomas.

662
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:40,252
Tomas.

663
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:43,589
Tomas, are you okay?

664
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:46,509
Can you walk?

665
01:37:35,224 --> 01:37:37,643
Go, I'll follow you.

666
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,312
Go now!

667
01:37:41,146 --> 01:37:42,147
Hurry!

668
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,247
Tomas.

669
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,210
Tomas.

670
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:56,550
Tomas?

671
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,303
Issa…

672
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,513
we can't leave Nilo…

673
01:41:03,932 --> 01:41:05,434
and the other orphans.

674
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:07,811
What's going to happen to them?

675
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:10,397
We don't have time for this, Tomas.

676
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:12,483
They're just scared to leave.

677
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:17,112
We have to show them
that they shouldn't be scared.

678
01:41:32,085 --> 01:41:33,337
Stay here, okay?

679
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:35,672
Together, always. Remember?

680
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:37,633
Together, always.

681
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:38,717
Always.

682
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:22,719
Tomas.
