1
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,560
Yu.

2
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,520
Long live the Emperor!

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,920
Rise, my ministers.

4
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

5
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,180
After all these years,

6
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,780
you've finally returned.

7
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,200
Look at what you've done.

8
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,479
Father, I am not responsible for the witchcraft incident.

9
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,940
I deny these accusations.

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,880
Father, my royal brother might be confused,

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,600
too afraid to admit his wrongdoing,

12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,560
perhaps you could forgive him.

13
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,720
My son.

14
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,759
I ask you once more,

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,720
are you responsible for the witchcraft incident?

16
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,560
No.

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,240
Very well. Since you refuse to repent.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,140
From this day forward,

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,810
I strip you of your Crown Prince title,

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,759
leaving you only as Prince Jing,

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,490
exiled to the frontier,

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,080
forbidden to return without my decree,

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
unless I am dead.

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
Today is my coronation ceremony, brother,

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,000
if you deliberately try to ruin it,

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,640
don't blame me for disregarding our brotherhood.

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,360
Not drawing my sword in the palace

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
is the greatest courtesy I can show you.

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,780
I came with only one question:

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Father has always been in good health,

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,920
so why did he suddenly pass away?

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,640
And why didn't you inform me

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,900
about Father's death?

34
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,080
Did someone deliberately kill him?

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,280
Or was that person you?

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
How dare you!

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,400
I just want the truth.

38
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,480
The truth is that ten years ago, during the witchcraft case...

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,440
You've always been troubled by

40
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,280
how Father Emperor treated you back then.

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
You know better than anyone

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
how you treated Father Emperor in return.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Prince Jing, after all these years,

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,760
have you ever felt any remorse?

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,370
Father Emperor left a message,

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,160
that we shall never meet again, in life or death.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,960
You're lying!

48
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,640
Guards,

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,840
protect the Emperor!

50
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,280
Your Majesty, the Prince has been stationed at the frontier for years

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,960
and may not be accustomed to palace life upon his return

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,200
Perhaps he should rest at his residence first

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,530
and reunite with his brother another day.

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,440
Prince Jing, you're being disrespectful.

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,440
Today I...

56
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,960
Mother!

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,720
Mother!

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,360
Mother!

59
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,560
Mother!

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,320
Mother!

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
Mother!

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,600
Half the court officials don't even know me.

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,320
If I argue with him now,

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,839
I'll surely be expelled from the palace,

65
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,570
making it even harder to uncover the truth later.

66
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,640
Congratulations on Your Majesty's ascension to the throne.

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,970
Long live Your Majesty,

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,500
long live the Great Jing Dynasty.

69
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,540
Royal Brother.

70
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,120
Since you're here, you might as well accept it.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,840
Feel free to watch how I govern this Great Jing empire.

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,300
Creating a prosperous era together.

73
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,720
Aconite.

74
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,640
This substance can easily take lives,

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,159
it's forbidden in the palace,

76
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,760
only the imperial physicians can purchase it.

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,040
Could she still have connections to the palace?

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,920
Erxi, so here you are.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,280
The young lady is about to enter the palace.

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,920
Speak.

81
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,560
Why does our household have this substance?

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,240
Well,

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,010
I've only seen it in the young lady's room.

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,240
Yan Xier.

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,680
She has a black box in her room,

86
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,520
she takes a little out almost every day,

87
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,960
but never lets us touch it.

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,120
Yan Xier is father's daughter,

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
why would she do this?

90
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,000
From today on,

91
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
I am Erxi.

92
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,240
Do you understand?

93
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Why hasn't the Emperor arrived yet?

94
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,340
What time is it now?

95
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,340
You stupid girl, cat got your tongue?

96
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Xiaoqing! Erxi!

97
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,400
Xiaoqing went to fetch water.

98
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,640
I am Erxi.

99
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,010
Who are you looking for?

100
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,240
My father's lips turned black when he died.

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,640
The only poison that can cause quick death

102
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,560
with bleeding from all orifices is aconite.

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
This poison is forbidden in the palace,

104
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,440
yet you have plenty in your room.

105
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,480
Tell me, where did you get it?

106
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,800
Don't scream!

107
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,800
Help!

108
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,720
Thief! Catch the thief!

109
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,570
When my father passed away,

110
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,770
Eunuch Chen must have been by his side.

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Yet there's no trace of him anywhere in the palace.

112
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Stop!

113
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,360
It's you!

114
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
Yes.

115
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,760
Are they gone?

116
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,010
Don't move, they haven't left yet.

117
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,850
How dare you take advantage of me, you!

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,400
You, young lady,

119
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,860
why are you so ungrateful?

120
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,640
I was clearly helping you buy time

121
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
so they could get further away.

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,770
You were clearly...

123
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,490
What?

124
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,120
Don't tell me you want to take advantage of me in return?
