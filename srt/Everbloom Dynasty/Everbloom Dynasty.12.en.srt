1
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm sorry, junior sister.

2
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,300
What does this have to do with you?

3
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,480
What I meant was,

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,120
when I was applying medicine just now,

5
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,000
I was a bit rough

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,040
and hurt you.

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
I don't know why,

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,050
even though I'm out now,

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,360
I still feel this isn't over.

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,920
Did she find out something

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,200
and is deliberately testing me?

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,560
I just feel like

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,960
there's a powerful force behind all this,

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,480
controlling everything,

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,000
and countless minions

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,680
closing in on me,

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,050
all wanting to strangle me.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,200
Junior sister,

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,210
I think you're overthinking this.

20
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,960
Tomorrow happens to be market day,

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,039
we can leave the palace together

22
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,840
and see the bustling streets of Chang'an,

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,600
relax a bit.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,810
How does that sound?

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,640
Look

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,800
at that kite.

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Yes,

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,860
over there.

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,380
Little junior,

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,600
how about this,

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,360
let's split up.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,560
You go look around first,

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,720
and I'll go to the south of the city to buy some herbs.

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,240
At 4 o'clock,

35
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
we'll meet at the palace gate.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,320
How does that sound?

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,800
Alright.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,920
Then I'll go first.

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,039
Miss,

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,960
take a look,

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,639
this would suit you well.

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,040
I'll take this one.

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,520
Good.

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,480
Thank you.

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,880
Xiaoqing is willing to plead with the prince for me,

46
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,640
this favor

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,490
I must repay.

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,720
What's that?

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,280
Let's take a look.

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
Wang's Pastry Shop opens today,

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,850
buy one get one free,

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,800
the more you buy, the more you get,

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,880
everyone is welcome to visit us!

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,120
Good.

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Apart from leasing farmland,

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,600
the Yan family has no other business.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
The Emperor has repeatedly ordered

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,760
that officials must not seek private profit outside the court.

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,360
Why would she open this shop?

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,680
Mother

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,010
I've missed you so much.

62
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,360
How have you been lately?

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,280
I'm doing well.

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,640
I heard about today's opening

65
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,760
and His Majesty specially sent Lady Yan to congratulate you.

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,490
Look at that,

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,040
how considerate.

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,720
The Yan family has gained favor.

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,360
They have connections in the palace now.

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,520
Indeed.

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,570
We, mother and daughter...

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,840
We have no more ties with the Yan family,

73
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,900
this is Wang family property.

74
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,640
Senior.

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,260
Didn't she go to the south of the city?

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
This medicine cannot be prepared inside the palace.

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,160
The prescription is ready,

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,490
prepare it yourselves,

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,860
and find a way to deliver it to the palace.

80
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,640
Mother,

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,160
did you see that?

82
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,400
Even someone like her

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,200
dares to disobey me, her master.

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,600
I thought entering the palace would help me rise to prominence,

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,280
but instead

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,400
my uncle can order me around whenever he wants.

87
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
And that Yan Jiehuan,

88
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,840
keeps asking about my father all day,

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
it's so annoying.

90
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,600
How long must I endure this?

91
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,130
I'm about to die from anger.

92
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,900
Especially that Yan Jiehuan,

93
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,760
I feel the urge to kill her whenever I see her.

94
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,440
Endure until you give birth to a prince.

95
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,760
Endure until you become the Empress.

96
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,520
Guard,

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,440
when I left,

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,560
the Imperial Physician only gave me one token.

99
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,040
My senior hasn't arrived yet.

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Could you let me in first?

101
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,400
No token,

102
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
no entry.

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,060
Move along.

104
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,960
It's past the hour.

105
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,000
You'll be punished if you don't return to the palace.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,640
Follow me,

107
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,920
and see who dares punish you.

108
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,880
Your Highness, why did you come out?

109
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,740
Do you remember

110
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,880
when you were beaten

111
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,680
because of the Five Elements Herb?

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,600
My wounds still hurt.

113
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,980
How could I forget?

114
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,050
I've received news that

115
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,040
Chang'an's largest medicine merchant

116
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,200
has recently acquired a batch of special herbs.

117
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
If that's the case,

118
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,250
could it be related to aconite?

119
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,840
Can you take me with you?

120
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Of course.

121
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,120
The place we're going to

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
is quite a special one.

123
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,240
So this is the great place you mentioned?

124
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,300
I think you're just

125
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,800
up to no good.

126
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,960
Don't underestimate this place.

127
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,620
Any problem you want to solve,

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,200
or any information you want to find out,

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,760
can all be

130
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,600
accomplished here.

131
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Really?

132
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
Every step is difficult,

133
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,410
yet every step is possible.

134
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:35,920
Come in.

135
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,050
Please, gentlemen.

136
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,440
Please have a seat.

137
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,360
What would you like to order?

138
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,700
Bring us some wine and dishes.

139
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,560
Just a moment.

140
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,160
Come on.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,560
The harder to get, the more valuable.

142
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Give me more of the sellable ones,

143
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,480
the expensive kind.

144
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you making money or risking your lives?

145
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,610
This stuff is meant for the palace, for making a fortune.

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,240
They're talking about

147
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,770
the Five Elements Herb.

148
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,360
Cheers!

149
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,720
Come on,

150
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,120
let's drink.

151
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
Gentlemen, I overheard

152
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,080
your conversation just now.

153
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
To be honest with you all,

154
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,130
I specialize in acquiring rare medicinal herbs.

155
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,640
All expenses tonight

156
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,600
are on me.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
You're quite generous, sir,

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,440
but my medicines

159
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,920
aren't available to just anyone.

160
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,600
What medicine are you looking to buy?

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,530
The ones that are

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,880
hard to find on the market.

163
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,120
Well, these medicines,

164
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,160
the harder they are to get, the more expensive they are.

165
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,420
How much can you offer?

166
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Whatever price

167
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
you name, I'll pay it.

168
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
This is the Five Elements Herb you're looking for.

169
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,120
Besides my shop,

170
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,920
you won't find it anywhere else.

171
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,780
Three days ago,

172
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,919
did anyone buy

173
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,280
this medicine from you?

174
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,840
Used properly, it saves lives,

175
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
used improperly, it harms people.

176
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,200
I don't want to be blamed for that.

177
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,600
So

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,120
everyone who buys from me,

179
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,159
I keep a record of them.

180
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,320
Can you show me

181
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,040
who has bought it?

182
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,560
That

183
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
is confidential.

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,400
We don't dare sell this medicine to just anyone,

185
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
only to people of some standing.

186
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
That way, if something goes wrong,

187
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,810
we won't have to take the blame.

188
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,760
I dare not imagine

189
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,240
that Lady Wang brought the Five Elements Herb into the palace.

190
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,720
The only person who could have given it

191
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,800
was Yan Xier.

192
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,080
And Yan Xier, out of jealousy for the pregnant Empress,

193
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
poisoned her.

194
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,960
But who helped her put the poison

195
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,000
into the medicine?

196
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,600
This is the Wang family business.

197
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,060
Senior Sister.

198
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,740
Didn't she go to the south of the city?

199
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,560
You've already guessed who it is, haven't you?

200
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,760
My father was poisoned to death.

201
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,640
I'm afraid,

202
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,540
afraid of wrongly accusing someone,

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,640
and afraid of trusting the wrong person.

204
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Often, the person you trust the most

205
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
is the one you'll eventually discover

206
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
is actually harming you.

207
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
This feeling

208
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,380
is truly devastating.

209
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Your Highness

210
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,010
knows this all too well.

211
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,280
From being banished from the palace

212
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,940
to being sent to the frontier,

213
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
all the reasons behind it

214
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
I dare not even think about them.

215
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
After that,

216
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,280
we'll search for the truth together,

217
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,040
keep each other company,

218
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,760
shall we?
