1
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
Junior sister.

2
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,960
Junior sister.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,480
I can't sleep.

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Something's bothering you.

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,880
You always do.

6
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,760
Whenever something's on your mind, you can't sleep,

7
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,720
and when you can't sleep,

8
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,440
you keep me up talking all night.

9
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:26,920
Tell me,

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,480
are you missing our master?

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,120
Of course I miss our master,

12
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,240
but there's something else

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
I wanted to ask you about.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,479
What is it?

15
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,250
What do you think

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,400
of General Huo?

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,800
What kind of person is he?

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,210
He's quite nice.

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,520
Pretty good.

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,850
Yes, indeed.

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,680
I've only met him a few times,

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,640
yet he went up the mountain to gather herbs for me.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
I think he's a good person.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,120
But don't worry, senior sister,

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,050
I'll definitely repay this favor.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Just repaying a favor?

27
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,360
Of course.

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,920
It's not like I have feelings for him.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,380
What, should I offer myself to him in return?

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,860
Well, that's all then.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,200
Let's go to sleep.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,759
Nothing else.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,610
Prime Minister.

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,600
Prince Jing is very concerned about the military camp embezzlement.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,680
He should have been eliminated by us long ago.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
But now,

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,880
what are we going to do?

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,000
Soldiers are valued for quality, not quantity,

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,000
and generals for wisdom, not strength.

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,760
Minister Wang, you're a scholar,

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,040
yet

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,040
is murder your only solution?

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,040
Prince Jing's return to court

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,960
is suspicious.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,530
I believe his interests

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
lie beyond court politics.

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
And His Majesty never questions

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
his actions.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Prime Minister, are you suggesting

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,960
he's conspiring with the Emperor?

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
That does make sense.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,120
After all,

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,160
this kingdom belongs to the Liu family.

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,240
When all is said and done,

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,320
they are brothers.

56
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,640
For the throne,

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,900
how many brothers have turned

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,130
against each other?

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,760
There's only one throne,

60
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
whether they unite or divide

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,840
isn't up to them.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,730
The Prime Minister speaks wisely.

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,440
Now that the account books

64
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,000
are in Prince Jing's hands,

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
further discussion is pointless.

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,060
We must prepare for the worst,

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,690
and ensure he cannot implicate me.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Yes.

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,840
Wait.

70
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,740
Minister Wang.

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,440
I

72
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,930
don't want to hear about

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,660
another failed assassination attempt.

74
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,530
Understood.

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,920
Father.

76
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,400
Embezzling military funds,

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,460
forming factions,

78
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,040
attempting to assassinate a prince,

79
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,280
disrespecting royal authority—

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,079
which of these isn't a capital offense?

81
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,120
Any one could destroy our Huo family forever.

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,720
Father.

83
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,480
Why are you being so foolish?

84
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,810
Stay out of this matter,

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,040
I have my own plans.

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,880
Get out!

87
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,860
Why did you call me out so late?

88
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,560
You promised to give me acupuncture,

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
but you didn't keep your word.

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
The one who broke his promise

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
is Prince Jing.

92
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,920
I didn't tell you my identity

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,280
because I have my reasons.

94
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,080
Actually, I wanted to protect...

95
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,680
Forget it.

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,330
Your identity doesn't matter to me

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,730
and I don't want to know.

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,450
Let it go.

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm big enough not to hold grudges,

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,330
so I forgive you.

101
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,400
Come on,

102
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,240
I'll give you another acupuncture treatment.

103
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,040
The red marks are raised

104
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
as if someone has licked an antidote herb.

105
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,960
When poisoned people consume it, the red marks disappear,

106
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,620
but for those without poison, red marks appear.

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,560
As a young lady,

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,240
couldn't you be a bit gentler?

109
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,720
When there's flow, there's no pain;

110
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,440
when there's pain, there's no flow.

111
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,760
You clearly found the antidote herb yourself

112
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,090
and secretly tasted it.

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,140
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
I heard you went to the Huo residence looking for your cousin,

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,720
Lady Yan.

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,720
What do you mean by that?

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,840
We're both women,

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,320
I can tell you like him.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,130
I can help you enter the Huo family.

120
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
However,

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,960
you must do as I say.

122
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Lady Yan,

123
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,890
what do you need me to do?

124
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,380
I can help you get into the Huo family,

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,320
but

126
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,840
you have to do as I say.

127
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Senior Sister, are you still awake?

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,920
Who is that person

129
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,440
he mentioned?

130
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,800
When first entering the palace,

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
there will surely be many difficulties

132
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,520
and people who make things hard for us.

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
Senior Sister, if you have any troubles, just tell me,

134
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,400
I'll help you.

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,160
Tomorrow is the day we go out to purchase supplies,

136
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
I want to go out and have a look around.

137
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,020
You should get some sleep now.

138
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,900
All palace affairs

139
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,159
are documented in archives.

140
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,360
When I was falsely accused of witchcraft back then,

141
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
there should be records.

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,320
The witnesses must have been accomplices of the slanderer.

143
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,680
If we can find these witnesses,

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
we can trace this back to its source.

145
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,880
Stop shouting.

146
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,360
It's me.

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,300
Your Highness,

148
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
why are you here?

149
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,160
I'm here to investigate the old witchcraft case.

150
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,490
What are you doing here?

151
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm looking for clues about my father's murder.

152
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,340
Be careful.

153
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
Someone has reported us.

154
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Whoever set this trap.

155
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,580
It must be someone close to me.

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,900
This kind of thing,

157
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,010
even if it exists in the palace,

158
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,240
is rarely stocked

159
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,330
and practically nonexistent.

160
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
Miss Yan.

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,330
General Huo.

162
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,080
I'll take care of this area.

163
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,480
You go patrol elsewhere.

164
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,240
Yes, sir.

165
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,560
Miss Yan

166
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,169
what are you doing here?

167
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
To be honest

168
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,440
General Huo

169
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,240
I'm here to investigate the truth about my father's murder

170
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
I came here today

171
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,280
to look for clues.

172
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,640
Thank you for covering for me, General Huo.

173
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,600
Between us

174
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
no thanks are necessary.

175
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,810
To tell you the truth

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,320
ever since I saw you at the Imperial Hospital

177
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,180
I haven't been able to forget you.

178
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,000
I even

179
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,140
think about you every day.

180
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,880
Perhaps it's because we see each other daily

181
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,360
that the impression is so strong.

182
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,840
No

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,280
I like you.

184
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,040
General Huo

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
my entry into the palace

186
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,500
is already a risky venture

187
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,080
so I don't want to involve anyone else.

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,680
Therefore

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,770
I must take my leave.

190
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,920
Miss Yan

191
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,640
it's getting late,

192
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,770
let me walk you back.

193
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,520
Thank you, General Huo,

194
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,920
I'll head back to my room.

195
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,640
Miss Yan,

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,020
I truly have feelings for you.

197
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm not afraid of the consequences,

198
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
would you give me a chance?

199
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,280
I'm sorry,

200
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
but right now I just want to focus on what I need to do.
