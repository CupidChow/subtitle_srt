1
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,960
Stop!

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,800
Move again and I'll kill her.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,360
Your Highness.

4
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,440
Your Highness.

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,640
Your Highness.

6
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,600
Your Highness.

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,560
Your Highness.

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,340
Your Highness.

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,740
Doctor Yan.

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,520
What's wrong with His Highness?

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,360
Why are all the palace doctors helpless?

12
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,200
This poison

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,320
is a mixture of various toxins,

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,400
containing glycosides that cause fainting.

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,240
It gradually infiltrates the blood,

16
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,000
the body,

17
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,560
and eventually the brain.

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,080
If he remains in a coma for months...

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,880
What can we do?

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
I can't just watch His Highness die.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
Is there truly no one who can cure this?

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,759
No,

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
there is someone.

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
I believe she can do it.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Don't the royal physicians have any solution?

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Where is Physician Yan?

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,289
Where is she?

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,479
She didn't say anything,

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,610
just left in a hurry.

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,600
They say true feelings show in times of trouble.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Now that the Prince is ill,

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,260
she's nowhere to be found.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,360
I don't think Physician Yan is that kind of person.

34
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,040
Whatever medicine you need,

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,640
feel free to get it from the Imperial Medical Office,

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,760
regardless of the cost.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,960
On behalf of the Prince,

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,620
I, Yu Shen, thank Your Majesty

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,570
and Your Highness the Empress.

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
Is the Empress

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,650
planning to stay and keep him company?

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,400
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,540
No matter what,

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,680
he is your imperial brother,

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,540
I am his friend,

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,130
there's nothing wrong with showing concern.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,160
If you can't let go, just admit it,

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,080
don't think I don't know what's in your mind.

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
If Your Majesty insists on wrongfully accusing me,

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,600
then I won't offer any explanation.

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,940
Doctor Yan.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,079
I knew you would come back.

53
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,000
This is my master.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
She has a way to cure the prince's poisoning.

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,730
Master, please.

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,240
Aconite mixed with arrow poison

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
is extremely difficult to cure.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,920
I know.

59
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,480
Master has a pill that can cure all diseases.

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,410
Please help him.

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
The Life-Saving Pill was made by my master

62
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,370
after collecting 99 different herbs.

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,320
There were once three pills.

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,640
After saving two lives,

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,240
only one remained, which was passed to me.

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,560
It's not that I'm unwilling to part with it,

67
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,220
but the formula has been lost.

68
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,560
I need to keep it

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,740
to identify the names of those herbs.

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,560
From now on, I'm willing to risk my life testing medicines for you, Master.

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,360
I promise to gather all 99 herbs,

72
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,900
please, Master, save him.

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,840
Using the life-saving pill is no simple matter.

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,520
It requires a special catalyst,

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,780
the Purple Gold Ingot.

76
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,080
Croton frost.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,960
Chinese gall.

78
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,600
Realgar,

79
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,850
we have all of these.

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,040
40 qian of cinnabar,

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,880
though it's quite a large amount,

82
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,160
fortunately the Imperial Hospital has it in stock.

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
But these 30 qian of musk

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
won't be easy to find.

85
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
I've checked the medical records.

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
Last year, the Western Regions sent tribute,

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,520
which included musk.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
But since it was often misused by people in the imperial harem,

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,880
the Emperor gave it to the Prime Minister.

90
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,680
So...

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,300
Doctor Yan!

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,420
Doctor Yan!

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,000
General Huo.

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,960
The musk,

95
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,210
I've brought it.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,330
Thank you, General Huo.

97
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,000
I've never seen her care so much about a man before.

98
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
His Lordship can finally swallow,

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,659
that's wonderful!

100
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,960
The purple gold pill detoxifies and relieves pain,

101
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,480
the life-saving pill restores vital energy,

102
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
within three days,

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,740
he will fully recover.

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,570
Thank you, Master, for saving him.

105
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,770
Huan'er.

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,440
Since when have you become so distant with your master?

107
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,040
By the way,

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
where is your senior apprentice?

109
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,640
Is she doing well in the palace?

110
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,700
Are you two looking after each other?

111
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
What's wrong?

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,280
Master,

113
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,000
although I'm an outsider

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,960
and shouldn't interfere in your family matters,

115
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,560
but

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,720
Physician Chunyu has been bullying Physician Yan,

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,240
and even

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,920
regarding the murder case,

119
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,080
he won't say a single word in Physician Yan's defense.

120
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,800
Murder.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,560
Master,

122
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,810
why are you here?

123
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,540
Kneel down!

124
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,360
When you entered the palace,

125
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,640
I never approved,

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,460
but you insisted on going,

127
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,810
thinking it would lead to a bright future.

128
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,280
Do you remember

129
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,280
what I told you then?

130
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,480
Master instructed us

131
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,610
to never forget our sisterhood

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,450
and maintain a healer's heart.

133
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,820
So what have you done instead?

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
Yan Jiehuan went back to the mountain,

135
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,960
brought you here,

136
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,640
and must have said many bad things about me.

137
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Master,

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,460
I don't understand

139
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
what I've done wrong.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,640
You don't even know your mistake!

141
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Then let me ask you,

142
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,360
when Huan was falsely accused of murder,

143
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
what did you do?

144
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
As her senior,

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,300
you failed to protect her,

146
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,000
watched her put herself in danger,

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
not only did you refuse to help,

148
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,960
but you spoke harshly to her.

149
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,480
What kind of senior sister are you?

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,280
In my life,

151
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,210
I've only taken two disciples,

152
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
treated you as my own children,

153
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,160
only hoping you would be safe

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
and happy.

155
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,450
But I never expected

156
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,640
that when you both

157
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,770
entered the palace,

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,360
you wouldn't support each other,

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,680
but instead would become rivals

160
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,400
and even sabotage one another.

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,159
Master.

162
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,300
Huan hasn't behaved well either.

163
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Stop pretending to be innocent!

164
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,400
Since I entered the palace,

165
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
you've been guarding against me,

166
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,640
afraid I'd steal your spotlight

167
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,040
and catch the nobles' attention.

168
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,640
You even went so far for your own glory

169
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,680
as to use Prince Jing

170
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
and General Huo.

171
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,680
You're absolutely!

172
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,800
Senior sister, what are you saying?

173
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
When have I ever used them?

174
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,680
Don't you know perfectly well what I mean?

175
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,120
You're just!

176
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,320
Yan'er, be quiet!

177
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,480
Huan is not that kind of person.

178
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,280
Master,

179
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,160
why do you always believe her

180
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,320
and not me?

181
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,000
Because Huan has always been loyal

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
and more sensible than you.

183
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,520
She...

184
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
Master, are you alright?

185
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,040
I haven't been feeling well lately

186
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm afraid my days are numbered.

187
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
This ancient medical manuscript

188
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,760
it's time to consider who should inherit it.

189
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I don't want it!

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
I just want you to be well, Master.

191
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
This book is the only one of its kind in the world.

192
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,720
Will Master really pass it on to her?

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,320
Is the Lingshan Taoist here?

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,480
The Empress requests your presence for a meeting.

195
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,280
Later, speak less and listen more,

196
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,409
learn from Huan'er,

197
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,400
and treat others with kindness.

198
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes.

199
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,600
In your eyes,

200
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm inferior to her in every way.

201
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,080
Your Highness,

202
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,210
the Taoist from Lingshan has arrived.

203
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
Master, it's not easy for you to come down from the mountain.

204
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
I've wanted to visit you for some time,

205
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,120
but palace affairs are complicated,

206
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,040
and I couldn't get away.

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

208
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,280
I should be the one visiting you.

209
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
This way, please.

210
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,620
It's quite rare

211
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,650
to have both of Master's disciples in the palace.

212
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,840
Please stay for a few more days during your visit.

213
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
If you need anything,

214
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
feel free to send someone to ask me.

215
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,280
Your Highness is so thoughtful,

216
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
but unfortunately my two disciples are disappointing,

217
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,720
always causing trouble.

218
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,680
Why hasn't Physician Yan come?

219
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Your Majesty,

220
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,400
my junior sister has been attending to Prince Jing

221
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
and hasn't left his side.

222
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,490
That's good.

223
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,400
The Prince hasn't fully recovered yet,

224
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,460
and needs someone to take care of him.

225
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,660
Junior sister, just you wait,

226
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,080
the Empress's possessions

227
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,560
are not something you can take away.
