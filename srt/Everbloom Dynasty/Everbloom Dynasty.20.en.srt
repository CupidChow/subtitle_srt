1
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,450
Once you've done it,

2
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,740
there's no escape.

3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,840
You can ask the Emperor to reopen the case,

4
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
but if it's discovered that it wasn't your mother,

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,880
but rather you who orchestrated it,

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,080
do you think the Emperor will ever trust you again?

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,960
How dare you speak to me like this,

8
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,760
don't you want to be with your cousin anymore?

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,090
Don't mention him to me.

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,960
Yes,

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,440
I do love him,

12
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,770
but I refuse to degrade myself.

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,240
My master scolded me before dying,

14
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
telling me to reflect on my actions.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,560
I will never do such things with you again.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,800
Your master?

17
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,440
Wasn't your master angered to death by you?

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,400
If you hadn't manipulated me

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,970
I wouldn't have been so blind as to turn against my master

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
You think it's not too late?

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,240
About the Five Elements Herb

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,970
I've already had a young eunuch cover it up for you

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,039
Don't do such brainless things again

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
As for that physician who knows

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,080
get rid of her

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,460
You want me to kill Chunyu Yan?

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,760
You know too much

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,760
Go join your master

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,240
You!

30
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,760
You framed Yan Jiehuan and now want to kill me

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,480
What a vicious heart!

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,120
Don't worry

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,530
That little junior sister of yours

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
will soon join you both

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,880
Yan Fei.

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,640
What are you doing?

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,200
Stop!

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,930
Miss Chunyu.

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,240
Miss Chunyu.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,290
Miss Chunyu.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,450
Miss Chunyu.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,380
I never thought

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
I would end up lying in your arms like this.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,079
I know

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,040
that I've never truly been in your heart.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
But it's alright.

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,720
I just

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
feared that

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,440
I would never see you again.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,010
Miss Chunyu.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,480
Help!

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,480
Miss,

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,890
are you alright?

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,280
Do you know?

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,040
Do you know how painful it is to give your heart to the wrong person?

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,570
Miss Chunyu,

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,840
I went too far last time,

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,680
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
What happened to her?

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Yan Xier did this.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,820
Go quickly and apply medicine to her wounds.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,320
The

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,720
formula for the life-saving pills.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,240
I found two ingredients

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
that I've tested

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,089
and can be used as medicine.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
I never intended to take the medical book,

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,920
I just wanted to look at it.

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,640
I never thought

70
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,440
this would anger Master to death.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
Miss Chunyu.

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,680
Senior Sister.

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,200
Senior Sister, I know you'll be fine, Senior Sister.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,260
I know everything.

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,520
You finally called me Senior Sister again.

76
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,000
Take good care of yourself from now on.

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,520
And also...

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,760
Senior Sister!

79
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Miss Chunyu, Senior Sister.

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,000
Miss Chunyu.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,860
Senior Sister.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,440
Miss Chunyu.

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,300
Senior Sister.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,860
Senior Sister.

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,020
Thank you for taking care of me all these years, Senior Sister.

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,020
Senior Sister.

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
Senior Sister.

88
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,400
Senior Sister.

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,600
Senior Sister.

90
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,480
Senior Sister.

91
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,320
Learn to please the Emperor,

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,800
keep him wrapped around your finger,

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,060
and use him for our Huo family's benefit.

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,680
What are you going to do?

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,560
What did you do to my senior sister?

96
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,820
I'll do the same to you.

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,920
Sister.

98
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,080
For our father's sake,

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
please don't kill me.

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,200
When father was alive, you took my place by his side,

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,000
fulfilling my filial duties.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I must avenge my senior sister.

103
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,770
I'm giving you these scissors.

104
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,760
Remember that you've used them to kill.

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,580
If you ever do it again,

106
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,010
I will show no mercy.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
You finally called me Senior Sister again.

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
That's enough for me.

109
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,400
Little Junior Sister, I'm going to join our master now.

110
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,840
From now on, you'll be alone in the palace.

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,890
Take good care of yourself.

112
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,260
Senior Sister.

113
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,610
I couldn't bring myself to harm Yan Xi'er.

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,400
I hope you can forgive me.

116
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
You're hurt.

117
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,000
With Yan Jie Huan's temperament,

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
if Huo Fang kills her now,

119
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,890
she will certainly reveal everything about Chun Yu Yan.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,450
It was just an accident.

121
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,720
I heard the Emperor hasn't eaten your desserts for days.

122
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,090
I suppose he's probably tired of them.

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,960
Find a way

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,200
to make him eat this.

125
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,659
When the time is right,

126
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,600
I will take you back to our mansion and restore your Huo family name.

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,160
Mother loved you her entire life,

128
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,490
yet you watched her die,

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,220
and you've only been using me.

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,680
If you want to be my father again,

131
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,560
it depends on whether I allow it.

132
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,140
You've been waiting here.

133
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,210
I don't know how to comfort you,

134
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,530
so I thought I'd just keep you company.

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,799
But now I don't have any family left.

136
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,919
But you still have me.

137
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,120
The Lantern Festival is coming up in a few days,

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,050
I'll take you there to cheer you up.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,320
Good medicine tastes bitter,

140
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,640
bitter first, then sweet.

141
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,240
If you don't believe me, Your Highness, try it.

142
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,340
It's too bitter. I won't drink it.

143
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,370
How about trying again?

144
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,520
Come,

145
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
take another sip.

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,840
Come, take another sip.

147
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,480
Your Majesty,

148
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,560
Eunuch Li has urgent matters to report to you.

149
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,400
Why so flustered?

150
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,280
What happened?

151
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,690
Your Majesty, the miscarriage was not caused by Doctor Yan.

152
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,040
Someone ordered me to frame him.

153
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,180
But Doctor Yan once saved my life,

154
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,240
and I cannot stand by

155
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
while he suffers this injustice.

156
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,120
Quickly, who was it?

157
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
That person is...

158
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,200
is...

159
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,280
Sister, come catch me!

160
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,300
Shi'er, slow down.

161
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,580
From what I can see,

162
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,280
she was truly wronged.

163
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,780
She was genuinely caring toward Shi'er.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,680
Shi'er's health has improved,

165
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,920
he doesn't need to take medicine anymore.

166
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,240
When you have time, take him out more often

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,640
to build up his strength.

168
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,440
I've heard about Physician Chunyu's situation.

169
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,280
The one-month deadline has arrived,

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,680
yet she has encountered such misfortune.

171
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
It's truly a pity.

172
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,920
From now on,

173
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,650
you shall remain at the Imperial Medical Bureau.

174
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,410
I obey your command.

175
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
Shi'er has been raised in the inner palace,

176
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,010
and I cannot easily go outside.

177
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,120
I hear you and the Prince are going to the Lantern Festival.

178
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Why not take Shi'er with you?

179
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,920
I want to see

180
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,300
the lantern festival.

181
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Alright.

182
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,170
Sister will take you

183
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,120
there.

184
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
I am the Empress.

185
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,380
The one I should really care about is Shi'er,

186
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,960
he is my only support.
