1
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Assassin!

2
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,640
Catch the assassin!

3
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,760
What's happening?

4
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,620
Don't touch it,

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,400
it's poisonous!

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Miss!

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,720
Miss!

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,280
You rushed me into the palace,

9
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,140
who exactly am I supposed to save?

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
You must save her.

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,000
Junior sister.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,330
So she's Yan Jiehuan, the eldest daughter of Historian Yan.

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,120
Why are you just standing there?

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,039
Save her now!

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,640
When the poison from the arrow tree enters the bloodstream,

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,960
the blood begins to coagulate.

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,490
Once the blood solidifies,

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,420
even the gods couldn't save them.

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,840
How did Junior Sister get poisoned?

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,140
Who did this to her?

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,320
I am responsible.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Your Majesty.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,840
I command you to use any means,

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,520
any remedy,

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,640
to save her life.

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,480
Only the Lone Tree herb can help.

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,320
However, this herb only grows around the arrow trees.

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,280
It looks like grass, hidden among grass,

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,000
those without medical knowledge can hardly identify it.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Then what should we do?

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,520
Taste it.

33
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,240
The herb has a sweet taste,

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
while regular grass tastes bitter.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,760
Let me try.

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,560
I'm sorry,

37
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,610
I already have someone in my heart.

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
In such a hurry,

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,880
could it be that you're worried about me?

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,680
How is she?

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,160
We must find this herb within three days,

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,180
or she won't survive much longer.

43
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
Your Majesty.

44
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
What is it?

45
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,140
Perhaps it's for the best,

46
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,920
getting rid of her would settle a grudge I've been harboring.

47
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,280
Uncle.

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,240
Xiaoqing, you may leave now.

49
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,159
Yes.

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Uncle.

51
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,920
Do you think you're clever?

52
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,600
Attempting to assassinate the Empress in broad daylight!

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Don't you realize if this gets exposed,

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,970
it will ruin everything I've planned.

55
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,360
If I become Empress,

56
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,240
wouldn't you benefit from it too, Uncle?

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,080
You're incompetent,

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,880
yet excellent at causing trouble.

59
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,140
The Empress isn't so easily eliminated.

60
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
If you dare act on your own again,

61
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,340
I'll flay both you and your mother alive.

62
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
Listen to me,

63
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,450
you must not let your guard down in the days ahead.

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,680
Lady Chunyu.

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,159
I found it.

66
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,840
How is that possible?

67
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,480
I tasted it. It was sweet.

68
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,420
This is just ordinary knotgrass,

69
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,240
slightly sweet, that's all.

70
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,440
That's right, this is it.

71
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,980
Junior Sister, you're awake.

72
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,920
I never thought you would care about her so much,

73
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,000
it really surprises me.

74
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,360
She saved my life,

75
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
I owe her a debt of gratitude.

76
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Is it really just gratitude,

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
or is it love?

78
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,920
For ten years, do you know that you've always been

79
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,320
the one in my heart whom I both love and hate,

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,100
the one I can never forget.

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,580
Ten years ago, I brought you misfortune,

82
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,170
and now I drink your poison.

83
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,250
Whether it's hatred

84
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
or love,

85
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,920
everything has changed.

86
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,760
Your Majesty,

87
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,160
after the new Emperor of North Yuán ascended the throne.

88
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,960
They repeatedly violate our borders

89
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,020
and have recently captured both Wusha and Yata cities.

90
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,960
I request Your Majesty to dispatch troops immediately

91
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,820
to demonstrate the might of our Great Jing Kingdom.

92
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,520
Your Majesty, Minister Chen speaks the truth.

93
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,280
Such a tiny nation dares to be so arrogant.

94
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,480
We must fight

95
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,450
to show the power of our Great Jing.

96
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,360
Your Majesty, our enemies remain determined to invade Great Jing,

97
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,600
our military must be strengthened.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,320
I believe the military budget should be increased.

99
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,280
Since I ascended the throne,

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,140
the military budget has been raised three times, and now you want another increase.

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,000
I know you still suspect me of killing our father,

102
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,000
but I assure you,

103
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,320
I had nothing to do with it.

104
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
Your Majesty.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,400
On my way back from Shu Prefecture, I found something special

106
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,290
that I'd like to share with you.

107
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,760
Your Majesty, this item is extremely rare,

108
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,640
there's only a small amount.

109
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,240
Please, enjoy it carefully.

110
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,480
Oh no!

111
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

112
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,280
I don't deserve such praise.

113
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,480
It truly is a pity.

114
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,520
By the way, Your Majesty, why did you summon me today?

115
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,680
Well,

116
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,600
when Father was alive,

117
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
he discovered irregularities in the military accounts.

118
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,060
He secretly sent people to investigate,

119
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
but unfortunately, those sent were either killed

120
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
or bribed.

121
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,520
Now that you've returned,

122
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,040
I wish

123
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,680
to entrust this matter to you.

124
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,800
Aren't you afraid I'll refuse?

125
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
You won't,

126
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
because you also don't want to see the kingdom of Da Jing

127
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,840
ruined in our hands.

128
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,200
Your Majesty, although the ministers have a point,

129
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,200
North Yuan is merely a tiny state

130
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,460
not worth mentioning.

131
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Moreover, Wusha and Yata are desert territories.

132
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
If we cut off their supplies,

133
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,980
the problem will resolve itself within months.

134
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,720
The most pressing issue now is the military camp situation.

135
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,160
The military accounts are in disarray,

136
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
military expenses keep increasing,

137
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
yet our forces continue to diminish.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
This matter requires a thorough investigation.
