1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,340
Senior Sister.

2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,970
Senior Sister, what's wrong with you?

3
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,440
What's wrong with you?

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,200
What were you two doing out so late?

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,720
Didn't you say you don't like him?

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,080
Senior Sister, don't misunderstand.

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,280
I was really just investigating about my father.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,480
Stop making excuses.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,480
I heard him say he likes you with my own ears.

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,620
Senior Sister,

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
you don't happen to like him, do you?

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,560
Whether I like him or not,

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,640
he cannot like you,

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,080
and you definitely cannot like him,

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,940
because you are my junior sister.

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Miss Yan, to be honest with you,

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,039
I like you.

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,640
So she entered the palace for revenge.

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,720
It's good that someone is helping her.

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,880
But why me?

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,320
Whether I like him or not,

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
he cannot like you,

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
and you certainly cannot like him,

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
because you are my junior disciple.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,000
I thought I was the only one in a bad mood,

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,680
but it seems you are too.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,600
I heard from the palace servants that

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,330
you used to be the Crown Prince,

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,250
but now you've become a prince.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,760
Does that bother you?

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,900
I haven't been back for ten years.

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,450
And now that I've returned,

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,140
I barely recognize the paths in the palace anymore.

34
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,210
Just like how I couldn't read people's hearts back then.

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
I was sent to the mountains when I was one,

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,650
and returned at seventeen,

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,520
but before my father and I could properly reunite,

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
we were already separated by death.

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,500
Years ago, my mother sacrificed herself

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,120
to protect me,

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
how is that any different from your father?

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
My father loved me,

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,600
otherwise he wouldn't have sent so many clothes up to the mountains.

44
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,120
A fallen prince

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,000
and a homeless young lady.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,640
How fitting,

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,120
how fitting.

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Fellow souls cast adrift in this world,

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,200
cheers.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,840
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,480
In your heart,

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,440
I am merely the Empress.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,280
From the day you married Liu Le,

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,440
we were destined to be ruler and subject,

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,280
nothing more.

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,240
What you say

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
is exactly what I think.

58
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
From now on,

59
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,680
no more letters,

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
no more intimacy.

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,760
I chose this path myself.

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
Having become the Empress of Dajing,

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,079
and the mother of Shi'er,

64
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,600
I will walk this path with dignity.

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,340
Dajing is fortunate to have an Empress like you,

66
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,360
indeed.

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,840
May you be well,

68
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,680
take care.

69
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
May Your Majesty be well,

70
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,080
take care.

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Please be seated, Your Majesty.

72
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,320
His Majesty is mindful of your hard work

73
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,960
and has sent these gifts especially for you.

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,920
The Empress doesn't look well,

75
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,640
something's troubling her.

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,240
Where did you go at midnight last night?

77
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,800
Look at these treasures,

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,610
I sent someone to deliver them last night,

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,120
but the eunuch said you weren't in the palace.

80
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,560
I was feeling distressed,

81
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,620
so I went for a walk.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,920
Chen.

83
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

84
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,960
Summon the imperial physician to examine the Empress thoroughly.

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,240
Just send for Physician Yan.

87
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,040
Very well.

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,260
Has Your Majesty been feeling irritable lately

89
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,300
with difficulty sleeping

90
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,720
and loss of appetite?

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,960
You're right.

92
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,520
Congratulations to the Empress,

93
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,980
and to Your Majesty. It's a pregnancy pulse.

94
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,980
Excellent! I shall have another prince.

95
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,159
Your Highness, after investigation,

96
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,320
this deficit is the worst in the history of the Great Jing Dynasty,

97
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,650
with military expenses alone exceeding one million taels.

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,200
The accounts are unclear,

99
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
the army's morale is unstable,

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,640
there have been no wars in recent years,

101
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,770
no troop increases,

102
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,480
so where has all this money gone?

103
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,280
I never expected the army would harbor such a greedy rat like you.

104
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,840
You're truly audacious.

105
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
This old servant admits his wrongdoing.

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
Since you admit your guilt,

107
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,480
then atone with your life.

108
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,320
Prime Minister, I shall atone with my life.

109
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,480
Prime Minister, you seem rather impatient.

110
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,480
What do you mean by that, Your Highness?

111
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm anxious for His Majesty

112
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,940
and for Great Jing's welfare.

113
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,290
Your Highness, something has happened to Imperial Physician Yan.

114
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,640
Physician Yan,

115
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
what exactly did you give me to drink?

116
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,320
What's going on with Physician Yan?

117
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,600
I...

118
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,120
I must protect this pregnancy

119
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,050
to give Shi'er a little brother

120
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,760
and make His Majesty happy.

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
Guards, take her away

122
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
and interrogate her thoroughly

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
until she confesses.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Your Majesty!

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
Your Majesty, there must be a misunderstanding

126
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
please release Physician Yan.

127
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
Careful investigation.

128
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,919
She killed my child,

129
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,130
and you want me to spare her?

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,000
During the previous epidemic in the city,

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,360
Physician Yan risked her own life

132
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,240
to save others,

133
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,179
rescuing thousands of citizens.

134
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Think about it,

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
would someone willing to sacrifice herself for strangers

136
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,840
harm the Empress who bestowed her title as royal physician?

137
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,920
She killed my prince!

138
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,400
Am I supposed to believe her

139
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
just because of your word, Brother?

140
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,760
The Emperor and I have longed for this child for so long.

141
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,280
It's because she caused the death of my child.

142
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Even if the Prince begs for mercy,

143
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
I will never agree.

144
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,600
If Your Majesty wants to prove your innocence,

145
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
then summon the Imperial Physician for an examination.

146
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,360
If anything unusual is found,

147
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,080
I request Your Majesty to sentence me to death.

148
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,080
Guards,

149
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
summon the Imperial Physician.

150
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,200
Yes, Your Majesty.
