1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,960
Senior Sister.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,240
Where were you yesterday?

3
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,600
Why did I wait for you at the palace gate for so long

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
and never saw you?

5
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,680
I was the one waiting for a long time without seeing you.

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,240
Then tell me, after we parted yesterday,

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
where did you go?

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,840
Senior Sister, in this palace, apart from Yan Xi'er,

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,320
you are my only family.

10
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,039
Please don't lie to me anymore.

11
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,840
I went to the rouge shop

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,080
to buy some rouge.

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
As for you, little junior sister,

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,600
you were gone all night.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,120
You should have been disciplined,

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,920
but since the Prince escorted you back,

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,080
even the Imperial Physician dares not say a word against you.

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,940
Senior Sister,

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,720
we've never kept any secrets from each other since we were little,

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,200
right?

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
Princess Yan is ill

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,330
and you're requested to treat her.

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,440
Perhaps you should go instead, senior.

24
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,220
Her Majesty wants both of you to go together.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
I'll go prepare.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,360
Oh, by the way,

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,220
Xiaoqing didn't get a chance to thank you last time.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,960
This is for you.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,680
Thank you, Miss.

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,280
There are some things I should tell you now.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,199
When I return after finishing my work,

32
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,259
I'll come find you.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,560
This medicine cannot be prepared inside the palace.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,720
I've prepared the prescription,

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,200
you'll need to brew it yourselves.

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,530
Then find a way to deliver it to the palace.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,610
Junior sister, you check Her Majesty's pulse first.

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,320
No, let her watch.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,280
You do it.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,560
This strong, vibrant pulse indicates pregnancy.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,480
Doctor Yan, come forward and check my pulse.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,530
If all is well, you may personally deliver the good news to His Majesty.

43
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,850
The pulse is strong,

44
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,320
but there's something unusual.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,720
It seems like pregnancy,

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,120
but also like you've experienced some kind of shock.

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,320
How dare you! Either it is

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
or it isn't.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
I can see you're nothing but a quack.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Your Highness is indeed with child.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,920
Is what you're saying true?

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,800
The news came from Yanfei Palace.

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,640
If the Emperor hadn't gone to the ceremony this morning,

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,040
the entire palace would know about it by now.

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,900
That does match her personality,

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,320
always making a big show of everything.

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,840
Your Highness.

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,760
My stomach...

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,480
Your Highness, what's wrong?

60
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,079
Someone come quickly!

61
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,680
Summon the royal physician!

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,330
Your Highness, the physician is here.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,320
It's you!

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,770
You're trying to harm me again!

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,720
Get out!

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,440
Your Highness, because of Consort Yan's pregnancy,

67
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,160
Doctor Chunyu has been attending to her in her palace,

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
and at the moment,

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,000
only Yan Jiehuan is available at the Imperial Medical Office.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,440
Whether Your Highness believes me or not,

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,300
I have never intended to harm you.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,480
You're suffering from dampness

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
spreading throughout your body.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,159
These pills will warm your womb and strengthen your spleen.

75
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,320
Take them for a few days and you'll recover.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,040
Why is my body in such condition?

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,280
You know best.

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,159
I will do my best to treat Your Highness's illness,

79
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,960
but I will never admit to something I haven't done.

80
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Do you know why I despise you?

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,240
Never mind.

82
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,800
I heard Yan Xier is with child.

83
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,780
I am but a humble physician

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,730
and dare not speak carelessly.

85
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,520
Are you covering up for your sister's lies,

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,680
or do you resent me for punishing you?

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,930
I wouldn't dare.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
About the previous incident,

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,280
didn't the Emperor already investigate it thoroughly?

90
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,840
If Prince Jing hadn't vouched for you with his life,

91
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,970
do you think the Emperor would have let you off so easily?

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,840
Huan'er.

93
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't worry too much.

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,880
It's just a temporary measure.

95
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,480
I won't lose my life that easily.

96
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,000
I already owe you too much.

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,080
I don't want to be in your debt anymore.

98
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,680
Don't risk your life for me again in the future.

99
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,760
I'm scared.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm truly afraid of losing you.

101
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,440
Rest assured.

102
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
I will always be here,

103
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,960
by your side,

104
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,410
protecting you.

105
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,160
We'll soon have leads on the Five Elements Herb matter.

106
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,840
The mastermind behind it will surely surface.

107
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
I've found out

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
that this matter might involve Medical Officer Chunyu.

109
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,740
If it really is her,

110
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,690
what will you do?

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,020
I don't believe it.

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,080
Doctors are compassionate by nature,

113
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,000
and this concerns the royal heir.

114
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
She wouldn't be so foolish.

115
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,120
Are you suggesting that I'm being foolish?

116
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,320
I wouldn't dare, Your Highness.

117
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,080
I mean we shouldn't be hasty.

118
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Haste makes waste.

119
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,650
You're not worried,

120
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,680
but others are already moving against you.

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,440
My master always taught us that patience brings success,

122
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
and a calm person finds peace.

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,440
Aren't we setting a trap for senior sister?

124
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,560
I noticed she couldn't contain herself,

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,820
acting suspiciously.

126
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,520
She'll definitely go to whoever is behind her.

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,340
Senior sister, please don't go in there,

128
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,240
please don't.

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,620
I don't want that person to be you.

130
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,200
Wait,

131
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,280
don't!

132
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,940
Your Highness.

133
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
Xiaoqing, didn't I tell you

134
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,580
not to let her in so easily?

135
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,800
His Majesty will become suspicious.

136
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,320
I didn't.

137
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,920
I came to tell you something.

138
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,050
Be quick and leave immediately after.

139
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,680
Yan Jiehuan knows who brought the Five Elements Herb into the palace.

140
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,400
What?

141
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,440
In the future,

142
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,920
please don't come to me for such matters.

143
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,520
Also, you must let His Majesty know about the pregnancy soon,

144
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,020
or once the medicine wears off, you won't be able to hide it.

145
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,160
Xiaoqing, did you hear anything?

146
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
No.

147
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,840
I hope you make arrangements soon.

148
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,570
I'm leaving.

149
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,820
Junior sister.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,120
Yan Jiehuan, you trespassed into the imperial harem,

151
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,280
do you know your crime?

152
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,440
Yan Xier, you poisoned the Empress,

153
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,700
do you know your crime?

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,920
Do you have any evidence?

155
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,280
I heard everything you just said.

156
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,600
Too bad it's too late.

157
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,760
Since you've come in,

158
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
don't expect to leave again.

159
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,680
Xiaoqing, arrest her for me.

160
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
What are you standing there for?

161
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,240
You're too insolent.

162
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,480
I am the imperial physician appointed by the Emperor himself.

163
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
Those who kill court officials forfeit their lives.

164
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
Besides, I have evidence of you killing your father.

165
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
What is this?

166
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Has anyone bought monkshood from you in the past year?

167
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,360
Yes, it was the Wang family.

168
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,880
This is where the monkshood in your box came from,

169
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,720
and they were used to poison my father.

170
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,720
You're talking nonsense!

171
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,280
I'm going to tell the Emperor

172
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,560
and file an imperial complaint.

173
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,760
I'll make you mother and daughter join my father in death.

174
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Yan Jiehuan, I...

175
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,160
Xiaoqing.

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,840
Yan Jiehuan, I'll kill you!
