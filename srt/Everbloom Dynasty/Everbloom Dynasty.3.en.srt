1
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,260
This junior sister is so foolish,

2
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,760
risking herself to cure the plague

3
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,160
by willingly exposing herself to infection.

4
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,280
What if she never wakes up?

5
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,200
She's had a natural talent for medicine since childhood

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,160
and a kind heart.

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,020
I believe heaven protects the virtuous.

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,520
When will this medicine finally be developed?

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,960
I don't know if she can do it or not.

10
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,240
Master!

11
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,640
Master!

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,720
Master, junior sister is awake!

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
Her fever has really broken!

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,200
Master, it seems our prescription is working.

15
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,360
Will this work?

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,759
Exactly,

17
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,160
even doctors can't help.

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,210
The medicine they made,

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,610
I don't dare to drink it.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Don't worry,

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,440
this is medicine I've tested myself.

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,320
I'm already better,

23
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,120
so you'll definitely get better too.

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
That's right. Junior Sister risked

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
her life to save you all,

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,480
and you still don't believe her?

27
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
After drinking it, I really feel much lighter.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,120
My wife is much better after taking yours,

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,200
please give me another bowl.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,800
Does it really work?

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,360
It works.

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,290
It really works.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,370
I'll take a bowl.

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
Give me a bowl.

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,690
We spent all our money on medicine,

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,600
but there are more and more sick people.

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
What should we do?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
It seems this medicine is truly effective.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,890
I have a sick person at home,

40
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,800
would you mind

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
coming to take a look?

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
You again.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,900
Wang whatever,

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,690
you're still alive.

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Take the medicine twice a day,

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,920
and you'll recover after finishing it.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,079
Get some rest.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,200
I've been wanting to explain to you

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,880
that day was actually a misunderstanding,

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,140
they were all after me.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,280
Blood on the blade,

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
murder in the eyes,

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,040
even if not a villain,

54
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,840
there must be hatred in the heart.

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,240
I think you've really misunderstood.

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,200
Why am I in front of her

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,560
stumbling over my words?

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,720
You have time to explain,

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,920
but I don't have time to listen.

60
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,760
We're almost out of medicinal herbs,

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I've spent all my master's savings,

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,400
and I don't know where to get money for tomorrow's medicine.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I have a solution.

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
Right now, only if the prefecture provides funds to purchase medicine

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,580
can Chang'an remain safe.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,080
Since when do officials pay

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,200
to treat common people's illnesses?

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,340
This year's taxes haven't even been collected yet!

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,740
Sir, if you ignore this situation

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,560
and let the epidemic spread,

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,860
forget about tax collection,

72
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,620
you'll lose half the city's population.

73
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,440
The water that bears the boat can also sink it.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,900
It can also capsize a boat.

75
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,680
I'll see to it right away, Your Excellency.

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Mother,

77
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,120
I heard the plague has been brought under control,

78
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,560
thanks to a convicted person who volunteered to test the medicine.

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,200
Then she has indeed made a significant contribution.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,520
She should be rewarded.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,120
What reward do you think she deserves, my son?

82
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Father's coronation ceremony is in three days,

83
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,760
I wish to ask Father

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,880
to grant amnesty to all prisoners as part of the celebration.

85
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,960
You have a kind heart, my son.

86
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,420
Your father will surely grant your request.

87
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,600
These medicines are really effective.

88
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,400
Everyone is feeling much better,

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
and hardly coughing anymore.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
The only illness in this world that can't be cured is a troubled heart,

91
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,560
everything else can be treated.

92
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,570
You're still quite a unique woman.

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,850
What did you say?

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
I said you're still...

95
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,960
The new emperor has ascended the throne,

96
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
granting amnesty throughout the land,

97
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,920
all offenders may be pardoned.

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
This is the benevolence of our new ruler,

99
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
give thanks for this mercy.

100
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,560
Long live the Emperor! Long live the Great Jing!

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,040
Little junior sister, that's wonderful!

102
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
You're finally free,

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,500
no more suffering for you.

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,930
The Emperor is truly merciful.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,660
The Strategies of the Warring States claims that a skilled tongue

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,290
is more powerful than a million soldiers,

107
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,850
and one person's eloquence

108
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,120
outweighs the words of nine sacred cauldrons.

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
What do you think?

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,120
I disagree,

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,560
throughout history, there have been eloquent sages,

112
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,600
wise men with silver tongues,

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,360
but what became of them in the end?

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,560
Therefore, I believe

115
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,780
a true leader must stand above even the mightiest army.

116
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,680
Well said. A strong army requires a strong nation.

117
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,320
To become a good emperor in the future,

118
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,560
you must govern diligently and love your people,

119
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,820
only then can you become truly powerful.

120
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,400
My son,

121
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,960
this kingdom of Dajing

122
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,440
you must shoulder this responsibility for me.

123
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,340
This person is so strange.

124
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,680
Huan.

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Chang'an City is not suitable for you,

126
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,640
neither is the Yan household.

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,120
Come back to the mountains with your master.

128
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,640
No.

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,320
I want to stay,

130
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
I must stay.

131
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,840
Long live Your Majesty!

132
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,240
Rise, my ministers.

133
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,920
Brother, could he be back to seize the throne?

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,039
For seventeen years,

136
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,700
I've been longing to be reunited with my father.

137
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,460
Little did I expect

138
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,340
that after meeting him just once,

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,120
he would leave me so soon.

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,360
All these years,

141
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,640
I've thought of you constantly.

142
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,840
Father.

143
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,780
What about you?

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
Did you ever think of me?

145
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,440
Father.

146
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,280
I will find out who killed you.

147
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,650
When that day comes, I will kill your enemy with my own hands.

148
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,200
I will bring you justice,

149
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,480
and clear my name.
