1
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,180
You've been poisoned indeed.

2
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,740
What are you doing?

3
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,920
Where am I?

4
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,480
You've been severely poisoned.

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,600
But fortunately,

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,080
Before the poison penetrates your intestines,

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,480
you met me.

8
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
otherwise, once it reaches your stomach

9
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,580
and perforates your intestines,

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,440
you'd be dead.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,600
Answer me two questions.

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,680
What did you eat tonight?

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Do you have any enemies in the palace?

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Food

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,560
enemies.

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,160
Greetings, Your Highness.

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,880
The Empress

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,520
has specially sent me to bring you your favorite rose cakes,

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,759
please do try them.

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,210
That's impossible.

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
They say entering the palace is like diving into a deep sea,

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,080
but I find it more like stepping into desolation.

23
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,680
Because no one is truly sincere.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,570
Go ahead.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
You saved me.

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,600
How would you like me to repay you?

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,120
Hey, I helped you because

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,500
of our friendship.

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,840
After all, we're old friends.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,370
By the way, how did you get into the palace?

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,940
That's not important.

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,320
Speaking of which,

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,450
why were those two guards chasing you?

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,840
It's nothing.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,340
Just a misunderstanding.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,040
This poison of yours

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
requires acupuncture treatment for three consecutive days.

38
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,240
I'll wait for you here at this time every night.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,000
How could you let her

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,480
sneak in here? What were you thinking?

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,240
Now she's gone

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
and nowhere to be found.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
You're completely useless.

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,680
His Majesty the Emperor arrives!

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,640
Why are you just standing there?

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,770
Apply my makeup now.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,160
My niece is intelligent

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,480
and beautiful,

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,580
she will surely please Your Majesty.

50
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,960
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,680
It's getting late,

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,400
I should be going.

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,200
Wait.

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,880
Are you just going out like this

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,200
without fear of being discovered?

56
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,280
I know a path

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
that can help us avoid their pursuit.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
You saved me,

59
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
so I'll take you back.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Thank you, then.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,240
When your hair grows down to your waist,

62
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,120
when I achieve fame and success,

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,540
we will surely walk together in Chang'an

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,900
and share in its splendor.

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
No matter who you really are,

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,880
you are my only husband.

67
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,580
Your Highness.

68
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,300
This prince has just returned and already found a new love.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,330
How easily an old friend's heart changes.

70
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,850
They say a familiar heart changes easily.

71
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,090
It's been ten years.

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
He has changed.

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,560
And so have I.

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,760
How dare you come back?

75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
Yan Fei will kill you.

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,800
Did she hit you again?

77
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,440
The Emperor is indeed still captivated by my beauty.

78
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,240
Once I completely win his heart,

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,540
the position of Empress will be mine.

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Someone come and do my makeup!

81
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Why are you just standing there?

82
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,920
It's you!

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Xiaoqing.

84
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Go ahead, scream!

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,360
Cry out!

86
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,800
Perfect timing to call the Emperor over to see

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
how this item left the palace,

88
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,880
then made its way into the Yan residence,

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,320
and even caused my father's death.

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,650
How dare you slander me,

91
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,200
His Majesty will never believe you.

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,720
Even if he doesn't believe me,

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,980
he'll still doubt you.

94
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,040
Who do you think would keep someone with murderous intentions

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,360
as their bedmate?

96
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,520
Your favor and becoming Empress

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
is nothing but a pipe dream.

98
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,760
You've been eavesdropping on me!

99
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,080
Weren't you about to call someone?

100
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,940
Let me help you.

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,800
Guards!

102
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
We're supposed to be sisters.

103
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,160
If I fall,

104
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,360
the Yan family will be finished.

105
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,200
What are you after?

106
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,680
Fine. I'll ask, you answer.

107
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,490
What do you want to know?

108
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,400
Aconite is something

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,160
that must be administered over many years

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,280
before it causes poisoning

111
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,410
that leads to death.

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,920
When did you start giving it to Father?

113
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,000
For how long?

114
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
He says his leg hurts.

115
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
This medicine specifically treats rheumatism.

116
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,960
You've studied medicine,

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,200
how could you not know?

118
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,400
It's precisely because I know

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,040
that I came to the palace to ask you.

120
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,159
If this medicine is taken in excess, it will cause poisoning.

121
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,440
I really don't know.

122
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,100
Then why do you have so much aconite in your room?

123
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,000
Your Highness, the Emperor wishes to have breakfast with you.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,200
Damn it, why didn't you tell me earlier?

125
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
Your Highness.

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,960
Your Highness.

127
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,000
Are you alright?

128
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,320
Looking like this, how can I face the Emperor?

129
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
Then we'll have to tell the Emperor

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
that Lady Yan won't be able to make it.

131
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,120
You.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,960
If she really is the young lady of the Yan family,

133
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,160
that wouldn't be bad.

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
You're much better today.

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,760
One more treatment tomorrow and you'll be fine.

136
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,560
Thank you.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,120
Come to think of it, I still don't know your true identity.

138
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,280
Who are you really?

139
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,640
I am

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,880
just a guard.

141
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,919
A mere guard who scares away a group of guards,

142
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,419
a guard important enough for someone to specifically poison you.

143
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,720
Fine then.

144
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,680
Since you don't want to tell the truth,

145
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,080
I guess you don't consider me a real friend.

146
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,650
Let's go.

147
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Actually, I'm...

148
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,300
What are you doing?

149
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

150
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,340
Paying respects to Your Majesty.

151
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,800
You again.

152
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,650
A mere palace servant daring to reach above her station?

153
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
Your Majesty,

154
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,780
striking a servant

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
is beneath your dignity.

156
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,200
Miss Yan, you may leave now.

157
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,640
You dare protect her.

158
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,280
Why?

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,720
I should be the one asking

160
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
why you poisoned me.

161
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,640
Do you know

162
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,280
you were the only person in this palace

163
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,000
I trusted?

164
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,000
I would have given up the throne for you.

165
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,610
Perhaps I should never have returned.

166
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,920
I came back only to ask

167
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,360
why you've become so vicious since becoming empress.
