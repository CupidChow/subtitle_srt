1
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,560
First, you disregarded the bond between father and son,

2
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,840
harmed the Emperor,

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,520
then ignored our brotherhood,

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,450
and forced me into a deadly corner.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
I will avenge Father Emperor

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,480
and Wan'er.

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,920
Prime Minister,

8
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,440
you've come at the perfect time!

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Quickly, save me!

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,039
Fool!

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,240
He's here to kill you.

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,280
I didn't expect the Liu family would have someone clever.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,600
Chop these two into minced meat.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,320
Huo Fang,

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,080
do you intend to kill even me?

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,320
You worthless scum!

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,210
You're merely a pawn in my game,

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,000
you could even murder your own father,

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,530
what face do you have to sit on this throne?

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
I understand now.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,680
So all this time you were just pretending to be submissive before me,

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,120
everything you did was false,

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,120
and I was merely your puppet.

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,039
I've been meticulously planning for years,

25
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,280
all for this very day.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,520
Rest assured,

27
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,039
after I take the throne,

28
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,720
I will certainly grant you a posthumous title,

29
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,850
Ruler of the Nation.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
Huo Fang,

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,080
your ambition is truly vicious.

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,840
First you killed the Emperor,

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,760
and now you want to kill His Majesty.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,400
Aren't you afraid of becoming the laughingstock of the world?

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,000
Nonsense.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,920
Brother.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Your life belongs to the Liu family,

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,800
and if you must die, it will be by my hand.

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,400
So the lives of you Liu family members are worth something,

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,660
but my Huo family's lives are worthless?

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,000
I will seek justice for the Huo family.

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,720
Huo Fang,

43
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,640
how dare you!

44
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,040
You traitor,

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,680
you dare to deceive me

46
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,880
and covet the throne of Dajing!

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,560
I will kill you!

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,079
Your Majesty!

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,280
Brother!

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,480
Your Majesty!

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,480
Stop!

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,240
Brother!

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,720
This is all my fault,

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
my retribution.

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,600
I leave Dajing and Shi'er in your hands, brother.

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,280
Everyone get out!

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
Step back!

58
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,280
Yu J

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
You've come at the perfect time,

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,000
kill Liu An,

61
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,640
and the empire will belong to our Huo family.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,840
Don't worry about me.

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,280
Huo Yu,

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
I know you've always been loyal.

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,280
Today, Huo Fang killed Liu Le

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,700
in an attempt to rebel.

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,170
If you want to ally with him, come at me.

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,560
I'll fight to the death with him if I have to.

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,160
Father,

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,520
is what the prince said true?

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,200
Indeed,

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,080
I killed Liu Le.

73
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,530
The late emperor

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,620
was also eliminated by my scheme.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,320
I have been waiting for this day

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,640
for decades.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,930
I did all this

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,180
for the Huo family,

79
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,500
and for you too.

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,620
Seize them.

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,840
Father,

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,700
you've lost your mind!

83
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
When I was little, didn't you teach me

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
to be loyal to the emperor and protect the country,

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,880
and also to—

86
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,410
Silence!

87
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,480
What an unfilial son!

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,170
I, Huo Fang, have been wise all my life,

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,480
yet I gave birth to such a useless creature.

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,610
Have you forgotten?

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,530
How your grandfather died?

92
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,680
And your uncle,

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
and your other uncle.

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,280
Don't you want to avenge them?

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,120
Do it.

96
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,380
Your Highness.

97
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,040
The rebels have been completely eliminated.

98
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
The palace is now under our control.

99
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,250
What are you smiling at?

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,560
Liu An,

101
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,880
I never expected that you, a mere concubine's son,

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,010
would possess such cunning strategy.

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,090
Huo Fang,

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,960
you have nowhere to run now.

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
Won't you confess to your crimes?

106
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I've maneuvered through court politics for decades,

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,660
do you really think

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,660
I wouldn't leave myself an escape route?

109
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,240
Bring her out.

110
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,159
Miss Yan.

111
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,440
Liu An,

112
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,000
surprised?

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,740
What do you have to say now?

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,159
Huo Fang,

115
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,360
you're truly despicable.

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,120
If you have a problem with me, come at me,

117
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,280
why target a woman?

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,240
You think I don't know

119
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,120
that this woman means more to you

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,520
than your own life?

121
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Your Highness, don't mind me,

122
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,800
kill him!

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,640
Release our Prime Minister!

124
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,520
Huo Fang,

125
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,600
let her go

126
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,320
and I'll spare your life.

127
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,080
Do you think I'm a three-year-old child?

128
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,930
If I release her now,

129
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,290
and once she's safe,

130
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,440
what if you go back on your word?

131
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,900
What could I do to you then?

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,360
All right.

133
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,120
Huo Fang,

134
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
if you promise not to harm her,

135
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,680
I swear by the Great Jing Dynasty

136
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,760
to let you leave Chang'an alive.

137
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,320
A life for a life.

138
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
I believe you.

139
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Are you all right?

140
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,940
Your Highness.

141
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,700
Your Highness,

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,620
Your Highness.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Your Highness.

144
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,740
Your Highness.

145
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,340
Your Highness.

146
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,440
It's been over two weeks now,

147
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,440
Your Highness remains unconscious,

148
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,370
and there are many rumors outside.

149
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
What are they saying?

150
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,700
They're saying

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
the Emperor is gone,

152
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,920
and Your Highness is also...

153
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,050
that the Great Jin has no ruler.

154
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,900
Is the Prince feeling better?

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,560
Who says Dajing has no one left?

156
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,160
We still have Shi'er here, don't we?

157
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,720
Shi'er,

158
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,880
tell me,

159
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,760
when will the Prince wake up?

160
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,690
He'll wake up tomorrow.

161
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
Children's words are prophetic.

162
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,850
Shi'er is right,

163
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,440
he will wake up tomorrow.

164
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,760
Doctor Yan seems quite carefree,

165
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,960
smiling all day long.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
Someone who doesn't know better

167
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,280
might think nothing's wrong with the Prince.

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,810
A day passes whether you cry

169
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,400
or laugh through it,

170
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,580
so why not choose to smile?

171
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,360
Besides, when others see you happy,

172
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,160
they'll feel happy too.

173
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,120
Doctor Yan,

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
may I ask you something?

175
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,380
Don't take this the wrong way,

176
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
but if the Prince never wakes up,

177
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,760
will you keep waiting for him?

178
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,840
Even if our paths

179
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,020
diverge in this world,

180
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,800
I will still wait

181
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,520
for the day we meet again.

182
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,840
Besides,

183
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,720
aren't we together every day now?

184
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,560
Fortunately, the sword missed your heart by an inch.

185
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,890
Heaven has blessed you.

186
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,020
I will surely protect you until you wake up soon.

187
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
You need to hurry.

188
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,480
Take it slow.

189
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,960
You're awake.

190
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,250
Thank goodness.

191
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,720
At last, I've finally

192
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,360
waited for you.

193
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
In this lifetime,

194
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,440
having you brings me joy.

195
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,800
Everyone,

196
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
the Great Jing from now on

197
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,170
will be in your hands and Shi'er's.

198
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,690
Then where will you go, Prince?

199
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,170
Wherever she is,

200
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,440
that's where I'll be.

201
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,720
Walking hand in hand for the rest of our lives,

202
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,120
this lifetime is enough.

203
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,640
Different paths in life,

204
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,360
yet with you, there is joy.
