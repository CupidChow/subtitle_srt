1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
Juanyu.

2
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,520
Yan Jiehuan, I'll kill you!

3
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,600
Xiaoqing, let me stop your bleeding.

4
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,960
Xiaoqing!

5
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,720
I saw with my own eyes

6
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,400
that the lady put poison

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,080
in the soup you made.

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,520
You're talking nonsense!

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,440
Xiaoqing!

10
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,280
Yan Xi'er, how vicious you are!

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,800
His Majesty the Emperor arrives!

12
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,340
My beloved concubine.

13
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,479
Are you feeling better?

14
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,240
Your Majesty!

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,560
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,479
Save me! Doctor Yan has gone mad,

17
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,759
she came in and started killing everyone,

18
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,520
and she even stabbed Xiaoqing to death!

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,440
Doctor Yan!

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,280
How dare you!

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,090
What do you think you're doing?

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,520
Guards!

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,400
Seize her!

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,400
Your Highness.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,039
According to the information provided by Eunuch Liu,

26
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,770
we have news about that person.

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,620
Where is he?

28
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,160
He's in Chang'an City,

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,490
but we haven't located his residence yet.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,079
I heard that person enjoys lively gatherings.

31
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,120
The Lantern Festival is the day after tomorrow,

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,040
perhaps he'll be there.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,900
Your Highness.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,560
Your Highness, something terrible has happened!

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,960
Doctor Yan is in trouble.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,960
Doctor Yan, I have treated you well.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,280
Why did you harm Consort Yan?

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,240
Do you know she was carrying a royal heir?

39
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Your Majesty,

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,920
it was Yan Xier who killed Xiaoqing.

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,520
There is a witness to this case.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Who?

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,320
Your Majesty, the witness has arrived.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,680
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,280
I was indeed at the scene.

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,090
However, I only took Her Majesty's pulse.

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
Then I left.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,660
Senior sister.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,360
Little junior sister, I'm sorry.

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm only saying what I saw.

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,480
I cannot lie before the Emperor.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Your Majesty, you must give me justice!

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,640
Your Majesty,

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,680
doctors are compassionate by nature.

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,640
I believe Physician Yan would never commit murder,

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,400
especially since she and Xiaoqing were on good terms.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you have anything else to say?

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Since Physician Chunyu claims

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,290
that you took Consort Yan's pulse,

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,920
I humbly dare to ask Physician Chunyu,

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,920
was Consort Yan truly pregnant?

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
That medicine has a lasting effect,

63
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,400
it shouldn't be detected.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Your Majesty,

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,960
when I first examined her,

66
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
the consort's pulse was strong and vigorous,

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,079
definitely indicating pregnancy.

68
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,540
Then may I ask Consort Yan,

69
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,020
do you dare to let the Imperial Physician come examine you?

70
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,660
Let him examine me,

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm not afraid of you.

72
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,200
Judging by their demeanor,

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
the medicine's effect hasn't worn off yet.

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,500
We must find a way to buy some time.

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Your Majesty!

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,560
It's dark and the way is long.

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
There are too many winding paths in the palace,

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,560
and the Imperial Physician is quite elderly.

79
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,520
I fear he might get lost in some corridor and be unable to find his way out.

80
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,040
I humbly request

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,760
Prince Jing

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,240
to go and escort him here.

83
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,370
I'll go fetch the Imperial Physician right away.

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,340
Your Highness,

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,740
what's wrong with you?

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,520
Imperial Physician, I meant to come out to greet you,

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,800
but I suddenly felt unwell in my stomach.

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,440
Let me take a look right away.

89
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,960
Come.

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,800
Please take your time.

91
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
Yan Xier,

92
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,400
for my father,

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,520
for Xiaoqing,

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,730
I will not let you pass this hurdle.

95
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,460
Where is the Imperial Physician? Why isn't he here yet?

96
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,720
Your Majesty, the Imperial Physician has arrived.

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,760
Your Majesty, I apologize for my late arrival.

98
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,820
Please forgive me.

99
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,560
Quickly, check my pulse.

100
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,260
Let me wash my hands first.

101
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,720
Hurry up, will you?

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,120
Quickly, tell His Majesty

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,520
if I am with child.

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,570
By this hour, the medicine's effect has likely worn off.

105
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,760
Yes, Imperial Physician,

106
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,490
speak up now.

107
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Your Majesty,

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,680
the Consort is not pregnant,

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,980
it's merely a common pulse disorder.

110
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,000
What did you say?

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,260
I am certainly with child.

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,200
Just days ago,

113
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,060
Physician Chunyu personally examined me himself.

114
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,760
Royal Physician Chunyu, I ask you once more

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,400
is Consort Yan with child?

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,800
I...

117
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,280
Sister.

118
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
You conspired with Yan Xi'er

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,800
you should have expected this outcome.

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,200
How dare you deceive me!

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,880
Guards

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,440
take Physician Chunyu and Consort Yan away.

123
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

124
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,800
Your Majesty!

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,360
Move.

126
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Your Majesty!

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Xiaoqing.

128
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Thank you.

129
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,880
I bought you an identical hairpin.

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
I hope when you get there,

131
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,680
someone will cherish you just the same.

132
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,420
Someone will love you.

133
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,920
Your thoughtfulness

134
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
will surely reach Xiaoqing.

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
But right now, the most important thing

136
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,520
is to clear your name.

137
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,840
Although the Emperor won't investigate Consort Yan's feigned illness,

138
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,100
we must still seek justice for Xiaoqing.

139
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,970
Thank you too

140
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,160
for always encouraging me

141
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,620
and helping me.

142
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,140
I dare not imagine.

143
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,760
Without you,

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,120
alone in this vast palace,

145
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,410
how desolate I would be.

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,280
Why am I always one step too late?

147
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,440
Yan Jiehuan.

148
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,000
Huan, please save Xier,

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,770
she's your biological sister.

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,480
If you want your jade pendant back,

151
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,210
you must agree to my condition.

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
She killed the master.

153
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,770
Biological sister.

154
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,360
Has she ever treated me as her sister?

155
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,130
Have you ever treated me as your daughter?

156
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
This is your birth mother's jade pendant.

157
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm returning it to you,

158
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,660
so please give Xi'er back to me, will you?

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,640
You used this very pendant to blackmail me back then,

160
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,000
preventing me from reuniting with my father,

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,320
until he died,

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,720
and I never had the chance to call him father even once.

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
Now your daughter has made a grave mistake,

164
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,040
and you simply say 'give her back to me'?

165
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,960
Can you bring my father back to me?

166
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,880
I know it's all my fault,

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Xi'er has nothing to do with this.

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,320
The Emperor only believes what you say now.

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,200
If you just say the diagnosis was correct,

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,360
even if it wasn't,

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
Xi'er will be safe.

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,880
She's my only daughter.

173
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,640
I'm begging you,

174
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
please help me, will you?

175
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
I only have one father too.

176
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,280
When I wanted to reveal myself to him,

177
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,409
you wouldn't let me.

178
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,450
How can you be so heartless?

179
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,320
I'll confess. Even if it costs me my life.

180
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,360
Huan'er, if I die,

181
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,760
can you help Xi'er?

182
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,600
We all make our own paths in life.

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,640
If she doesn't choose to be good,

184
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,840
how can I help her?

185
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,760
So you refuse to help?

186
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
The crime of deceiving the Emperor

187
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,960
is for His Majesty to judge.

188
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,920
If Xi'er dies,

189
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,640
you won't live either.

190
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,560
Aunt!

191
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,020
So you've been doing all these shameful things with Xi'er.

192
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,520
If you dare harm Huan'er,

193
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,860
I will never let you leave here alive.

194
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,960
Guards!

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
Take this madwoman to prison

196
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
and await my orders.
