00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,940
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,060
Hey.

4
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,000
Why are you all speaking in riddles?

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,080
What's going on?

6
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,370
It's very possible

7
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,650
that Li Lun is not dead.

8
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,930
What?

9
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,290
When Li Lun died,

10
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,060
did you see his inner core?

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,690
No.

12
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,990
We thought at the time that his inner core

13
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,430
had been burned to ashes by the Ever-Burning Wood.

14
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,230
There!

15
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,919
Li Lun has the ability to possess living beings.

16
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,450
He must have placed his inner core

17
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,880
inside someone at the scene

18
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,260
before he died.

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,780
Thus, as his soul was scattering

20
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,550
when he was burned by the Ever-Burning Wood,

21
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,680
he had already possessed that person.

22
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,070
A life without death.

23
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,940
You will kill him one day.

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,600
Kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

25
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,579
It's Zhuo.

26
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,310
Li Lun must have possessed Zhuo

27
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,550
at that moment.

28
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,340
So now, Mr. Zhuo...

29
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,670
is Li Lun.

30
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,250
Let's go.

31
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,230
Otherwise,

32
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,690
Li Lun will kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

33
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,240
Let's go.

34
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,050
I brought wine.

35
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,250
But it seems like

36
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
you won't be able to drink it.

37
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,430
I once swore

38
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,840
that I would

39
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,750
personally settle the debt between us.

40
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,320
The journey we walked together,

41
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,650
with all its past events,

42
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,950
made me feel

43
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,910
that maybe

44
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,730
oaths can be broken

45
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,280
and fate can be changed.

46
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,430
But...

47
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,870
this day...

48
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,080
has ultimately come.

49
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,170
Like a book

50
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,980
with its ending already written,

51
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,170
no matter how many times I read it,

52
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,370
the ending

53
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,670
is always the same.

54
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,990
Great Demon, are you alright?

55
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,580
Li Lun has already made his move.

56
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,150
Then let's go quickly.

57
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,700
Wait!

58
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,050
Let's repair the Baize Token first.

59
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,780
Otherwise, even if we arrive in time,

60
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,630
we won't be able to wake Zhao Yuanzhou.

61
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,270
Yes.

62
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,610

Jiu!

73
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,880
Let's fight together.

74
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,350
One person for each,

75
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,970
and we'll find its weakness.

76
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,690
The one with Ying Lei is fake.

77
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
The one with the kitchen knife is the real Ying Lei.

78
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,930
What?

79
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,980
Don't mess around!

80
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,170
He took my kitchen knife!

81
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,950
Don't do anything reckless!

82
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,520
Huh?

83
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,700
Don't believe him!

84
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,010
Ao Yin is full of tricks

85
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,170
and can continuously change its shape,

86
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,000
making it hard to distinguish.

87
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,590
Don't worry about me.

88
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,250
I'll handle it myself!

89
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,780
We'll handle it ourselves!

90
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,660
Jiu?

91
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,510
Jiu, be careful.

92
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,810
Open the door!

93
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,090
Open the door...

94
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,040
Brother Zhuo!

95
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,750
Brother Zhuo, save me!

96
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,820
Brother Zhuo!

97
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,200
Brother Zhuo!

98
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,270
You...

99
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,910
You're not Bai Jiu.

100
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,260
You are Li Lun.

101
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,420
I'm so disappointed.

102
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,010
It's only now

103
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,730
that you've figured it out.

104
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,880
Darn it.

105
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,350
We were tricked by you.

106
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,770
When did you do it?

107
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,360
I had already placed my inner core

108
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,650
inside Bai Jiu's body in the illusion

109
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,060
of the Demon Hunting Bureau,

110
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,820
preparing to possess him at any time.

111
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,830
So, I've underestimated you.

112
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,350
But...

113
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,590
this is indeed a great gift.

114
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,020
I just possessed him,

115
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,700
so my power is weak,

116
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,760
and I haven't fully controlled this body.

117
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,870
Therefore,

118
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,030
during this time,

119
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,330
I can only come out and act

120
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,220
when he's asleep at night.

121
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,170
Even so,

122
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,290
it was enough

123
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,610
for you to take on Wen Xiao's appearance

124
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,640
and kill the Prime Minister.

125
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,620
I'd like to see,

126
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,630
with her being wanted throughout the city,

127
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,800
if she still has time to find the Divine Wood.

128
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,140
Yes.

129
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,240
So,

130
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,620
just now, Ao Yin deliberately knocked out Jiu

131
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,020
to let you out and control the situation?

132
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,860
That's right.

133
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,870
Otherwise,

134
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,160
how could I stop you?

135
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,280
You deceived Mr. Zhuo,

136
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,090
using him to kill.

137
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,280
What exactly do you plan to do to Great Demon?

138
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,270
Mr. Zhuo,

139
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,280
this is the Soul Trapping Needle

140
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,500
that I've been developing for a long time

141
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,470
and have finally created.

142
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,470
It's a suspended animation decoction

143
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,430
made from Death Ginseng

144
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,380
and Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

145
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,410
Why did you

146
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,290
suddenly start developing this?

147
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,510
I just wanted to

148
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,400
make up for the harm I caused everyone.

149
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,510
You don't need to feel guilty.

150
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,450
It was not your fault,

151
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,700
but Li Lun's.

152
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,440
What exactly is the Soul Trapping Needle?

153
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,230
I used half of my soul's power

154
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,700
to condense it into a needle.

155
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,830
It can trap spirits

156
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,010
and control souls.

157
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,460
Don't worry.

158
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,020
This time,

159
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,580
Zhao Yuanzhou is entirely under my control.

160
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,020
As long as we succeed in driving it into the center of his forehead,

161
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,350
he will be mine to command.

162
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,500
He will no longer remember who he is,

163
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,530
and naturally,

164
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,140
he will forget all of you.

165
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,320
From now on,

166
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,400
he will only obediently follow my orders.

167
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,550
And the malicious energy he carries

168
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:08,010
will no longer be his curse,

169
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,089
but rather the sharp edge with which he dominates the world.

170
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,460
Are you reluctant to do it?

171
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,850
That's right.

172
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,670
If you strike a few more times,

173
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,000
I may not die,

174
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,860
but Bai Jiu...

175
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,630
definitely will.

176
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,820
I raised this piece of Divine Wood myself.

177
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,470
During the 300 years trapped in the sundial,

178
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,300
I played this melody every day.

179
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,050
It naturally resonates with me.

180
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,020
Goddess,

181
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,460
go and find Zhao Yuanzhou.

182
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,880
Leave this to us!

183
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,330
Zhao Yuanzhou!

184
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,650
I don't want to kill you with the Cloud Light Sword.

185
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,580
So,

186
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,500
I must do this.

187
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,530
This time,

188
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,920
I bled myself for you.

189
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,510
Zhuo, stop!

190
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,240
That silver needle is fake!

191
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,630
Zhuo!

192
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,110
Zhuo.

193
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,610
Why are you here?

194
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,100
Bai Jiu has been controlled by Li Lun.

195
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,460
Go out and help them first.

196
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,790
Leave Great Demon to me.

197
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,680
No.

198
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,070
It's too dangerous here.

199
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,460
Don't worry.

200
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,960
Be careful.

201
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Where is Jing's Shadow Hunting Bow?

202
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,810
Where is Zhao Yuanzhou?

203
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,580
A calamity can last for a thousand years.

204
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,030
Don't worry.

205
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,310
He's fine.

206
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,460
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

207
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,050
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

208
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,450
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

209
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,590
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

210
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,350
♫Someone is longing for♫

211
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,700
♫Softly calling for♫

212
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,840
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

213
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,800
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

214
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,360
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

215
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,710
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

216
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,930
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

217
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,590
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

218
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:10,120
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

219
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,780
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

220
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:21,130
♫One step at a time, chasing every yesterday♫

221
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,330
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

222
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,070
♫Put everything behind♫

223
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,510
♫You appear in my dream♫

224
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,240
♫The flower in my palm♫

225
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,790
♫Is everchanging♫

226
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,330
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

227
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,710
♫Struggling again and again♫

228
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,510
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

229
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,110
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

230
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:18,820
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

231
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,640
If only...

232
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,780
you were real.

233
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,310
Unfortunately,

234
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,380
this is just my imagination.

235
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,330
In your imagination,

236
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,270
would I hit you this way?

237
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,350
Yes,

238
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,110
but it wouldn't hurt this much.

239
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,370
♫One light, one fire, one crescent moon♫

240
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,020
♫The vow of life and death♫

241
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,570
♫Yet tears leave without a goodbye♫

242
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,540
♫No need to borrow strong wine; it's in my heart♫

243
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,310
♫The dark hair doesn't turn white like snow♫

244
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:26,630
♫Some other time, let's watch the setting sun again♫

245
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,040
So...

246
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,770
♫The cruel debts of fate♫

247
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,130
I'm not dreaming?

248
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,440
♫Are exchanged for the phrase "I'm willing"♫

249
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,960
♫Wind blows in the distance♫

250
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,900
What do you think?

251
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,970
♫The distant boat approaches the shore♫

252
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,250
The Baize Token

253
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,820
is fixed?

254
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,110
Yes.

255
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,880
Why do you seem

256
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,530
different from before?

257
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,110
We've been apart for so long.

258
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,690
Of course, things have been a bit different.

259
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,210
Was it long?

260
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,620
♫The little city traps♫

261
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,840
♫The little us♫

262
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,100
♫Going around and around♫

263
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,840
♫Dusk and dawn♫

264
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,130
♫The heavy door♫

265
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,040
♫Who is waiting foolishly♫

266
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,700
♫Reluctant, not asking, unreconciled, unwilling♫

267
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,560
♫The pillow of the past♫

268
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,410
♫Still has the warmth of the dream♫

269
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,750
♫The dust from yesterday♫

270
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,600
♫Covering my eyes♫

271
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,780
♫The person in the dream♫

272
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,670
♫Is silent, waiting with each step♫

273
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,280
♫Refuses to leave, and refuses♫

274
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,840
♫To turn around♫

275
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,670
♫The spring breeze, she seems to have♫

276
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,060
♫Many stories♫

277
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,720
♫There's a name in her heart♫

278
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,880
♫The human world♫

279
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,070
♫The ink is mottled♫

280
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,380
♫Love, hate, absurdity, mistakes♫

281
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,860
♫Can't clearly write it♫

282
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,320
♫Can't completely express it♫

283
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,660
♫This karma♫

284
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,920
♫The spring breeze, she seems to have♫

285
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,370
♫Too much on her mind♫

286
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,030
♫There's a blank spot♫

287
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,050
♫The human world♫

288
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,320
♫The clouds in the sky♫

289
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,690
♫The end of the bitter sea♫

290
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,170
♫A dream♫

291
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,520
♫A pair of hands♫

292
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,900
♫A cup of wine♫

293
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,720
[300 years]

294
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,970
One day apart

295
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,100
felt like three years, right?

296
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,610
If you say so.

297
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,240
One day apart

298
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,950
felt like three years.

299
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,650
Jiu!

300
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,860
Jiu!

301
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,960
Jiu!

302
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,340
Jiu!

303
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,100
Brother Zhuo.

304
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,070
Brother Zhuo, is that you?

305
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,260
Brother Zhuo?

306
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,240
So annoying.

307
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,930
Look closely.

308
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,210
I'm not your Jiu.

309
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,490
I'm Li Lun.

310
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,740
I will make sure you die knowing exactly who killed you.

311
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,230
See with your last look

312
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,100
who killed you.

313
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,660
I hated this bow so much back then.

314
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,489
I never imagined

315
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,790
that one day

316
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,330
I would risk my life

317
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,199
fighting a demon to reclaim it.

318
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,510
Thank you, Heng.

319
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,010
♫An arrow in the hand♫

320
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,850
♫A string in the heart♫

321
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,830
♫A backside standing, turning into forever♫

322
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,400
♫The moon shines on the south♫

323
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,320
♫But I look north♫

324
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,830
♫I only hope the snow comes a bit later♫

325
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,260
Mr. Zhuo!

326
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,250
Don't you hurt Brother Zhuo!

327
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,010
Brother Zhuo!

328
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,020
Don't waste your effort.

329
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,940
My inner core has been inside Bai Jiu's body for many days.

330
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,070
My soul has already solidified,

331
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,310
making it much stronger than Bai Jiu's.

332
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,250
His soul is nothing but a weak ant

333
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,500
compared to mine,

334
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,390
which can be easily crushed by me.

335
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,690
After staying for the last few hours,

336
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,330
his soul

337
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,570
will never come out again.

338
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,810
I'm too timid.

339
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,040
But

340
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,800
whenever I hear the bells on your braids ringing,

341
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,370
I know

342
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,450
you're by my side.

343
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,360
And I'll feel safe.

344
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,310
Are you scared?

345
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,410
With you

346
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,910
and your powerful Cloud Light Sword here,

347
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,390
I'm not that scared.

348
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,230
I'm sure it will be fine.

349
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,270
Mr. Zhuo!

350
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,300
Your body can't take any more!

351
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,800
Don't consume any more of your Bingyi blood!

352
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,160
Give Jiu back to me!

353
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,740
Zhuo!

354
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:14,970
Li Lun!

355
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,650
Mr. Zhuo.

356
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,980
You're really hard to kill.

357
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,300
You ultimately managed to escape death.

358
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,740
How could I possibly die before you?

359
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,370
Mr. Zhuo, wake up.

360
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,040
I promise I won't argue with you anymore,

361
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,760
okay?

362
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,940
Mr. Zhuo.

363
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,490
Zhao Yuanzhou,

364
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,950
I'm actually very grateful to you.

365
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,790
If it weren't for you bringing this kid to me,

366
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,720
how could I have obtained such a perfect body,

367
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,720
so well-matched to my pagoda ghost form?

368
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,620
You've finally done something that makes me happy.

369
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,070
You cooperated with Wen Zongyu

370
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,670
just for this body, didn't you?

371
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,580
You know very well

372
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,040
that once you break free from Baize Goddess's seal,

373
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,020
your true form will quickly wither and die.

374
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,150
You do know me well.

375
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,250
But if anyone's to blame,

376
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,860
it's Wen Zongyu for being ruthless.

377
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,370
He even sacrificed his disciple.

378
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,790
I've always told you

379
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,330
that humans, though weak,

380
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,190
are far more vicious

381
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,890
than powerful demons.

382
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,630
You never believed me.

383
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,840
Wen Zongyu could even sacrifice his disciple.

384
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,780
You're not his family or friend.

385
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,530
How could you not see this?

386
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,640
Of course, I can see this.

387
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,830
We are just

388
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,530
using each other to get what we each want.

389
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,810
Li Lun,

390
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
do you know his true purpose?

391
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,530
The people of the world,

392
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,270
bustling with activity,

393
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,810
are driven by greed and desire.

394
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,300
Wen Zongyu covets power

395
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,700
and wants to destroy the Baize Token,

396
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,550
allowing the demons of the Wilderness

397
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,470
to enter the mortal world and create chaos.

398
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:27,950
By doing so, he hopes to

399
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,500
recreate the glory of Chongwu Camp's dominance over the world.

400
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,550
However,

401
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,610
Wen Zongyu is too naive.

402
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,270
The naive one is you,

403
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,910
Li Lun.

404
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,970
You've lived for tens of thousands of years,

405
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,000
but you're not even as wise as a ten-year-old child in the mortal world.

406
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,220
Wen Zongyu has been hunting monsters

407
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,260
and secretly researching them,

408
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,780
hoping to create demonized humans stronger than demons,

409
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,750
to eliminate all the demons in the world

410
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,420
and turn the Wilderness into a barren wasteland.

411
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,730
This is his true purpose.

412
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:07,950
What?

413
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,200
Eight years ago,

414
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,620
in the mortal world, the little demons

415
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,210
we saw being tortured in the dungeon

416
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,750
were captured and imprisoned by Wen Zongyu's men.

417
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,860
That was the very reason we turned against each other back then.

418
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,010
But now,

419
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,850
you are helping the very culprit.

420
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,590
Li Lun,

421
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,400
you once swore an oath with blood

422
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,280
to protect the Wilderness.

423
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,630
Have you forgotten?

424
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,400
No, I haven't.

425
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,200
You're lying to me.

426
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,480
You're lying to me again.

427
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,480
He's not lying.

428
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,860
The one who's been lying to you

429
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,710
is Wen Zongyu.

430
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,330
If you don't believe it,

431
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,660
go to the secret chamber in Chongwu Camp to check.

432
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,060
There are the answers you want.
