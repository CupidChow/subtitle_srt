The Original Goddess and I

♫Far in the distance♫

6
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,100
were in charge of the Baize Imperial Order together.

♫Scars♫

8
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,590
We worked together

♫Nourished gently by rain♫

10
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,229

♫The window opened by the wind♫

12
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,150
protecting the peace of the Wilderness.

♫Softly sways, but time slips away♫

♫Hastily♫

15
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,389
♫You wear candlelight like a robe, awaiting dawn♫

16

♫Blossom♫

26
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,660
I thought the Goddess and I

27
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,670
could be like this forever

28
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,550
and never go back on our promise.

29
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,950
But I didn't expect...

30
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,030
Mom.

31
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,730
What’s this mark?

32
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,890
This is the mark of the Baize Order.

33
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,270
Only with this mark

34
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,310
can we hide our demonic energy

35
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,350
in the mortal world

36
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,590
and avoid troubles.

37
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,790
The Baize Order is the reason

38
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,579
why the Human Realm

39
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,510
and the Demon Realm have been at peace.

40
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,570
Be good when you go to the Human Realm.

41
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,740
Fei.

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,520
You're a disaster beast.

43
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,310
Once you're seen by people, you'll bring a serious plague.

44
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,870
Wherever you go,

45
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,710
you'll cause massive deaths.

46
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,230
I can't allow you to go to the mortal world.

47
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,950
I searched the entire Wilderness,

48
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,400
but I couldn't find a way to cure the plague.

49
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,510
I told myself that

50
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,400
I must save her

51
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,540
no matter what it takes.

52
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,060
Did you kill so many demons in the Wilderness back then

53
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,640
just to extend the Goddess's life?

54
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,820
I told you

55
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,970
as long as she could live,

56
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,840
I'd pay any price.

57
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,659
You shoulder the responsibility of managing the Baize Order.

58
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,120
You're supposed to protect the Wilderness,

59
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,570
yet you disregarded the lives of demons in the Wilderness.

60
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,150
You committed a heinous crime,

61
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,270
yet you said it was just a price to pay.

62
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,500
The Baize Goddess

63
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
was meant to exist for guarding

64
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,450
the peace of the two realms.

65
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,690
If I couldn't even save the Goddess,

66
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,960
how could I possibly save the Wilderness?

67
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,390
For her, I had to

68
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,409
take a chance.

69
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,270
So, was she willing to let you take that chance?

70
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,570
You have the power of the universe,

71
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
yet you used it to kill the innocent.

72
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,080
Do you admit your crime?

73
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,510
I killed the innocent.

74
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,820
I know my sins

75
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,180
are unforgivable.

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,690
Since you know it's wrong,

77
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,090
why are you still so unrepentant?

78
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,540
That's because...

79
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,930
That's because they were unruly

80
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,500
and fled the Wilderness.

81
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,470
They deserved to die.

82
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,200
No matter what your purpose was,

83
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,380
it's unacceptable.

84
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,450
You are no longer

85
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,190
fit to be in charge of the Baize Order.

86
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,730
I'm taking back that half in you.

87
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,230
The Goddess's original intention

88
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,160
was to seal me.

89
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,260
But she was infected by plague,

90
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,740
and her magical power was weakened.

91
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,040
I took advantage of her exhaustion

92
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,970
and escaped.

93
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,130
I've been hiding in the Wilderness.

94
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,750
I wanted to kill more demons in secret

95
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,090
to extend her life.

96
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,540
You killed others just for your loved one.

97
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,470
You're way too crazy.

98
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,280
You don't even regret it

99
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,700
or feel guilty about the heinous crimes you've committed.

100
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,300
Who said I don't regret it?

101
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,960
I do regret it.

102
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,720
I regret that what I did wasn't enough

103
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,590
to save her.

104
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,630
Perhaps the Goddess already knew everything.

105
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,200
She didn't want you to make more mistakes,

106
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,920
so she committed suicide.

107
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,150
What did you say?

108
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,900
But the Goddess has passed away years ago.

109
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,860
Why are you killing the innocent again?

110
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,090
Zhao Yuanzhou.

111
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,970
What is your desire?

112
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,390
All emotions and desires.

113
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,260
Everything.

114
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,920
And what do you want the most?

115
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,420
I can get

116
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,100
basically whatever I want.

117
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,660
You're right.

118
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,710
You're immortal,

119
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,200
and you can never die of any injury.

120
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,890
This super power you were born with

121
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,890
is enough to make all the demons

122
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,250
envy you.

123
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,910
The rest of my life

124
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,580
will be like traveling in the dark night,

125
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,820
with no light ahead.

126
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,950
There's no past

127
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,010
and no future.

128
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,800
Maybe I'm the opposite of everyone else.

129
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,680
For me, living is torture.

130
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,260
Death

131
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,720
is actually a blessing and relief.

132
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,780
Since you want to die,

133
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,780
why don't you go for it?

134
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
This is a world of misery and suffering.

135
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,300
It's hard to get my wish granted.

136
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,910
I can help you.

137
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,400
That won't do.

138
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,590
I've promised someone else.

139
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,690
He'll come to kill me.

140
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,370
He doesn't deserve it.

141
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,270
Since Zhao Yuanzhou wants to die,

142
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,160
how about I help you

143
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,020
kill him?

144
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,060
Then your wish will come true.

145
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,950
And he

146
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,740
can disappear once and for all.

147
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,420
This is between me and him.

148
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,310
I must kill him myself.

149
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,860
I don't need anyone's help.

150
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,750
It's been tens of thousands of years,

151
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,830
yet humans are still so stupid.

152
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,560
I made a big mistake back then,

153
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,830
killing demons to extend my life

154
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,820
and letting the Goddess die with regrets.

155
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,160
So I thought,

156
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,880
if I could go back to the past,

157
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,310
back to when she was healthy and carefree,

158
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,720
back to when there hadn't been

159
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,730
any blood on my hands,

160
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,580
back to

161
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,290
when we were still together...

162
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,920
What are you planning to do?

163
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,510
Rewind the clock

164
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,420
and go back in time.

165
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,880
This magical instrument, sundial, can do it.

166
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,220
As long as I grant enough mortals' wishes,

167
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,640
this magical instrument

168
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,300
will gradually become stronger.

169
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,830
One day,

170
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,080
it'll be able to turn things around

171
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,150
and bring back the past.

172
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,600
This way, I can go back to the time before the Goddess was infected by plague,

173
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,590
and back to

174
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,710
when everything wasn't too late.

175
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,700
Why are you sneering?

176
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,460
Because you're dreaming.

177
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,470
Go back to the past

178
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,880
and turn things around.

179
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,900
Is that what Li Lun told you?

180
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,710
That's right.

181
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,390
Why did he give you this?

182
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,630
Because he wants to know

183
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,920
the secret of the Baize Order.

184
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,490
What's the secret of the Baize Order?

185
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,850
You’re so pitiful.

186
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,200
You were deceived by Li Lun.

187
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,620
Li Lun didn't deceive me.

188
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,180
It's you rat, Zhu Yan,

189
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,730
who wants to deceive me.

190
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,110
This sundial

191
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,560
is the magical instrument I found with Li Lun back then.

192
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,520
It only has one function,

193
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,020
which is to store memory.

194
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,660
It can't rewind the clock.

195
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,780
Sister.

196
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,530
The dress is beautiful, but it's inconvenient to walk around in it.

197
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,920
See?

198
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,570
In this world, the Human Realm and the Demon realm

199
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,190
share the same origin.

200
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,070
There will never be a magical instrument

201
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,030
that can rewind the clock and turn things around.

202
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,880
Cheng Huang.

203
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,220
The ending is settled.

204
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,090
The past is the past.

205
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,300
No way.

206
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,630
You're lying to me.

207
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,630
You must be lying to me.

208
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,150
The one who lied to you

209
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,000
is Li Lun.

210
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,380
He's gone crazy.

211
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,080
He has too many desires,

212
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,960
and he's too involved to see the big picture.

213
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,910
Cheng Huang.

214
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,800
You were willing to be deceived by Li Lun.

215
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Everyone has their own regrets,

216
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,460
but the way of Heaven is fair.

217
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,400
There's no turning back in everything.

218
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,930
Cheng Huang.

219
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,820
Be realistic.

220
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,950
Stop being obsessed with the past.

221
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,070
It's all water under the bridge now.

222
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,930
Turn around and mend your ways before it's too late.

223
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,700
I won't accept it!

224
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,070
Cheng Huang is the demon

225
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,810
that has lived the longest in the Wilderness.

226
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,640
He's suffered such a great shock.

227
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,390
I'm afraid even Brother Zhuo

228
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,790
and Great Demon can't do anything about it.

229
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,340
The original Baize Token

230
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,440
was divided into two halves.

231
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,030
It was jointly managed by the Original Goddess

232
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,550
and the strongest great demon

233
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,280
of the Wilderness.

234
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
Turns out I have that half.

235
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,390
Bless everything.

236
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,460
Invulnerable to all evil.

237
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,350
We promise to work together

238
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,960
and guard the Wilderness.

239
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,580
♫Heartlessness births a dream♫

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,860

My God.

246
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,790
So this is the legendary Baize Token.

247
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,840
♫The world is an illusion, like flowers in the mirror and moonlight on water♫

248
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,170
♫I tempered my roar into a blade♫

249
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,110
Baize Token.

250
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,880
I've finally got you back.

251
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,260
Since they asked me to guard here,

252
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,420
I won't

253
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,970
let anyone in.

254
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,550
You and whose army?

255
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,140
The Baize Token has returned?

256
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,420
Hey.

257
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
Hey!

258
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,860
The Baize Token has returned.

259
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,690
It's indeed delightful.

260
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,830
It seems that

261
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,450
very soon,

262
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,860
my wish will come true.

263
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,460
I'm not going.

264
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,730
It's too scary.

265
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,450
How could this be?

266
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,140
Shouldn't he have been sealed

267
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,080
and sent to his place of birth?

268
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,850
Could it be that since he's lived for too long,

269
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,290
the Baize Order no longer works on him?

270
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,140
That can't be.

271
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,640
All demons are under the Baize Order's control.

272
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,030
As long as he's a demon,

273
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,990
he'll definitely be sealed.

274
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,380
Unless...

275
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,230
Look at Cheng Huang's hands.

276
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,810
Could it be...

277
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,500
He's also a puppet?

278
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,350
Appear.

279
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,840
If I could rewind the clock,

280
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,400
then she

281
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,670
could smile again.

282
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,310
How great that would be.

No wonder Cheng Huang has lived so long.

338
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,790
So he has long been a puppet.

339
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,520
And his obsession

340
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,950
is actually so strong

341
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,470
as to make a puppet

342
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,670
as powerful as a real great demon.

343
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,940
Something's not right.

344
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,410
We've dealt with Cheng Huang.

345
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,040
Why hasn't the sundial illusion

346
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,270
dissipated?

347
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,950
This sundial

348
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,180
was found by you and Li Lun.

349
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,150
Zhao Yuanzhou, do something.

350
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,490
There's nothing I can do.

351
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,270
But I believe the Goddess can do something.

352
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,230
Me?

353
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,330
Take a look at it, and you'll see.

354
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,600
So beautiful.

355
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,850
Wen Xiao.

356
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,000
Why did you say it out loud?

357
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,990
I mean

358
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,150
these golden pupils are so beautiful.

359
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,040
Will those eyes

360
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,470
be like this forever?

361
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,350
Only when she uses the power of the Baize Order

362
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,020
will her pupils turn golden.

363
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,580
You said there's something I can do.

364
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,370
Do you mean by using these golden pupils?

365
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,690
It's actually not hard to find the exit of the sundial.

366
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,580
The Golden Pupils of Baize can break through any illusion.

367
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,870
It's actually a more powerful version

368
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,800
of the Truth Eye.

369
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,600
You have the power of the Baize Goddess.

370
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,000
Motivate the power in your blood.

371
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,950
Where your will is,

372
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,850
you can see the truth.

373
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,600
Where my will is,

374
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,720
I can see the truth.

375
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,240
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

376
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,900
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

377
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,310
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

378
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,520
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

379
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,200
♫Someone is longing for♫

380
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,560
♫Softly calling for♫

381
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,860
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

382
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,070
We're back.

383
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,120
Everything

384
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,900
is like a dream.

385
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,440
Since Ran Yi's case,

386
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,190
it's like I've been having endless dreams.

387
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,320
Now that the Baize Order has returned,

388
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,270
Master should be at ease now.

389
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,790
The moonlight is so beautiful tonight.

390
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,870
Zhuo told me that

391
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,690
most of those who say things like

392
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,520
"the moonlight is like water",

393
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,270
or "how can we

394
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,800
fail this beautiful scene"

395
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,580
have ulterior motives

396
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,460
and evil intentions.

397
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,400
Is that so?

398
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,190
I've always wondered

399
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,730
what kind of water this is.

400
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,909
Let me try it.

401
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,660
It's so bitter.

402
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,790
The world is full of hardships.

403
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,040
Life is suffering.

404
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,600
I’m no exception.

405
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,060
You love acting so much.

406
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,470
I suspect your true form

407
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,390
is not a monkey,

408
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,850
but an opera stage.

409
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm a noble white ape, okay?

410
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,270
I've said it 100 times.

411
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,390
You seem to be writing

412
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,510
on your notebook every day,

413
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,130
but it's useless at all.

414
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,650
So what are you drinking?

415
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,810
Pear soup.

416
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,410
I want a sip too.

417
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,540
Zhuo made a big pot.

418
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,960
I'll ask him to get you a bowl.

419
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,140
No need.

420
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,030
I want to take a trip back to Mount Kunlun.

421
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,560
With my current situation,

422
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,380
I'm not suitable for managing the Baize Token with you.

423
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,550
I haven't found the key

424
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,960
to putting the two halves of the Baize Token together.

425
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,440
So I want to go back to the Wilderness

426
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,040
to see if the old Mountain Gods like Ying Zhao

427
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,810
have any ideas.

428
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,840
So as a great demon,

429
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,340
there are also times you feel inferior

430
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,580
and feel like you don't deserve it?

431
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,950
You are a Goddess,

432
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,490
yet you feel inferior too, don't you?

433
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,370
In the past,

434
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,510
when all demons first heard my name,

435
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,380
they were either afraid,

436
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,220
awed,

437
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,100
or delighted.

438
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,160
But soon after, they found out that

439
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,840
I don't have any divine power,

440
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,490
and I can't help them

441
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,790
or discipline them.

442
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,030
That's why I learned so much knowledge

443
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,480
about demons

444
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,430
in the hope that I could help them.

445
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,190
But

446
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,070
it's still useless.

447
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,430
That's not true.

448
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,310
You know even more than me, a great demon

449
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,040
who has lived for 30,000 years.

450
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,810
Besides, with the Baize Order's return,

451
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,910
you won't get any weaker from now on.

452
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,220
You'll get better

453
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,530
and become more and more capable.

454
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,070
No wonder on the way back from Qinghu,

455
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,150
Zhuo said

456
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,000
he felt like my physique had improved.

457
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,790
Although I fell into the trap of Ran Yi's dream control magic,

458
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,790
my body wasn't affected.

459
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,370
Maybe it's because

460
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,830
you've been by my side.

461
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,110
That half of the Baize Token in your body

462
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,090
has been giving me power

463
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,110
and protecting me.

464
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,340
Is Baize Token the only thing that's been protecting you?

465
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,490
What about me?

466
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,230
Alright. Alright.

467
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,240
You're really something.

468
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,630
Now you can control me, a big white ape, with just one look.

469
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,600
Impressive.

470
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,970
It doesn't matter if I can't control you.

471
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,060
But I want to cure you.

472
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,130
Why?

473
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,330
I'm not sick.

474
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,500
You are.

475
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,710
Here.

476
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,300
You actually want to cure a great evil demon?

477
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,040
You're also sick.

478
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,430
Here.

479
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,100
When are we leaving for Kunlun?

480
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,670
I'll go to Kunlun with you.

481
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,710
Mr. Zhuo.

482
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,200
I don't trust this demon. I don't want you to be alone with him.

483
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,560
Mr. Zhuo...

484
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Take me with you.

485
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,270
Brother Zhuo.

486
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,480
Take me with you.

487
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,680
Sure.

488
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,340
Great.

489
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,310
Mr. Zhuo.

490
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,120
What delicious food are you carrying in your hand?

491
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,480
Pear soup.

492
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,220
Wen Xiao has had it.

493
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,070
So is it for me?

494
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,060
Ridiculous.

495
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,230
I'm feeding it to the dogs.

496
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,740
Wen Xiao, that's not what I meant.

497
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,600
I...

498
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,320
You...

499
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,060
Jiu.

500
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,750
Brother Zhuo.

501
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,030
Wait for me.

502
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,830
Brother Zhuo.

503
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,560
Fortunately, I didn't drink it.

504
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,830
Jiu.

505
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,150
Come here.

506
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,290
Jiu.

507
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,840
Are you sure you want to go to Kunlun with us?

508
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,750
Yes.

509
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,550
No one knows

510
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,310
what will happen on this trip.

511
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,990
There will be many demons along the way.

512
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,930
Aren't you afraid?

513
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:04,960
Jiu.

514
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,110
With this, I'm not afraid.

515
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,290
Why do you like holding my bells so much?

516
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,990
I'm too timid.

517
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:20,510
But

518
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,110
whenever I hear the bells on your braids ringing,

519
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,190
I know

520
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,180
you're by my side, Brother Zhuo,

521
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,650
and I feel safe.

522
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,930
Even if there are demons, I'm not afraid.

523
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,370
So, Mr. Zhuo,

524
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,870
why do you always

525
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,750
put bells on your braids?

526
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,490
When I was a kid,

527
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,380
my older brother used to practice swordsmanship in the garden.

528
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,120
♫Footsteps echo, one by one♫

529
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,510
He was afraid I'd get lost,

530
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,600
so he tied many bells

531
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,580
♫Sorrows scattered, lost to the wind♫

532
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,560
on my braids.

533
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,620
♫Not forgetting, nor dwelling on♫

534
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,180
As long as he heard the sound of the bells,

535
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,810
♫The way back home♫

536
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,430
he would know

537
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,730
I didn't go far.

538
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,140
♫With strong will♫

539
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,100
♫I slowly carve out♫

540
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,440
♫Growth♫

541
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,650
♫Turning back♫

542
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,430
♫I find you still in that familiar place♫

543
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,030
♫Waiting there♫

544
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,910
So when I first met you,

545
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,900
I saw the dangling bell

546
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,750
in your hair,

547
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,990
and it reminded me of myself.

548
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,430
My bells were put on by my brother

549
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,630
because he was worried that I'd get lost.

550
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,270
What about yours?

551
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,080
I put it on because I was worried

552
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,410
no one would look for me,

553
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,860
and no one would find me.

554
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,770
When I was little,

555
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,840
I used to play hide-and-seek with my mother.

556
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,470
I was worried that my mother couldn't find me,

557
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,390
so I tied a bell on my braid.

558
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,220
This way, my mother would always be able to find me.

559
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,150
But soon afterwards,

560
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,640
no one played hide-and-seek with me anymore.
