That's right.

Are you scared?

13
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,400
This is Zhu Yan's form

after thousands of years of cultivation.

15
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,970

but I'm very capable.

22
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,459
Why are you laughing?

23
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,670
I'm not laughing because you're a kid.

24
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,500
I'm laughing because I didn't plan to run away.

25
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,430

Why are they arresting us?

36
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,760
They're from the Chongwu Camp.

37
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,530
Where are Wen Xiao and Zhao Yuanzhou?

38
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,330
They ran after someone else from the Chongwu Camp.

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,260
What about Zhuo?

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,570
Zhuo is facing people from the Chongwu Camp.

There are no demons there.

72
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,180
They don't know magic.

73
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,670
Zhuo has no trouble

74
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,270

75
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,920
You are not from Chongwu Camp.

76

People from Chongwu Camp don't have such skills.

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,400

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,470
Sister Pei.

80
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,420
This is it.

81
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,830
Brother Zhuo.

82
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,760
This was the source of the trouble.

83
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,500
This is a talisman drawn with Xing Tian's blood.

84
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,680
Xing Tian?

85
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,150
Only his body remains,

86
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,550
yet he fights on without a head.

87
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,780
His name is Xing Tian.

89
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,650

Yes, sir.

92
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,600
But...

93
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,660
Why did Chongwu Camp's people ambush us?

94
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,280
From the beginning,

95
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,760
this was a trap.

96
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,750
As long as you lure the Demon Hunting Bureau's people

97
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,120
to the demon hunters,

98
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,390
I have my way of keeping them there.

99
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,130
You appeared on purpose

100
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,250
just to lure me away.

101
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,280
Stupid Chongwu Camp.

102
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,230
They don't deserve to fight you.

103
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,040
Need I find the right match for a fight too?

104
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,120
Everything in the world

105
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,590
deserves the right match.

106
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,920
She is a goddess without divine power.

107
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,430
She doesn't deserve to stand

108
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,020
by your side.

109
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,360
We're here to catch up as old friends.

110
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,910
As for this joke of a goddess,

111
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,710
let me kill her for you.

112
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,120
You can try.

113
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,640
How long can you protect her?

114
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,610
For this moment,

115
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,010
or forever?

116
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,210
You don't have to protect me.

117
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,180
The blood feud between me and Li Lun

118
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,650
shall end here.

119
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh?

120
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,630
You have no divine power now.

121
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,520
All you have is the form of a weak mortal.

122
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,790
End, you say?

123
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,690
Do you mean ending your own life?

124
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,760
A mortal's body

125
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,120
can't bear the Truth Eye for a long time.

126
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,160
Aren't you just afraid she'll see your true form?

127
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,300
This trick again?

128
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,020
Didn't you say you wanted to

129
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,580
end the blood feud today?

130
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,680
A gentleman's revenge is never too late.

131
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,420
A lady's revenge must be flexible.

132
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:55,980
What?

133
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,000
Are you okay?

134
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,600
Let me do it.

135
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,410
I'm a doctor.

136
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,260
Why are you crying?

137
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,660
You and Sister Pei are both good at fighting.

138
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,120
If it weren't for me,

139
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,950
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

140
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,660
I dragged you down.

141
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,990
But

142
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,120
those talismans

143
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,800
were found

144
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,040
and destroyed by you.

145
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,840
Jiu.

146
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,490
Without you,

147
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,750
we might have gotten

148
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,920
more than just a few injuries.

149
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,620
Really,

150
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,110
Mr. Zhuo?

151
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,240
Sorry for the trouble, but...

152
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,310
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

153
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,910
Can you work a little faster?

154
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,590
My wound is still bleeding.

155
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,400
Oh.

156
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,160
The blood of the Bingyi Clan is useful,

157
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,720
but it's very draining for you to use it.

158
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,960
Try to use less in the future.

159
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,670
I'll get you some ginger date cakes

160
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,460
to replenish your blood.

161
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,190
Let me see if I have more inside.

162
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,830
Enough.

163
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,120
Oh.

164
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,640
Oh...

165
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,760
Thank you.

166
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,740
Are you talking to me?

167
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,750
This time,

168
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,339
it's all thanks to you.

169
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,040
From now on,

170
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,830
I won't look down on you anymore.

171
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,810
I promise that

172
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,380
as long as I'm here,

173
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,660
you will never die.

174
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,490
You won't resign anymore?

175
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,680
I'm telling Mr. Zhuo that I'm resigning.

176
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,950
You're not the only one

177
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,710
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

178
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,820
Next time,

179
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,740
you don't have to

180
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,350
bear everything yourself.

181
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,140
I’m the commander.

182
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,240
I have the responsibility to protect all of you.

183
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,020
I'm more skilled than you.

184
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,550
I have the responsibility to protect all of you too.

185
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,750
Are you all right?

186
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,470
Sister Pei and Mr. Zhuo are with me.

187
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,700
It's alright now.

188
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,580
I trust you.

189
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,320
But I don't trust him.

190
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,320
Are you okay?

191
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,500
I don't need it.

192
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,960
Here's some free demonic energy

193
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,400
so that you can kill me

194
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,790
easier in the future.

195
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,750
Traceless repair...

196
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,200
I think I'm going to lose my job.

197
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,130
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

198
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,470
♫Beneath the bodhi tree, dust gathers♫

199
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,520
♫Who truly decides fate's design?♫

200
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,980
♫Vividly painted in black and white♫

201
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
Sir.

202
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,350
It failed.

203
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,090
You bunch of losers!

204
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,880
You can't even handle the Demon Hunting Bureau?

205
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,470
Who are you?

206
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,980
I'm the only person who can kill him.

207
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,500
Look at me.

208
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,550
I want an answer.

209
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,890
I have three questions for you.

210
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,840
Get them right,

211
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,480
and you live.

212
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,400
Get them wrong,

213
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
and you die.

214
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,510
First question.

215
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Do you think it's better to be a human

216
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,520
or a demon?

217
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,760
It's better to be a demon.

218
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,800
A demon.

219
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,190
Wrong answer.

220
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,470
Why didn't you tell me

221
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,570
before killing one of my men?

222
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,360
You didn't tell me before

223
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,250
you hurt Zhao Yuanzhou either.

224
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,670
King Xiang sent him here to spy on Chongwu Camp.

225
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,940
I thought he was a hindrance long ago.

226
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,640
Thanks for killing him

227
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,840
for me.

228
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm glad you know.

229
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
Don't forget

230
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,340
our promise.

231
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,710
I will help you find the Baize Token.

232
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,010
My Lady.

233
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,280
My Lady?

234
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,710
[Third day since the Military Order]

235
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,210
Oh my god!

236
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,610
This is terrible.

237
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,310
This won't do.

238
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,560
This won't do.

239
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

240
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,260
Did you step on poop?

241
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,920
It's all my fault.

242
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm too short

243
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,830
and too weak.

244
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
My medicine box is too small

245
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,680
to hold enough herbs and pills.

246
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,960
I only managed to slightly replenish Mr. Zhuo's blood.

247
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,830
But I didn't have the

248
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,680
multi-nutrition pill,

249
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,560
tortoise and deer treatment gum,

250
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,520
ancient wood liver-boosting powder,

251
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,690
heavenly king heart-boosting pill...

252
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,360
Mr. Zhuo

253
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,180
just cut his hand.

254
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,040
He wasn't hit by a carriage.

255
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Oh, please.

256
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,580
You don't understand.

257
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,280
Do you think everyone

258
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,400
is like you, a great demon?

259
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,680
You have thick skin.

260
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,640
You can heal wounds

261
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
with a small spell.

262
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,960
Before you arrived,

263
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,140
Mr. Zhuo protected me and Sister Pei.

264
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,620
Well...

265
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,200
Well, he...

266
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,270
He was beaten up by that bad guy.

267
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,650
So he's quite weak.

268
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,520
Are you blind?

269
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,620
I'll bring you some medicine for your eyes next time.

270
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,130
You should take some medicine

271
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,500
and treat your eyes.

272
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,760
I am a great demon

273
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,190
with amazing power.

274
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,800
But you're ignoring me and

275
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,480
only care about your Mr. Zhuo.

276
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,140
Kid.

277
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,920
If you broaden your horizons,

278
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,960
you'll find

279
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,760
someone better and stronger

280
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,600
to be your role model.

281
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,900
For example...

282
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,720
Sister Pei.

283
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,070
She's weaker.

284
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,200
Quit wasting my time.

285
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,860
I need to replenish the herbs.

286
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,780
What are you doing?

287
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,860
Don't you think I'm weak?

288
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
I can use my power to

289
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,930
make your medicine box really big.

290
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,880
Then you can put all the medicine

291
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,290
inside in the future.

292
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,420
You'll never have to worry about not being able

293
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,820
to save him in the future.

294
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,690
You're just bragging.

295
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,070
So big?

296
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,650
Oh my god.

297
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,400
Amazing.

298
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,670
How do I pack it in again?

299
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,220
It can't be this big forever, right?

300
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,050
See that bell up there?

301
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,300
Ring it.

302
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,260
Fold.

303
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,680
How is it?

304
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,710
Am I better than Mr. Zhuo now?

305
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,850
Mm...

306
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,940
I have to admit that

307
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,840
you're almost as good as him.

308
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,280
Zhuo.

309
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,160
Listen to me.

310
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:27,720
Don't...

311
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,980
Don't show off if you're not good enough.

312
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,470
Ignore him.

313
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,120
What I want to say is,

314
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,210
don't ignore the right actions at the right time.

315
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,880
If you can't beat them, outrun them.

316
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,810
No need to force yourself to fight.

317
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,460
Ms. Wen Xiao and I share the same view.

318
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,790
Zhu Yan.

319
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,570
What a good name.

320
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,260
Let me guess.

321
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,290
The "Yan" stands for "annoying", right?

322
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,510
Mr. Zhuo.

323
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,670
Your Bingyi Clan

324
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,770
has a secret technique to coagulate water into ice.

325
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,440
It's better than drawing your blood in battle.

326
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,970
I don't know how to use that.

327
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,030
You don't know?

328
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,040
Do you?

329
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,880
Of course.

330
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,640
It's written in so many books.

331
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,190
"The great demon Zhu Yan

332
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,260
is skilled in thousands of divine magic

333
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,060
and all kinds of demonic magic."

334
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,500
Ms. Wen Xiao, your name is also nice.

335
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,950
Let me guess.

336
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,980
Does "Wen" stand for "illiterate?"

337
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,300
Mr. Zhuo.

338
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,100
I can teach you.

339
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,230
It's not hard.

340
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,100
If there is water,

341
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,130
you can use your senses

342
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,750
to control them.

343
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,760
Teach me if you want.

344
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,640
Cut the crap.

345
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,250
Come closer then.

346
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,690
Why?

347
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,520
The Bingyi secret technique

348
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,250
cannot be heard by outsiders.

349
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,570
Oh.

350
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,770
Outsider, you say?

351
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,880
Then I, the outsider,

352
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,990
shall take my leave.

353
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,870
No need.

354
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,920
This is a secret technique only descendants of the Bingyi Clan can use.

355
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,890
Even if you learn about it, it's useless.

356
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,450
Then why did you say that?

357
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,800
You're playing tricks.

358
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,280
Hurry up and come here.

359
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,610
Okay.

360
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,590
Miss Outsider,

361
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,920
please make way.

362
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,930
Okay.

363
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,060
The strength comes from the senses.

364
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,280
The form comes from the spirit.

365
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,200
Channel your energy along

366
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,760
the path that I've drawn out for you.

367
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,680
The mind is endless,

368
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,440
the flowing water is tireless.

369
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,890
Aren't you ungrateful?

370
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,480
The tea is so cold.

371
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,690
It's as cold as my heart.

372
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,640
Isn't that nice?

373
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,940
Drink some herbal tea

374
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,150
and calm down.

375
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,830
Mr. Zhuo, you learn fast.

376
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,710
But it'll take a lot of practicing

377
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,290
for you to be able to hit me.

378
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,720
Mr. Zhuo.

379
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,750
Take care of yourself.

380
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,230
Are you really hurt?

381
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,280
Get up.

382
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,420
Don't make trouble.

383
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,830
I'll stay here to take care of Zhuo.

384
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,920
Go back first.

385
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,080
Don't delay Mr. Zhuo's recovery.

386
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,580
No way.

387
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,480
I have to stay and protect you.

388
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,560
If Li Lun comes,

389
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,590
Mr. Zhuo can't deal with him.

390
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,760
Li Lun?

391
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,560
Who is Li Lun?

392
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,730
According to you,

393
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,310
Li Lun is here for you.

394
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,540
Are you familiar with Li Lun?

395
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,020
Yes.

396
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,130
We have known each other since childhood.

397
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,100
What kind of demon is he?

398
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,670
Why can he possess others?

399
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,450
Li Lun is a tree demon.

400
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,050
His true form is an ancient pagoda tree that likes Yin energy.

401
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,850
His spirit can be held in a single pagoda tree leaf.

402
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,360
Once the leaf lands on the body,

403
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,740
his spirit will possess it,

404
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,860
thereby parasitizing other living beings

405
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,730
and controlling their behaviors.

406
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,930
Is he looking for you?

407
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,760
Yes.

408
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,130
You're avoiding him?

409
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,340
He did many evil things back then.

410
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,880
To uphold justice and punish the evil,

411
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,080
I taught him a lesson.

412
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,630
He's very petty about it

413
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,430
and wants to kill me as revenge.

414
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,810
That's why

415
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,300
I chose to cooperate with the Demon Hunting Bureau

416
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,370
and asked you to deal with him for me.

417
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,590
But I didn't expect you guys to be so weak.

418
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,620
Do you know that there is a formation here?

419
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,510
If someone lies here,

420
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
they'll grow a fox tail.

421
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,600
I'm tired.

422
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,870
Commander Zhuo.

423
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,090
Something big happened in Tiandu.

424
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,840
General Wu Yan of Chongwu Camp

425
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,960
was killed.

426
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,890
What?

427
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,470
Zhuo, get some rest.

428
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,870
Don't worry.

429
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,840
Zhao Yuanzhou.

430
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
Come with me.

431
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,870
Wen Xiao.

432
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,290
Sir.

433
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,710
Wu Yan is dead.

434
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,270
Will King Xiang hold us accountable?

435
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,970
General was not killed by a demon

436
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,040
but by the Demon Hunting Bureau's members.

437
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,840
Understand?

438
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,770
Yes.

439
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,560
Wu Yan was killed by a demon.

440
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,700
Why are they blaming the Demon Hunting Bureau now?

441
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,610
Chongwu Camp

442
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,220
exaggerated and twisted the truth,

443
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,530
slandering us before King Xiang.

444
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,700
Fortunately, the Prime Minister pleaded

445
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,110
for us and got us

446
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,490
one last day of pardon

447
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,880
One last day?

448
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,240
So our five days of pardon became one?

449
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,190
Tomorrow's our death day?

450
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,890
King Xiang ordered for the five of you

451
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,480
to catch the Water Ghost

452
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,760
before noon tomorrow.

453
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,520
Otherwise,

454
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,680
the entire Demon Hunting Bureau

455
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,810
will be punished together.

456
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,490
There's only one day left.

457
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,400
Then we can't wait until the Water Ghost's marriage

458
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
for Ran Yi to show up.

459
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,750
We must take the initiative.

460
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,220
We'll catch him today.

461
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,690
How?

462
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,550
The clues are all gone.

463
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,480
No.

464
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,600
There's one last person.

465
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,110
A person who has been hiding in the dark

466
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,950
but remains crucial to the case.

467
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,870
Miss Qi.

468
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
The Water Ghost Marriage Case

469
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,200
involves dozens of victims.

470
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,640
But besides Miss Qi,

471
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,840
other brides

472
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,120
didn't receive Ran Yi's wedding letter.

473
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,340
I believe she must be

474
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,410
hiding a big secret.

475
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,880
Miss Qi has gone missing.

476
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,660
My Lady?

477
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,930
What should we do now?

478
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,860
The only clue is gone.

479
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,220
There's another clue.

480
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,930
Master Qi.

481
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,280
Master Qi

482
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,410
purposely leaked the information about the demon hunter to us

483
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,650
and asked Commander Zhuo and me to investigate.

484
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,050
We were then ambushed.

485
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,550
He is indeed suspicious.

486
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,090
Go to Qi's Mansion

487
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,219
and investigate Master Qi.

488
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,460
I'll use my demon power to track Miss Qi.

489
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,570
Maybe I can find her.

490
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,520
Okay.

491
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,199
Let's split up.

492
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,880
Why are you here alone?

493
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,930
Where is she?

494
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,970
Miss Qi is missing.

495
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,730
Isn't she here?

496
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,770
She's missing?

497
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,640
When I came here last time,

498
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,360
this island wasn't in the middle of the lake.

499
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,850
It must have been hidden by a barrier.

500
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,350
But even a great demon like Zhao Yuanzhou

501
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,760
didn't notice it.

502
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,300
Because he colluded with Ran Yi long ago.

503
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,940
Mr. Zhuo.

504
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,310
Take care.

505
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,540
Fortunately, Ms. Pei's demonic energy-tracking skill

506
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,000
brought us here.

507
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,820
I'm being followed.

508
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,400
So annoying.

509
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,330
With Ms. Pei here,

510
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,140
our Demon Hunting Bureau became very powerful.

511
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,050
How nice.

512
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,910
After this case is closed,

513
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,980
I will quit the Demon Hunting Bureau.

514
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,200
Why?

515
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,740
I don't want to get involved in demons anymore.

516
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,110
Zhao Yuanzhou used my brother as the reason

517
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,440
and got me involved.

518
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,840
But I never trusted him.

519
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,160
I went to the Demon Hunting Bureau

520
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,820
to return the token.

521
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,740
But I signed the Military Order

522
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,360
under the provocation of Chongwu Camp.

523
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,200
Now he colluded with Ran Yi.

524
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,490
We can't trust him.

525
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,320
Zhu Yan cannot be controlled.

526
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
I think you know that better than I do, Mr. Zhuo.

527
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,850
I hope you can cut your losses

528
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,670
and stop trusting the wrong people.

529
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,170
Since you didn't invite them,

530
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,330
don't blame me for being rude.

531
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,400
Be careful!

532
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,370
Wen Xiao?

533
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,400
Mr. Zhuo?

534
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,850
Wen Xiao?

535
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,680
Mr. Zhuo?

536
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,490
Those who are as firm as a rock

537
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,120
will also break down in despair.

538
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,370
Hurry up and release your dream control magic.

539
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,630
Once the Dream Control Magic is used,

540
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,200
no one can release it.

541
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,920
The dreamers must

542
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,040
realize that they are dreaming

543
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,500
to escape the dreams themselves.

544
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,380
Otherwise,

545
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,190
they will be trapped in this nightmare forever.

546
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,410
Besides,

547
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,700
didn't you ask me to do this?

548
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,910
Interesting.

549
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,720
How are you resisting

550
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,370
my dream control magic?

551
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,100
It's him.

552
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,880
It's really him.

553
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,120
Go find her.
