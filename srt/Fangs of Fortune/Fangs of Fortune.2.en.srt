[Episode 2]

3
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,490
Archivist Wen,

4
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,430
how come you're bleeding again?

5
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,100
I need to go out.

6
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,000
I waited for you so long that I almost fell asleep.

7
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,310
You knew I would come?

8
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,980
I know you can't let it go.

9
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't let go of your life.

10
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,890
You have the blood of countless lives on your hands.

11
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,710
Even your death is not enough.

12
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,579
So you were bound to come.

13
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,270
Because you want to know the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

14
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,250
I can tell you.

15
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,590
But you have conditions.

16
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,750
Yes.

17
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,140
What do you want?

18
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,829
I want a vow from you.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,430
Make a solemn vow.

20
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,870
Never to go back on your word.

21
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,440
What do you want me

22
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,910
to do?

23
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,030
I want you to kill me.

24
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,870
I'll teach you the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

25
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,280
Then...

26
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,710
Kill me.

27
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,890
You really want to die?

28
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,070
Yes.

29
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,740
And I must die by your hand.

30
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,350
I don't understand.

31
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,190
If you want to die,

32
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,670
there are thousands of ways.

33
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,780
Why must I be the one to kill you?

34
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,260
People call me the evilest demon.

35
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,940
Why do you think that is?

36
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,190
It's obviously because you've committed numerous evil deeds.

37
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,650
You're extremely brutal.

38
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,440
Mr. Zhuo, don't believe those rumors.

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,760
What?

40
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,910
Don't tell me you're actually a good demon?

41
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,630
No.

42
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,270
I'm more vicious and eviler

43
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,870
than rumors say.

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,350
Not only do I absorb the world's malicious energy,

45
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,910
but I'm also a vessel that contains it.

46
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,410
Do you know what malicious energy is?

47
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,600
Of course I do.

48
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,030
It can destroy heaven and earth.

49
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,770
It can make the world

50
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,790
dark and sunless,

51
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,690
and be littered with corpses.

52
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,870
So,

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,510
when I die,

54
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,430
a new vessel

55
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,300
will immediately be born in the world

56
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,030
to replace me

57
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,030
and contain and absorb the endless malicious energy.

58
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,070
And that new vessel,

59
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,320
whether good or evil,

60
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,260
righteous or wicked,

61
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,270
is unpredictable.

62
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,520
Your Cloud Light Sword

63
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,860
can dispel all evil spirits and demons.

64
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,670
Dying by your sword

65
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,750
can end the vessels' reincarnation cycle.

66
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,320
I, Zhuo Yichen,

67
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
swear to the heavens

68
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,600
that as long as Zhu Yan

69
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,780
teaches me the true use of the Cloud Light Sword,

70
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,340
I will surely slay him with my sword.

71
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
If I break this vow,

72
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,500
may heaven and earth destroy me,

73
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,630
and my soul be scattered.

74
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,790
Very good.

75
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,420
What's going on?

76
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,240
What happened?

77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,460
Well...

78
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,310
I don't know what happened either.

79
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,670
When Commander Zhuo came just now,

80
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,870
he was fine.

81
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,350
Commander Zhuo was here?

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,160
He just left.

83
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,690
Open the door.

84
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,470
Yes.

85
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,010
Mr. Fan Ying,

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,420
[Demon Hunting Bureau Meeting Hall]

87
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,310
we need to select

88
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,110
an elite force to lead the charge

89
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,100
to quickly solve the Water Ghost's wedding murder case.

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,710
This is the list of candidates drafted by the Prime Minister.

91
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,270
Each of them possesses extraordinary skills

92
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,350
and they are unwaveringly loyal.

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,620
There are twenty-eight people in total.

94
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,130
Five will suffice.

95
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,990
Quantity over quality

96
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,050
is useless.

97
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,510
I have prepared five tokens.

98
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,430
Two of them have already been handed to them.

99
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,510
[Demon Hunting Bureau]

100
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,700
These two

101
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,240
are not on the Prime Minister's list.

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,210
Get up.

103
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,720
Stop pretending.

104
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,930
I didn't expect Ms. Wen Xiao to care so much about me.

105
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,080
I can't help but feel touched.

106
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,380
I'm already up and you still stabbed me?

107
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,340
Just in case.

108
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,150
I'll give you a small cut first.

109
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,100
There's Huanling Powder on the blade.

110
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,160
It can suppress your demonic powers.

111
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,580
Otherwise,

112
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,310
I'm afraid you might hurt me.

113
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,050
You're the one who's been hurting me.

114
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,950
Humans and demons should keep their distance.

115
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,350
Why are you here to see me?

116
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm here

117
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,790
to give you a gift.

118
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,990
It seems Mr. Fan Ying has accepted my proposal.

119
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,880
It'll be impolite not to reciprocate.

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,700
I'm a very polite person.

121
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,809
Tell me,

122
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,350
what do you want?

123
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,190
I want an answer.

124
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,600
What did

125
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,550
Zhuo come to see you for?

126
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,200
Why do you care so much about him?

127
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,870
He's just an ordinary mortal man.

128
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,470
Zhuo

129
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,280
is no ordinary man.

130
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,810
Zhuo?

131
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,350
Zhuo.

132
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,830
What's going on?

133
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,850
Are you going to tell me or not?

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,470
This is an agreement between Commander Zhuo and me.

135
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,620
It's a secret.

136
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,000
How can I easily tell others?

137
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,550
Others?

138
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,600
Mr. Zhao Yuanzhou,

139
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,110
you specifically named me

140
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,600
to hunt demons together.

141
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,700
Now you call me

142
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,780
'others'?

143
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,870
That's right.

144
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,100
You're not happy about

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,170
hunting demons with me?

146
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,470
Not happy.

147
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,990
Mortal women

148
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,790
all say one thing and mean another.

149
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,260
You seem to know a lot about mortal women.

150
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,040
I know a thing or two, I suppose.

151
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,670
Don't you also carry a pen and notebook every day

152
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,550
to study us demons of the Wilderness?

153
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,350
You and I,

154
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,210
we're not so different.

155
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,580
How much have you been snooping around about me?

156
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,320
If I hadn't specifically requested it,

157
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,910
I'm afraid with your weak and frail

158
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,110
body that could be blown over by the wind,

159
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,110
you'd never make it into the Demon Hunting Squad in your lifetime.

160
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,150
When did I ever say I wanted to join?

161
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,910
See?

162
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,110
See?

163
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,720
The storybooks were right after all.

164
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,770
Women

165
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,040
always say one thing and mean another.

166
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,550
Before I came here,

167
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,410
I had already inquired about you.

168
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,400
Ms. Wen Xiao is dedicated to helping demons,

169
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,770
secretly releasing demons many times

170
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,980
from under the nose of Chongwu Camp.

171
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,460
You always say

172
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,090
people can be good or bad,

173
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,230
and demons can be righteous or evil,

174
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,020
right?

175
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,960
And haven't you already

176
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,290
eagerly accepted the token?

177
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,020
[[Demon Hunting Bureau]]

178
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,310
Yet you still say you don't want it?

179
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,870
You're so impressive.

180
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,890
You know so much.

181
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,560
I also know

182
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,200
that you're the disciple of the Baize Goddess.

183
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,650
What's so special about that?

184
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,850
All the demons in the Wilderness

185
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,630
know that I'm the new Baize Goddess.

186
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,850
If we're talking about

187
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,470
fame in the Wilderness,

188
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,930
I'm no less famous than you, Zhu Yan.

189
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,130
A goddess without the Baize Token

190

or Baize Divine Power

191
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,190
is indeed very famous.

192
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,010
A well-known laughingstock.

193
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,210
If your master Zhao Wan'er

194
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,730
saw you as you are today,

195
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,070
would she be disappointed?

196
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,200
I love swinging on a swing the most.

197
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,430
I hate pushing swings the most.

198
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,440
Have we met before or not?

199
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,760
You've already

200
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,170
asked this question once.

201
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,190
Then come closer and look again.

202
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,850
Make sure.

203
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,990
Do you know why your body

204
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,650
is so weak?

205
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,450
Because the Baize Token is missing.

206
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,870
I know.

207
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,420
You don't need to tell me.

208
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,310
Then do you know

209
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,830
that if you can't find it back,

210
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,020
you'll die soon?

211
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,290
It seems your master didn't tell you.

212
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,050
Now,

213
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,310
you have no divine power.

214
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,680
Unless you find the Baize Token,

215
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,810
you'll soon die of weakness.

216
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,130
I can help you.

217
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,070
I came here from the Wilderness

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,060
to help you find the Baize Token.

219
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,560
In this situation,

220
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,630
we can cooperate for mutual benefit

221
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,910
and get what we need.

222
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,110
Isn't that good?

223
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,720
I do need the Baize Token.

224
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,550
What about you?

225
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,680
What do you want?

226
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,760
I also want the Baize Token.

227
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,310
What do you want the Baize Token for?

228
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,510
Because the goddess hasn't returned.

229
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,590
If this continues,

230
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,990
the Wilderness will be done for.

231
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,260
After Zhao Wan'er's death,

232
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,630
[One month ago]

233
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,080
the position of Goddess of the Wilderness has been vacant.

234
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,750
Without the protective power,

235
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,580
powerful and brutal demons

236
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,830
break through the Kunlun Gate

237
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,610
and enter the human world.

238
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,350
If Baize doesn't return,

239
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,110
the Wilderness will perish.

240
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,080
Zhu Yan,

241
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,110
the past has already been bid farewell

242
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,790
and old friends have departed.

243
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,110
Don't be a distant boat in the sea of bitterness,

244
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,790
imprisoning yourself.

245
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,390
Find the goddess

246
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,070
and retrieve the Baize Token.

247
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,290
This is

248
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,850
your last chance for redemption.

249
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,370
The water ghost bride abduction case that your adoptive father wants to investigate

250
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,190
also stemmed from this.

251
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,220
I once made a vow

252
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,320
to protect the Wilderness,

253
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,580
bring back the demons who fled from the Wilderness,

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,060
and restore peace to the human world.

255
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm speaking so passionately.

256
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,170
What's with your expression?

257
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,610
Your acting is so fake.

258
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,790
Tone it down a bit.

259
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,190
Okay.

260
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,910
Everyone knows

261
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,850
that when Zhu Yan appears,

262
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,060
chaos will erupt.

263
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,750
Eight years ago, you massacred the Demon Hunting Bureau,

264
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,280
killing countless people.

265
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,150
Among them

266
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,180
were Zhuo's father and brother.

267
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,640
You

268
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,590
are full of malicious energy

269
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,260
and brimming with evil.

270
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,810
You don't seem like a demon with such a

271
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,580
sense of responsibility

272
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,510
and justice.

273
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,790
Is that so?

274
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,550
Is that what everyone thinks?

275
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,790
If even you think this way...

276
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,390
Yes.

277
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,050
Then I can only cooperate with the Chongwu Camp.

278
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,990
Your words can't threaten me.

279
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,650
You can't threaten me either.

280
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,060
Let's just stay at this impasse.

281
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,750
One word:

282
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,270
wait.

283
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,040
I won't fall into the same trap twice.

284
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,450
You think I'd let you get close to me again?

285
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,579
How about this then?

286
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,130
No matter what evil intentions you harbor,

287
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,230
your purpose for coming to the Demon Hunting Bureau

288
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,579
was to find me.

289
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,010
If I die,

290
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,230
your plans will all fail.

291
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,790
Move.

292
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,950
Whoever I want to die

293
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,040
cannot possibly live.

294
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,850
Conversely,

295
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,480
those I want to live

296
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,350
cannot possibly die in front of me.

297
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,590
Live well.

298
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,910
At least,

299
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,360
your master hopes you live well.

300

303
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,120
Once you select the final two people,

304
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,150
I will issue the official document

305
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,350
to announce the completion of the Demon Hunting Bureau's reconstruction.

Take this to get the medicine.

The first elite vanguard squad will depart immediately

to replace the Chongwu Camp

315

and take over the water ghost bride abduction case.

316

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,040
Do you really have to join the Demon Hunting Bureau's vanguard squad?

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,110
Isn't it good?

321
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,620
Of course not.

322
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,410

323

For many years,

but have no clues.

he might really know the whereabouts of the Baize Token.

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,170
Impossible.

You're so young.

354

Don't always have such a precocious expression.

You can't get over that hurdle in your heart.

He's the one who killed your father and brother,

361
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,490
yet you have to fight alongside him

362
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,630
and interact with him every day.

363
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,580
I'm letting down the spirits of my father and brother.

But to protect the Demon Hunting Bureau,

365
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,600
you still agreed, didn't you?

366
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,730
This is your ancestral home,

368
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,670

to rebuild the Demon Hunting Bureau.

Yes, I know.

396
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,190
Yinglong had the divine power to glimpse the future.

397
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,390
He once predicted

398
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,270
that every successor of Bingyi who inherited the Cloud Light Sword

399
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,940
would slay the evilest demon of their time.

Yinglong's prophecy

401
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,070
seems to be wrong.

402
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,590

403
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,690
No.

404

Yinglong's prophecies have never been wrong.

405
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,430
Because it's not a prophecy.

If this is also considered a curse,

410
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,910
then I couldn't ask for more.

411

568
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,639
leaving only me.

569
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,170
I was terrified then,

570
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,679
but I still bravely went up

571
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,840
and fought fiercely with that Zhu Yan.

572
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,400
In the end, I can only say

573
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,080
it was a narrow victory.

574
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,909
Otherwise, why do you think the Demon Hunting Bureau would choose me

575
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,110
to join the first elite squad?

576
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,710
Bai Jiu.

577
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,780
Hello.

578
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,740
Don't look down on me because of my short stature.

579
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,670
That's because I'm only 13 years old.

580
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,790
Don't underestimate me because of my young age.

581
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,790
I'm very capable.

582
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,420
Since Commander Zhuo chose you,

583
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,750
it means

584
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,790
you must have some exceptional qualities.

585
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,400
Mr. Zhuo chose me?

586
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,030
The hero I admire chose me.

587
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,990
Let's go.

588
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,080
I'll take you to meet Mr. Zhuo.

589
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,590
Thank you.

590
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,390
You're so kind.

591
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,630
What's wrong with you, Great Demon?

592
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,690
Why are you so late?

593
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,230
Great Demon?

594
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,910
Where?

595
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:45,870
Him.

596
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,120
Great Demon.

597
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,310
Zhu Yan.

598
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,890
So you're the Great Demon Zhu Yan?

599
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,470
Let me go.

600
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,100
Put me down!

601
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,080
You don't need to be so afraid.

602
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,270
Zhao Yuanzhou

603
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,470
is just unserious.

604
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,870
He likes to scare people.

605
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,930
He doesn't eat children.

606
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,030
Isn't he that

607
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,690
extremely hungry demon?

608
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,630
If he's so hungry,

609
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,430
how can he resist eating people?

610
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,570
He must be Mr. Zhuo Yichen.

611
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,000
The thing in his hand

612
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,190
is the legendary

613
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,250
Cloud Light Sword of the Bingyi Clan.

614
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,910
Aren't all demons afraid of this sword?

615
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,610
Even Great Demons must fear it, right?

616
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,530
Hello.

617
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,070
Hello.

618
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,310
Ms. Pei,

619
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,150
you're here.

620
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,020
Let me introduce you.

621
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,350
This is the new doctor,

622
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:38,970
Bai Jiu.

623
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,980
Hello, Sister.

624
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,180
Please take good care of me from now on.

625
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,860
Fully draw the bow.

00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,670
♫An arrow in the hand♫

627
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,740

♫A string in the heart♫

629
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,270

♫A backside standing, turning into forever♫

631
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,230

please take good care of me.

636

Don't misunderstand.

637
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,820
I'm not here to join you.

638
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm here to return this token.

639
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,910
I don't believe the words of an

640
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,520
extremely evil demon.

641
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,270
It's right not to believe him.

642
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,140
People from the Demon Hunting Bureau,

643
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,910
come out.

644
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:46,040

♫Heartlessness births a dream♫

649
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,740
Mr. Zhuo, you're so imposing and powerful now.

650
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,570
I'm afraid you've forgotten the pain once the wound has healed.

651
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,790
Back then, the Demon Hunting Bureau was destroyed by Zhu Yan.

652
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,660
It was the Chongwu Camp that took on the dangerous mission

653
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,120
and protected the people.

654
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,980
What?

655
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,010
You forgot?

656
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,660
The Chongwu Camp is ruthless and vicious

657
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,950
in demon hunting.

658
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,680
You even harm innocent lives.

659
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,990
It goes against the law.

660
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,170
The Chongwu Camp should have been stopped from acting arbitrarily long ago.

661
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,960
Demons are inherently violent.

662
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,310
To eliminate future troubles,

663
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,870
it's better to kill a wrong one than to let one go.

664
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,480
The Chongwu Camp privately built an underground black market,

665
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,320
trading demon beast furs and bones,

666
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,920
making exorbitant profits.

667
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,200
And in the name of demon hunting,

668
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,870
you forcibly recruit able-bodied men

669
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,400
and occupy civilian homes.

670
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,890
Does King Xiang know about all of this?

671
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,470
Mr. Zhen Mei,

672
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,150
we're in broad daylight

673
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,560
and in full view of everyone,

674
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,680
You're not planning to commit murder and arson, are you?

675
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,430
The Demon Hunting Bureau has fallen into disrepair.

676
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,870
The weather is hot and dry,

677
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,360
which caused a wildfire.

678
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,950
What does that have to do with me?

679
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,060
Have you asked my permission

680
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,790
before burning down the Demon Hunting Bureau?

681
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,970
What do you think you are?

682
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
Demon.

683
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,860
Demon?

684
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,250
Then you deserve to die even more.

685
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,480
Reverse.

686
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,730
I forgot to tell you,

687
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,910
I'm the type of demon

688
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,510
that likes to kill people to vent my anger.

689
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,980
Zhao Yuanzhou,

690
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,550
calm down.

691
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,100
Mr. Fan.

692
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,920
Spare them.

693
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,230
General Wu,

694
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,030
what brings you here?

695
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,330
Mr. Fan said he prepared a gift for King Xiang.

696
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,450
I came personally to receive it

697
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,210
on behalf of King Xiang.

698
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,050
Over the past eight years,

699
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,320
close to 700 innocent people have been killed by the Chongwu Camp

700
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,580
while hunting demons.

701
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,430
The list and related evidence are all here.

702
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,730
Please review them, General.

703
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,320
I accept this

704
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,520
grand gift on behalf of King Xiang.

705
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,110
He now understands

706
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,830
the Demon Hunting Bureau's determination to revitalize itself.

707
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,880
He agrees for you to take over from the Chongwu Camp

708
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,080
and thoroughly investigate the Water Ghost murder case.

709
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,770
The Demon Hunting Bureau hereby requests permission from King Xiang

710
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,370
to thoroughly investigate the Water Ghost murder case.

711
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,980
Do not harm civilians.

712
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,500
Do not be negligent or lazy.

713
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,670
The Demon Hunting Bureau should spare no effort

714
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,310
to solve this case.

715
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,790
I'll trouble you all

716
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,050
to sign and stamp this,

717
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,730
so I can take it back

718
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,410
and report back to King Xiang.

719
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,850
[Military Order]

720
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,460
Sir,

721
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,140
you can press down at the end of the scroll.

722
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,630
Mr. Zhuo,

723
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,650
there are people behind you, right?

724
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,260
There's one more person.

725
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,210
She won't need to.

726
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,200
I just heard her say

727
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,860
she refuses to join the Demon Hunting Bureau.

728
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,570
The Demon Hunting Bureau is truly useless.

729
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,050
Even the dogs that our Chongwu Camp doesn't want

730
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,180
look down on the Demon Hunting Bureau.

731
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,200
[Military Order]

732
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,880
Did you hear any dogs barking?

733
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,870
It's a bit noisy.

734
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,400
They're finally gone.

735
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,140
Indeed.

736
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,540
It's a pity the evidence of Chongwu Camp's crimes was burned.

737
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,810
The real evidence

738
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,410
was secretly sent

739
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,640
to the Prime Minister the day before.

740
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,790
If one day they really need to be held accountable,

741
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,190
the Prime Minister will make the decision.

742
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,680
The chance to investigate

743
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,810
the Water Ghost case didn't come easy.

744
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,160
Whether the Demon Hunting Bureau can be revitalized

745
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,960
depends on this crucial battle.

746
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,610
Zhao Yuanzhou,

747
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,500
you'd better not play any tricks.

748
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,700
Mr. Zhuo,

749
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,760
trust me.

750
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,550
Keep dreaming.

751
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,710
These are all the files on the Water Ghost case.

752
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,230
Everyone, please take a look first.
