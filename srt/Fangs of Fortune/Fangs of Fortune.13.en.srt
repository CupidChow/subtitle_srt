[Episode 13]

3
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,160
I was afraid of causing the plague to spread,

4
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,789
so I went to live in the cave alone.

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,420
There's no concept of time in the mountains.

6
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,470
When the cold weather ends, I don't even know what year it is.

7
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,820
Life is short,

8
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,280
but loneliness is long.

9
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,039
Finally, one day,

10
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,140
I couldn't help it

11
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,270
and went to a town where humans live.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,610
That's where I met Qing Geng.

13
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,990
Qing Geng was the first friend I made.

14
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,790
I was very happy.

15
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,840
Since I went to the town to see Qing Geng a lot,

16
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,960
the plague finally spread.

17
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,579
It was all because of me

18
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,200
that the mortal world I love

19
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,150
turned into a hell.

20
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,570
Since Qing Geng can suppress the source of the plague,

21
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,970
the Baize Goddess could only seal us together.

22
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,520
Am I being too delusional?

23
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,750
I actually want to cure the plague.

24
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,610
Don't be too hard on yourself.

25
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,310
It's all because of you!

26
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,980
I don't want to see you again!

27
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,070
Because of me,

28
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,230
she's trapped

29
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,280
in this dark villa for eternity.

[God Bless Lingxi]

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,329
My existence

32
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,470
is Qing Geng's greatest misfortune.

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,950
This is my inner core.

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,980
Wait.

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,750
Could the method

36
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,120
you were talking about be...

37
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,610
As long as I die,

38
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,210
the plague will be gone.

39
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,529
Please.

40
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,610
Don't kill her.

41
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,950
If Qing Geng were gone,

42
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,460
I'd have no friends

43
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,870
in this world anymore.

44
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm a beast of calamity.

45
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,500
I don't deserve to live in the mortal world.

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,420
But I really

47
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,360
like the bright lights,

48
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,290
the liveliness and happiness,

49
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,480
and the prosperity here.

50
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,900
It's just as a beast of calamity,

51
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,010
I have no choice.

52
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,640
Where is Fei?

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
He's dead.

54
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,600
He killed himself by destroying his inner core.

55
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,620
Good.

56
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,180
It's actually good that he's dead.

57
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,080
Since he died,

58
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,840
I can be free.

59
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,930
It's not good at all.

60
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,740
Why else would you cry?

61
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,860
Do you know why you cry?

62
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,610
Because Li Lun hid something in you.

63
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,720
I noticed just now that

64
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,250
there's Li Lun's demonic energy in your body.

65
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,510
That's why I asked Mr. Zhuo

66
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,050
to use his blood of Bingyi

67
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,580
to cleanse the evil demonic energy in your body.

68
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,310
Mr. Zhuo

69
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,060
is a man of righteousness.

70
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,170
His blood contains more power

71
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,520
to cleanse the evil energy.

72
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,450
Look at this demonic power.

73
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,110
It's grim and dark.

74
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,210
It's exactly because

75
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,170
it sprouted in your heart

76
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,840

his lifespan and demonic power

I don't deserve to live in the mortal world.

188
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,660
But I love this mortal world.

189
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,260

190
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,920

191
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,010
But as a beast of calamity,

192
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,330
I have no choice.

193
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,030
That's why I didn't dare to approach you.

194
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,910
But I dare to choose.

195
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,480

196
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,410

in the mortal world.

201
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,760
You don't like the Wilderness?

202
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,870
The Wilderness

203
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,740
is too desolate

204
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,030
and too lonely.

205
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,370
I don't like it.

206
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,790

It's slippery since it's raining.

210
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,800
Okay.

211
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,020
Fei fled to the mortal world secretly

212
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,230
and caused one disaster after another.

213
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,470
I must take him back to the Wilderness

214
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,600
and seal him for eternity.

215
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,750
I was born to avoid the plague,

216
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,440
so I'm incompatible with Fei.

217
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,580
I'm willing to

218
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,360

You're supposed to pursue the freedom of flying in the sky.

221
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Are you sure you want to choose this?

222
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,780
At least I still have a choice.

223
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,250
But what about Fei?

224
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,230
He was born as a beast of calamity.

225
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,100
Does he have a choice?

226
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,910
This is my choice.

227
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,360

During that time,

259
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,360
I did feel lonely and bored from time to time.

The Baize Goddess

282
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,800
presented a false picture of peace and prosperity

283
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,730
and claimed to be fair.

284
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,350
But she is a human herself,

285
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,810
not a demon.

286
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,180
She couldn't understand the pain and struggle of the demon.

Every choice she made

288
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,660
was to sacrifice demons' lives

289
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,660
to protect humans.

290
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,630
Is that fair?

291
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,280
Your sacrifice

292
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,030
is completely meaningless.

the days I spent with him.

300
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,020
It's just that I hadn't had the chance

301
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,640
to tell him this.

302
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,280
He could never hear it.

303
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,620
Don't blame yourself.

304
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,160
The real culprit is not you.

The plague caused by Fei

321
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,950
can't be cured.

322
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,430
It's my fault.

our final ending

326
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,980
would be to die of illness.

327
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,470
But at least we will die together.

328
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,150
It still counts as a happy ending.

329
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,260
Happy ending?

330
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm so unlucky

331
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,970
to have to die with you.

332
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,230
Aren't you a great demon?

333
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,620
If you were also to be defeated by the plague,

334
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,180
wouldn't it be too pathetic?

335
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,270
Do something.

336
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,540
I may not die.

337
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,680
But I'll be ill and

338
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,580
half-dead like this forever.

339
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,120
Isn't that even more miserable?

340
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,890
I'll have to take care of your funeral affairs

341
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,420
with this sick body.

342
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,550
God forbid!

343
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,250
I won't accept that we'll just all die together.

344
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,660
I'll go work on the antidote.

345
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,940
There must be a way.

346
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,800

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,680

You're indeed more reliable, Mr. Zhuo.

00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,950
Thank you.

354
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,880
Are you praising me?

355
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,930
I'm just telling the truth.

356
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,170
If you hadn't been so smart,

357
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,000
pretended to faint,

358
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,600
and gone deep into the tiger's den, Mr. Zhuo,

359
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,440
we couldn't have

360
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,370
found the real culprit so quickly.

361
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,570
The real culprit

362
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,420
is Li Lun.

363
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,990
To be precise, it's Li Lun

364
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,710
and Chongwu Camp.

365
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,150
I didn't expect them to join forces.

366
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,000

367
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,840
the dark evil aura in Qing Geng

368
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,980
to make her angry

369
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,620
and spread the plague.

370
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,010
And then, he kidnapped Jiu

371
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,770
to lure Mr. Zhuo away.

372
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,580
So that mysterious man

373
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,230
kidnapped me here

374
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,240
to use my Cloud Light Sword to kill you

375
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,920
and take your inner core.

376
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,120
Li Lun is a demon himself.

377
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,130
Why does he want your inner core?

378
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,460
When Qing Geng imprisoned me,

379
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,330
she used Qin Yuan's poison needle.

380
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,100
Qin Yuan's poison needle?

381
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,940
Qin Yuan

382
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,860
is shaped like a bee.

383
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,270
It's as big as a mandarin duck.

384
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,070
When birds and beasts are stung by it, they'll die.

385
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,580
When plants are stung by it, they'll wither.

386
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,240
Chongwu Camp figured out

387
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,920
how to make Qin Yuan's poison needle years ago.

388
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,180
The medicine is ready.

389
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,020
But it's very potent.

390
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,270
I'm not sure.

391
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,360
What if it makes your condition even worse...

392
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,370
Mr. Zhuo.

393
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,710
Let me try it.

394
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,720
I won't die anyway.

395
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,610
There's no room for my condition to worsen.

396
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,560
How does it feel?

397
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
Bitter.

398
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,440
I'm asking how you feel,

399
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,520
not how it tastes.

400
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,240
I feel bad.

401
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,570
But I checked

402
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,960
the prescription left on Qing Geng's table.

403
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,400
This is indeed a prescription to cure the plague.

404
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
But why doesn't it work?

405
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,950
Qing Geng

406
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,240
once told me

407
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,100
she had studied it for many years,

408
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,550
but it seems

409
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,310
there's still one enhancing ingredient missing

410
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,370
which could combine the power of all herbs.

411
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,970
Enhancing ingredient?

412
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,060
Qing Geng lives on a cypress tree

413
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,490
and feeds on its flowers and fruits.

414
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,400
Avoid plague...

415
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,350
Cypress tree...

416
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,060
I know what the enhancing ingredient is!

417
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,530
It's said that when trees grow over 100 years, it will cultivate spiritual energy.

418
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,040
Qing Geng likes living here,

419
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,840
and she feeds on the flowers and fruits on the tree.

420
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
That's why she managed to avoid the plague.

421
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,950
But this tree has withered.

422
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,200
There're no flowers or fruits,

423
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,610
not even laves.

424
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
What should we do?

425
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,160
How about using the bark?

426
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,570
Let's peel it.

427
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,860
My heart aches.

428
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,200
My hand hurts, okay?

429
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,380
Alright, your palm hurts.

430
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,340
Here.

431
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,200
This won't do.

432
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,760
The bark is too hard.

433
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,070
I have to borrow

434
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,570
the Cloud Light Sword from Mr. Zhuo and try again.

435
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,760
Don't bother.

436
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,160
Check out

437
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,100
the awesome swordsmanship

438
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,300
of me, a Mountain God.

439
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,310
Oh my god.

440
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,260
This is too weird.

441
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,760
I did it, right?

442
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,380
Yes.

443
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,430
Jiu.

444
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Thank you.

445
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,450
It's nothing.

446
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,780
Don't worry about it, Mr. Zhuo.

447
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,660
Sister Pei.

448
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,770
Be careful.

449
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,710
It's hot.

450
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,810
Little Mountain God.

451
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,080
Thank you.

452
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,100
You're welcome.

453
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,680
This is all thanks to Bai Jiu.

454
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,420
I

455
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,040

with him.

458
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,240
This is not

459
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,750
how this word should be used.

460
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,200
Really?

461
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,840
Let me put it another way.

462
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,080
Jiu and I

463
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,960
are

464
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,390
birds of a feather.

465
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,660
I'm so tired.

466
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,830
Take a rest if you're tired.

467
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,430
[Lingxi Villa]

468
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,120
Qing Geng.

469
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,230
You spread the plague.

470
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,030
You should be punished for the crime you committed.

471
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,230
But considering the fact that you were deceived by Li Lun,

472
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,000
and you volunteered to

473
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,960
be imprisoned for 100 years for the people

474
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,800
back then even though you were innocent,

475
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,730
that should count as an atonement.

476
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,650
I promised Fei

477
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,060
I wouldn't punish you.

478
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,750
Now,

479
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,750
I'll remove the seal for you.

480

[Lingxi Villa]

481
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,940
I was born to avoid the plague,

482
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,470
so I'm incompatible with Fei.

483
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,840
I'm willing to

484
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,410
be sealed together with Fei for eternity.

485
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,840
You're supposed to pursue the freedom of flying in the sky.

486
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
Are you sure you want to choose this?

487
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,340
At least I still have a choice.

488
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,330
But what about Fei?

489
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,940
Birds are supposed to fly among the mountains.

490
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,910
You shouldn't be trapped

491
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,130
under this low roof.

492
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,050
I started the plague.

493
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,230
The Baize Goddess

494
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,380
did make a mistake.

495
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,560
It's hard to justify it.

496
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,040
If there's an afterlife,

497
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,220
Qing Geng,

498
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,360
I hope you can be an ordinary bird

499
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,990
and meet some new bird friends.

500
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,960

Most of those who choose to indulge in their dreams

514

want to escape.

515

Perhaps

516
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,850
it's not necessarily escaping,

but choosing.

529

can finally leave this place.

530

She's been trapped here for over 100 years.

00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,070
You used to hate demons the most,

Yes.

00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,280
What?

What's wrong?

556
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,550
I thought of my mother.

557
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,140
The demon that killed my mother

558
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,990
was also a tree.

559
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,960
So

560
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,620
you're very scared of trees?

561
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,010
Although trees are silent,

562
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,390
they're calm

563
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,800
and tolerant.

564
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,400
They can always absorb your bad emotions.

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,020
When I was a kid,

566
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:40,600
my father and older brother used to go hunt demons together.

567
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,550
They'd leave me alone at home.

568
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,320
I'd talk to that big tree

569
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,710
in the yard.

570
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,750
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

571
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,790
Sometimes,

572
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,040
I'd think of it as my older brother,

573
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,050
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

574
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,370
and I'd cry to

575
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,590
and smile at it.

576
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,560
In the end,

577
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,880
♫The river flows east and west♫

578
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,390
I'd fall asleep under the tree.

579
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,980
♫The moonlight shines north and south♫

580
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,010
Yichen.

581
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,760
♫Lonely eyes can't make it through the dawn♫

582
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,390
What are you doing?

583
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,360
I saw you look good wearing a headband,

584
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,420
♫Time is quiet♫

585
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,080
so I wanted to wear it too.

586
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,630
Wearing headbands

587
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,900
♫And noisy at the same time♫

588
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,070
is not for good looks.

589
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,300
Then what is it for?

590
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,700
♫How many are the fallen flowers♫

591
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,960
It's for self-restraint and self-love.

592
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,290
It's to remind you to behave yourself.

593
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,470
♫My heart is burning♫

594
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,740
♫The snowflakes are falling♫

595
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,110
♫A heartbeat of cold and heat♫

596
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,000
♫The world is beautiful♫

597
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,020
♫But troubled♫

598
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,370
♫It's going home♫

599
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,860
After hearing what you said, Mr. Zhuo,

600
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,800
I'm not that scared anymore.

601
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,550
♫I'm going home♫

602
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,830
But you're still scared of demons,

603
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,580
right?

604
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:03,280
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

605
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,820
There are so many demons in the Wilderness.

606
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,270
Are you scared?

607
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:09,440
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

608
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,300
There are demons all over there.

609
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,140
Of course I'm still scared.

610
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,320
♫Its cry has never been heard♫

611
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,240
But

612
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,700
with you

613
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,600
and your powerful Cloud Light Sword here, Mr. Zhuo,

614
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,880
♫Only I know its story♫

615
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,570
I'm not that scared.

616
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,190
Good.

617
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,010
You'll be all right.

618
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,840
Zhao Yuanzhou.

619
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,580
Baize Goddess.

620
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,190
Now that you can freely seal and break the seal,

621
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,710
it seems that you've had a mutual understanding,

622
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,100
and your minds are in sync.

623
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,960
How nice.

624
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,430
How nice.

625
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,280
How nice.
