1
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,759
Father.

2
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,350
Father.

3
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,600
Ms. Pei,

4
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,440
you were also a member of the Chongwu Camp.

5
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
Why are you fighting against me?

6
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,630
People of different aspirations can't get along.

7
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,290
Since you want to kill people,

8
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
I should kill you!

9
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,870
You're just a mortal.

10
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,390
How will you kill me?

11
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,600
Here,

12
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,390
my power is endless.

13
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,000
Look.

14
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,610
You can't hold on much longer, can you?

15
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Mortals

16
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,680
are so weak and powerless.

17
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,720
It's my turn!

18
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Zhuo!

19
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,240
Zhuo!

20
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,250
Zhao Yuanzhou!

21
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,450
Get Jiu out of here!

22
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,360
If this continues,

23
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,560
you won't be able to hold on much longer.

24
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,960
Brother Zhuo!

25
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,540
Zhao Yuanzhou.

26
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
Jiu.

27
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,270
Let him go!

28
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,390
Jiu!

29
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,549
Jiu!

30
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,440
Jiu.

31
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,690
Have you ever had a nightmare?

32
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,390
A nightmare is

33
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,360
what you think is over

34
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,720
is actually just the beginning.

35
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,510
Wen Xiao

36
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,630
and Pei Sijing are already dead.

37
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,090
I don't believe it.

38
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,470
Turn around and take a look if you don't believe me.

39
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Impossible.

40
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,960
Impossible.

41
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,270
You're the only one left now.

42
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,810
Are you lonely?

43
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,550
Are you afraid?

44
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,630
Jiu, don't worry.

45
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,420
As long as you need,

46
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,550
I'll come to you.

47
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,490
Then I'll always take the bell with me,

48
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,390
so that you can find me anytime.

49
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,390
No.

50
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,960
This Jiu is fake.

51
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
He doesn't have the bell.

52
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,440
So,

53
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,390
this is a dream.

54
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,840
I'm still in the dream.

55
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,050
As long as I kill myself

56
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,270
in the dream,

57
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,630
I can wake up.

58
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,750
Zhuo Yichen!

59
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,960
Wake up!

60
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,450
The smoke...

61
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,390
seems to be poisonous!

62
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,120
Seal!

63
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,600
Zhuo Yichen!

64
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,430
Wake up!

65
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,450
Zhuo Yichen!

66
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,550
Wake up now!

67
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,200
It's useless.

68
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,330
No one can wake up from a Dream of Indulgence.

69
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,570
And it's different from a dream created by Ran Yi.

70
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,910
If he dies in the dream,

71
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,630
he'll die in real life too.

72
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:25,960
Zhuo!

73
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,090
Zhuo Yichen!

74
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,750
Let me do you a favor.

75
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,440
Are you crazy?

76
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,150
Why did you forcibly suspend your cultivation and bring about your own destruction?

77
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,680
The root of the pagoda tree needs to cultivate

78
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,110
for 100 years to transform into a human.

79
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,000
You forcibly used your demonic power.

80
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,970
You can only stay in the human form for a while.

81
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,120
After a while,

82
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,150
you'll vanish into thin air.

83
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,790
A while

84
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,150
is enough.

85
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,840
I know

86
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,700
you must want to save Zhuo Yichen with the Truth Eye.

87
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,410
So I'm here to help you.

88
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,880
The Truth Eye?

89
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,680
It's indeed amazing.

90
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,480
But it can only stop it for a while.

91
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,440
It can't undo the Dream of Indulgence.

92
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,240
How so?

93
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,760
Because the Dream of Indulgence

94
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,590
is not a spell.

95
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,840
It's a kind of poison.

96
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,590
The Poison Avoidance Pearl?

97
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,590
Mr. Zhuo has been infected with the Poison of Indulgence.

98
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,450
Can you undo it?

99
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,590
I can try.

100
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,750
But I need time.

101
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,200
I'll give you some time.

102
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,640
How about catching up with your old friend?

103
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,070
Qing Geng.

104
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,350
You've been regretting

105
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
that you didn't have time to tell Fei

106
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,260
your innermost thoughts, right?

107
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
He's not Fei.

108
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,960
Are you sure?

109
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,160
You can't protect her.

110
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,920
Even though I can't,

111
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,310
I must.

112
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,550
Ms. Pei,

113
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,270
can you still stand up?

114
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,510
Ms. Pei.

115
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,480
Give up.

116
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,610
You are no match for me.

117
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,830
Li Lun!

118
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,990
You wanted Zhao Yuanzhou to die so much,

119
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,750
but now you are helping him.

120
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,550
Li Lun.

121
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,210
Zhao Yuanzhou.

122
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,440
As a great demon,

123
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,400
you have the strongest power in the world.

124
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,520
But you lost your demonic power

125
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,800
for a mortal,

126
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,720
covered with wounds.

127
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,400
The two most famous great demons in the Wilderness

128
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,750
are so foolish.

129
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,030
Qing Geng.

130
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,080
You and Fei love each other.

131
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,660
But now you're fighting against each other.

132
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,270
That's why I said

133
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,240
you demons

134
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,590
are so stupid.

135
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,310
You don't understand

136
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,030
because you measure

137
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,200
gains and losses with your eyes.

138
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,330
You've never felt it with your heart.

139
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,720
You are not him.

140
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,790
You're not him.

141
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,590
You're not him!

142
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,270
But how I wish

143
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,680
you were him.

144
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Brother Zhuo!

145
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:13,880
Brother Zhuo!

146
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,230
Jiu!

147
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,550
Brother Zhuo!

148
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:14,920
Wake up!

149
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,440
What are you doing here?

150
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,070
Brother Zhuo!

151
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,870
Brother Zhuo.

152
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,030
Brother Zhuo, wake up.

153
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,830
Brother Zhuo.

154
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,830
Brother Zhuo.

155
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,740
Brother Zhuo, wake up!

156
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,630
Brother Zhuo!

157
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,510
Can you hear me?

158
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,310
Brother Zhuo!

159
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,200
Jiu!

160
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau now!

161
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,480
It's too dangerous here!

162
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,270
I stole two Bi Fang's feathers from the Chongwu Camp.

163
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,790
Just like the Shanhai Portal,

164
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,190
it can take you anywhere.

165
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,000
I was worried you and Brother Zhuo wouldn't give up although you're no match for him.

166
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,720
The Bi Fang's feathers are a pair.

167
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,880
The people holding the feathers

168
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,310
can be teleported to each other's location.

169
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,880
Okay.

170
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,310
You take it.

171
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,030
Go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau now.

172
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,830
I promise you.

173
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,160
If we are in danger,

174
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,440
I'll take Zhuo back to you immediately.

175
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,240
Go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau and wait for us.

176
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,880
But Brother Zhuo...

177
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,680
Go back now!

178
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,040
Brother Zhuo.

179
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,070
Brother Zhuo.

180
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,520
You're awake.

181
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,240
Just now in my dream,

182
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
I saw a cloud

183
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,440
of cyan light.

184
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,770
It was Qing Geng's inner core.

185
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
Fortunately,

186
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,240
I woke you up.

187
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,720
Qing Geng.

188
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,590
I can finally

189
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,880
be with him.

190
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,590
I can be with you forever.

191
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,680
Qing Geng.

192
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,310
Back then, I was blinded

193
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
and deceived by you.

194
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,960
Now,

195
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
let me see

196
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,590
what on earth you are.

197
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,270
The Truth Eye.

198
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,180
The inner core is at the elbow of his left arm.

199
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,370
You want to destroy my inner core.

200
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,110
Dream on.

201
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,970
The Ever-Burning Wood?

202
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,670
Li Lun, the pagoda ghost,

203
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,240
aren't you afraid?

204
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,720
Brother Zhuo!

205
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,790
We can't protect you.

206
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,750
Jiu,

207
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,510
go now!

208
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,160
Go!

209
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,960
Go!

210
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,520
You're so stubborn.

211
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm...

212
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,920
going to kill you.

213
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,360
You actually...

214
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,510
I told you...

215
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
I can do it.

216
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,880
Jing.

217
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,490
Don't kill her!

218
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,800
If you want to kill her,

219
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,960
kill me first.

220
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,840
Jiu,

221
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,770
get out of my way.

222
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,440
You're a mortal.

223
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,250
You can't possibly defeat me.

224
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,550
No.

225
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,510
In this illusion,

226
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,000
you are just the fear in my heart.

227
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,170
What else do you want to do?

228
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,040
Don't you think you've done enough bad things?

229
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,920
Done.

230
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,630
I'll give you a candy

231
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,530
every time you treat my wounds.

232
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Although

233
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,000
I love candies,

234
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,550
don't get hurt next time.

235
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,550
Wounds will heal,

236
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,250
but it still hurts a lot.

237
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,360
This time,

238
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,230
you finally...

239
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,670
don't need to save me.

240
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,840
Sister Pei.

241
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,230
Sister Pei.

242
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,830
Wake up.

243
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Maybe

244
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,670
a mortal

245
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,510
can't kill a powerful demon.

246
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,880
But I can

247
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,670
kill my own fear.
