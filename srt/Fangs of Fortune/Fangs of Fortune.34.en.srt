1
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,430
Jiu.

2
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Hello.

3
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,430
Hello.

4
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Hello.

5
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,480
Hold this

6
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,190
and tell me

7
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,630
why you're scared.

8
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,040
Brother Zhuo.

9
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you think Ying Lei will blame me?

10
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,150
Of course not.

11
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,920
He did it to protect you.

12
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,870
One day,

13
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,720
there will be someone you want to protect too.

14
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,070
Why do you always hold my bell?

15
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,430
Because when I hold the bell,

16
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,190
I feel like you're right beside me.

17
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,159
That way, no matter how scary the road ahead is,

18
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,370
I'm brave enough to move forward.

19
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,430
Jiu.

20
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,360
I'm sorry.

21
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm sorry.

22
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
Jiu.

23
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,950
I'll take you home.

24
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Brother Zhuo,

25
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,220
this time it's my turn to protect you.

26
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,840
There are countless rules in this world,

27
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,080
but none can compare to "I am willing."

28
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,630
Jiu!

29
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,320
Dad!

30
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,600
Dad.

31
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,750
Don't leave me.

32
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,510
Dad.

33
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,510
Dad?

34
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,960
Dad!

35
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,110
Wake up!

36
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,320
Dad?

37
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,120
Dad!

38
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,670
Wen Xiao.

39
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,080
Dad.

40
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,720
Xiao.

41
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,390
Dad.

42
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,480
Xiao.

43
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,510
You recognized me?

44
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,360
Dad.

45
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,250
It's good that you woke up.

46
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,120
How did I wake up?

47
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,030
It's Baize Divine Power.

48
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,750
The power of Baize,

49
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,060
with water as its essence,

50
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,050
can purify all things in the world.

51
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,510
Dad?

52
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,510
Dad?

53
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,200
What's wrong?

54
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,750
Once the inner core enters the body,

55
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,000
it can't be reversed.

56
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,750
Dad,

57
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,810
that won't happen.

58
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,150
Xiao.

59
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,680
I will definitely save you.

60
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,870
I can't turn back.

61
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,790
Go and save those people.

62
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,120
Before...

63
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,120
the demon core in their bodies

64
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,670
takes root completely.

65
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,000
Dad!

66
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
Dad!

67
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,910
I promised you.

68
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,360
It seems that in this life,

69
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,750
you'll have to keep watching over

70
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,880
your troublesome daughter every day.

71
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,320
Yes.

72
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,310
In this life...

73
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,630
I promised...

74
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,270
Dad.

75
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,030
I would never leave you.

76
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,840
But now, I can't do that.

77
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,480
Dad!

78
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,790
From now on,

79
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,790
someone will...

80
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,790
continue...

81
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,150
to watch over you...

82
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,130
and take care of you.

83
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,840
Dad.

84
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,960
Dad!

85
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,030
Dad!

86
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,480
Dad.

87
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,790
Dad?

88
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,200
Dad?

89
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Dad!

90
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,360
Dad!

91
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,110
Son!

92
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,390
Son!

93
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,190
The entire city's people

94
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
are turning into demonized humans.

95
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,240
Yes.

96
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,600
My tears

97
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,870
can turn the demonized humans

98
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,000
back to normal.

99
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,080
As long as

100
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,510
I release Baize Divine Power within me

101
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,130
and transform it into rain,

102
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,630
everyone will be saved.

103
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,880
My master taught me this.

104
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,670
This is the final sacrificial spell

105
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,600
of the Baize Goddesses:

106
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Guili.

107
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,150
Without Baize Divine Power,

108
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,030
you will die.

109
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,120
I'm already poisoned

110
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,210
and don't have much time left.

111
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,910
Isn't this a better way to die?

112
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,790
I have a better way.

113
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,930
The love token I promised you.

114
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,910
You must keep it safe.

115
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,360
I carved it myself.

116
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,510
It's the only one

117
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,540
in this vast world.

118
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,750
If you lose it,

119
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,550
there won't be another.

120
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,910
Wear it,

121
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,829
and think of it as me being with you.

122
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,619
Zhao Yuanzhou,

123
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,310
what are you doing?

124
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,920
Do you know what the source of the Baize Order's power is?

125
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,590
I heard from my master

126
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,770
that Baize Divine Power

127
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,510
has no source;

128
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,830
it is a cycle.

129
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,760
The reason Baize Divine Power is a cyclical force

130
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,070
is because it actually comes from malicious energy.

131
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,400
Baize Divine Power is the force of heaven and earth's cycles,

132
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,920
protecting the Wilderness

133
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,950
and counteracting the malicious energy.

134
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,440
Without you,

135
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,450
how could this malicious energy be gathered?

136
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,070
And how could the power of Baize

137
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,270
continue to cycle?

138
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,720
Am I...

139
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,970
also a part of the cycles of heaven and earth?

140
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,290
The stronger the malicious energy is,

141
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,660
the stronger the power of Baize becomes.

142
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,750
No.

143
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,160
No!

144
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,350
In the realm of illusions of the Bingyi Clan's forbidden area,

145
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,240
the future Ying Long foresaw

146
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,000
is that I ultimately die under the Cloud Light Sword,

147
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,440
using my body

148
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,900
to trigger the power of the Baize Order to cycle once again.

149
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,590
This is the most powerful force in this world.

150
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,270
No.

151
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,570
This is what the Baize Goddess should do,

152
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,110
not you.

153
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,350
I told you

154
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,720
I would make sure you live.

155
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,790
Tie.

156
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,340
Zhao Yuanzhou,

157
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,940
I forbid you to do this!

158
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,020
Zhao Yuanzhou!

159
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,260
Zhao Yuanzhou.

160
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,110
Zhao Yuanzhou!

161
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,970
Zhao Yuanzhou!

162
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,790
Let go of me.

163
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,110
Zhao Yuanzhou,

164
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
what are you doing?

165
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,070
Let go of me!

166
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,830
Let go of me!

167
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,030
Let go of me!

168
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,720
Zhao Yuanzhou!

169
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,640
Zhao Yuanzhou!

170
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,960
Zhao Yuanzhou,

171
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,110
let go of me!

172
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,480
Zhao Yuanzhou!

173
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,350
Don't cry.

174
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,630
Pull yourself together.

175
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,720
You have more important things to do.

176
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,240
Do you know why

177
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,510
my One-Word Spell "Yi" worked on you

178
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,680
but didn't work when breaking

179
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,710
Wen Zongyu's barrier later?

180
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,880
Why?

181
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Because I only gave you the ability

182
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,540
to be immune to my One-Word Spell.

183
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,700
At that time, you had Li Lun's demonic power inside you.

184
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,860
The One-Word Spell recognized you as Li Lun,

185
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,270
so it took effect.

186
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
When you gave me both Li Lun's

187
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
and your demonic power,

188
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,190
my spell recognized that you were Zhuo Yichen.

189
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,240
See?

190
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,200
Li Lun always wanted to kill you,

191
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,510
but in the end, by accident, he saved you.

192
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
The world

193
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,840
is full of tangled karma,

194
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,770
always leaving people unsure of how to respond.

195
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,000
Jiu's life

196
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,110
was bought with Ying Lei's death.

197
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,070
And your life

198
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
was bought with Li Lun's and Jiu's deaths.

199
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,510
Now,

200
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,940
the lives of everyone in the world

201
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,070
must be bought with my death.

202
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,680
And my death

203
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,240
must be bought with you bearing

204
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,680
the same guilt and pain as Bingyi in the rest of your life.

205
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,400
It's time to fulfill

206
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,550
the vow you made when we first met.

207
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,550
I, Zhuo Yichen,

208
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,200
swear to the heavens.

209
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,960
As long as Zhu Yan

210
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,170
teaches me the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

211
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,720
I will surely slay him with my sword.

212
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,020
Zhao Yuanzhou,

213
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,490
do we have any other choice?

214
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,920
Did Bingyi and Ying Long

215
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,830
have any other choice?

216
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,960
Ying Long,

217
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,570
to save all living beings,

218
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
turned into a star.

219
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,640
But some people in later generations

220
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,550
call him a demon.

221
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,240
Bingyi, as a dragon slayer,

222
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,070
was worshipped as a god

223
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,790
but chose to live as a mortal

224
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,200
in seclusion.

225
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
How absurd

226
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,790
is this world?

227
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,440
Do you remember our agreement?

228
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,400
Yes, I do.

229
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,550
Mr. Zhuo,

230
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,830
this time,

231
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,570
please make sure not to miss the mark.

232
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,400
Mr. Zhuo,

233
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,080
I knew you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

234
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,030
So I decided long ago

235
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,280
that you wouldn't have to make a choice for me.

236
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,550
This is my decision.

237
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,750
I am willing to bear the guilt

238
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,370
of killing my dearest friend for all the lifetimes to come.

239
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,310
You don't need to bear it for me.

240
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,640
Zhuo,

241
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,440
you're still so...

242
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,110
Zhao Yuanzhou.

243
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,100
Zhao Yuanzhou.

244
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,130
Zhao Yuanzhou!

245
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,790
The poison in my body...

246
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,960
I've absorbed it all.

247
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,000
Don't worry.

248
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,200
It's fine now.

249
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,680
Am I amazing?

250
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,510
I know you are sad.

251
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,510
But life is short.

252
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,480
Don't be sad for too long.

253
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,940
I can't bear to see you spend the rest of your life

254
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,310
grieving for me.

255
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,070
Your tears

256
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,330
should be used to save all living beings.

257
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,510
Don't let them fall for me.

258
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,590
You won't die so easily.

259
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
You said you would always be with me.

260
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,240
You lied to me.

261
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,680
You liar.

262
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,830
Meeting you all

263
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,550
was like having a long, beautiful dream.

264
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,590
But dreams always end,

265
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,000
and it's time for me

266
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,400
to leave now.

267
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,260
Zhao Yuanzhou,

268
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,630
I fulfilled my vow,

269
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
but you didn't.

270
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,960
You liar.

271
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,760
The road ahead is long,

272
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
filled with hardships and dangers.

273
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,190
Mr. Zhuo,

274
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,800
from now on,

275
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,080
you will have to protect everyone on your own.

276
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,630
Use my body

277
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,040
to drive the powerful malicious energy in the world,

278
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,360
turning the tears of the Baize Goddess into rain,

279
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,260
falling on all things.

280
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,030
This way,

281
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,470
everyone will be saved.

282
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,550
But your soul will dissipate

283
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,840
and cease to exist.

284
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,030
Your tears

285
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,290
should be used to save all living beings.

286
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,190
Don't let them fall for me.

287
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Dead demons

288
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,550
will turn into stars in the sky.

289
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,230
And what about you?

290
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,230
I will turn into rain.

291
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
From now on,

292
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,360
whenever it rains,

293
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,000
it will be me, staying by your side.
