1
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Sister Pei.

2
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,070
Sister Pei!

3
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,229
Sister Pei!

4
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,039
Sister Pei?

5
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,510
Sister Pei?

6
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,150
Sister Pei?

7
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,800
Jiu.

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
Where's Heng?

9
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,270
Sister.

10
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
You finally succeeded.

11
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,170
Unfortunately,

12
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,680
I can't be with you anymore.

13
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,870
This time,

14
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,920
I'm really leaving.

15
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,750
I'm happy

16
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,920
that I'm no longer your burden.

17
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,000
I've become your armor.

18
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,560
But...

19
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,360
But what?

20
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,870
Nothing.

21
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,190
But the fate of the armor

22
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,160
is destined to break.

23
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,750
Just like the fate of snow

24
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,160
is destined to melt.

25
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,510
This is

26
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,040
my last time

27
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
protecting you.

28
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,510
You

29
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,870
must...

30
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,560
Live on well.

31
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,870
Don't leave me.

32
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,800
Don't leave me alone.

33
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,270
Heng.

34
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,510
Heng!

35
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,560
Pei Siheng!

36
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Heng.

37
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,280
I have a way to deal with him.

38
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,720
What is it?

39
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,760
My true form is the pagoda tree.

40
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm restricted by the Ever-Burning Wood,

41
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,550
but at the same time,

42
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,750
I can attract the fire.

43
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,120
I'll attract the fire of Wen Zongyu's

44
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,270
Ever-Burning Wood

45
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,630
to weaken his demonic power.

46
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,440
You take the chance to destroy his inner core.

47
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,200
He will definitely die.

48
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
But...

49
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,740
But this way, you will die too.

50
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,670
Li Lun.

51
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,080
What are you doing?

52
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,210
I'll give you half of my demonic power.

53
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,040
With the demonic powers of the pagoda ghost and Bingyi together,

54
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,910
Wen Zongyu won't put up a fight.

55
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,080
Zhuo Yichen.

56
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,600
I'll leave it to you.

57
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,390
Don't let me down.

58
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,600
Since we were born,

59
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,960
he and I

60
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,870
were equal

61
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,820
and always tied in a fight.

62
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,000
I can't stand seeing him so useless.

63
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,360
Zhu Yan.

64
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,670
I'll give you

65
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,370
the remaining half.

66
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,080
This is...

67
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,910
The Truth Eye.

68
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,270
These eyes

69
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,580
were not mine originally.

70
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,050
I'm giving it to you now.

71
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,030
I hope you can see the world clearly.

72
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,270
Don't be like me.

73
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,960
Li Lun!

74
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,510
I once vowed...

75
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:41,910
Li Lun!

76
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
To protect the Wilderness

77
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,360
until my death.

78
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
I, Li Lun,

79
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,360
live up to my vow

80
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,480
and keep my promise.

81
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,600
Zhuo Yichen!

82
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,200
Look carefully.

83
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,480
Don't miss!

84
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,030
Wen Zongyu,

85
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,300
we've done too many wrong things.

86
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,320
So...

87
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,000
let's die together!

88
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,600
Zhuo!

89
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,200
Wing.

90
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,960
Dharma.

91
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,440
Return!

92
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,240
See through

93
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,400
all illusions!

94
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,680
Jiu.

95
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,790
You can't go there

96
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,400
when Sir isn't here.

97
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,690
There's a strong barrier here.

98
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,890
You'll get hurt.

99
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,640
Why is a barrier set here?

100
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,370
To protect something?

101
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,040
He didn't say it.

102
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
But it must be very important.

103
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,200
Zhao Yuanzhou.

104
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,110
Do you really think you defeated me?

105
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,920
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes,

106
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,240
I can be reborn countless times

107
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,300
from the Ever-Burning Wood's ashes.

108
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,000
I was right.

109
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,240
The phoenix will be reborn

110
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,060
from the Ever-Burning Wood's ashes.

111
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,030
Jiu,

112
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,110
go!

113
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,400
Sir

114
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,750
is now

115
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,000
immortal.

116
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,960
He can

117
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,480
eternally be reborn

118
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,960
from the Ever-Burning Wood's ashes.

119
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,480
You can't defeat him.

120
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,200
Go.

121
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,240
Zhao Yuanzhou.

122
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Zhuo!

123
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,920
Zhuo!

124
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,510
Such a powerful barrier.

125
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,540
It must be used to protect the ashes for rebirth.

126
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,120
Jiu,

127
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,240
go!

128
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,830
This time...

129
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,590
I must accomplish it.

130
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,110
Zhao Yuanzhou.

131
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,110
This barrier can block my body,

132
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,370
but it can't block demonic power.

133
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,880
I'll give you all my and Li Lun's power.

134
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,770
Before he regains his power completely,

135
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,110
destroy

136
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,200
this barrier!

137
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,930
Zhao Yuanzhou,

138
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,350
if you destroy this barrier,

139
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,960
he and I will both die.

140
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,930
Zhao Yuanzhou,

141
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,920
do it!

142
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,600
But you're still inside.

143
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,830
Ignore me.

144
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,960
Your One-Word Spell

145
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,400
has no effect on me.

146
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,550
Hurry.

147
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,240
Wing.

148
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,110
No.

149
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,310
No.

150
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,440
Why is it like this?

151
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,880
Zhao Yuanzhou!

152
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,440
Hurry.

153
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,030
The One-Word Spell is effective on you.

154
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,440
You will die too.

155
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,510
If I can't

156
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,200
protect you anymore,

157
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,810
you have to learn to protect yourself.

158
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,400
Understand?

159
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,830
I know.

160
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,960
Brother Zhuo,

161
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,750
this time,

162
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,030
let me protect you!

163
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,200
Brother Zhuo!

164
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,920
Brother Zhuo!

165
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,720
Brother Zhuo!

166
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,720
Brother Zhuo!

167
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,720
Do it!

168
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,640
Zhao Yuanzhou!

169
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,790
Brother Zhuo!

170
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,440
Brother Zhuo!

171
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,270
Break!

172
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,360
Zhuo.

173
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,280
Why?

174
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,570
Why does my One-Word Spell

175
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,840
not work on you again?

176
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,240
I don't understand.

177
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,880
Maybe God thinks

178
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,280
I didn't do

179
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,360
what I promised you.

180
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,230
If

181
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,530
the phoenix rebirth Wen Zongyu said is true,

182
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,110
will he be reborn again?

183
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,590
Someone must have

184
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,280
destroyed the Ever-Burning Wood ashes

185
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
that he needs

186
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,840
to be reborn.

187
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,450
Who could it be?

188
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,750
Maybe someone who knows him well enough

189
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,070
to think of this.

190
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,320
It's Jiu.

191
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,590
Mr. Zhuo,

192
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
goodbye.

193
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,960
This feather

194
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,630
can bring you to Jiu's side.

195
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,590
Go!

196
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,760
I'll wait for you at the Demon Hunting Bureau.
