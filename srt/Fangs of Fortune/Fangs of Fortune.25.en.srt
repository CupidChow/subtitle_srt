[Episode 25]

3
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,090
Zhuo.

4
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,870
Cloud…

5
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,990
Cloud Light Sword.

6
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,039
Zhuo.

7
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,840
Zhuo!

8
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,479
Where are you going?

9
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,669
Zhuo.

10
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,250
Freeze.

11
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,560
So, I'll give you the ability

12
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,440
to be immune to my One-Word Spell.

13
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,980
Wen Xiao!

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,200
Wen Xiao!

15
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,980
Mr. Zhuo,

16
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,470
you're awake.

17
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,200
Why are you standing in the water?

18
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,650
Mr. Zhuo?

19
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,170
Mr. Zhuo.

20
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,080
Ms. Pei,

21
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,550
where is Mr. Zhuo?

22
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,970
Stop him!

23
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,830
Everyone's safe.

24
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,260
Everyone's safe.

25
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,780
It's you, Commander Zhuo from the Demon Hunting Bureau.

26
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,730
You're out on a mission at this late hour.

27
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,060
You're working so hard.

28
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,050
Commander Zhuo,

29
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,570
it's rainy and windy tonight.

30
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,230
Be careful not to catch a cold.

31
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
Mr. Zhuo!

32
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,780
Don't stay here.

33
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,450
Go!

34
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,510
Mr. Zhuo!

35
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,720
Mr. Zhuo!

36
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,590
Zhuo!

37
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,470
Ying Lei.

38
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,090
Zhuo.

39
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,750
Zhuo.

40
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,780
Ms. Pei.

41
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,600
Run your meridian system quietly,

42
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,060
and your demonic energy will adjust itself.

43
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,130
Stabilize your energy, remove dust,

44
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,990
and let it flow through your body.

45
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,750
This is the formula for circulating your demonic power.

46
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,280
Control yourself now.

47
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,150
Zhuo Yichen.

48
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,060
Why am I here?

49
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,860
Mr. Zhuo,

50
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,409
you're finally awake.

51
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,700
How long have I been in a coma?

52
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,900
I only remember

53
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,160
the Cloud Light Sword was broken.

54
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,400
Then...

55
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,670
Then I...

56
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,870
You killed someone.

57
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
I...

58
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,000
killed someone?

59
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,150
Zhao Yuanzhou,

60
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,760
tell me

61
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,210
what happened.

62
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,590
Demon...

63
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,580
Demonized?

64
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
You tried to strangle Wen Xiao

65
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,090
at the Demon Hunting Bureau just now.

66
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,000
Wen Xiao.

67
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,910
I killed Wen Xiao?

68
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,100
She's fine.

69
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,740
I saved her.

70
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,750
Then, you hurt Ying Lei,

71
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
ran out of the Demon Hunting Bureau,

72
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,210
and attacked a night watchman just now.

73
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,170
Zhuo!

74
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,470
Zhuo!

75
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,350
Zhuo!

76
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,560
Zhuo!

77
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,570
Don't you remember anything?

78
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,550
Not at all.

79
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,120
But I think

80
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,250
I did do these things.

81
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,930
I...

82
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,790
I know this feeling.

83
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,230
Every time

84
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,800
I was controlled by malicious energy,

85
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,040
I experienced this feeling.

86
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,780
Commander Zhuo.

87
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,420
You harmed a civilian.

88
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,760
I have to do my job

89
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,070
and put you in the Demon Hunting Bureau's prison.

90
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,040
W-Wait.

91
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,730
Mr. Zhuo may have attacked the goddess,

92
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,590
but he definitely didn't kill

93
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,800
that night watchman.

94
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,380
Look.

95
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,660
There's no blood

96
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,970
[Righteous God of Virtue and Blessing]

97
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,890
on his hands and body.

98
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,090
It was raining heavily.

99
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,550
Even if there was blood,

100
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,780
it would have been washed away already.

101
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,470
You were there just now.

102
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,270
We saw it with our own eyes.

103
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,240
Don't forget

104
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,460
Ao Yin was there, too.

105
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,620
I smelled sulfur just now.

106
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,630
It must be her!

107
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,410
Are you sure you smelled sulfur,

108
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,450
and you're not helping Mr. Zhuo?

109
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm not helping him.

110
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,680
I think I did smell sulfur.

111
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,790
You think?

112
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,080
Yes.

113
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,300
I think I did.

114
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,930
Even if there was a smell,

115
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,550
it would have been washed away by the rain.

116
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,070
I don't think

117
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,670
Mr. Zhuo would kill someone!

118
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,490
Great Demon!

119
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,010
Great Demon, say something!

120
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,820
I

121
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,300
did see

122
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,640
him try to strangle Wen Xiao.

123
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,410
When I was controlled by malicious energy,

124
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,640
I even killed

125
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,640
Wen Xiao's master.

126
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,250
Zhao Yuanzhou

127
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,370
is right.

128
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,190
I didn't even recognize Wen Xiao.

129
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,490
What else is impossible?

130
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,120
Mr. Zhuo.

131
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,780
Ms. Pei.

132
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,070
Don't let me kill anymore.

133
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,880
Put me in prison.

134
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,220
Don't worry.

135
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,500
I will save you.

136
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,980
Wen Xiao.

137
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,510
The damn contract

138
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,660
is still making me

139
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,130
hurt.

140
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,620
I saw it clearly last night.

141
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,850
Zhuo Yichen from the Demon Hunting Bureau

142
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,990
killed someone on the street.

143
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,910
He was so cruel!

144
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,170
Hand over Zhuo Yichen!

145
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:16,790
Hand him over!

146
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,320
Hand him over!

147
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,910
Hand him over!

148
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,910
You must give us an explanation today!

149
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,390
Hand him over!

150
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,540
You people from the Demon Hunting Bureau

151
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,940
can do whatever you want?

152
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,710
A man who kills must pay with his life!

153
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,280
How can you be so unreasonable?

154
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,290
You stay with demons

155
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,670
all the time.

156
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,910
Even though you are human,

157
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,760
you've become as cruel as demons.

158
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,280
Where is Zhuo Yichen?

159
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,780
Enough.

160
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,160
Get out.

161
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,870
Do you hear that?

162
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,950
Get...

163
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,460
Hand over Zhuo Yichen!

164
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,320
Hand him over!

165
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,180
Hand him over!

166
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
Hand him over!

167
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,190
Hand him over!

168
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,230
Hand him over!

169
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,710
Hand him over!

170
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,290
Hand him over!

171
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
Hand over Zhuo Yichen!

172
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,910
Hand him over!

173
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,710
Hand him over!

174
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,250
Hand him over!

175
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,520
I have a question.

176
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,550
Why did they only throw leaves at me?

177
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,750
I have the most sensitive nose.

178
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,230
Will I never be able

179
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,360
to smell food again?

180
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,110
No.

181
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,910
I'll be in bad odor forever.

182
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,790
That's not how the phrase is used.

183
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,020
Goddess.

184
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,850
You're awake.

185
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,440
You're okay now?

186
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,420
What happened outside just now?

187
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,700
Why was it so noisy?

188
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,950
What happened to you?

189
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,310
Why didn't you fight back?

190
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,310
I didn't dare fight back.

191
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,830
I couldn't fight back.

192
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,470
Why aren't the great demon and Zhuo here?

193
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Where did they go?

194
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,190
Mr. Zhuo

195
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,070
is imprisoned in the dungeon.

196
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,750
The dungeon?

197
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,710
Last night,

198
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,210
Mr. Zhuo couldn't control his demonic power

199
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,760
and hurt you.

200
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,310
Besides,

201
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,390
he went out

202
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,770
and severely injured a night watchman.

203
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,970
That's what she thinks.

204
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,520
I don't think Mr. Zhuo did it.

205
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,260
It's not

206
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,600
up to you.

207
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,470
We need evidence.

208
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,510
You saw those villagers

209
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,200
just now.

210
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,190
We need to give them an explanation.

211
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,580
If Mr. Zhuo really did it,

212
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,380
he must be punished according to the law.

213
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,190
The night watchman has woken up.

214
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,380
He almost hurt his liver,

215
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,860
but he barely survived.

216
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,330
It's good that he's alive.

217
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,860
It's good.

218
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,890
At least no one died.

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,230
Zhuo didn't do it,

220
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,160
right?

221
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,700
No, he didn't.

222
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,540
That's great!

223
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,810
Is there a way to prove Zhuo's innocence?

224
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,090
I asked the night watchman detailed questions.

225
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,820
Although the man last night

226
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,220
looked exactly like Mr. Zhuo,

227
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,230
he didn't have a hard-to-copy feature

228
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,120
of Mr. Zhuo.

229
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,530
What feature?

230
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,230
The ice marks that appeared on Mr. Zhuo's skin

231
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,590
last night.

232
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,310
That person imitated Mr. Zhuo very well,

233
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,650
but he didn't know Mr. Zhuo had been demonized

234
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,710
and started to have blue ice marks on his neck and jaw.

235
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,220
Mr. Zhuo's demonic feature

236
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,830
proved his innocence.

237
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
I don't know whether to cry or laugh.

238
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,510
Maybe this is fate.

239
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,110
It's a mixed blessing.

240
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,350
So,

241
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,890
can you release Zhuo now?

242
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,190
Do you blame me for not trusting Zhuo

243
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,440
and insisting on locking him up in the dungeon?

244
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,230
Ms. Pei, do you consider us friends?

245
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,340
Of course.

246
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,480
You are my best friends.

247
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,300
Don't you blame me?

248
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,440
I admire you

249
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,940
because you are fair and selfless.

250
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,200
Back then, to protect the people of Tiandu,

251
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,310
you chose to cut off

252
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,390
your blood bond with your brother.

253
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,420
You chose to suffer alone

254
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,620
and uphold

255
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,270
the law and justice.

256
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,470
Actually, by doing this,

257
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,040
you protected not only the people of Tiandu

258
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,090
but also Zhuo.

259
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,200
You're really a good friend.

260
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,920
Now,

261
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,660
let's go pick up another friend.

262
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,050
Okay.

263
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,060
Wen Xiao.

264
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,870
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,990
Zhuo.

266
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,640
You don't have to say sorry.

267
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,610
You were just controlled by demonic power,

268
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,560
just like Zhao Yuanzhou was once controlled by malicious energy.

269
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,120
Zhuo!

270
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,510
Zhuo.

271
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,440
We must go to Bingyi's forbidden area as soon as possible.

272
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,290
Otherwise, Zhuo

273
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,360
will be torn apart by demonic power.

274
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,310
But we haven't caught Ao Yin.

275
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,980
If we release Mr. Zhuo now,

276
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,250
the people of Tiandu

277
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,200
will no longer trust the Demon Hunting Bureau.

278
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,550
Isn't that what Wen Zongyu wants?

279
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,550
Sir,

280
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,170
you were right.

281
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,950
They came to Tianxiang Pavilion to look for Ao Yin.

282
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,170
But why did Ao Yin

283
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,540
kill that man?

284
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,170
A poisoned monster

285
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,030
can eat human livers to relieve the effects of the poison.

286
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,310
Li Lun was poisoned by me.

287
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,480
Without the antidote,

288
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,130
he can only eat human livers

289
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,340
to temporarily suppress the poison's effects.

290
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,400
But this is not a long-term solution.

291
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,580
In the end,

292
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,900
he will have to come to me.

293
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:44,860
Go.

294
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,850
Sir,

295
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,350
you're a new friend.

296
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,550
What new friend?

297
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,910
Isn't this Commander Zhuo?

298
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,210
What a coincidence!

299
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,770
At this moment,

300
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,930
you're still in the mood for entertainment.

301
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,130
Commander Zhuo?

302
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,440
Is he Zhuo Yichen from the Demon Hunting Bureau?

303
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,590
It's so scary.

304
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,610
Isn't he supposed to be in prison?

305
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,690
Why was he released?

306
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,990
He's wearing a cloak and doesn't want others to see his face.

307
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,030
He's suspicious.

308
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,130
What do you want?

309
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,190
What Commander Zhuo?

310
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,900
He is that demon!

311
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,650
A demon who killed someone!

312
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,620
Will he eat us?

313
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,050
So scary.

314
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,950
I told you people from the Demon Hunting Bureau are scary.

315
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,070
They stay with demons all the time

316
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,550
and always help them.

317
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,250
Look.

318
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,190
He's become a demon himself.

319
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,370
Evil creature!

320
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,760
What are you talking about?

321
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,110
Evil creature.

322
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,370
Scourge.

323
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,200
If staying with demons makes one a demon,

324
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,810
are you pig demons

325
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,860
since you eat pigs and sheep every day?

326
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,750
That's right.

327
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,370
Do you want to know what a real evil creature is?

328
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:29,950
What?

329
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,740
Don't push it.

330
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,030
Do you want to fight?

331
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,850
Don't forget

332
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,160
you're responsible for protecting the people.

333
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,790
We don't pay taxes

334
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,350
to support

335
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,210
you people who can't distinguish right from wrong.

336
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,200
It's true that we should protect the people.

337
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,390
But when there's someone who can't tell right from wrong,

338
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,000
we can't stand by and do nothing.

339
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,370
Someone who can't tell right from wrong?

340
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,920
I can't tell right from wrong?

341
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,620
What does she mean?

342
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,800
Isn't he a demon?

343
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,700
Isn't he a demon?

344
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,030
Isn't he a demon?

345
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,570
What are you doing?

346
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,720
Go away!

347
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,340
Don't come any closer!

348
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,500
Who did this?

349
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,540
Come out!

350
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,380
Move!

351
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,560
He is a demon.

352
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,610
So what if I threw an egg at him?

353
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,810
Demons deserve this.

354
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,270
Don't go too far,

355
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,910
or we'll fight back!

356
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,240
So many demons.

357
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,480
I hate demons the most.

358
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,000
Demon.

359
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,630
The one with white hair must be a demon, too!

360
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,950
The evidence is solid.

361
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,300
Look.

362
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,620
Are they demons?

363
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,060
Are they demons?

364
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,260
Are they demons?

365
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,960
Zhao Yuanzhou,

366
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,000
don't act rashly.

367
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,010
Pei Sijing,

368
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,390
step aside!

369
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,600
Commander Zhuo.

370
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,930
Is the person you are looking for

371
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,350
over there?

372
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,640
Ao Yin.

373
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,740
Pei Sijing!

374
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,300
Wen Xiao!

375
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,810
Ying Lei,

376
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,390
take Mr. Zhuo away.

377
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,810
Let's go!

378
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,930
Don't let them go!

379
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,300
Don't go!

380
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,970
Move!

381
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:23,800
Move!

382
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,290
Move!

383
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,810
So what if he's a demon?

384
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,070
Do demons deserve to die?

385
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,470
Murderer!

386
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,990
Murderer!

387
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,800
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

388
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,390
♫It uses starlight as its feathers♫

389
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,100
Hit me!

390
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,460
Hit me!

391
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,980
♫Snowflakes on the corners of its eyes♫

392
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,540
♫It doesn't cry for years♫

393
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,110
♫The river flows east and west♫

394
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,330
♫The moonlight shines north and south♫

395
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:07,060
♫Lonely eyes can't make it through the dawn♫

396
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,640
♫Time is quiet♫

397
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,350
♫And noisy at the same time♫

398
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:20,000
♫How many are the fallen flowers?♫

399
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,250
♫I'm going home♫

400
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,470
It's you.

401
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,230
It's me.

402
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,480
What?

403
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,540
You're not going to kill me now?

404
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,800
Now, I'm a demon, too.

405
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,160
I have no right to kill you.

406
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,380
I should

407
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,560
kill myself.

408
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,790
Do you know

409
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,820
what Zhu Yan

410
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,790
hates the most?

411
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,300
He hates demons who kill humans

412
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,080
the most.

413
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,410
You planned this,

414
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,400
didn't you?

415
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,790
You framed me

416
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,480
and made people despise me.

417
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,480
Do you understand now?

418
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,110
What do you expect me to understand?

419
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,810
Me.

420
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,530
You

421
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,390
must have felt it, too.

422
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,570
Being despised

423
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,090
by ignorant and weak insects.

424
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,490
They despised you,

425
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,740
trampled on you,

426
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,340
and cursed you

427
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,970
just because you don't belong to the same race as them.

428
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,550
How did it feel?

429
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,570
Don't you hate them?

430
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,830
Don't you feel aggrieved?

431
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,750
What people despise are not demons

432
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,140
but cruel and cold-blooded demons

433
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,020
who kill countless people.

434
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,410
People hate sinners who bring bloodshed.

435
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,690
You're not a sinner,

436
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,300
but they still hate you.

437
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,220
They...

438
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,860
They just don't know the truth.

439
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,100
Really?

440
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,040
When people knock down a divine statue

441
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,840
and trample

442
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,520
and spit on it,

443
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,430
they never get it up and kneel before it to worship it again.

444
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,460
That's because this statue

445
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,430
has reflected

446
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,870
their evil thoughts.

447
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,590
They hit

448
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,380
and insulted you

449
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,110
just to vent their evil thoughts.

450
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,330
Become a demon completely.

451
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,660
What are you waiting for?

452
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,840
You've turned into a demon from a human.

453
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,830
It's hard for you to stay in the mortal world.

454
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:25,449
But since you've killed so many demons,

455
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,110
you won't be accepted by the Wilderness.

456
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,159
You are the real outcast.

457
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,000
Isn't that ridiculous?

458
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,510
Do you feel lonely?

459
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,560
Do you feel desperate?

460
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,590
They don't want to play with me.

461
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,100
Brother,

462
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,560
have I

463
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,179
made myself

464
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:53,030
an outcast?

465
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,520
I've seen too many demons.

466
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,570
They were just like you tonight,

467
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,270
being cursed harshly

468
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,350
and hit violently.

469
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,330
Wine cups and rotten vegetable leaves were not the only things thrown at them.

470
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,310
There were also blades

471
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,720
and arrows.

472
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,690
You're right.

473
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,390
Those rotten vegetable leaves,

474
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,980
insults,

475
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,880
and smashing

476
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,370
are just excuses to let evil intentions go unchecked.

477
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,860
These excuses won't make you stronger.

478
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,670
I don't want to be like you.

479
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,800
You will never be like me.

480
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,450
Because you're too cowardly.

481
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,110
You're not strong enough.

482
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,110
You are as cowardly as

483
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,510
Zhao Yuanzhou.

484
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,590
Do you know what you are like now?

485
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,780
A mirror.

486
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,720
When I see you,

487
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,270
I see an abyss.

488
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,140
An abyss has a bottom,

489
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,060
but it's hard to tell a person's mind.

490
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,240
A person's mind

491
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,650
is the biggest abyss in the world.

492
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,720
You're wrong.

493
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,540
As long as I don't jump down,

494
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,000
it's not an abyss.

495
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,250
You just want to see me jump down.

496
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,530
If I jump,

497
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,960
I'll become you.

498
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,630
You're going to be disappointed.

499
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,200
We are not weak.

500
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,850
We have kindness in our hearts.

501
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,300
No matter how long the night is,

502
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,380
it can't suppress dawn.

503
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,340
Everything will pass.

504
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,440
A little starlight,

505
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,170
a candle flame,

506
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,580
and a street lamp left on for travelers

507
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,680
can all pierce the darkness

508
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,000
and you.

509
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,870
Zhuo Yichen!

510
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,150
You are really pitiful.

511
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,410
You are the loneliest person in the world.

512
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
You just asked me if I understood you.

513
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,410
Ask me again.

514
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,660
I've asked you again.

515
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,360
Give me your answer.

516
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,110
I will never understand you.

517
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,510
But now,

518
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,630
I understand Zhao Yuanzhou.

519
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,840
Zhuo Yichen!

520
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,960
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

521
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,300

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,410
