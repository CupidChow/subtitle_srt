[Episode 11]

3
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,710
Sister Pei.

4
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,070
Zhao Yuanzhou asked me

5
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,360
to give you

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,390
Pei Siheng's puppet.

7
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,160
I don't know what he wants to do.

8
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,990
Sister Pei.

9
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,150
You must want to be alone.

10
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,150
Then I'll

11
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,310
be off.

12
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,080
Sister.

13
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,710
♫If you were a spring night♫

14
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
♫I'm the silent mountain♫

15
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,460
♫You're a sad firefly♫

16
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,100
♫Guarding the last moment of the night♫

17
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,090
♫Why don't you remember♫

18
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,840
♫I'm always by your side?♫

19
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,700
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

20
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,380
♫Guarding the memories♫

21
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,710
You're still alive.

22
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,230
♫Never fading away♫

23
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,390
Of course not.

24
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,190
I died a long time ago.

25
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,110
You know that.

26
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,520
♫I guard the eaves♫

27
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,990
♫And watch the times fade♫

28
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
♫You hold the flame and watch the night♫

29
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,230
Then why are you…

30
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,300
Zhao Yuanzhou used the Chaos Spell

31
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,930
♫I count the winters♫

32
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,550
to keep my soul.

33
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,710
♫And waited for one more year♫

34
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,020
I know a spell

35
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,000
♫My heart is full of passion♫

36
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,800
called Chaotic Impermanence.

37
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,310
It can make your soul

38
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,430
re-form in the puppet.

39
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,410
♫The stars dazzle and the crescent moon curves♫

40
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,940
But since it's chaotic,

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,650
♫The guilty greed♫

42
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,070
it's orderless and ever-changing.

43
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,190
♫Thousands of dark hairs, long and short♫

44
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,270
Maybe you won't be able to

45
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,550
♫The cruel entanglement♫

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,070
show up in this world ever again.

47
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,279
♫Lend me the cold lamp for one night♫

48
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,660
Or maybe

49
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,350
you can accompany and protect your sister every day and night.

50
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,600
♫Let regret stay before dawn♫

51
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,460
What do you say?

52
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,100
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

53
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,100
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

54
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,120
♫In the sky of floating snowflakes♫

55
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,860
♫You are the only warm bloom♫

56
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,560
♫But why don't I remember♫

57
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,310
I can occasionally…

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,280
♫How much the plot has twisted?♫

59
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,720
I can occasionally keep you company now.

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,490
♫I forgot the bitter karma♫

61
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,159
♫I missed it again and again♫

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,780
♫Helpless♫

63
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,470
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

64
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,670
Heng.

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,360
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,640
♫I'm a black-and-white wound♫

67
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,680
Why are you so silly?

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,260
♫You're the vibrant red color♫

69
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,550
I often got sick when I was young.

70
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,080
♫How can I not remember♫

71
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,470
I'd always been a burden for our family…

72
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,780
♫You're always by my side?♫

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,690
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

74
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,510
and for you.

75
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,840
I never saw you as a burden.

76
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:16,980
♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

77
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,530
It was for myself that I wanted

78
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,870
to be a demon hunter.

79
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,100
It wasn't because of you.

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,120
You often got sick when you were young.

81
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,110
The medicine in the mortal world didn't work at all.

82
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,310
But there might be miracles in the Wilderness.

83
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,270
So I worked hard to hunt demons

84
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,790
so that one day

85
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,240
I could find some miraculous medicine

86
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,540
to cure you.

87
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,190
I didn't feel tired.

88
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,260
Because that was my biggest wish.

89
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,310
Sister,

90
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,830
your wish has come true.

91
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,510
I'm very healthy

92
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,510
and strong now.

93
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,240
I won't make you worry anymore.

94
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,830
I can even protect you.

95
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,110
Sister.

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,850
Back then…

97
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,200
Back then, I didn't want to become a demon.

98
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,300
I was very scared.

99
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,909
Because

100
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,110
as a demon…

101
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,510
I couldn't be your brother anymore.

102
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,540
Don't be afraid.

103
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,750
If you became a demon again,

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,150
I'd become a demon with you.

105
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,560
You finally learned to joke.

106
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,230
Smile more.

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,150
That's good.

108
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,020
So, Sister,

109
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,900
look,

110
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,630
no matter what…

111
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,810
this is somewhat of a good ending.

112
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,480
Isn't it?

113
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,790
Sister.

114
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
Remember

115
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,230
to smile more.

116
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,920
In the days to come…

117
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,590
don't cry again.

118
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,690
You can't sleep?

119
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,680
Are you guys

120
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,450
going to Kunlun tomorrow?

121
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,430
Yeah.

122
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,750
That's great.

123
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,990
How about you?

124
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,930
Are you coming with us?

125
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,990
Me?

126
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,900
I'll pass.

127
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,650
Those at the Demon Hunting Bureau need me to cook for them.

128
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,980
They all like me so much.

129
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,260
You'd rather stay in the mortal world as a cook

130
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,020
than return to the Wilderness

131
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,280
to be the Mountain God?

132
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,890
Yes.

133
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,200
I don't understand.

134
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,280
The mortal world is so good.

135
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,410
There are all kinds of

136
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,610
amazing things here.

137
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,990
But Grandpa and the others

138
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,120
are willing to stay in the Wilderness,

139
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,560
a desolate and lonely place,

140
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,910
till the end of their lives.

141
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,330
I see no point

142
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,050
in spending my life like that.

143
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,010
There are many ways to live your life.

144
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,540
Responsibility is a choice,

145
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,690
not a constraint.

146
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,470
Neither shouldering responsibility

147
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,600
nor pursuing dreams is wrong.

148
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,290
Some people

149
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,180
only wish to be a quiet lake in the forest,

150
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,400
while other people

151
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,470
want to become a running river.

152
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,270
Lady Goddess,

153
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,250
what about you?

154
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,350
What's your choice?

155
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,950
Master said

156
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,460
it's not the Baize Token that made us the Goddess

157
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,510
but the determination to protect the Wilderness.

158
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,020
I want peace between the two worlds.

159
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,010
Because in the Wilderness

160
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,960
and the mortal world, there are people and demons…

161
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,030
that I care for.

162
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,550
Come with us to Kunlun.

163
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,380
Jiu is waiting for you to cook for him.

164
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,080
The plan is going more smoothly than I thought.

165
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,490
How about a toast?

166
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,020
The way you look at me

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,880
makes me very uncomfortable.

168
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,660
The plan is going smoothly,

169
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,280
but you'd better stay committed.

170
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,700
Look at who I am.

171
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,520
Don't get smart.

172
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,150
Relax.

173
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,610
We have the same goal.

174
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,910
I believe we can get the Baize Token very soon.

175
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,340
Aren't you happy?

176
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,710
Getting it

177
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,770
can't make me happy.

178
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,460
But destroying it

179
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,390
is very delightful.

180
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,150
Five days later,

181
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,590
there will be a blood moon.

182
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,850
That's the best time to destroy the Baize Token.

183
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,630
So those from the Demon Hunting Bureau

184
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,230
can't get to Kunlun too soon.

185
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,040
Do something about it.

186
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,630
Don't worry.

187
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,080
Qing Geng is already waiting at the foot of Mount Kunlun.

188
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,650
But don't forget

189
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,740
what you promised me.

190
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,180
Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core,

191
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,550
I'll definitely get it for you.

192
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,380
What about your promise to me?

193
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,510
Can you fulfill it?

194
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,140
I don't need to fulfill it myself.

195
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
Someone else will fulfill it for me.

196
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,990
And she can do better than me.

197
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,350
Stall them at Sinan Water Town.

198
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,680
Can you do it?

199
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,890
I'll try my best.

200
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,760
[Lingxi Villa]

201
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,890
To be obsessed

202
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,320
is to be trapped.

203
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,930
Life is full of ups and downs.

204
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,400
It's just all about obsession

205
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,270
and karma.

206
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,150
Wen Xiao.

207
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,900
What are you writing?

208
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,940
Cheng Huang was obsessed

209
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,600
with keeping the Goddess alive.

210
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,060
He was so obsessed

211
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,910
that he swam against the tide

212
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,420
and eventually hurt himself.

213
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,620
Obsessions

214
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,330
trap not only mortals

215
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,420
but also immortals.

216
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,830
I'm so happy!

217
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,130
We're going to Mount Kunlun.

218
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,870
Let me tell you.

219
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,290
I've packed a lot of things in my box.

220
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,290
It's very heavy.

221
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,060
Brother Zhuo.

222
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,710
My box is so heavy.

223
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,590
Give it to me if you're tired.

224
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,790
I can carry it for you.

225
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,990
I told you I could carry it for you.

226
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,060
Thank you, Brother Zhuo.

227
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,220
I'm stronger than Zhuo.

228
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,780
Someone stronger is coming, in terms of malicious energy.

229
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,320
Morning.

230
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,180
Friends.

231
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,840
Everyone is here, Yinglei.

232
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,610
Lend us your incense burner.

233
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,050
Just Mount Kunlun.

234
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,870
No problem.

235
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,300
My turf.

236
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,260
This...

237
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,220
This is Mount Kunlun?

238
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,040
Well… sorry.

239
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,330
When I was thinking about Mount Kunlun just now,

240
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,150
I suddenly thought that

241
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,090
Ms. Pei once mentioned

242
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,400
Sinan Water Town at the foot of Mount Kunlun

243
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,090
which had an interesting Lantern Festival.

244
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,530
And I got distracted.

245
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,130
Sinan Water Town is at the foot of Mount Kunlun.

246
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,210
I came here for investigation once.

247
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,150
It happened to be during the Lantern Festival,

248
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,280
so I casually mentioned it to Jiu.

249
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,040
Why did you eavesdrop?

250
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,780
It's fine.

251
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,970
Mount Kunlun is not far away.

252
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,120
We just need to hike a bit.

253
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,910
Hike?

254
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,760
Hiking is good for your health.

255
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,170
Sinan Water Town

256
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,390
is a beautiful place.

257
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,079
People here live in peace.

258
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,900
It's a wealthy paradise.

259
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,089
But this place

260
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,660
doesn't look like it.

261
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,790
Looks like

262
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,180
many people have died.

263
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,680
They've arrived at Sinan Water Town.

264
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,850
Then we can kill him soon.

265
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,290
The plague has spread across the town.

266
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,540
This red string can make you immune to it.

267
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,970
Otherwise,

268
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,320
you'll be infected too.

269
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,080
When I came here for a case,

270
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,490
things were completely different.

271
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,330
It's been just a few months.

272
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,080
What on earth has happened?

273
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
This place is so scary.

274
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,350
It's like a haunted town.

275
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,670
Don't be afraid.

276
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,880
With me by your side,

277
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,550
you…

278
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,870
Jiu.

279
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,200
With you holding me like this,

280
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,560
how can I use my sword?

281
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,420
But I'm really scared.

282
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,980
I'll hold this instead.

283
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,290
Don't pull my hair.

284
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,270
Here.

285
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,050
Hold this.

286
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,420
What has ruined this wealthy town

287
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,900
is either war

288
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,070
or plague.

289
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,700
I made these detoxification pills myself.

290
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,210
You each take one.

291
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,940
Try not to come in contact with the residents

292
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,940
or animals here.

293
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,680
Stay away from dead bodies.

294
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,330
How did it happen so suddenly?

295
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,690
The news never reached Tiandu.

296
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
No one knows this town is in such a grave situation.

297
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,870
Let's split up to make inquiries.

298
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,810
Be careful.

299
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,680
Come back!

300
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,910
Brother Zhuo!

301
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,710
Brother Zhuo!

302
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,370
Before we find out the source of the plague,

303
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,310
we have to isolate this place

304
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,660
to prevent the plague and miasma from spreading.

305
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,170
Zhao Yuanzhou, lend me your Baize Token.

306
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,290
You want to hold my hand?

307
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,400
No problem.

308
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,000
Now, to you, is he

309
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,250
the cruel demon who killed your father or brother

310
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,930
or a friend who fights alongside you?

311
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,540
Both.

312
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,610
But it doesn't matter.

313
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,230
No matter what,

314
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,510
I'll kill him myself.

315
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,490
But he has half of the Baize Token now.

316
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,130
I can't kill him.

317
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,110
Is that the real reason?

318
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,620
After we reach Mount Kunlun

319
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,690
and find a way to merge the two halves of the Baize Token,

320
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,790
Wen Xiao can get back

321
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,630
the power of Baize Goddess.

322
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,510
By then,

323
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,950
I'll settle all my grudges with him.

324
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,670
I didn't expect

325
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,330
to find the other half of the Baize Token so soon.

326
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,250
And it happened to be with Zhao Yuanzhou.

327
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,690
It seems that the universe

328
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,390
is protecting the Wilderness

329
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,850
and the mortal world.

330
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,540
I don't think so.

331
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,200
What do you mean?

332
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,520
I don't think it's accidental.

333
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,730
It's more like by design.

334
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,430
Pei Siheng's puppet suddenly appeared,

335
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,550
leading us to investigate the case of Cheng Huang

336
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,520
and learn the truth about the Baize Token.

337
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,200
Your brother's appearance

338
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,260
is too much of a coincidence.

339
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,250
You suspect my brother?

340
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,470
I just suspect Cheng Huang's motive.

341
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,030
Pei Siheng has always been under Cheng Huang's control,

342
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,270
but Cheng Huang is leading us to catch him.

343
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,930
Don't you think it's strange?

344
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,040
I have the feeling

345
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,740
that we're like puppets

346
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,720
that are manipulated

347
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,130
by a pair of invisible hands.

348
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,350
We got what we wanted too easily.

349
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,460
Everything has been going so smoothly.

350
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,810
This feeling

351
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,740
unsettles me very much.

352
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,760
Well…

353
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,890
I'll go check the perimeter again.

354
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,300
I can do it alone.

355
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,530
Why are we in a drug shop?

356
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,410
I want to see if they have enough herbs in stock.

357
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,060
Master?

358
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,150
Jiu?

359
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,790
Master, it's really you.

360
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,270
What are you doing here?

361
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,670
Hello, sir.

362
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,410
I'm…

363
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,960
good friend.

364
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,930
Master.

365
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,840
Shouldn't you be in Tiandu?

366
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,980
Why are you here?

367
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,590
I was told that

368
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,720
a plague broke out in Sinan Water Town,

369
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,100
so I came to have a look.

370
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,750
But I didn't expect it

371
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,110
to be so serious.

372
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,220
It started five days ago.

373
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,100
Local physicians couldn't do anything about it.

374
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,670
Some people were too scared and ran away.

375
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,220
Ran away?

376
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,000
Wouldn't they bring the plague to other towns?

377
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,970
Life here was always peaceful.

378
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,300
With the protection of the spiritual energy of Mount Kunlun,

379
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,800
this town never saw any plague or natural disaster.

380
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,950
The only plague I know

381
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,870
happened hundreds of years ago.

382
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,940
It's said to have been horrible,

383
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,910
and almost everyone in the town died.

384

To end this plague,

389
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,290
we need to find the source.

390
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,700
There are four causes for plague: unnatural energy,

393
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
and the build-up of harmful miasma.

394
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,630
I've checked them one by one.

395
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,590
None of them are the cause of this plague.

None of them are?

397
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,920
Then what could be the cause?

398
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,070
Could it be that

399
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,630
there's a demon in the town?

400

It turns out that he trained under you.

421
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,630
Zhao Yuanzhou and Wen Xiao have found the source of the plague.

Wait.

570
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,220
Why is it wet here?

571
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,160
You're actually awake?

572
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,570
Who on earth

573
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,840
are you?

574
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,280
Qing Geng.

575
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,110
A demon?

576
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,010
A demon.

577
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,710
However,

578
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,030
without the Cloud Light Sword,

579
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
the famous Zhuo Yichen

580
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,580
can only be under the thumb of a demon.

581
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,970
I didn't expect you to be so bold

582
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,730
as to pretend to be in a coma

583
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,880
and throw yourself into danger alone.

584
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,980
You're indeed a descendant of the Bingyi Clan.

585
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,240
If I hadn't pretended to be unconscious,

586
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,130
how could I have found out

587
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,940
your secret plot?

588
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,300
Once Zhao Yuanzhou is dead,

589
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,060
I can get his inner core

590
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,690
and finish my unfinished business.

591
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,690
Then I'll give his inner core to you.

592
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,260
You want Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core

593
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,870
but can't kill him.

594
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,810
So,

595
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,000
you need me to do it.

596
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,840
To be precise,

597
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,030
I need your sword.

598
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,400
Only the Cloud Light Sword

599
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,450
can kill Zhao Yuanzhou

600
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,910
and help me get his inner core.

601
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,350
Who brought me here?

602
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,360
You don't need to know that.

603
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,630
If you don't

604
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,370
tell me who is behind this

605
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,790
and what they want,

606
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,480
I'll never help you kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

607
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,230
Interesting.

608
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,350
He killed your father and brother,

609
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,720
yet you really see him as a friend

610
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,230
who fights alongside you?

611
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,120
I'll kill him,

612
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,010
but it has nothing to do with you guys.

613
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,990
Mortals are really hard to understand.

614
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,150
I'm kindly helping you to take revenge,

615
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,790
but you don't appreciate it.

616
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,320
This was originally a spine from the fierce beast Qin Yuan in the Wilderness.

617
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,040
Surprisingly, it's been made

618
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,970
into a needle in the mortal world.

619
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,970
They all say demons are cold-blooded and evil.

620
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,120
But humans are worse.

621
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,910
It's said that if one is jabbed by it,

622
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,210
they'll suffer greatly

623
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,030
and wish they were dead.

624
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,510
The Cloud Light Sword can actually feel your pain.

625
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,350
Are you afraid?

626
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,390
Are you

627
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,810
afraid?

628
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,390
I only

629
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,870
follow my heart.

630
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,410
I don't take orders from anyone.

631
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,020
People say humans are greedy,

632
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,020
cowardly,

633
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,060
and selfish.

634
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,500
They stop at nothing to get what they want.

635
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:12,890
Are you

636
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,430
any different?

637
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,740
Try me.

638
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,210
Sure.

639
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,260
Mr. Zhuo, since you're so stubborn…

640
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,780
how about now?

641
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:40,680
Kill Zhao Yuanzhou for me.

642
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,740
Let's do it together.

643
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,840
You'll help me,

644
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,190
won't you?

645
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,540
Say

646
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,410
you will.

647
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,350
I

648
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,160
will.
