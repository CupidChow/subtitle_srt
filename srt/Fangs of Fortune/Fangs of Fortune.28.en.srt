[Fangs of Fortune]

2
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,020
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,590
Princess Longyu has a bad temper

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,740
and hates to see people,

5
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,539
especially men.

6
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,430
So, we had to let Zhuo and the others

7
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,229
stay in the White Emperor Tower.

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,590
Am I not a man?

9
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,450
You're an ape.

10
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,550
Whenever you need me,

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,940
I'll come to your aid.

12
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,110
Well,

13
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,300
I wanted to eavesdrop on Princess Longyu,

14
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,450
so I cast a spell on Mr. Zhuo and the others

15
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,570
to carry voices

16
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,200
to their ears.

17
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,290
But now,

18
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,640
they heard our words of love.

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,900
It's embarrassing.

20
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,480
Shame on you, Zhao Yuanzhou.

21
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,520
Bastard!

22
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,440
He's talking nonsense!

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,890
Huh.

24
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,150
Mr. Zhuo,

25
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,670
after you became a demon,

26
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,300
your voice turned more sonorous when cursing.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
But you'd better be careful.

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,390
It seems

29
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,050
your ice marks

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,210
are about to crack.

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,550
If Jiu were here

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,570
and saw the powerful great demon

33
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,090
Mr. Zhuo has become,

34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,630
he'd scream with delight.

35
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,920
Jiu is most afraid of great demons.

36
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,670
I think he'd scream

37
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,400
with terror.

38
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,730
What are we having for dinner?

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,000
Sweet and sour ribs?

40
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,440
What do you mean?

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,980
Then why didn't you

42
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,310
buy sugar and ribs?

43
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,590
What?

44
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,520
The ingredients are hard to get in the Wilderness.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,120
I'll make it when we return to the mortal world.

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,120
She's coming.

47
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,329
Baize Goddess.

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,620
Are you Zhu Yan?

49
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,430
See?

50
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,790
I told you

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,140
everyone in the Wilderness knows me.

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,670
The notorious Zhu Yan.

53
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,750
Next time, please finish your words in one go.

54
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,910
Baize Goddess, why did you free me

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,089
and summon me here?

56
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,100
I want

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,399
to ask you for a dragon scale.

58
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,040
Interesting.

59
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,940
Why are there so many people who want my dragon scale today?

60
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,740
Someone else asked you for your dragon scale, too?

61
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,270
If you don't want to die,

62
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,970
give me your dragon scale.

63
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,430
A dragon has a reverse scale,

64
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,990
which you can't touch.

65
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,470
If you touch it, the dragon will get angry.

66
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,330
Neither can you snatch the scale.

67
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,110
If you do, its spiritual energy will disappear.

68
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,310
Only if the dragon gives you the scale willingly

69
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,200
can it resurrect everything.

70
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,860
You don't even know that?

71
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,480
Oh.

72
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,690
There's someone else.

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
Princess Longyu.

74
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,380
Your old friend

75
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,240
asked me to send you a letter.

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,460
[Meng Xuan]

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,150
Meng Xuan.

78
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,970
[To Long Yu] [Meng Xuan]

79
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,640
[Meng Xuan]

80
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,430
There's nothing to expect of this love.

81
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,590
Although I regret it, it's too late.

82
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,720
Meng Xuan.

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,740
Where did you get this?

84
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,340
You want to know?

85
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,590
Give me Zhu Yan's inner core, and I'll tell you.

86
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,910
Why do you want the dragon scale?

87
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm poisoned.

88
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,450
I want to detoxify.

89
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,470
Poisoned?

90
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,880
The goddess is really good at making up stories.

91
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,370
Besides books about demons, there must also be many novels

92
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,120
in the Archives.

93
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,040
She must have read a lot.

94
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,390
Novels?

95
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,380
When I was young,

96
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,390
my grandfather didn't allow me to read novels,

97
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,320
calling them a breach of morality.

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,900
I don't quite understand that.

99
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,270
The novels Wen Xiao read

100
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,830
are not the same

101
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,730
as the novels your grandfather mentioned.

102
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,090
I want the dragon scale

103
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,470
just to live

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
so that I can stay with him

105
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,600
forever.

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,240
Am I right?

107
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,210
Of course.

108
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,020
They say

109
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,240
people who love each other don't always

110
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,250
get together and live happily ever after.

111
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,480
They don't know

112
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,810
there are faithful lovers

113
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,920
who are willing to give up everything for each other.

114
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,420
That's us.

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,340
Faithful lovers?

116
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,430
When a human and a demon fall in love with each other,

117
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,390
it's destined to be a tragedy.

118
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,760
You owe me the dragon scale.

119
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,470
You owe me a life.

120
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,980
Have you forgotten?

121
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,120
No, I haven't.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm willing to hold your hands

123
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,340
and spend the rest of my life with you.

124
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,200
Meng Xuan.

125
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,250
These are the Feng Pearl and the Huang Pearl,

126
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,690
secret treasures of the Longyu Clan.

127
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,620
Now,

128
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,220
I'm giving the Feng Pearl to you.

129
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,910
Feng and Huang are two birds that are always together.

130
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,920
If you don't deceive me,

131
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,230
I'll be with you in life and in death.

132
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,429
Darling.

133
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,700
Don't bother.

134
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,710
I was bitten by the Black Bee.

135
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,510
Herbs in the mortal world

136
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,470
can't cure me.

137
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,270
You will be cured.

138
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,550
I asked Princess Longyu for help.

139
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,380
The reverse scale on the back of her neck can cure all diseases

140
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,170
and bring the dead back to life.

141
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,550
You and the baby

142
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,920
will be fine.

143
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,640
Drink the medicine.

144
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,990
I asked Princess Longyu for help.

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,430
The reverse scale on the back of her neck can cure all diseases

146
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,260
and bring the dead back to life.

147
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,660
But he didn't know

148
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,000
every creature in the river

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,710
could talk to me.

150
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,620
He lied to me.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,740
He just wanted to save his wife and child.

152
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,830
I hated him.

153
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,300
I was jealous of the woman he had been protecting.

154
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,680
So, I wanted to kill them.

155
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,110
Senior.

156
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,620
Meng Xuan.

157
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,190
Yes.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,310
Well...

159
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,150
Take the medicine

160
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,120
to my home and give it to my wife.

161
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,890
Okay.

162
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,710
I have to go out of town now.

163
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,530
Okay.

164
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,290
Don't worry.

165
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,430
I'll go now.

166
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,110
Okay.

167
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,880
But I couldn't bear to kill Meng Xuan.

168
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,150
So, I asked him to meet me outside of town

169
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,330
so he wouldn't be home.

170
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,830
Unexpectedly, he didn't come.

171
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,570
Wen He.

172
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,570
Meng.

173
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,660
Where is Wen Xiao?

174
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,830
I haven't seen her for a long time.

175
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,290
She's grown taller, right?

176
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,400
I heard my senior's wife has lost her appetite recently.

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
I brought her some plums.

178
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,680
Something smells good.

179
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,390
What is it?

180
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,190
Mrs...

181
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
Wen,

182
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,030
it has been...

183
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,390
Wen! Wen!

184
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,360
Guards.

185
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,170
Guards!

186
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,630
I secretly put some Bone-Melting Incense,

187
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,150
a unique poison of our clan,

188
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,210
in Meng Xuan's house.

189
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,160
Bone-Melting Incense?

190
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,550
It's a diffusive poison

191
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,210
made from red mermaid pearls.

192
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,450
Anyone who smells it rots and dies immediately.

193
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,450
It's strictly forbidden to take this poison to the mortal world.

194
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,150
I only wanted to kill his wife and child.

195
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,590
I didn't expect Meng Xuan would stand me up

196
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,330
and go home early.

197
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,740
Maybe God thought he was hateful, too.

198
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,200
He deserved it.

199
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,690
Is there a saying

200
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,440
in the mortal world that goes,

201
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,630
"An innocent person's only crime

202
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,360
is to own something valuable"?

203
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,940
Princess Longyu

204
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,630
may never be able to tell

205
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,670
if her admirers

206
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,240
come for her

207
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,140
or for her dragon scale.

208
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,660
People with a treasure

209
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,510
are always surrounded by bad wolves

210
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,970
and cunning foxes.

211
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,310
In most cases,

212
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,190
in order to protect the treasure,

213
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,050
they become a bloodthirsty beast, too.

214
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,710
It's a choice.

215
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,520
She could choose not to.

216
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,160
No matter what,

217
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,740
sharp teeth and claws

218
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,810
can't be used to hurt the innocent and weak.

219
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,140
Meng Xuan was hateful.

220
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,860
But you deserve death, too.

221
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,200
Meng Xuan's wife was pregnant.

222
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,760
How could you do that?

223
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,010
You also killed my father.

224
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,540
I was guided here by the short flute.

225
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm glad I found you.

226
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,310
I'll pay you back

227
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,360
what I owe you.

228
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,950
But I have a request.

229
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,990
What is it?

230
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,750
If you want my scale,

231
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,710
give me his inner core.

232
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,640
Wen Xiao.

233
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,570
I thought

234
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,400
I could use Princess Longyu's guilt for me

235
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,280
to make her hand over her dragon scale.

236
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,350
Wen Xiao.

237
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,760
But I didn't expect that...

238
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,020
Don't blame yourself.

239
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,440
Not everyone is as kind as you.

240
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,240
Don't let others' wickedness

241
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,910
change your kindness.

242
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,930
Hey.

243
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,930
Don't you think

244
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,770
you look too grim?

245
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,120
It may make others think the Wilderness is going to collapse again.

246
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,100
The Wilderness is not going to collapse.

247
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,260
You are.

248
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,350
I can't believe you're still joking.

249
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,020
Handing over Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core is not an option.

250
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,350
Let's find another way.

251
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,470
Zhao Yuanzhou.

252
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,470
Why is it not an option?

253
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,890
If you hand over my inner core,

254
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,420
you can get the dragon scale

255
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,320
to repair your Cloud Light Sword.

256
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,470
Zhao Yuanzhou.

257
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,130
What you said

258
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,960
insulted Zhuo.

259
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,630
Zhao Yuanzhou,

260
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,210
keep

261
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,200
your inner core.

262
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,570
I won't exchange it

263
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,170
for anything,

264
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,790
not even the Cloud Light Sword.

265
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,310
It's useless to look at them.

266
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,560
The sword is mine.

267
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,750
I have the final say.

268
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,210
But the inner core is mine.

269
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,110
I have the final say.

270
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,890
Zhao Yuanzhou,

271
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,870
don't push me.

272
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,230
I'm not.

273
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,230
I just don't want you

274
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,150
to face this hard choice.

275
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,960
So, I'm going to choose for you.

276
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,770
And it seems

277
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,000
Pei Sijing and Ying Lei

278
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,070
agree with me.

279
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,589
I know you want to save Jiu,

280
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,970
but Zhao Yuanzhou is also our friend.

281
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,140
Can you say

282
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,960
one friend is more important than another?

283
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,849
Why not?

284
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,040
You're a coward,

285
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,750
and you want to treat them fairly,

286
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,640
but that doesn't mean everyone's like you.

287
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,150
If you don't dare to choose,

288
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,950
I dare!

289
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,730
Jiu is more important!

290
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,440
If everyone were fine today,

291
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,260
I wouldn't force Zhao Yuanzhou.

292
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,310
If

293
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,870
Princess Longyu wanted my inner core,

294
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,600
I'd give it to her immediately.

295
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,750
But today,

296
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,120
if either Jiu or Zhao Yuanzhou must die,

297
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,770
I'll choose Zhao Yuanzhou

298
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,350
without hesitation.

299
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,680
Ying Lei.

300
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,720
Every one of you

301
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,990
is saying

302
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,330
pretty words.

303
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,230
Don't you want

304
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,600
to be favored

305
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,230
and be chosen firmly?

306
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,680
Do you think Zhao Yuanzhou doesn't want to be favored

307
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,540
and be chosen firmly?

308
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,510
He

309
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,870
has never been chosen firmly.

310
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,930
Oh, that's not true.

311
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,570
He has.

312
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,550
Malicious energy chose him,

313
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,370
and then everyone gave up on him.

314
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,260
Mr. Zhuo,

315
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,200
don't you want to save Jiu?

316
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,400
He's being kept in that dark place.

317
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,860
He must be scared.

318
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,870
Every time he's most scared,

319
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
you are the one

320
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,470
he wants to turn to!

321
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,190
Mr. Zhuo,

322
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,420
Jiu needs you.

323
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
No matter what,

324
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,490
I'm on Zhuo's side.

325
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,830
We don't agree

326
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,710
to sacrifice Zhao Yuanzhou to get the dragon scale.

327
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,350
It's not "we."

328
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,890
It's only you and Zhuo Yichen.

329
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,500
I thought

330
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,200
we were like-minded.

331
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,190
I was wrong.

332
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,200
Today,

333
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,420
anyone who wants to take Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core

334
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,930
has to defeat me first.

335
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,150
Don't bother.

336
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,180
Don't use violence.

337
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,220
I'll take out my inner core

338
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,610
myself.

339
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,750
Great Demon,

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,570
no!

341
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,600
Zhao Yuanzhou!

342
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,820
I brought Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

343
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,080
Where is the letter?

344
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,980

[To Long Yu]

346
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,210
This letter doesn't mean anything

347
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,850
to me now.

348
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,800
I knew you were still alive.

349
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,520
That day, I did go to the forest

350
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,970

353
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,840
was not me

but my junior.

355
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,000
He was the real Meng Xuan.

356
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,430
Now that I think about it,

357
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,190
I did have feelings for you.

358
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,280
My feelings for you saved me

359
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,790
but caused the death of my loved one.

360
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,660

362
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,290

you came to me again.

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,860
If you hand over my inner core,

382
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,620
you can get the dragon scale.

383
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,260
Are you sure Princess Longyu is coming?

384
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,190
I left some spies at the Chongwu Camp.

385
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,570
The information should be accurate.

386
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,880
What about you?

387
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,640
Are you sure the fake inner core you gave her

388
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,230
can fool Wen Zongyu?

389
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,990
Wen Zongyu is always sinister and cunning.

390
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,860
I hope his strong desire for my inner core

391
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,540
will make him lower his guard.

392
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,090
It seems we're okay now,

393
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,030
but

394
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,020
I don't think he is.

395
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,950
Leave it to me.

396
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,790
Zhuo.

397
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,390
Go away.

398
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,110
Okay.

399
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,610
If I were Mr. Zhuo,

400
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,450
I would be furious.

401
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,550
Most importantly, Mr. Zhuo

402
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,790
is usually serious.

403
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,870
We all acted dramatically.

404
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,920
Only he showed his true feelings.

405
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,610
It was so embarrassing.

406
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,770
Today,

407
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,570
anyone who wants to take Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core

408
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,820
has to defeat me first.

409
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,210
The thing is, Zhuo was in the wrong position.

410
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,450
If he had seen it,

411
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,110
the fish in the water would have seen it, too.

412
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,190
It has nothing to do with his position.

413
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,710
Mr. Zhuo is upright

414
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,070
and honest.

415
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,610
Usually, when he's asked to lie,

416
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,820
his ears turn extremely red.

417
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,270
If we had made him lie,

418
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,650
the fish in the water would have laughed so hard

419
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,420
that they'd have turned upside-down.

420
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,310
So funny.

421
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,270
She's coming.

422
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,660
I've applied a poison of our clan to the inner core.

423
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,330
You're going to die soon.

424
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,270
Don't you miss your wife and child?

425
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,060
Go to hell and keep them company.

426
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm going with you.

427
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,330
So, now you know

428
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:47,090
[Carry on the Legacy]

429
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,550
why I asked you to meet me here, right?

430
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,360
You gave them your reverse scale?

431
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,070
Yes.

432
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,380
But Wen Xiao doesn't know

433
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,710
that for us of the Longyu Clan, once we hand over our reverse scales,

434
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,750
we die.

435
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,840
Yet you know it.

436
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,630
I loved you

437
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,990
and trusted you,

438
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,630
so I told you all my secrets.

439
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,170
But what about you?

440
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,450
The one who deserves to die is you,

441
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,840
Meng Xuan.

442
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,450
You're still calling me by the wrong name.

443
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,310
Don't you think you're pathetic?

444
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,040
I knew you'd play a trick,

445
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,260
so I got prepared.

446
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,900
You didn't let me down.

447
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,140
[Carry on the Legacy]

448
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,350
Meng Xuan!

449
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,610
I'm not Meng Xuan!

450
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,140
It's you.

451
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,430
You killed my wife

452
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,980
and my unborn child.

453
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,130
It's all you demons' fault.

454
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,020
But don't worry.

455
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,940
I'll make all demons in the Wilderness

456
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,190
die with you.

457
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,390
Shall we let him go?

458
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,740
There are about a dozen demonized humans in the yard.

459
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,320
My One-Word Spells won't work on them.

460
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,810
Your Cloud Light Sword hasn't been repaired.

461
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,210
If we fight with them directly,

462
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,740
we'll be at a disadvantage.

463
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,980
Let's not alert them

464
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,400
and see what Wen Zongyu wants to do.

465
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,830
Miss,

466
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,430
I'm in a rush to see a patient.

467
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,390
Sorry.

470
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,300
What's your name?

471
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,210
Meng Xuan.

[The Bloodline is Carried On]

what are you thinking?

475
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,750
I'm thinking about how to repair the Cloud Light Sword

476
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,480
to keep Zhuo alive

477
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,690
and how to defeat Li Lun

478
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,350

479
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,940
What about me?

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,570
You're not thinking about me?

481
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,250
I'm also thinking about you.

482
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,550
Since I met you, an evil great demon,

483
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,920
I've learned more.

484
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,750
What can you learn from me?

485
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,610
Being pessimistic and world-weary?

486
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,660
People can't choose their origins,

487
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,950

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,510
Why is it that every time I finish playing the wooden flute,

551
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,420
my heart aches

552
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,450
as if it's burning.

553
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,580
Okay.

let's seal it.

00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,460

00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,630
No need.

560
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,720
Human livers can only slow down the spread of the poison.

561
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,580
I'm already seriously poisoned.

562
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,730
Don't bother.

563
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,430
Don't worry.

564
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,640
I will get the dragon scale to cure you.

00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,230
stop being angry.

568
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,500
Next time, I'll act with you to fool Zhao Yuanzhou.

569
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,910
There's no next time.

570
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,920
I'm not good at pretending to quarrel,

571
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,000
either.

572
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,630
[One-Word Spell: act]

573
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,040
Zhao Yuanzhou.

574
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,630
Why is it not an option?

575
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,050
Oh.

576
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,050
Take the dragon scale.

577
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,860
You can use it to repair your Cloud Light Sword now.

578
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,330
There's no rush.

579
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,070
This is the only dragon scale.

580
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,830
Besides, we don't know how to repair the sword.

581
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,230
I think we'd better wait for Lord Bai Yan

582
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,310
to come back.

583
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,900
Right.

584
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,110
It's a matter of success and failure.

585
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,110
We can't be hasty.

586
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,200
For the time being,

587
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,110
the dragon scale...

588
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,910
Let me keep it.

589
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,020
You?

590
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,170
What?

591
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,080
Your expression

592
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,890
♫Leaving home, going far away from those mountains♫

593
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,700
is very insulting.

594
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,430
♫And that stream♫

595
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,940
Don't worry.

596
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,430
I'll keep it with me

597
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:02,940
♫The boy wiped away his tears and sang♫

598
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,710
and keep a close eye on it.

599
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,840
Even if Mount Tai collapses in front of me,

600
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,580
I won't even blink.

601
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,640
♫He carried his dreams with him♫

602
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,380
You're a Mountain God.

603
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,620
Is it appropriate for you

604
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,760
♫Jingling all the way♫

605
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,960
to say "Mount Tai collapses"?

606
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,060
♫Wind, rain, and light♫

607
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,240
Okay.

608
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,300
♫Wandering with me♫

609
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,950
I can trust Ying Lei

610
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,030
with the dragon scale.

611
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,330
This is about Jiu.

612
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,330
He'll put it ahead of himself.

613
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:21,480
♫Standing somewhere high and walking into the crowd♫

614
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,350
♫So what if I love the world more?♫

615
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,150
Okay.

616
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,280
But

617
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,220
♫The more ordinary it is, the longer it lasts♫

618
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,670
since Li Lun badly wants to stop us from repairing the sword,

619
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,170
♫The moon is nodding with me♫

620
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,220
he'll definitely come for the dragon scale.

621
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,370
♫A person who falls asleep in a simple way is the gentlest♫

622
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,080
Then I'll fight hard with him.

623
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,080
Seal.

624
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,310
To ensure its safety,

625
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,580
I set a restriction with my power.

626
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,930
No one can open the box.

627
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,240
Then nothing will go wrong.

628
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,860
Mr. Zhuo,

629
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,970
why are you here?

630
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,050
I'm worried.

631
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,050
I'm afraid Li Lun

632
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,870
will take away the dragon scale.

633
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,330
The dragon scale is safe.

634
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,740
I've been keeping an eye on it.

635
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,130
Let me take a look.

636
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,070
Sure.

637
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:06,480
You're not Mr. Zhuo.

638
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,310
You don't smell right.

639
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,580
Oh?

640
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,950
Then tell me

641
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,070
what Mr. Zhuo

642
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,670
smells like.

643
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,830
Cut the crap!

644
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,150
Ao Yin.

645
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,080
Hey!

646
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,350
[Ao Yin]

647
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,850
Stop!

648
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,300
Lord Bai Yan is back.

649
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,860
Let's take the dragon scale to him now

650
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,380
and ask him

651
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,470
how to repair the Cloud Light Sword.

652
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,310
Where is Ying Lei?

653
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,520
[Ao Yin]

654
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,180
It was Ao Yin again.

655
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,150
The dragon scale was taken away.

656
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,040
Looks like Ying Lei went after Ao Yin.

657
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,050
Let's go save him

658
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,850
and get the dragon scale back.

659
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,950
Mr. Zhuo,

660
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,810
what are you doing?

661
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,900
Is he

662
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,450
Ao Yin?

663
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,320
He is not Ao Yin.

664
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,460
He is Zhao Yuanzhou.

665
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,480
But he's hiding something from us.

666
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,200
Mr. Zhuo,

667
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,640
what do you mean?

668
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,960
Was the dragon scale really taken away by Ao Yin?

669
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,510
[Ao Yin]

670
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,960
The golden characters on the white wall

671
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,470
are solid evidence.

672
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,310
My lord,

673
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,650
I got the dragon scale.

674
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,790
I can't open it.

675
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,200
Give it to me.

676
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,800
I don't want the box.

677
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,090
Give me your hand.

678
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,790
My injury

679
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,870
is not serious.

680
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,260
You don't have much demonic power left.

681
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,580
Don't waste it on me.

682
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,820
I'm dying. My demonic power will be wasted

683
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,000
if I still keep it.

684
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,770
If I die,

685
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,120
I'll give you all my demonic power.

686
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,700
It's just a restriction.

687
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,140
Looks like Zhao Yuanzhou

688
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,000
has completely forgotten

689
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,710
he once taught me

690
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,190
all

691
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,380
his tricks.

692
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,900
My lord.

693
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,630
You are seriously poisoned.

694
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,010
Don't use your power lightly anymore.

695
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,610
Where is the dragon scale?
