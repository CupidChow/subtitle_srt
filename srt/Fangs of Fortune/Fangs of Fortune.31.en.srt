1
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,039
How is it?

2
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
I know

3
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,900
it probably can't be detoxified.

4
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,190
I just wanted to give it a try.

5
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,150
It's my fault.

6
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,430
You gave me the dragon scale to save me.

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,960
Silly.

8
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,430
I'm glad to be able to

9
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,800
save you.

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
If I die,

11
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,750
there will be another Baize Goddess.

12
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,230
But Jiu…

13
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,490
There's only one Jiu in the world.

14
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,079
But

15
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,000
in this world,

16
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,250
there's also only one Wen Xiao.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,470
Goddess,

19
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,470
Mr. Zhao,

20
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,110
Tiandu is in trouble.

21
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,920
Why is there a plague suddenly?

22
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,560
The plague is fierce.

23
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,840
The physicians in Tiandu

24
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
are all helpless.

25
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
Could it be caused by a demon?

26
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,960
King Xiang

27
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,960
will definitely put pressure on my father.

28
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
That's what I wanted to tell you too.

29
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
Mr. Fan

30
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,190
is missing.

31
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,040
Father!

32
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,800
It's me.

33
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:25,920
Jiu.

34
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,800
Don't come in.

35
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,690
I've been infected.

36
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,830
It's contagious.

37
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,040
Everyone in Tiandu

38
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,920
has probably been infected.

39
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,320
The origin of this plague

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,159
was a child of an ordinary family.

41
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Unexpectedly, it to spread so fast.

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,190
I suspect this sachet

43
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,310
might be the source of the plague.

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
It's demon blood.

45
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,950
Demon blood?

46
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,830
Which demon's blood?

47
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,800
A demon that we are familiar with.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,720
Fei.

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,310
Fei?

50
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,630
Isn't he dead?

51
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,160
It's...

52
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,310
It's this sachet.

53
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,870
Sister Pei.

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,920
Brother Zhuo.

55
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,310
Step back a little.

56
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,680
Step back.

57
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,360
Good.

58
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
The city

59
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,560
is full of infected civilians.

60
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,430
We are in the city.

61
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
We can't avoid it.

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,580
It'll happen sooner or later.

63
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,830
Jiu,

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,560
do you have any ideas?

65
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,560
I need to study this.

66
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,390
Are you okay?

67
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,120
I can hold on.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,870
But

69
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,600
I haven't detected

70
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,000
the energy of any demons in Tiandu.

71
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,600
Not even Fei's demonic energy.

72
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,190
That's even stranger.

73
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Brother Zhuo?

74
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,630
They said

75
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,270
you stayed here all day

76
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,720
and haven't even eaten.

77
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,580
I'm not hungry.

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,730
Time is running out.

79
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
For a long time

80
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,580
after my father and brother died,

81
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,430
I was the same.

82
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,510
Anxious.

83
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,510
Worried.

84
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,400
It always felt like there wasn't enough time.

85
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,510
Mr. Zhuo.

86
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,830
Actually,

87
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,870
I'm a little scared.

88
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,270
Hold this.

89
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,360
Tell me

90
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,980
why you're scared.

91
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,190
Before,

92
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,600
I always thought

93
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,950
that my dad

94
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,429
killed my mom.

95
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,480
That's why I ran away from home.

96
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,520
I don't remember much about my father.

97
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,600
Every time I thought of him,

98
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,390
I would drown in hatred.

99
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,750
Familial love

100
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,090
is deep within one's body.

101
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,510
Time and distance

102
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,390
can never wipe away its existence.

103
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,720
Do you remember

104
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,000
how I told you

105
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,840
I like the smell of herbs?

106
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,040
Of course I remember.

107
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,510
I was very happy then,

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
because I've been dealing with herbs since I was a kid.

109
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,930
Actually, it's because

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,790
my mother died from sickness

111
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,890
when I was very little.

112
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,080
My memories of her

113
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,440
have blurred too.

114
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,610
But I still remember the smell of herbs on her.

115
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,620
Whenever I smelled the herbs after that,

116
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,360
it felt like

117
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,810
my mother was still holding me.

118
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,670
I see.

119
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,030
It's like how

120
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,150
every time I eat almond buttermilk,

121
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,790
I think of my mother.

122
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,790
Every time I eat delicious food,

123
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
I think of Ying Lei.

124
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,590
Every time I hear a bell,

125
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,120
I think of you, Mr. Zhuo.

126
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,670
But

127
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,510
I haven't sat down with Daddy

128
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,840
and had a proper meal yet

129
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,200
and clear up

130
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,800
the misunderstanding.

131
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,360
Jiu,

132
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,030
you have to believe

133
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,330
that you can cure it.

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,130
There's still time.

135
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,270
But I have no more.

136
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,840
Mr. Zhuo.

137
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,120
You must miss your brother and father

138
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,920
frequently, right?

139
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,790
Yes.

140
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,150
My brother

141
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,120
was an amazing person.

142
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,670
I admired them

143
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,070
and I wanted to become like them.

144
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,840
Mr. Zhuo.

145
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,430
I want to be someone like you too.

146
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,770
What kind of person am I?

147
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,150
At least...

148
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,860
At least someone who's not timid like me,

149
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,990
only daring to

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,060
move forward by holding onto the bell

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
hanging from someone's ribbon.

152
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,240
Since young,

153
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,390
I always wanted to be an older brother

154
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,520
and protect others.

155
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,390
I never did it.

156
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,320
But your appearance

157
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,240
helped me do it.

158
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,280
You turned me

159
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,340
into an older brother.

160
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,480
Mr. Zhuo,

161
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,480
you love your father and brother so much.

162
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,360
How did you survive it?

163
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,930
After they passed away,

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,480
I was depressed for a long time.

165
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,790
Later,

166
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,270
I met someone.

167
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,390
She said

168
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,450
she hoped I wouldn't be worried

169
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,860
and won't indulge in sadness.

170
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,030
I hope you won't indulge in sadness

171
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,080
anymore.

172
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,120
She grew up

173
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,270
with me.

174
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,080
Slowly,

175
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
I healed.

176
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,750
Are you talking about

177
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,270
Wen?

178
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,960
Brother Zhuo,

179
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,080
you love

180
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,910
Wen,

181
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,150
right?

182
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,390
Why don't you tell her?

183
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
There are many kinds of love.

184
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,440
People like roses.

185
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,930
When they pass by a rose,

186
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,320
they'll praise it.

187
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,060
"So fragrant."

188
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,680
"So beautiful."

189
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,480
Then they'll pick it

190
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,330
and place it in their hair,

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,910
on their sleeve.

192
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,910
When others see it,

193
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,630
they all feel envious.

194
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,440
Do you think this is love?

195
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,120
It is.

196
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,930
But there's another kind of love,

197
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,390
which is

198
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,080
watering it every day,

199
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,300
removing insects,

200
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,550
watching it flourish

201
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,000
and sway

202
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,360
in the wind,

203
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,320
becoming more and more beautiful.

204
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,640
Brother Zhuo,

205
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,870
why do I feel like

206
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,270
the second type

207
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,910
is more loving

208
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,490
than the first kind?

209
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,860
Because the second one

210
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,480
is actually...

211
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,480
What is it?

212
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,960
Actually...

213
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,560
I don't really understand either.

214
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,150
Then,

215
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,320
I feel even more sorry toward you.

216
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,120
In order to save me,

217
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,240
Wen's poison…

218
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,870
Did she blame you?

219
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,270
Of course not.

220
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,150
She said

221
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,600
it's not my fault.

222
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,690
Then you should listen to her.

223
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,030
Because

224
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,110
I also listened to her

225
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
when I was little.

226
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,910
Okay.

227
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,080
Are you still going to read?

228
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,440
Yes.

229
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,870
Okay.

230
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,410
I'll stay with you for a while more.

231
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,240
The fog is heavy at night.

232
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,500
It's cold by the water.

233
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,630
Put on a coat.

234
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,960
There's no need

235
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,330
to act tough in front of me.

236
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
Actually, I got used to the pain.

237
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,720
You are a great demon.

238
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,750
Why are you

239
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,440
so attentive?

240
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Great Demons are naturally casual,

241
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,030
but with you,

242
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,930
I'm extraordinarily thoughtful.

243
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,589
My godfather

244
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,069
is renowned.

245
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,720
They all think he is decisive.

246
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Xiao.

247
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,000
Father.

248
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,940
You always lose your pens.

249
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,349
I asked someone...

250
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,200
But actually...

251
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,109
To make these pens just for you.

252
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,720
He is gentle, kind

253
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,350
and thoughtful.

254
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,880
He is really a good father.

255
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,750
But now,

256
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,000
he's alone

257
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,730
and somewhere unknown.

258
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,320
Yet there's nothing I can do.

259
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't worry.

260
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,310
Mr. Fan is my future father too.

261
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,160
I'm waiting

262
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,920
to find Mr. Fan

263
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,720
and then I can…

264
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,920
What?

265
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,490
Return to the Wilderness.

266
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,200
I got it!

267
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,460
I got the solution.

268
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,160
I got it!

269
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,550
Paralysis fruit?

270
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,240
Yes.

271
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,640
Since the plague

272
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,970
is spread by fragrance,

273
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
then let's seal off our sense of smell

274
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,880
and cut off our breathing.

275
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,030
This will work.

276
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,790
This paralysis fruit

277
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,270
was the herb you used

278
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,680
to seal Zhao Yuanzhou's five senses before.

279
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,200
Yes.

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,830
My master developed it himself.

281
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,720
It's even effective for great demons like Zhao Yuanzhou.

282
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,400
It must

283
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,720
also work on humans.

284
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,920
Sealing the sense of smell

285
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,880
is just the first step.

286
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,790
We need to add

287
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,250
wood that repels diseases

288
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,750
to cure the plague from Fei's blood.

289
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,090
You've worked hard.

290
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,270
Fall.

291
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,510
The ingrdients are all set.

292
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,240
Watch me.

293
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,030
Okay.

294
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,850
I know there's a plague in the Tiandu.

295
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,350
If you need it,

296
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,440
you can summon me with this bead.

297
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,500
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

298
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,280
Remember to take the medicine.

299
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,810
Not only should you take it,

300
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,640
but also inform your neighbors,

301
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
friends, and families.

302
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,880
Have them all come and get the medicine.

303
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,890
Where are Wen Xiao and the others?

304
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,270
They sneaked out

305
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,200
to Chongwu Camp.

306
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,920
Fortunately, Sister Pei knows

307
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,850
when Chongwu Camp changes shifts.

308
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,760
Otherwise, we’d be in trouble.

309
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,330
Why can’t the Baize Token find this place?

310
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,480
There are talismans with Zhu Jian's blood in this secret room.

311
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,280
It can block the demonic energy,

312
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,320
so I decided to take a gamble.

313
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,440
Fei should be here.

314
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,510
Yes.

315
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,350
Here.

316
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,240
Yes.

317
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,590
Fei.

318
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,830
Isn’t Fei dead?

319
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,680
It really is Fei.

320
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,070
Mr. Fan.

321
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,350
Zhuo—

322
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,270
Wen Xiao!

323
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,830
Father!

324
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,680
Father!

325
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,200
Father!

326
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,310
Let's go.

327
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,880
Wait.

328
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,310
There an inner core

329
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in Mr. Fan's body.

330
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,180
How can a human have an inner core?

331
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,030
Because I finally created

332
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,480
a real demonized human.

333
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,890
As expected, you're still alive.

334
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,880
Instead of being a human,

335
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,630
why did you turn yourself into this demonic thing?

336
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,200
This is a true rebirth.

337
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Phoenix.

338
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,480
Looks like you are really smart.

339
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,620
Princess Longyu gave you the Phoenix Pearl.

340
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,910
You swallowed the Phoenix Pearl

341
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,350
and turned yourself into a demonized human.

342
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,280
I've always had the Phoenix Pearl.

343
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,350
That's why you tried so hard

344
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,650
to get Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

345
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,070
The inner core

346
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,640
had the Ever-Burning Wood that you wanted.

347
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,370
Zhao Yuanzhou,

348
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,640
in the end,

349
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,670
the heavens made you repay what you owed me.

350
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,270
Not only do I possess the demonic power of Phoenix now,

351
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,760
but I also have the power of the Ever-Burning Wood.

352
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,400
Sir!

353
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,960
You're still alive.

354
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,710
Our great mission is about to be completed.

355
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,590
If you swallow it,

356
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,410
you will be transformed completely.

357
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,040
Now, I have the fire of the Ever-Burning Wood.

358
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,760
I can create demon cores myself.

359
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,870
Soon,

360
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,070
I will have a perfect team of demonized humans.

361
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,030
Dream on.

362
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,790
Today,

363
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,010
I won't let you succeed!

364
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,060
Unfortunately, I've succeeded.

365
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,590
And it was all thanks to you.

366
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,960
Just now,

367
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,530
you personally gave the demon core I created

368
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,440
to all the people in the city.

369
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,330
After tomorrow,

370
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,590
everyone

371
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,590
will gradually transform into demonized humans.

372
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,970
It's the paralysis fruit.

373
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,680
You're still using Bai Jiu.

374
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,160
Wen Zongyu,

375
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,640
you hate demons so much,

376
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,880
but now you chose to be a demon.

377
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,080
Isn't it ridiculous?

378
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,220
You're a demon too.

379
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,270
Don't you think you're ridiculous?

380
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,940
The demons hurt my beloved wife first

381
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,810
and then killed my wife, child, and brother.

382
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,750
The tragedies in the mortal world are all caused by demons.

383
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,830
So I want to kill demons.

384
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,890
I want to kill all demons in the world!

385
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,640
But as a human, I was born with little power.

386
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,440
That's why I must fight for the rest of my life

387
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,030
to create a power that is stronger

388
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,890
and more invincible than demons.

389
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,190
Your loved ones were also killed by demons.

390
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,430
Why don't you understand me?

391
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,410
Understand you?

392
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,160
You disregarded the wishes of the city's people

393
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,640
and turned them into mindless, half-demon

394
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,200
and half-human creatures.

395
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,750
Yet you expect us to understand you?

396
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,500
I'm doing this for their own good.

397
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,790
Demonized humans have no pain

398
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,200
and no worries.

399
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,410
They only have powerful strength.

400
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,640
I'll lead them to kill all the evil monsters,

401
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,040
flatten the Wilderness,

402
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,510
and create a new world.

403
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,770
Wen Xiao,

404
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,490
quickly take Mr. Fan away.

405
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,770
It's the same trick again.

406
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,320
You can only run away, right?

407
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,030
Sir!

408
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,050
The phoenix's power

409
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,270
can control the karmic fire.

410
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,130
The phoenix has an immortal body.

411
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,940
It is reborn from fire.

412
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,510
The greater the karmic fire,

413
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,440
the stronger his spiritual energy is.

414
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,500
We can't defeat him

415
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,240
in the fire.

416
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,880
That's why I brought him

417
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,510
to the icy Mount Kunlun.

418
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,200
The demonic power of Bingyi Clan is best at manipulating ice and snow.

419
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
It happens to be the nemesis of karmic fire.

420
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,030
Zhuo,

421
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,590
do as I say.

422
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,410
Since the sword is has a shape,

423
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,020
flowing water will be traceless.

424
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,060
Flowing water will be traceless.

425
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,530
The origin is formless.

426
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,160
The origin is formless.

427
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,280
It is born from a thought.

428
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,750
It is born from a thought.

429
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,100
This smoke!

430
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,640
It seems to be poisonous.

431
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,440
Seal.

432
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,160
Zhuo!

433
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,110
Zhao Yuanzhou.

434
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,270
Zhao Yuanzhou.

435
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,920
Your new home is really interesting.

436
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,970
Why didn't you invite me earlier?

437
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,350
Zhu Yan.

438
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,640
Long time no see.

439
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,110
Want a drink?

440
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,350
Brother Zhuo!

441
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,450
Let's go.

442
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,210
Let's drink.

443
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,640
There's wine here.

444
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,000
Here.

445
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Kids can't dirnk.

446
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,020
You drink this.

447
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,790
Almond buttermilk.

448
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,920
Jiu.

449
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,510
Didn't you say

450
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,150
you regret not cherishing that time?

451
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,650
Why are you still unhappy?

452
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,330
Look carefully.

453
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,370
Let me try again.

454
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,880
You hurt your hand.

455
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,670
Let's call it a day.

456
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,710
It's just a minor injury.

457
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,670
I'm a man.

458
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,030
I can continue.

459
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,540
We have the future ahead of us.

460
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,480
I will teach you archery well.

461
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,400
There's no rush.

462
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,489
Zhao Yuanzhou.

463
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,110
Long time no see.

464
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,219
When old friends meet,

465
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,790
we should drink more.

466
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,710
Great Demon.

467
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,880
Why are you spacing out?

468
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,800
Come and push the swing for me.

469
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,670
Great Demon,

470
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,710
just help me

471
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,570
push the swing like this forever,

472
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,800
okay?

473
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,510
Okay.

474
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,280
Stay here with me forever.

475
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,480
Look,

476
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,960
everyone is so happy right now.

477
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,360
Didn't you say

478
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,300
you don't like pushing the swing?

479
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,840
If it's for someone I love,

480
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,250
I can push it for the rest of my life.

481
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,260
It would be great if we really could stay here

482
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,660
for a lifetime.

483
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,880
But you know

484
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,590
it's impossible.

485
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,320
Of course I know.

486
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,720
It's just that

487
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,170
I want to consciously be delusional for a moment.

488
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,190
It's a dream.

489
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,510
It should be the Poison of Indulgence in Wen Zongyu's fire.

490
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,770
Poison of Indulgence?

491
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,920
Yes.

492
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,130
It's similar to Ran Yi's dream.

493
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,440
This poison will arouse the greatest desire

494
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,670
in our hearts,

495
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,840
and make us indulge in it,

496
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,710
trapped in this endless dream.

497
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,400
How can we wake up?

498
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,320
Do you remember

499
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,800
the solution to Ran Yi's dream?

500
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,800
Yes.

501
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,720
What's wrong?

502
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,360
What if...

503
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,110
this isn't a dream?

504
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,070
Zhao Wan'er and Li Lun have long died.

505
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,670
How can this not be a dream?

506
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,710
Zhao Yuanzhou.

507
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,190
Wake up!

508
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,800
Brother Zhuo!

509
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,530
Great Demon!

510
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,150
Jiu?

511
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,330
Why are you here?

512
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,760
I went to Chongwu Camp to find you all.

513
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,960
I heard you were here.

514
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,710
You're the one who detoxified us.

515
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,110
Yes.

516
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,970
Luckily I arrived in time.

517
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:20,840
Bai Jiu.

518
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,550
Are you going to fight me too?

519
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,800
I know it's beyond my abilities,

520
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,510
but I have to

521
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,000
stand with my friends.

522
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,150
Ridiculous.

523
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,280
You don't have much demonic power left.

524
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,510
It's useless like an insect trying to shake a tree.

525
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
The inner core is not in his stomach.

526
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,110
He hid the inner core somewhere else.

527
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,110
What should we do?

528
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,000
Only the Truth Eye

529
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,200
or the Golden Pupils of Baize can see it.

530
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,110
Wen Xiao.
