Its name is Meng Ji.

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,920
It looks like a leopard

There were so many bodies in this lake.

149
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,550
It should have strong malicious energy.

150
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,100
But there's so little

151
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,770

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,680
that it's barely enough for me.

153
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,890
The murderer must have absorbed the malicious energy.

154
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,520
So that demon's goal

155
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,770
is to kill people

156
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,130
and absorb malicious energy

157
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
to increase its demon power?

158
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,830
If he just wanted malicious energy from dead people,

159
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,850
why did he have to bring

160
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,050
all the brides' bodies here?

161
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,740
Isn't it strange?

162
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,480
It is.

163
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,480
Only the brides' bodies were dumped here.

164

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,900
what he wants is brides.

168
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,950
He only wants

169
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,060

170
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,270

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,240
you only look powerful.

175
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,270
You know nothing…

182
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,610
To know what demon killed those people,

183

we just need to find their bodies in the mortuary.

184
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,570
I'll know after checking them.

186
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,880

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,380
He's pissed off.

194
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,620
[Mortuary]

195
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,360
It's raining.

196
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,150
This is snow.

197
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,790
I'm a physician,

198
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,750
not a coroner.

199
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,000
I can't do

200
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,070
the autopsy.

201
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,740
The same thing.

202
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,860
The same thing?

203
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,630
Not at all!

204
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,830
You're good at shooting.

205
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,310
Can I say shooting is the same thing

206
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,110
as cotton fluffing?

207
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,970
I can't.

208
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,610
Physicians and coroners are two different jobs.

209
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,190
They're worlds apart.

210
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,910
Good luck.

211
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,670
I'm off.

212
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,260
[Mortuary]

213
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,340
I'll go to Mr. Zhuo to resign.

214
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,760
Sure.

215
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,420
But you'll lose your head in five days.

216
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,550
In five days,

217
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,500
I'll go to Mr. Zhuo to resign.

218
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,720
Why is there no corpse here?

219
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,670
The Chongwu Camp…

220
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,270
The Chongwu Camp did it.

221
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,589
They got rid of all the bodies in advance,

222
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,030
destroying the evidence

223
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,240
to stop us from investigating the case.

224
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,980
Those at the Chongwu Camp are so nice.

225
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,690
No one at the Chongwu Camp is good.

226
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,120
Where is Brother Zhuo?

227
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,180
He went to keep an eye on

228
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,220
the next bride in danger.

229
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,790
The daughter of the Qi family who is about to get married?

230
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,590
Yes.

231
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,140
Master is so cruel.

232
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,540
Yeah.

233
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,790
After all that's happened,

234
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,830
he still insists on Young Lady

235
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,470
getting married in five days as planned.

236
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,620
Yes.

237
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,660
Move the things in.

238
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,410
Don't gossip ever again.

239
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,150
Do you want to end up like Danyan and the others?

240
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,660
Butler Fang.

241
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,440
Should we

242
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,880
burn some joss paper for them

243
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,510
so they can

244
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,510
rest in peace?

245
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,620
I don't want to be haunted.

246
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,100
I told you you were just dreaming.

247
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,790
But I did see…

248
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,790
Don't mention it again!

249
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,400
Yes.

250
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,190
Move it in!

251
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,400
This smell…

252
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,650
Let's go.

253
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,090
Why are you looking at me?

254
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,710
What are you up to this time?

255
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,500
Let me tell you.

256
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,430
I'm going.

257
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,750
Good afternoon.

258
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,540
Are you okay?

259
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,510
I'm fine.

260
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,070
But is he okay?

261
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,860
Why is there another wound?

262
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,190
Isn't it supposed to heal itself?

263
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,760
It's the Demon Slaying Arrow of the Chongwu Camp.

264
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,980
It's laced with a poison specifically designed to target demons.

265
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,380
It keeps the wound from healing

266
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,560
and worsening the ulcer.

267
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,910
It can't be cured.

268
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,580
I can cure it!

269
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,550
[Mortuary]

270
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,980
The Chongwu Camp destroyed all corpses.

271
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,300
Fortunately, I was resourceful

272
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,860
and took a precious body from them.

273
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,270
Sir,

274
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,190
the vanguard squad of the Demon Hunting Bureau

275
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,130
has gone to the crime scene and the mortuary.

276
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,050
They also took a victim's body

277
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,050
from the Chongwu Camp.

278
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,590
Useless idiots.

279
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,020
Leave us.

280
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,970
Yes.

281
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,330
I heard that

282
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,760
over a month ago,

283
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,380
you paid a lot to hire a demon hunter from the Chongwu Camp.

284
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,880
Is that true?

285
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,970
I can't find out anything.

286
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,510
Judging from the bride's expression,

287
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,310
it seems she was scared to death.

288
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,810
That demon scared her to death?

289
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,890
He must look horrifying.

290
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,340
What is this?

291
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,730
The victim is holding it in her hand.

292
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,290
It looks like

293
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,140
a demon's scale.

294
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,290
So that dumbass has run wild.

295
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,760
The case is cracked.

296
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm a little hungry.

297
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,270
Let's talk while eating.

298
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,250
Here's the soup.

299
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,160
You've gone too far.

300
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,950
You asked me, a famous physician in Tiandu,

301
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,460
to do an autopsy like a coroner.

302
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,860
That body was so disgusting.

303
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,020
I can't eat for three days after seeing it.

304
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,620
Sir.

305
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,950
Another bowl of lamb soup.

306
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,590
Six pancakes.

307
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,240
A plate of braised pork.

308
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,750
Also,

309
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,960
pack some pepper and vinegar for me.

310
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,550
A lot of pepper.

311
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,350
Okay.

312
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,370
Here, Jiu.

313
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,430
Thank you.

314
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,940
Wait.

315
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,270
Sister Pei,

316
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,460
you're being so nice to me.

317
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,510
Are you going to ask me

318
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,450
to do something scary again?

319
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,280
Well,

320
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,500
Little Bunny has a brain now?

321
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,750
You don't eat anyway.

322
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,950
Tell me about that demon.

323
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,130
The victim has no wounds on her body

324
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,620
but looks terrified.

325
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,840
They were scared to death.

326
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,830
In the Wilderness,

327
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,910
a lot of demons

328
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,060
can scare people to death.

329
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,570
Say something we don't know.

330
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,690
His name is Ran Yi.

331
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,680
You didn't expect me to cut to the point so suddenly?

332
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,230
Ran Yi?

333
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,520
The demon whose flesh is said to be able to

334
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,810
help with sleep?

335
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,810
He was born with the ability to control dreams.

336
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,430
He can indeed make people fall asleep.

337
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,880
He can control dreams?

338
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,070
Can he make me have the dream

339
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,770
of being the best physician every day

340
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,930
and never wake up?

341
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,040
Good dreams are the reflection of our wishes.

342
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,280
They're good,

343
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,110
but they're like the moon in the lake

344
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,690
that disappears when you touch it.

345
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,490
So don't get obsessed with them.

346
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,070
Fine.

347
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,870
But most people

348
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,770
in the world

349
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,510
can never reach the real moon in their whole lives.

350
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,140
For them,

351
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,770
although the moon in the water

352
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,040
is just an illusion,

353
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,530
having it for just a moment

354
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,280
can make them content enough.

355
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,790
However,

356
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,530
some people

357
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,150
never rely on dreams.

358
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,570
They're down-to-earth

359
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,070
and work hard.

360
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,240
For example…

361
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,760
Mr. Zhuo.

362
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,170
He never talks big

363
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,540
and is a man of his word.

364
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,790
Can't you see anyone else

365
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,320
except for your role model?

366
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,270
But it's true that Zhuo

367
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,090
never has dreams.

368
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,050
Really?

369
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,570
That's strange.

370
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,160
I've never heard of anyone who doesn't dream.

371
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,310
Everyone wants to escape from certain things.

372
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,830
At night,

373
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,520
they hide in their dreams

374
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,570
to catch their breath.

375
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,580
That's human nature.

376
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,570
I don't dare to sleep

377
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,100
or dream.

378
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,390
Whenever I fall asleep,

379
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,570
I dream about

380
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,780
becoming a demon.

381
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,100
So Ran Yi is good at

382
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,070
trapping people in dreams

383
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,970
and scaring them to death.

384
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,500
So Ran Yi

385
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,390
gives people bad dreams

386
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,790
instead of good ones?

387
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,910
The record is wrong again.

388
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,800
Then how can we deal with Ran Yi?

389
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,940
You need to either have the Truth Eye

390
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,740
or

391
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,200
cut off a piece of his flesh to eat.

392
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,440
It's better to do it when he's alive.

393
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,640
The flesh can have the best effect that way.

394
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,500
You're the worst, Zhao Yuanzhou.

395
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,940
By the way,

396
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
what is the Truth Eye you just mentioned?

397
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,520
Why have I never read about it in books?

398
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,870
It's something

399
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,600
only the greatest demons in the Wilderness have.

400
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,300
Forget about that.

401
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,550
Focus on the case.

402
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,660
Master,

403
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,860
Young Lady's wedding dress and dowry are ready.

404
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,860
Then hurry up and get it done.

405
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,710
Don't miss the auspicious day.

406
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,430
But Master,

407
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,620
what if the Water Ghost comes to take her away?

408
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,910
I spent so much money raising her.

409
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,140
She should be grateful.

410
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,220
Even if she were to die,

411
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,610
she should die on her way to get married.

412
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,540
Once the wedding procession from Duke Zhen's Mansion

413
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,350
takes her away from here,

414
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,570
she has nothing to do with us.

415
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,710
I just want to keep the betrothal gifts

416
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,080
and let my son

417
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,700
marry the daughter of the deputy prefect in style.

418
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,780
But Master,

419
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,820
after all, Young Lady...

420
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Enough!

421
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,540
Now that we know the murderer is Ran Yi,

422
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,980
let's go catch him.

423
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,610
We signed the Military Order.

424
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,840
Our heads are still hanging by a thread.

425
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,930
I don't know where he is.

426
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,220
How can we catch him?

427
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,750
With our minds?

428
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,410
Both of you are demons.

429
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,020
Can't you track his scent?

430
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,980
Dogs track scents.

431
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,050
Even dogs…

432
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,890
are more capable than you.

433
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,390
You said you'd help me find my brother.

434
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,610
Were you just bragging too?

435
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,120
Mr. Zhuo?

436
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,180
I know how to find Ran Yi.

437
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,610
The one who's better than a dog is here.

438
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,470
Miss Qi will get married in five days.

439
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,370
Her wedding date hasn't been delayed.

440
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,700
If we watch over Miss Qi,

441
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,020
we can find Ran Yi.

442
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
What's wrong with Master Qi?

443
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,860
Marrying off her daughter now

444
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,410
is sending her to be killed by the Water Ghost.

445
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,530
Mr. Zhuo,

446
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,820
you found something else, didn't you?

447
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,190
Qi's Mansion

448
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,880
is full of a strange smell.

449
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,420
Strange smell?

450
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,680
In the yard,

451
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,460
there's the energy of demon-slaying spells.

452
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,560
It's been eight years.

453
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,530
Zhao Yuanzhou.

454
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,660
Do you still remember your old friend?

455
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,110
You've made so many new friends.

456
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,630
Which one of them should I kill first?

457
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,750
As usual,

458
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,640
I'll start with Baize Goddess.

459
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,070
Show.

460
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,790
Come out.

461
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,410
Stop playing mysterious.

462
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,380
Come to me now,

463
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,150
or I'll set the lake ablaze

464
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,270
and make you a fish soup.

465
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,660
Kneel.

466
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,030
Don't use your little tricks against me.

467
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,330
The illusions you created

468
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,530
can only deceive mortals.

469
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,640
I know you have the Truth Eye.

470
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,490
Of course I can't fool you.

471
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,080
But it's not easy for other demons

472
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,250
to see through the illusions.

473
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,060
Even if you're just a fish,

474
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,770
you still need to treat your wound.

475
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,820
To get you this medicine,

476
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,200
I had to pretend that I was hurt by the Demon Slaying Arrow too.

477
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,270
Why is there another wound?

478
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,830
That was so disgraceful for me.

479
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,420
When will you

480
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,810
fulfill your promise to me?

481
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,250
Don't worry.

482
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:20,810
Soon.

483
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,610
Master.

484
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,040
Some officers from the Demon Hunting Bureau asked to see you.

485
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,449
They're quick.

486
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,550
You know what to do, don't you?

487
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,590
Yes.

488
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,469
I'll go meet them.

489
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,260
Walk the general out

490
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,570
through the back door.

491
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,590
Lead the way.

492
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,070
Please.

493
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,909
Please.

494
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,950
Lead the way.

495
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,030
Coming.

496
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,080
[Wedding Letter]

497
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,070
Officers,

498
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,050
this is the wedding letter left by the Water Ghost.

499
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,070
See if you can

500
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,040
find anything special about it.

501
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,830
Wedding letter?

502
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,230
Where is Miss Qi?

503
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,320
She…

504
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,710
My daughter

505
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,950
was too frightened

506
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,990
and caught a cold.

507
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,080
She has been bedridden for days

508
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,690
and can't see any visitors.

509
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,230
There's demonic energy.

510
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,420
Some demon is lurking around.

511
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,000
The wedding letter

512
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,970
has strong demonic energy left on it.

513
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,270
Mr. Qi,

514
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,990
have you set up a formation

515
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,160
in your mansion to kill demons?

516
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,280
To be honest, officers,

517
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,630
the whole household is in a panic.

518
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,270
So

519
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,240
I asked someone to set up a formation

520
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,630
to calm them down.

521
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,760
Before the Water Ghost case,

522
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,330
was there anything unusual in the mansion?

523
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,730
We lived a peaceful life.

524
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,640
Nothing unusual.

525
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,670
Mr. Qi.

526
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,360
If you really want to save your daughter,

527
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,620
you need to be honest with us

528
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,780
and hide no secrets.

529
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,600
Of course.

530
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,020
Please

531
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,860
save my daughter.

532
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,450
[God of Happiness]

533
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,160
Something's wrong with Master Qi.

534
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,610
The case file doesn't mention

535
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,580
anything about the wedding letter from the Water Ghost.

536
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,380
No.

537
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,620
Only Miss Qi received it.

538
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,780
It seems that Miss Qi

539
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,140
is the key to solving the Water Ghost case.

540
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,350
But we can't see her.

541
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,520
Hey.

542
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,520
The Qi family is really unlucky.

543
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,930
It was supposed to be great that Miss Qi was getting married,

544
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,850
but such a misfortune befell her.

545
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,690
Exactly.

546
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,790
Over the past month,

547
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,910
a lot of things happened in the mansion.

548
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,350
No one knows why.

549
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,100
Over the past month?

550
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,980
What happened before?

551
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,950
Nothing.

552
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,340
I know nothing.

553
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,430
I-I really don't know.

554
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,910
He has a bad temper,

555
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,390
not easy to deal with.

556
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,990
I-I really don't know.

557
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,610
Tell us.

558
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,470
I only know

559
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,070
a month ago, Master secretly

560
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,090
hired a demon hunter from the Chongwu Camp

561
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,940
and forbade us from telling anyone about it.

562
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,500
As for

563
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,410
the reason,

564
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,880
I-I really don't know.

565
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,940
Anything else?

566
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,890
No.

567
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,630
That's all I know.

568
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,750
As early as over a month ago,

569
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,880
Master Qi hired a demon hunter.

570
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,590
But Ran Yi's wedding letter

571
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,620
has just arrived.

572
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,980
Do you know

573
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,550
where the demon hunter is?

574
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,520
I know.

575
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,840
Master.

576
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,760
As you ordered,

577
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,260
I've told them

578
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,960
that you hired a demon hunter

579
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,350
over a month ago.

580
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,030
Did you tell them

581
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,830
where the demon hunter is?

582
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,790
I did.

583
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,060
If nothing happens,

584
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,610
they should have set off.

585
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:29,990
Hey.

586
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,720
Great Demon.

587
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,920
Why isn't there any task assigned to me?

588
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,540
Of course there is.

589
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,010
Your task is to stay away from the battlefield.

590
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,540
Don't cause us any trouble.

591
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,210
Why aren't you catching the demon?

592
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,580
You let Brother Zhuo and Sister Pei do all the work

593
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,110
while you idle around here.

594
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,820
Why are you scolding Wen Xiao so harshly?

595
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,240
I…

596
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,280
Wen.

597
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,630
He's trying to sow discord between us.

598
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,810
Don't fall for it.

599
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,020
We're waiting,

600
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,340
not idling around.

601
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,610
If the demon tries to escape,

602
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,350
this is his only way out.

603
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,740
We just need to wait for him to show up.

604
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,580
Okay.

605
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,450
Humph!

606
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,510
Do the demons in the Wilderness

607
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,710
only drink water

608
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,990
and not eat?

609
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,110
We don't even have to drink water.

610
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,390
Low-maintenance pets.

611
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,840
Then do you want to have one?

612
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,030
Since I was young,

613
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,470
every pet I kept has died.

614
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,950
That's very tempting.

615
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,060
Since you don't need water,

616
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,180
why are you always holding a bottle?

617
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,860
It serves a special purpose?

618
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Zhao Yuanzhou.

619
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,710
I've always suspected

620
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,370
what's in your bottle is wine,

621
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,190
but I have no evidence.

622
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,660
It's indeed water.

623
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,400
I simply like drinking water.

624
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,510
Just like some tree demons

625
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,280
like sunbathing.

626
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,180
What kind of water is it?

627
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,490
You want to get something out of me?

628
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,430
As your colleague,

629
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,750
I just want to know more about you.

630
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,460
I advise you not to.

631
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,990
Why?

632
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,340
Because the more you know about me,

633
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,100
the more…

634
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,720
Dangerous!

635
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,320
Run, run!

636
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,880
If you want to catch up,

637
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,070
come with me.

638
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,230
Wen Xiao!

639
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,420
Stay hidden!

640
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,350
What are you doing here?

641
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,210
He'd have run away if I hadn't come.

642
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,970
Do you think I'll let him run away?

643
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,490
Open your eyes.

644
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,270
Don't kill him!

645
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,410
Li Lun.

646
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,170
You're playing that parasite game again.

647
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,150
You're not used to not having

648
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,110
your Truth Eye, are you?

649
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,800
Li Lun?

650
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,680
Li Lun, who killed my master.

651
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,530
Li Lun,

652
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,770
do you admit your crimes?

653
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,120
Zhao Wan'er,

654
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,080
you're just a mortal.

655
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,600
Who are you to interfere in the affairs of the Wilderness?

656
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,500
I'm from the Baize bloodline,

657
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,740
so it's my duty to protect the Wilderness.

658
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,010
Of course I have to intervene.

659
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,950
Then I'll kill you.

660
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,570
Let's see how you can intervene then.

661
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,850
Master!

662
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,460
Master!

663
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,370
Master.

664
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,520
Master!

665
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,310
She's close to remembering it.

666
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,100
How about

667
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,860
I help her?

668
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,300
Wen Xiao!

669
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,190
How about now?

670
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,680
Do you remember everything?
