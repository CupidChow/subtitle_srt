1
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,970
You are really pitiful.

2
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,400
You are the loneliest person in the world.

3
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,710
My unique talent I'm proud of

4
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,120
can be easily seen through

5
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,710
by your Truth Eye.

6
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,310
A destined enemy like you

7
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,240
is so boring.

8
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,750
I shall give you the Truth Eye.

9
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,280
In this way,

10
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,240
no one in the world can see through you.

11
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,840
Zhu Yan.

12
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,030
Won't you regret it?

13
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,210
How long has it been

14
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,550
since we played Go so peacefully

15
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,710
as we are now?

16
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,050
I don't remember anymore.

17
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,360
Indeed.

18
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,310
Some things

19
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,120
are better forgotten.

20
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,680
Sacrificing a pawn to gain an advantage,

21
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,280
advancing step by step with careful strategy.

22
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,560
In the end, you only took one piece.

23
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,400
Is this fun?

24
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,810
As expected, after staying with humans for a long time,

25
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,520
you start

26
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,470
beating around the bush too.

27
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,840
Life is like chess.

28
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,950
If you were wrong right from the start...

29
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,269
Life is like chess?

30
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,000
But I don't want to be a human.

31
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,000
You are the one

32
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
who wants to be human.

33
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,830
One of us

34
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,159
will lose,

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,860
and the other will win.

36
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,159
We can draw too.

37
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,800
Draw?

38
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,159
You said it yourself.

39
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,430
We can draw.

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I don't mind being the best with you.

41
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,590
You still have a chance to make up for it.

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,510
How?

43
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,630
Leave Bai Jiu's body

44
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,310
and let him live.

45
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,950
Zhu Yan.

46
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
Your peace resolution

47
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,240
is for me to die?

48
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,040
He is your friend.

49
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,480
I was

50
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,070
your friend too.

51
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,000
Zhao Yuanzhou.

52
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,680
What's wrong?

53
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,409
Great Demon!

54
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,280
Great Demon?

55
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,980
He has lost all his demonic power.

56
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,270
He's no different from a human.

57
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,740
Your demonic power...

58
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,890
Was it to rebuild the Cloud Light Sword for me?

59
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,560
No.

60
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,830
I'm here to save Bai Jiu.

61
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,070
Zhao Yuanzhou...

62
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,870
You made yourself such a mess.

63
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,060
You don't deserve to be my opponent anymore.

64
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,950
Li Lun.

65
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,360
Your opponent

66
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
is me.

67
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,680
Zhuo!

68
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,340
Zhao Yuanzhou.

69
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,750
Lord Bai Yan,

70
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,880
I'll leave it to you.

71
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,680
Goddess,

72
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,860
I will protect you.

73
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,890
With a human's body...

74
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,180
That's seeking death.

75
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,200
Heng.

76
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,730
Bingyi Sword Technique is indeed powerful.

77
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,270
But you don't dare to hurt me.

78
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,390
By avoiding the vital parts,

79
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,320
you will lose.

80
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,910
Wen Xiao!

81
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,910
The poison in your body hasn't been detoxified.

82
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,770
Don't force it!

83
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,480
Wen Xiao.

84
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,790
We must control him.

85
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,570
Otherwise Zhuo can't take away Li Lun's spirit.

86
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,600
If anything goes wrong,

87
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,550
both Li Lun and Jiu will perish.

88
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Wen Xiao.

89
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,670
What are you afraid of?

90
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,360
I'm here.

91
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,160
Let's go!

92
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,240
J...

93
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,270
Jiu...

94
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,960
Jiu!

95
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,550
I was not used to

96
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,290
not having you around.

97
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,550
Ying Lei!

98
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,360
Mr. Zhuo!

99
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,170
The root of the pagoda tree...

100
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,270
I gave you my Truth Eye.

101
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,870
You gave me the root of your pagoda tree.

102
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,080
We used to be best friends,

103
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,970
but now we turned against each other.

104
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,770
The pagoda tree is your primordial tree.

105
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,050
If you remove your inner core from Bai Jiu's body

106
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,870
and lead it to the root of the pagoda tree,

107
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,130
after you cultivate for a hundred years,

108
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,670
you can still take human form.

109
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,710
Zhao Yuanzhou still doesn't want your soul to disappear.

110
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,320
This is his last mercy to you.

111
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,270
Promise me

112
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,670
to spare his life.

113
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,200
Tell him...

114
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,510
I did it.

115
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:53,960
Ying Lei.

116
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Jiu is fine.

117
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,600
Pass him to me.

118
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,120
Little girl,

119
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,960
the temple is a solemn place.

120
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,910
Please be quiet.

121
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,610
Who are you calling "Miss"?

122
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,880
Go take some medicine if you're blind!

123
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,840
Why is your name

124
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,390
Bai Jiu?

125
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,080
Why not Yellow Wine or Hua Tiao?

126
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,270
Mr. Zhuo...

127
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,680
Ying Lei.

128
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,350
Mr. Zhuo...

129
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,270
Jiu...

130
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
admires you the most.

131
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,550
This time,

132
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,550
it was me...

133
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,200
who saved him...

134
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,400
Mountain God.

135
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,790
You're amazing.

136
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,790
I like...

137
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,960
hearing Mr. Zhuo...

138
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,070
calling me

139
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,640
amazing...

140
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,160
Jiu.

141
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,090
You're amazing.

142
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
What about me?

143
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,720
Shouldn't you praise me?

144
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,570
Mountain God Ying Lei,

145
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,840
you're amazing too.

146
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,000
You're better than me.

147
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,750
You're the hero who saved Jiu.

148
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,910
You are the best

149
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,400
mountain god

150
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,920
I've ever seen.

151
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,480
You're also the best cook.

152
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,480
Jiu.

153
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,510
You'll surely become

154
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,350
the best physician in the world.

155
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,310
Go for it.

156
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,160
Jiu...

157
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,240
You'll surely become

158
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,270
the greatest

159
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,000
Doc...

160
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,270
Doctor...

161
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,780
in the world...

162
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,270
Demon!

163
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
Little Mountain God!

164
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,350
Ying Lei!

165
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,880
Ying Lei.

166
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,590
I'm ready.

167
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,930
Are you coming?

168
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,750
Let's go.

169
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,790
Mr. Zhuo...

170
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,070
I want to

171
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,200
stay with

172
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,070
everyone.

173
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,510
I'm...

174
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
scared.

175
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,200
Jiu.

176
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,350
Mom.

177
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,160
Mom.

178
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,350
I'm sorry.

179
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,140
I made you wait for a long time.

180
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,880
Mom.

181
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,550
We can draw.

182
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,160
Li Lun

183
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,510
left this message

184
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,680
for you.

185
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,720
Tell him...

186
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,240
this time...

187
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,160
This time...

188
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,510
we draw.

189
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,000
Why didn't you tell us?

190
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,240
After you forged the sword with Ever-Burning Wood,

191
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
you've lost all your demonic power.

192
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,920
Would saying it

193
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,130
make a difference?

194
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,000
This sword must be cultivated.

195
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,960
Wen Xiao risked her life for this.

196
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,920
So what if I don't have

197
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,380
my demonic power anymore?

198
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,020
But you're worse than a human now.

199
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,920
Normal people

200
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,200
are not that weak.

201
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,270
Look.

202
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,440
I don't want to tell you

203
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,830
because I don't want to see you like this.

204
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,270
Every generation of the Bingyi Clan is the God of War.

205
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,640
But your gaze is so resentful right now.

206
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,000
If your Bingyi ancestors see it,

207
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
they'll beat you to death.

208
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,320
What are you talking about?

209
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,480
I'm more used to

210
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,120
hearing you scold me.

211
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,750
Let's go.

212
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,070
Ying Lei!

213
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,680
Ying Lei!

214
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,880
Ying Lei!

215
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,680
Ying Lei!

216
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,680
Ying Lei!

217
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,440
Ying Lei!

218
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,590
Ying Lei!

219
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,960
Ying Lei!

220
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,000
Ying Lei!

221
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,280
Ying Lei!

222
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,070
Ying Lei!

223
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,160
Ying Lei!

224
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,750
Jiu.

225
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,510
Jiu.

226
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,510
Cry if you want.

227
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
I'll be with you.

228
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,070
Tears

229
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,710
has nothing to do with age

230
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,100
and nothing to do with strength or weakness.

231
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,720
It has something to do with our hearts.

232
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,380
Humans are soft-hearted.

233
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,400
Soft things

234
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,720
will always be pricked by something hard and cold.

235
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,000
Death

236
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,720
is the hardest and coldest thing

237
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,070
in this world.

238
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,750
Ying Lei asked me to bring this to you.

239
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,070
I brought it.

240
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,120
Ying Lei left it for me?

241
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,640
Yes.

242
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
It looks like

243
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,790
almond cheese.

244
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,110
My mom's almond cheese is better.

245
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Almond cheese?

246
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,160
Yes.

247
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,070
Got it.

248
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,510
This little cook

249
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,560
is really a fool.

250
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,000
Who makes a whole pickle jar

251
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
of almond cheese?

252
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,340
It'll spoil in just a few days.

253
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,310
Ying Lei.

254
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,870
Are you making pomegranate wine again?

255
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,640
No.

256
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,960
It's almond cheese.

257
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,440
Silly kid.

258
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,110
It'll spoil

259
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,170
if you make so many.

260
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,000
Just use some spells.

261
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,590
I've figured it out.

262
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,250
No wonder your grandpa always scolds you.

263
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,830
He said you always use your power

264
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,680
on important things.

265
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,240
Who said it's not important?

266
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,440
It's very important.

267
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,030
My grandpa never understood

268
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,550
why I want to be a cook.

269
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:50,070
That's because he seldom goes to the mortal world.

270
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,750
Behind every favorite dish,

271
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,270
there is someone who cares about you the most.

272
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,070
One's mother,

273
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,510
brother,

274
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,750
lover,

275
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,680
and friend.

276
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,880
Only those who cherish you the most

277
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,960
will always cook the same dish for you.

278
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,920
I heard that

279
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,440
all homesickness

280
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,400
can be turned into a dish.

281
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,320
It can tug on your stomach

282
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,550
and your heart.

283
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,650
So that when you wander around,

284
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,030
you always want to go home.

285
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,810
When Jiu comes back

286
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,310
and eat the almond cheese

287
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,400
his mom made for him the most,

288
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,790
he must be very happy.

289
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,400
Give it to him yourself.

290
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,460
Why are you giving it to me?

291
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,270
I don't listen to my grandpa.

292
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,040
But my grandpa has a good saying.

293
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,350
Ying Lei,

294
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,000
if you want to be the best cook in the world,

295
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,810
you need to know all kinds of flavors.

296
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
There are only

297
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,910
two places on a human body

298
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,000
that can taste.

299
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,750
One is tongue,

300
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,550
and the other

301
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,960
is heart.

302
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,960
Sister Pei.

303
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,880
Are you sad about Ying Lei's death?

304
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,960
I'm not sad.

305
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,199
I'm blaming myself.

306
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,320
If I could be stronger

307
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,800
and more powerful,

308
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,150
maybe Ying Lei wouldn't have died.

309
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,389
I'm also a human.

310
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,320
So is Zhuo.

311
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,070
But we

312
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,400
are all indispensable.

313
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,070
You’re the Baize Goddess.

314
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,130
Mr. Zhuo is from the Bingyi bloodline.

315
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,840
I'm the only

316
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,440
most useless mortal.

317
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,510
I couldn't save Jiu

318
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,760
nor Ying Lei.

319
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,030
Now I need my brother's puppet to protect me.

320
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,840
If you hadn't protected me,

321
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,880
I would have died.

322
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,280
No one can protect everyone.

323
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,320
Great Demon is so strong.

324
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,070
He needs us sometimes.

325
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,510
He wouldn't need me.

326
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,400
But I need you.

327
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,640
Before you know how to protect others,

328
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,300
you have to learn to protect yourself first.

329
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,760
Got it?

330
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,670
Brother Zhuo will protect me.

331
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,960
Maybe after this,

332
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,000
I...

333
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,200
Brother Zhuo.

334
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,000
What did you say?

335
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,800
I said you're a skilled doctor.

336
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,440
You should know how to protect and take care of

337
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,280
these friends around you who've been through thick and thin with you.

338
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,190
Of course.

339
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,110
I'm confident in this.

340
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,710
Especially Wen.

341
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,590
She's unlucky.

342
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,570
She's always riddled with troubles and illness.

343
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,840
Take care of her health.

344
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,070
As for Ms. Pei,

345
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,070
she can take care of herself,

346
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,040
but she sometimes acts tough

347
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,760
and would feel inferior.

348
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,710
And Zhao Yuanzhou...

349
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,760
Wait.

350
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,760
Brother Zhuo.

351
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,320
Why do I feel

352
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,030
you're acting weird today?

353
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,710
Maybe

354
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,210
the departure of Little Mountain God

355
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,840
made me cherish you more.

356
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,000
Can the poison on Wen Xiao

357
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,460
really not be detoxified?

358
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,040
There is no antidote at all.

359
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,760
Unless someone is willing to use their demonic power

360
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,020
to absorb the poison into their own body.

361
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
That's what he said.

362
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,550
Looks like

363
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,190
we can only find another way.

364
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,070
Ao Yin

365
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,360
transferred the poison in her body away with demonic power.

366
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,840
She transferred it away?

367
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Don't tell

368
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,920
Mr. Zhuo about this.

369
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
I understand.

370
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,880
But Wen Xiao

371
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,710
won't let you do that.

372
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,030
Let's go.
