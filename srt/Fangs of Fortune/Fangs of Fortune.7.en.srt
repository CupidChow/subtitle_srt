[Episode 7]

3
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,750
I have a question for you.

4
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,759
Not ashamed to ask,

5
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,700
you've become a good boy now.

6
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,970
Forget about it.

7
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,290
What's your question?

8
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,440
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,620
♫Beneath the bodhi tree, dust gathers♫

10
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,890
♫Who truly decides fate's design?♫

11
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,170
I beg you to ask.

12
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,040
♫Vividly painted in black and white♫

13
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,500
Wen Xiao seems

14
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,070
to be doing a lot better.

15
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,010
♫It's water under the bridge♫

16
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,270
Is it because...

17
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,570
You know what? Let's just drop it.

18
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,190
♫The moon sheds her light on my heart♫

19
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,900
You...

20
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,470
King Xiang wants us
back to report by noon.

21
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,430
Why are you walking so slowly?

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,370
♫The good old days are gone for good like that lantern in my dream♫

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,760
Do you wanna get killed?

24
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,620
-Your fault. -Your fault.

25
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,940
♫See immortals enter Penglai♫

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,890
Jiu!

27
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,660
Brother Zhuo!

28
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,030
I'm so glad to see you back.

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,710
I was freaked out!

30
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,350
I was waiting for you
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

31
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,990
They said if you don't come back
to report by noon,

32
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,630
everyone will pay with their lives.

33
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,310
I was afraid you'd leave me and run away,

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,190
and I'd be the only one

35
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,630
to suffer in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,590
So I came out to welcome you

37
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,620
but accidentally

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,860
ended up in this mountain god temple.

39
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,190
There's a demon inside!

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,390
Let's go in and check.

41
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,790
Let's go.

42
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,870
Where's the demon?

43
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,230
Jiu.

44
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,190
No demons here.

45
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,510
There is one!

46
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,150
There's definitely one here!

47
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,350
No demons.

48
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,470
There is one.

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,880
Such a big one here.

50
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,390
It's not funny.

51
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,590
They've gone for quite a while.

52
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,450
Could they have run into trouble?

53
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,400
If they still don't come back,

54
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,150
you will be in big trouble.

55
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,810
There's only a quarter of an hour left.

56
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,510
The Demon Hunting Bureau

57
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,660
shall either hand in the closing document

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,950
or

59
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,040
kill those five persons,

60
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,990
This is my turf;

61
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,630
I am the boss.

62
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,600
If you want to pass...

63
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,270
Little brat,

64
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,630
ditching school

65
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,830
to be a bandit here?

66
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,720
Little?

67
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,510
♫Leaving home, going far away from those mountains♫

68
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,370
Who do you call little?

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,940
♫And that stream♫

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,670
♫The boy wiped away his tears and sang♫

71
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,440
♫He carried his dreams with him♫

72
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,490
♫Jingling all the way♫

73
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,750
♫Wind, rain, and light♫

74
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,010
♫Wandering with me♫

75
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,510
Little girl,

76
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,230
the temple is a solemn place.

77
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,450
Please be quiet.

78
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,840
Who are you calling "girl"?

79
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,310
Not a girl?

80
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,480
He's so short.

81
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,820
He just hit a nerve directly.

82
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,930
Why are you laughing?

83
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,690
I...

84
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,380
You really broke his heart,

85
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,400
boy.

86
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,640
Boy?

87
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,840
If I tell you my age,

88
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,460
you'll certainly freak out.

89
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,550
This man

90
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,920
is 34,000 years old.

91
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,000
It's this demon.

92
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,380
A thousand-year-old demon.

93
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,440
Who are you calling a demon?

94
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,040
Other than demons,
immortals are also as old as the hills.

95
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,940
Got it?

96
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,950
You're in a mountain god temple.

97
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,560
I

98
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,409
am the Mountain God, Yinglei!

99
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,240
If you dare to offend me in my place,

100
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,280
you'll end up

101
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,220
just like those people
crying out on the ground.

102
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,310
Who is he?

103
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,090
He sounds so full of himself.

104
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,200
Half a demon.

105
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,670
He is half-god and half-demon,

106
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,730
a scion of the Mountain God Yingzhao.

107
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,030
Did your grandpa let you

108
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,540
leave home so easily?

109
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,320
The Mountain God of the Wilderness
is already stuck in a mess

110
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,840
and has no time for me.

111
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,240
The Wilderness?

112
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,240
What happened in the Wilderness?

113
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,840
After the Baize Token disappeared,

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,770
the Wilderness began to collapse.

115
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,430
Grandfather and the others had to close

116
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,620
the Kunlun Gate

117
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,809
and cut off the connection
between the Wilderness and the mortal realm.

118
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,940
That's how the collapse was relieved.

119
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,070
But after that,

120
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,870
another monster appeared,

121
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,570
opening the Kunlun Gate by force
without authorization.

122
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,870
Then loads of demons flocked
into the mortal world,

123
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,050
causing chaos in both realms.

124
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,170
That's the root

125
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,630
of the further decreased and unsustainable

126
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,230
spiritual energy in Kunlun.

127
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,770
Grandpa and other Mountain Gods

128
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,640
had no choice but to use their divine power

129
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,370
to barely maintain stability.

130
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,200
But we don't know how long
they have to hold on.

131
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,910
Ugh,

132
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,270
so annoying.

133
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,440
It’s all that Baize Goddess's fault.

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,580
The Wilderness is about to collapse,

135
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,740
yet where is she?

136
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,710
You are really unfilial.

137
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,310
Your grandpa's fighting so hard in the Wilderness,

138
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,420
while you're making a fuss
in the mortal world, huh?

139
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,220
I'm not here for fun.

140
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,590
I'm here to realize my dream.

141
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,650
And my grandpa actually supports me.

142
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,100
Maybe he allowed me

143
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,850
to do it because he knew the Wilderness

144
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,040
would be doomed.

145
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,640
You come across

146
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,410
as even worse this way.

147
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,180
Who are you,

148
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,050
yapping here nonstop?

149
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,790
He is a great demon, for real.

150
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,760
Are you scared?

151
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,080
He feeds on those with beards like you.

152
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,640
I don't care if he's a great demon or not!

153
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,260
I'm the boss of this place!

154
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,830
-You know what... -Enough.

155
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,030
Why should we stop

156
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,830
to listen to two kids bickering?

157
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,190
Alright, stop it.

158
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,450
Show some respect
to those people over there.

159
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,630
They are here to kill us seriously.

160
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,600
Go!

161
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,530
Shoo,

162
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,230
shoo!

163
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,830
Hurry up...

164
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,390
Go!

165
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,320
Get up, or I'll kick you hard!

166
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,080
It's getting late.

167
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,200
Let's hurry up and hit the road.

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
What should we do
with this little demon in our way?

169
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,170
Do we have to deal with him?

170
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,550
If so, when it's done, the sun will set,

171
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,190
and I'll be dead.

172
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,770
This is the demon expert
in the Demon Hunting Bureau,

173
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,950
who specializes in catching little demons like you.

174
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,810
Mm,

175
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,690
delicate-skinned demons are good.

176
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,380
And half-god,

177
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,070
half-demon types like you

178
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,280
are even better.

179
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,110
You think you can beat me?

180
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,320
Kneel.

181
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,120
Move.

182
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,510
Stop.

183
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,340
Stop.

184
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,190
Okay.

185
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,830
I give in.

186
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,810
What is it?

187
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,800
So powerful.

188
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,270
It numbed my whole body

189
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,330
and knocked me out.

190
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,480
I know your mountain god temples
keep myriad artifacts.

191
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,150
If you don't wanna be taken back
to the Demon Hunting Bureau to suffer,

192
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,190
just hand over

193
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,900
your treasures.

194
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,780
Fine...

195
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,220
My precious pepper.

196
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,890
What treasures are these?

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,730
Are you trying to fool us?

198
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,190
They are my treasures!

199
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,620
Treasures that lead me to my dream.

200
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,490
It took me a lot of effort to collect them.

201
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,750
You don't understand.

202
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm carrying my dream every day.

203
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,590
Your dream

204
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,290
is to carry the wok?

205
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,880
It's to be a chef!

206
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,580
A top chef who makes delicacies
in the mortal world!

207
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,910
Everything's here.

208
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,230
Not these.

209
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
You mean this, right?

210
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,720
What is it?

211
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,830
An incense burner, I guess?

212
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,700
This is the artifact

213
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,600
that the Mountain Gods use

214
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,310
to teleport across hills and peaks,

215
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,840
called the Shanhai Portal.

216
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,830
With it,

217
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,890
we can rush back
to the Demon Hunting Bureau right away.

218
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,480
How to use it?

219
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,070
This is the Mountain God's artifact.

220
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,200
So of course,

221
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,770
it needs the Mountain God to cast a spell.

222
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,010
You just called me a little demon.

223
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,950
Now you call me the Mountain God.

224
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,080
So worldly.

225
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,960
And this is mine.

226
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,420
Why should I let you use it?

227
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,470
If you help us,

228
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,180
we will do you a favor too.

229
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,790
What favor?

230
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,750
I have neither desires

231
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,030
nor anxiety.

232
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,190
To help you realize your dream.

233
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,360
Don't you want to be a chef?

234
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,020
Our Demon Hunting Bureau

235
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,300
happens to need a chef.

236
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,150
You...

237
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,610
Don't you mind that I'm a demon?

238
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,270
You just called yourself a little Mountain God.

239
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,090
Of course, we don't mind it.

240
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,120
The Demon Hunting Bureau deals with demons every day.

241
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,830
And we have a large personnel,

242
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,270
requiring various delicacies every day.

243
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,420
We've also got servants

244
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,130
specifically responsible for buying
all sorts of fresh daily ingredients.

245
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,190
The whole kitchen

246
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,310
is as large as your mountain god temple,

247
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,910
providing a complete set of kitchenware.

248
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,070
She's right.

249
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,950
OK!

250
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,410
The Shanhai Portal

251
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,120
can only help you teleport to a place you know.

252
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,870
Have you been to the Demon Hunting Bureau?

253
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,700
Sure.

254
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,120
I've sneaked over there several times.

255
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,010
Let's begin.

256
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,530
Go!

257
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,090
♫First time being in this world♫

258
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,610
♫Let me enjoy all the splendors♫

259
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,440
♫Leaving home, going far away from those mountains♫

260
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,770
♫And that stream♫

261
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:52,410
♫The boy wiped away his tears and sang♫

262
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,370
♫He carried his dreams with him♫

263
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,490
♫Jingling all the way♫

264
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,760
♫Wind, rain, and light♫

265
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,980
♫Wandering with me♫

266
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,730
Looks like the Demon Hunting Bureau

267
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,200
can't solve the case.

268
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,510
In that case,

269
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,580
I'll send you to hell first.

270
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,510
Mr. Zhen Mei.

271
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,349
Mr. Fan Ying,

272
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,210
the Water Ghost case has been solved.

273
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,730
Our advance team of five

274
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,859
is back to report.

275
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,200
Let's wait and see.

276
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,460
Who is this?

277
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,790
Nice to meet you, sirs.

278
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,950
I'm Yinglei,

279
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,800
a newbie in the Demon Hunting Bureau as a...

280
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,710
A chef!

281
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,560
The Water Ghost case is over.

282
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,380
The Great Demon invited us

283
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,910
to his home in the suburbs of Tiandu

284
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,510
for a drink and celebration.

285
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,730
Sister Pei,

286
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,590
are you coming with me?

287
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,500
Even if you're leaving,

288
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,440
you should at least bid a proper farewell.

289
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,880
I've decided to stay
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

290
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,600
What's wrong?

291
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,040
You don't want me to?

292
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,960
I'd love to hear that!

293
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,500
♫An arrow in the hand♫

294
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,400
♫A string in the heart♫

295
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:18,370
♫A backside standing, turning into forever♫

296
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,940
♫The moon shines on the south♫

297
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,790
♫But I look north♫

298
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,390
♫I only hope the snow comes a bit later♫

299
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
I didn't want to

300
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,750
get involved in demon stuff anymore.

301
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,220
♫Intimately bound together in the cold world♫

302
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,030
♫Even death can't break our ties♫

303
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,640
Or maybe I was just avoiding it.

304
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,320
♫Like intertwined fates, debt, love, and hatred♫

305
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,020
But in life

306
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,920
♫Reluctant but with no resentment♫

307
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I see with my eyes,

308
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,420
♫Only half of the bows and arrows remain♫

309
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,920
listen with my ears,

310
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,300
and observe with my heart,

311
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,190
just to see through everything

312
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,870
♫Night and dawn are forever kept apart♫

313
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,550
and live a sober life.

314
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,650
♫If you were a spring night♫

315
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,340
♫I'm the silent mountain♫

316
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,150
So I've decided not to run away anymore.

317
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,400
♫You're a sad firefly♫

318
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,180
♫Guarding the last moment of night♫

319
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,040
♫Why don't you remember♫

320
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,380
The word "dawn"

321
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,790
♫I'm always by your side♫

322
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,550
has dawned on me.

323
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,650
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

324
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,320
♫Guarding the memories♫

325
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,560
♫Never fading away♫

326
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,790
The day breaks.

327
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,820
Thank you

328
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
for turning my dark night

329
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,260
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

330
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,700
into a dawn.

331

♫But why don't I remember♫

335
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,130
♫How much the plot has twisted?♫

336
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,250
♫I forgot the bitter karma♫

337
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,910
♫I missed it again and again♫

♫You're always by my side♫

♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

347

Falling flowers,

348
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,900
permeating fragrance.

349
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,750
How is it?

350
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,720
Isn't my place pretty nice?

351
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,070
A seclusion in the bustling city,

352
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,590
adorned with natural beauty.

353
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,770
It is quite good.

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,390
But it doesn't feel like

355
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,120
the kind of place you'd live in.

356
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,310
Oh?

357
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,250
I specially opened the barrier

358
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,220
to welcome all of you.

359
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,160
Why are you so mean to me?

360
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,210
Then tell me, Mr. Zhuo,

361
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,800
where should I live?

362
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,580
The place you live

363
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,920
should have corpses, bones, and blood

364
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,520
all over.

365
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,550
That suits your image.

366
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,780
Only those soaked in blood

367
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,670
love bathing, burning incense,

368
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,200
and having flowers around.

369
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,060
After all these years in the mortal world,

370
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,350
my biggest gain

371
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,070
is to learn that

372
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:24,830
a human

373
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,090
should know how to hide his true self.

374
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,790
You're not human.

375
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,780
So sharp all of a sudden.

376
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,540
I didn't expect that.

377
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,970
Zhuo Yichen, Zhuo Yichen.

378
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,740
Zhao Yuanzhou, Zhao Yuanzhou.

379
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,710
Let's celebrate our teamwork

380
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,540
in solving the Water Ghost case.

381
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,020
The crisis of the Demon Hunting Bureau

382
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,480
has finally been settled.

383
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,030
The Demon Hunting Bureau survived,

384
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,070
and so did I!

385
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,940
Great!

386
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,490
Don't get carried away.

387
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,470
In the Demon Hunting Bureau,

388
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,630
you may lose your life at any time.

389
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,930
It's still not too late

390
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,710
to quit now.

391
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,250
I was a little scared before.

392
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,580
But our team

393
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,880
has Mr. Zhuo, the strongest one in Tiandu.

394
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,210
I'm not afraid anymore.

395
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,950
When we were in danger,

396
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,070
Mr. Zhuo

397
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,870
was always protecting me.

398
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,240
I can also protect you, too!

399
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
I’m the Mountain God!

400
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,460
Wen, hope you find
and get the Baize Token back soon.

401
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,900
Then, those demons and monsters

402
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,770
can't cause chaos in the mortal world

403
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,170
and hurt humans anymore.

404
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,360
No more tragedies like what happened

405
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,100
to Ran Yi and Miss Qi.

406
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:54,930
Mm.

407
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,160
With the Baize Token,

408
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,420
even the greatest demons are no big deal.

409
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,420
Brilliant.

410
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,040
I swear I'll help you
find and retrieve it, Wen.

411
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,700
Then my mom will...

412
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,640
What did you say?

413
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,560
Bai Jiu?

414
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,130
Nothing.

415
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,620
Cheers.

416
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,270
Cheers!

417
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,300
Why is it tea for me?

418
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,730
No alcohol for kids.

419
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,870
You call me a kid.

420
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,190
Then how old are you?

421
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,020
I should be 18

422
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,030
in human years.

423
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,550
Eight...

424
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,740
Eighteen?

425
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,680
Eighteen with this thick beard?

426
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,960
Guess it's time for a shave.

427
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,810
I'll sneak into Zhao Yuanzhou's room later.

428
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,490
He has no beard

429
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,570
at his age.

430
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,920
He must have a razor.

431
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,070
I'm gonna be ugly.

432
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,000
Mirror, mirror,

433
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,950
promise me.

434
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,960
Please remember

435
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,470
how handsome I look at over 200.

436
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,220
Well...

437
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,470
How can I refill my tea?

438
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,750
I also want it.

439
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,420
Come on.

440
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,750
A little.

441
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,610
That's enough.

442
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,630
Wow.

443
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,160
What is this?

444
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,390
A kid's meal I made

445
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,760
just for you!

446
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,580
Let me try.

447
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,790
How is it?

448
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,160
How's my cooking?

449
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,790
It tastes so good!

450
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,650
By the way, Yinglei,

451
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,930
I helped you realize your dream and become a chef

452
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,610
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

453
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,070
So,

454
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,670
shouldn't you repay me?

455
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,870
No problem!

456
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,590
Help me steal Zhao Yuanzhou's bottle.

457
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,320
Well...

458
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,270
That's...

459
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,750
actually a big problem.

460
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,500
I'm just curious

461
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,030
what on earth is in his bottle.

462
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,780
This Great Demon hasn't

463
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,690
had anything the whole trip
but what's in his bottle.

464
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,560
I got you!

465
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,340
I've already sniffed out

466
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,010
what's in his bottle.

467
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,980
Jade bracelets!

468
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,840
Sir,

469
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,550
what kind of jade do you like?

470
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,910
I have no preference.

471
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,990
As long as it's jade.

472
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,610
OK...

473
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,110
Do you guys know

474
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,530
jade cream?

475
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,390
Jade cream?

476
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,130
According to the book,

477
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,220
the Mountain of Jade produces jade cream,

478
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,120
which, mixed with the powdered Heartless Herb,

479
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,640
can turn into liquid.

480
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,200
Drink it,

481
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,070
and you can become immortal.

482
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,440
Not that powerful.

483
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
That's to tease kids.

484
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,800
But having plenty of it

485
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,920
can prolong your life

486
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,050
and replenish your spiritual energy.

487
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,950
No wonder that Great Demon

488
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,330
holds his bottle every day
without letting go.

489
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,130
So it's really his food reserve.

490
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,140
The Great Demon

491
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,250
was just chatting with Mr. Zhuo.

492
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,830
But where is he now?

493
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,740
How about we make another bet?

494
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,790
Bet on what?

495
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,630
Let's see who's the first to solve
the water ghost bride abduction case.

496
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,700
The loser

497
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,390
should do one thing for the other.

498
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,220
Deal.

499
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,080
But that thing

500
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,090
should be within the loser's capabilities

501
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,110
and can't be immoral.

502
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,710
Keep your promise,

503
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,710
Mr. Zhuo.

504
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,060
You're pulling a long face.

505
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,920
Don't tell me you have zero tolerance
even for this.

506
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,340
Do you have eyes behind your back?

507
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm looking great.

508
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,590
Wen Xiao and I were the first

509
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,800
to solve the water ghost bride abduction case.

510
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,170
You have such a poor memory, Mr. Zhuo.

511
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,150
You said it yourself

512
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,470
that I knew the murderer was Ran Yi

513
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,240
before I came to the Demon Hunting Bureau.

514
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,560
So I solved the case first, of course.

515
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,790
I admit defeat.

516
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,990
But you won unjustly.

517
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,630
You knew Ran committed a crime,

518
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,610
yet you still colluded with him.

519
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,790
You are accomplices.

520
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,900
Something's heavy on my head.

521
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,640
My neck hurts.

522
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,410
What's wrong with you again?

523
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,330
Someone put the "heavy" blame on me.

524
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,910
You...

525
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,860
I did this

526
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,670
because I know you too well.

527
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,510
Ridiculous.

528
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,190
We've only known each other for a few days.

529
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,380
You know me?

530
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,470
Dream on.

531
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,220
Everyone in Tiandu knows

532
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,350
Mr. Zhuo

533
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,830
is handsome

534
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,210
and charming.

535
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,360
You're like a sharp sword
when dealing with evil demons,

536
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,990
upholding justice,

537
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,750
sticking to principles,

538
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,390
and having ambition.

539
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,710
Right?

540
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,750
Indeed.

541
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,390
So,

542
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,630
if I had told you

543
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,630
the murderer Ran Yi's whereabouts,

544
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,070
the righteous Mr. Zhuo

545
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,080
would have left in no time
to arrest Ran for sure.

546
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
Then how could we find clues
about the Baize Token?

547
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,950
The less flexible it is,
the easier it is to break.

548
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,720
You can't stick to the rules too rigidly.

549
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,450
To achieve a goal,

550
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,290
sometimes we have to use special methods.

551
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,740
Mr. Zhuo,

552
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,920
am I right?

553
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,200
Flexibility is okay,

554
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,410
but not always tricks and schemes.

555
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,110
Could you push it for me?

556
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,750
Move.

557
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,960
You...

558
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,890
You hid Ran Yi's whereabouts

559
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,120
and even tried to drag us into your plan.

560
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,540
It's obviously deception.

561
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,980
Unfortunately, you are too smart.

562
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,480
My plan failed.

563
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,470
It doesn't mean you didn't do it.

564
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,130
Zhao Yuanzhou,

565
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,230
your eloquence

566
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,580
can deceive Zhuo,

567
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,920
but not me.

568
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,860
She means you're goofy.

569
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:30,990
I...

570
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,030
Despite

571
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,640
our different personalities

572
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,040
and ways of doing things,

573
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,070
we have the same goal.

574
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,470
So we should be honest with each other

575
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,110
and discuss more.

576
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,910
Trust

577
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,500
is like a swing.

578
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,890
You must trust the people behind you

579
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,620
to swing higher.

580
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,740
You are so good at pushing a swing.

581
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,930
Don't you understand that?

582
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,370
The little demon Ran Yi

583
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,980
is not dangerous.

584
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
What about Li Lun?

585
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,590
You hid the existence of Li Lun,

586
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,750
and he almost got Wen Xiao...

587
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,550
Li Lun wouldn't really kill her.

588
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,390
If Li Lun tried to kill Wen Xiao seriously,

589
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,770
you couldn’t stop him.

590
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,750
What is he up to?

591
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,510
I don't know.

592
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,510
It's always hard

593
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,390
to read his mind.

594
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,610
Move.

595
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,300
Mr. Zhuo, you quit?

596
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,950
Are you angry because I said

597
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,700
you're too rigid?

598
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,070
Didn't you just say

599
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,420
you only like sitting on the swing,

600
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,070
not pushing it?

601
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,620
Aren't you enjoying pushing it now?

602
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,010
Old liar.

603
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,260
So that's why you're mad.

604
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,700
Come here, then.

605
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,930
Let me push it for you.

606
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,230
Ridiculous.

607
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,190
Adults

608
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,110
are not obsessed with the swing!

609
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,050
He's mocking you.

610
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,090
Keep pushing.

611
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,680
Move.

612
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,200
They must be having fun with the swing, huh?

613
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,590
Mr. Zhuo

614
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,670
on the swing?

615
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
Bai Jiu just said you...

616
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,690
Is the wine good?

617
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,330
Not bad!

618
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,950
The pomegranate wine
from Tianxiang Pavilion

619
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,950
is indeed worthy of its reputation.

620
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,550
The smell is mellow and fragrant.

621
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,150
Little Mountain God,

622
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,850
you just came down the mountain
and already got so much info.

623
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,460
You even know Tianxiang Pavilion?

624
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,449
Yeah.

625
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,670
When I just left the mountain,

626
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,449
I heard that

627
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,429
Tianxiang Pavilion

628
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,090
was holding a beauty contest.

629
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,800
There must be good wine

630
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,159
as well as lovely girls.

631
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,670
I'm thinking about finding a chance

632
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,989
to have fun there one day.

633
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,370
If you go, I'll tell Sister Wen.

634
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,210
Unless you take me with you,

635
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,420
and I won't tell her.

636
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,360
You...

637
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,870
You...

638
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,130
Drink some more.

639
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,870
C'mon...

640
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,550
No, thanks.

641
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,310
It's wet...

642
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,900
It's okay. I'll hang it up to dry.

643
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,110
Just a small patch is wet.

644
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,440
Why bother?

645
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,590
Sister Pei.

646
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,300
You don't

647
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,610
look so well.

648
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,680
[File]

649
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,390
There's another murder case in Tiandu.

650
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,620
[File]

651
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,560
[File]

652
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Where is Wen Xiao?

653
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,060
She's on the swing
with Zhao Yuanzhou over there.

654
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,030
What do you want to say?

655
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,390
You would never

656
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,470
let Wen Xiao

657
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,110
be alone with him before.

658
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,930
Mr. Zhuo,

659
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,430
You're innocent and kind.

660
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,790
Don't easily

661
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,590
let down your guard against him.

662
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,320
I'll never let my guard down.

663
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,480
Is everything ready?

664
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,430
The file

665
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,880
has been delivered to Pei Sijing.

666
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,520
Thanks to you,

667
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,210
the fish took the bait.

668
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,700
Pei Sijing saw his face.

669
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,810
She will definitely investigate it.

670
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,670
It’s time to let them know

671
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,630
where the Baize Token is.

672
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,480
Aren’t you afraid that old demon

673
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,670
might kill them?

674
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,440
That old demon is indeed powerful.

675
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,820
I'm scared of him too.

676
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,870
But I want Zhao Yuanzhou and his crew

677
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,670
to suffer.

678
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,370
Can Zhao Yuanzhou really find the Baize Token?

679
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,250
According to the file,

680
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,020
since two days ago,

681
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,510
two households in Tiandu
have been murdered consecutively,

682
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,120
both happening at noon.

683
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,370
No signs of a struggle inside.

684
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,790
It's not a robbery.

685
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,760
Actually, there is another reason

686
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,230
why I'm investigating this case.

687
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,130
What is it?

688
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,770
This is the household
where the first murder occurred.

689
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,570
There's no demonic energy.

690
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,390
My sword is not shining.

691
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,590
I don't need you to tell me.

692
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,830
Yeah...

693
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,390
Awesome...

694
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,800
No blood,

695
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,190
nor signs of fighting.

696
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,090
It looks pretty normal.

697
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,300
It's just that no one is here.

698
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,620
Being too normal

699
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,560
is actually an anomaly.

700
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,510
Your Bingyi Clan's sense of humor

701
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,990
is hard to understand.

702
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,120
Give me your hand.

703
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,840
Is it necessary?

704
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,100
You're so scared.

705
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,680
Are you serious?

706
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,640
Let me borrow some demon blood of yours.

707
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,130
Last time at the Mirror Lake,

708
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,900
I found

709
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,120
your blood on the Yunguang Sword

710
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,840
made its power soar.

711
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,020
Is this the so-called “bloody bad luck”?

712
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,610
♫Can't tell tears from wine♫

713
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,850
♫So frustrating♫

714
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,610
♫The moon and the puppy go with me silently♫

715
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,330

716

Ouch...

717
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,910
It hurts...

718
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,270
♫The boy never looks back♫

719
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:11,050
♫He left his hometown and love behind♫

720
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,430
Why are we in the same squad?

721
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,210
Bloody bad luck...

722
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,590
What are you afraid of?

723
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,400
I'm here.

724
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,140
Let's go.

725
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,600
Is this their strategic arrangement?

726
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,960
In their eyes,

727
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,250
we're...

728
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,450
-Discarded pawns. -Aces.

729
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,340
Aren't you half-god, half-demon?

730
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,270
Are you actually half-pig-demon?

731
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,820
What do you mean?

732
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,950
I'm saying you're as dumb as a pig.

733
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,670
Jiu,

734
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,230
you...

735
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,000
You're getting better at mocking others.

736
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,340
No plum trees in the yard.

737
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,990
Where did these petals come from?

738
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,670
The plates are still warm.

739
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,080
That means...

740
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,090
The murderer is still here.

741
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,700
Sister.
