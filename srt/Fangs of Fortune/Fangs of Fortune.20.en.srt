[Episode 20]

3
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,440
Jiu?

4
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,920
Jiu?

5
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,100
Sister Pei!

6
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,260
Sister Pei.

7
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,190
Sister Pei.

8
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,440
Don't kill her.

9
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,820
You really care about her, don't you?

10
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,100
I just don't think

11
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,460
you should alert them.

12
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,880
After all,

13
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,000
our target is Zhao Yuanzhou.

14
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,850
I'll wait for it to dry.

15
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,410
Just a small patch is wet.

16
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,610
Why bother?

17
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,550
Bai Jiu,

18
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,530
we need to check your wrist.

19
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,610
I am indeed from Chongwu Camp.

20
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,530
You're very curious, aren't you?

21
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,800
Yes, I am.

22
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,230
When did he start to seal my five senses?

23
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,690
You each take one.

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,600
I made these detoxification pills myself.

25
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,840
Taste.

26
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,630
What do you want from me?

27
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,450
This is the new version of Huanling Powder I developed.

28
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,520
Are you ready?

29
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Smell.

30
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,610
I feel nothing.

31
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,800
I even want to laugh.

32
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,220
I'm so scared.

33
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,010
Sight.

34
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,130
Then why are you covering my eyes?

35
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,790
Cover your own eyes.

36
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,180
I can't see the road.

37
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,150
It's so scary.

38
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,270
What's that sound?

39
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,590
Put this on.

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,190
I think something is definitely wrong with this voice.

41
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,130
Don't listen.

42
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,450
Hearing.

43
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,130
I never expected that seemingly harmless Little Bunny

44
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,090
could be so meticulous.

45
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,350
To accomplish great things,

46
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,520
one must not only have deep foresight

47
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,420
but also patience

48
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,490
to set up the game step by step.

49
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,530
Zhao Yuanzhou,

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,440
from the moment you entered Tiandu City,

51
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,710
you have been stepping into this chessboard,

52
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,670
bit by bit.

53
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,280
Where do you think the list of these five people

54
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,080
in the vanguard squad formed by

55
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,280
the Demon Hunting Bureau came from?

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,160
Didn't Mr. Zhuo make it?

57
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,470
So it was you.

58
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,840
To obtain your inner core,

59
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,360
we must seal your five senses.

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,300
Bai Jiu could do that for me.

61
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,950
However, he lacks experience

62
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,980
and needs someone to protect him.

63
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,360
Ms. Pei,

64
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,390
you don't think our Chongwu Camp

65
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,790
is a place you can enter

66
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,600
or exit at will, do you?

67
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,090
You deliberately arranged for me to leave Chongwu Camp

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,630
and then be noticed by the Demon Hunting Bureau.

69
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,030
Ms. Pei, not only are you a good archer,

70
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,360
but you are also the bodyguard of the Prime Minister.

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Moreover, you have a grudge against Chongwu Camp.

72
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,790
Who else would

73
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,650
the Demon Hunting Bureau choose

74
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,840
besides an outstanding talent like you?

75
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,870
Besides, you just suffered the loss of your younger brother.

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,590
When facing Bai Jiu,

77
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,720
would there be any emotional projection?

78
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,850
Over time, when you grow deep feelings for him,

79
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,380
you will surely risk your life to protect him.

80
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,590
Bai Jiu calls you 'Sister Pei' every day;

81
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,490
you must be enjoying that, right?

82
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,550
Despicable.

83
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,400
If Bai Jiu couldn't succeed,

84
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,070
I would still have a backup plan.

85
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,400
Even Mr. Zhuo

86
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,240
is one of your pawns.

87
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,350
Zhuo Yichen is the leader of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

88
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,280
It was reasonable for him to join the vanguard squad.

89
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,080
Besides, he has the Cloud Light Sword.

90
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,510
He's the only one who can kill you.

91
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,440
As for Baize Goddess...

92
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,560
I'll cooperate with Li Lun

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,550
to help him destroy the Baize Token.

94
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,270
I promise I'll give you

95
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,570
Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

96
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,300
What about your promise to me?

97
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,070
To merge

98
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,550
the Baize Token hidden in you and Wen Xiao,

99
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,110
we naturally need to bind you together

100
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,710
to endure hardships

101
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,280
so that you can understand each other.

102
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,100
Now, there's only one last step left

103
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,510
to seal your five senses.

104
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,110
I just need to use a silver needle

105
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,550
to seal your touch,

106
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,240
and everything will be accomplished.

107
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,290
What does a mortal like you

108
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,430
want with my inner core?

109
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,700
Who wants your foul inner core?

110
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,150
From the beginning,

111
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,610
what I want is always the Ever-Burning Wood.

112
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,500
It's been such a hard journey.

113
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,910
I finally found

114
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,070
the Ever-Burning Wood that he wants.

115
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,190
It is said that

116
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,930
this is the last piece of Ever-Burning Wood in the world.

117
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,660
We must keep a close watch on it.

118
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,530
Eight years ago,

119
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,380
you inhaled

120
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,430
the last piece of Ever-Burning Wood that I had found

121
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,760
with great difficulty.

122
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,620
I have been looking for you for eight years.

123
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,350
Go ahead, my disciple.

124
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,020
Bai Jiu,

125
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,510
aren't we your friends?

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,220
Don't come any closer.

127
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,790
I don't want to hurt you.

128
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,430
You've already said so much;

129
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,190
how could I possibly

130
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,520
just let Little Bunny stick a needle in me?

131
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,040
What's wrong, Zhao Yuanzhou?

132
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,810
It seems like you can't cast your spells.

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,410
Jiu,

134
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,440
think it through.

135
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,580
Stop.

136
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,190
[Book of Rites]

137
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,170
As expected, at the critical moment,

138
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,180
you still wished for him to live

139
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,190
and didn't want him to die.

140
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,350
Don't worry.

141
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,430
Whether it's Mr. Fan's order

142
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,650
or the Prime Minister's,

143
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,610
it cannot suppress me.

144
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,610
The only one who can kill Zhao Yuanzhou

145
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,060
is me.

146
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,540
I won't be anyone's executioner.

147
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,030
Well, if we

148
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,280
restore the Baize Token

149
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,310
and are ultimately able to suppress Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy,

150
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,670
will you still kill him?

151
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,720
The Yao Water was polluted,

152
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,860
and the Divine Wood went missing.

153
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,160
The "if" you mentioned

154
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,110
seems too distant to hope for.

155
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,440
I won't answer such a hopeless hypothetical.

156
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,120
But what if

157
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,560
the hope is not distant?

158
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,790
What do you mean?

159
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,210
Zhao Yuanzhou once mentioned to me

160
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,990
that the clues about the Divine Wood

161
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,610
are in Situ's Mansion.

162
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,270
Situ's Mansion?

163
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,950
Mr. Zhuo.

164
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,580
Mr. Situ Ming.

165
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,640
Mr. Zhuo,

166
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,310
please take Ms. Wen Xiao away through the back door now.

167
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,470
Mr. Situ, why are you so panicked?

168
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,200
What on earth has happened?

169
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,910
Zhen Mei,

170
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,080
what are you doing?

171
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,360
Wen Xiao from the Demon Hunting Bureau

172
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,090
murdered the Prime Minister,

173
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,400
resisted arrest, and fled,

174
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,000
committing a grave crime.

175
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,460
Chongwu Camp has been ordered to capture her.

176
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,590
Those who block the way will be killed.

177
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,110
The Prime Minister was murdered.

178
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,870
Chongwu Camp is here to arrest the criminal.

179
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,670
They claimed the murderer is...

180
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,280
is Ms. Wen Xiao.

181
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,270
Utterly absurd!

182
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,170
How could it possibly be Wen Xiao?

183
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,860
Many of the Prime Minister's attendants

184
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,380
witnessed Wen Xiao publicly stop the horse.

185
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,270
They said that after Wen Xiao got into the carriage,

186
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,930
she brutally killed the Prime Minister.

187
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,590
The blood dripped all the way.

188
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,210
All the servants saw with their own eyes

189
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,870
that inside the carriage,

190
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,200
[Book of Rites]

191
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,410
the Prime Minister's body was mutilated.

192
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,160
Wen Xiao was covered in blood

193
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,960
and ran away.

194
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,600
Nonsense!

195
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,350
Wen Xiao was in the Demon Hunting Bureau all night.

196
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,280
All the guards can testify to that.

197
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,160
I was here all night,

198
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,430
being punished with house arrest by my father.

199
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,760
Chongwu Camp

200
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,740
is clearly framing me.

201
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,650
In such a serious event

202
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,780
as the Prime Minister's murder,

203
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,840
they wouldn't casually frame anyone

204
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,350
unless they were absolutely confident.

205
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,590
There must be

206
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,380
something fishy going on.

207
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,910
The situation is unclear now,

208
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,790
and there are a bunch of witnesses on both sides.

209
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,520
We cannot prove our innocence.

210
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,350
Mr. Zhuo,

211
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,950
you should take Ms. Wen Xiao and leave now.

212
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,470
Before Chongwu Camp closes the city gates,

213
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,670
I'll take Wen Xiao and leave the city as soon as possible.

214
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,390
No.

215
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,210
I'm not leaving the city.

216
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,370
They believe I will escape.

217
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,790
So, at this moment, Tiandu City

218
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,700
is the safest place.

219
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,750
That's true.

220
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,770
But Tiandu City is not that large.

221
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,710
Chongwu Camp has ample forces in Tiandu City.

222
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,720
They could search the entire city in two or three days.

223
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,910
By the time they realize...

224
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,470
So,

225
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,720
Mr. Situ, please shelter me.

226
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,880
What?

227
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,300
Urgent matters need flexible solutions.

228
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
It's not up to you.

229
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,390
I'd like to see

230
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,660
who dares to stop me.

231
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,960
I do.

232
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,550
[Arrest Warrant]

233
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,500
King Xiang has issued an urgent decree

234
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,430
to capture the true murderer, Wen Xiao, who killed the Prime Minister.

235
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,210
Anyone who dares to obstruct will be regarded

236
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,210
as having committed the same crime.

237
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,310
Go in and arrest her.

238
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,280
Commander,

239
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,700
we have searched the entire Demon Hunting Bureau

240
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,960
and haven't found her.

241
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,480
Seal the city gate immediately

242
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,470
and launch a citywide search.

243
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,940
Inspect all inns and taverns,

244
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,700
and issue a wanted notice

245
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,750
for the serious criminal, Wen Xiao.

246
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,040
Come out.

247
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,350
Let's go.

248
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,150
Go inside.

249
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,920
Mr. Situ, I never expected your home to have such a rustic charm.

250
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,850
Hurry inside.

251
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,280
Don't let others see you.

252
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,960
Come on.

253
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,700
What's wrong with that room?

254
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,550
Why is it sealed?

255
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,350
Oh.

256
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,390
That's my wife's bedroom.

257
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,310
She has been bedridden for many years because of her illness

258
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,510
and is sensitive to light and wind.

259
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,240
It has been like this for years.

260
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,040
Ms. Wen Xiao,

261
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,580
come.

262
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,330
Follow me.

263
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,390
Okay.

264
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
Jiu hasn't been home for a long time.

265
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,610
How about you stay in his room for now?

266
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,980
What a coincidence.

267
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,030
You're here too?

268
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,550
You're here too?

269
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,170
I didn't expect

270
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,380
it was Bai Jiu.

271
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,110
Yeah,

272
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,300
I didn't expect it was him either.

273
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,200
I actually didn't expect you

274
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,470
to be hunted down across the entire city.

275
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,580
Impressive.

276
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,100
What's so surprising about that?

277
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,500
Since Mr. Situ is willing to take me in,

278
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,390
I can take the chance to investigate the clues about the Divine Wood.

279
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,370
It's you guys who are weird.

280
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,550
Why are you here?

281
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,590
To find the Divine Wood, of course.

282
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,520
Commander Zhuo,

283
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,530
this is the carriage the Prime Minister was in when he was murdered.

284
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,730
It was just sent here.

285
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,310
What's the smell?

286
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,610
The attendants said that

287
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,340
this criminal is highly skilled

288
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,870
and killed the Prime Minister silently

289
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,250
in one strike.

290
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,280
Book of Rites?

291
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,160
The Prime Minister should have memorized

292
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,450
a classic book like this long ago.

293
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,210
Why was he still reading it?

294
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,180
The pages of this copy of the Book of Rites

295
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,490
are yellowed.

296
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,950
It must be quite old.

297
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,940
The edges are worn,

298
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,060
indicating it has been frequently read.

299
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,020
However, the binding threads

300
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,690
are new,

301
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
suggesting it is highly cherished.

302
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,860
Only by reading the works of sages can one be sensible

303
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,550
and discern the true good and evil,

304
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,950
right and wrong in the world.

305
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,450
[Book of Rites]

306
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,190
If one day

307
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,310
I pass the imperial examinations,

308
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,050
I will do something for the people of the world...

309
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,850
Perhaps...

310
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,940
the Prime Minister was just reminiscing about something.

311
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,160
At present, rumors are swirling throughout the city,

312
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,290
and tales of the demoness who eats humans are incessant.

313
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,660
They all say the Prime Minister

314
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,340
was eaten by a demoness,

315
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,840
leaving only his skeleton.

316
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,640
Mr. Fan,

317
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,710
you raised Wen Xiao.

318
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,480
Don't you know

319
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,450
whether she is human or a demon?

320
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,730
Of course I know it's not Wen Xiao.

321
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,790
The demoness must be someone else.

322
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,120
What's strange is that

323
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,620
everyone present saw...

324
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,780
it was Wen Xiao who stopped the carriage.

325
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,190
Where is the Prime Minister's body?

326
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,250
Sulfur?

327
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,280
The people from Chongwu Camp have taken

328
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,030
the Prime Minister's body away amid the chaos.

329
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,520
Then these bones...

330
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,530
This is another murder case

331
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,080
that recently happened outside Tiandu City.

332
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,980
A woodcutter was killed on his way home

333
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,970
after chopping wood in the forest.

334
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,710
His family believes he was killed by a demon,

335
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,840
so they brought the remains to our Demon Hunting Bureau.

336
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,290
The remains of the deceased are quite similar

337
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,680
to those of the Prime Minister.

338
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,850
I'm thinking

339
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,520
that the bones

340
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,980
have a smell of sulfur,

341
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,360
and there was also

342
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,090
a lingering sulfur smell in the carriage.

343
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,890
Sulfur?

344
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,920
What kind of demon has a sulfuric smell?

345
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,540
It should be Ao Yin.

346
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,500
Ying Lei?

347
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,950
Why are you here?

348
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,030
Mr. Zhuo.

349
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,110
Did anything happen to Mount Kunlun?

350
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,370
Kunlun is fine for now.

351
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,240
Currently, the Mountain God, Mr. Lu Wu,

352
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,670
along with several other mountain gods,

353
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,950
is guarding the stone pillar.

354
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,040
I came here

355
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,470
because I successfully purified the Yao Water.

356
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,280
Mr. Zhuo.

357
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,090
Great.

358
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,190
I was going to

359
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,930
return it to the Goddess.

360
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,390
However, as soon as I entered Tiandu City...

361
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,620
It's truly audacious,

362
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,990
even daring to kill the Prime Minister.

363
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,150
It's said that it even eats people.

364
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,470
It's a female demon, right?

365
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,350
So there really are man-eating demons

366
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,510
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

367
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,840
People are in panic now.

368
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,180
The authorities have issued a wanted notice.

369
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,810
Quickly catch her.

370
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,380
A vicious female demon?

371
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,540
Appeared in the Demon Hunting Bureau?

372
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,390
It seems

373
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,850
I need to help the Goddess.

374
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,600
[Wanted Notice]

375
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,270
Goddess...

376
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,500
Goddess!

377
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,010
I learned

378
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,680
that the Goddess is wanted.

379
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
It turns out she was framed by Ao Yin.

380
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,050
What exactly

381
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,950
is Ao Yin?

382
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,790
Ao Yin

383
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,250
is a bloodthirsty beast with claws like blades,

384
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,060
residing in the volcanic area of the West Wilderness.

385
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,150
It particularly likes

386
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,830
eating human brains

387
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,780
and hearts.

388
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,700
It moves swiftly

389
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,090
and is adept at hiding its tracks,

390
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,860
preferring to travel alone under the cover of darkness.

391
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,470
Volcanic areas

392
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,410
happen to be rich in sulfur.

393
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,960
Exactly.

394
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,200
Is there any way to find her?

395
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,990
Of course.

396
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,730
My lord,

397
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,820
we have discovered

398
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,560
that Zhen Mei is gathering soldiers from Chongwu Camp

399
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,220
and preparing to take action.

400
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,450
I'll go and find Wen Xiao first.

401
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,290
I'll leave the matter of Ao Yin

402
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,460
to you.

403
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,280
Don't worry.

404
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,540
Well, I ran away,

405
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,830
and you ran away too.

406
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,580
Chongwu Camp must be furious now.

407
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,440
Chongwu Camp has been busy capturing demons to conduct research.

408
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,030
Creating a little chaos for them

409
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,600
would distract them.

410
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,800
Wen Zongyu has already affected your four senses.

411
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,750
If your last sense is sealed with a silver needle,

412
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,970
wouldn't you be...

413
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,450
As a great demon, how could I

414
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,580
be so easily stripped of my inner core?

415
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,690
You'd better worry about

416
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,960
how to clear your name from the charge of murdering the Prime Minister.

417
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,690
I didn't expect that Wen Zongyu,

418
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,040
who seems like a skilled doctor with a kind heart,

419
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,570
could be so terrifying behind the scenes.

420
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,300
He's been hiding his true face.

421
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,340
There are many people who have been

422
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,070
hiding their true faces.

423
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,250
They should be bringing people to search here soon.

424
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,290
Jiu.

425
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,520
Jiu?

426
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,840
Why are you back?

427
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,280
I'm here to see my mother.

428
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,110
Oh.

429
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,480
Our friend is back.

430
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,750
Didn't you say that once I return to Tiandu,

431
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,070
I would see my mother?

432
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,090
Yes.

433
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,360
Jiu,

434
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,060
have you eaten yet?

435
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,390
Would you like something to eat?

436
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,660
I'll go make you something you like.

437
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,830
Mr. Situ,

438
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,430
please prepare three more sets of chopsticks and bowls.

439
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,170
There are three more people here.

440
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,330
Zhao Yuanzhou?

441
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,510
Ms. Pei?

442
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,140
Why are you here?

443
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,830
You escaped from the dungeon in Chongwu Camp?

444
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,380
Why did you just run off?

445
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,190
What?

446
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,180
Are you going to Chongwu Camp to report again?

447
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,530
Zhao Yuanzhou,

448
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,920
what nonsense are you talking about?

449
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,740
I think you all have misunderstood.

450
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,960
I wrote that letter on purpose.

451
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,630
I was afraid that our Jiu would be in danger,

452
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,310
so I sent...

453
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,970
It's not a misunderstanding.

454
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,850
Bai Jiu

455
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,930
is indeed a spy from Chongwu Camp.

456
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,360
A spy?

457
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,760
Why did you help Chongwu Camp?

458
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,920
Do you remember what I said to you

459
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,960
when the pagoda spirit tied you up?

460
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,060
Jiu,

461
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,410
Let me ask you seriously.

462
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,420
Are you

463
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,040
hiding something from us?

464
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,680
I remember.

465
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,110
Then let me ask you seriously one more time.

466
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,770
Are you hiding something from us?

467
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,900
So, would you rather be a traitor

468
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,060
or be my friend?

469
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,550
You choose.

470
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,480
Mr. Zhuo,

471
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,270
will you...

472
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,850
still believe what I say?

473
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,710
As long as you say it,

474
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,860
I will believe you.

475
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,830
Everything I did

476
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,510
was for my mother.

559
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,710
and tanned a bit.

560
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,810
I've also learned a lot from many medical books.

561
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,630
I will definitely cure you.

00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,560
Could you please open the door?

568
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,199
Mom,

569
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,449
I've finished reading all the medical books at home.

570
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,159
I'm going out to find the best master to learn from.

571
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,850
One day,

572
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,989
I will definitely cure you.

573
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,750
You are...

574
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,410
I'm the new apprentice.

575
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,870
My name is...

576
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,670
Si...

577
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,450
My name is Bai Jiu.

578
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:50,900
Master,

579
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,900
really?

580
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,120
Can you really bring my mom back to life?

581
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,940
I promise you

582
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,890
I will bring your mom back to life.

583
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,760
But I need your help with something as well.

584
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,900
Join the vanguard squad of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

585
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:07,100
I just need you to seal Zhu Yan's five senses.

586
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,930
I know you have a kind heart.

587
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,650
But Zhu Yan is a demon.

588
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,870
Your mother was killed by a demon.

589
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,340
If he isn't eliminated,

590
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,010
there will be

591
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,630
more children like you

592
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,960
who lost their mothers.

593
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,510
Jiu,

594
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,230
you really are a fool.

595
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,470
Your mother was not killed by a demon,

596
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,710
nor is she sick.

597
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,720
You were deceived by Wen Zongyu.

598
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,880
Then my mom is...

599
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,640
Mr. Situ,

600
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,390
don't hide it from Jiu any longer.

601
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,710
Where is my mom?

602
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,780
Where is my mom?

603
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,080
This is your mom.

604
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,960
Nonsense.

605
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,250
Your father is not talking nonsense.

606
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,930
Your mother

607
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,750
is not human.

608
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,370
Your mother, like Ying Lei,

609
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,980
is half god and half demon.

610
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,320
She was born in ancient times.

611
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,020
She's the same age as the gods.

612
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
Yes.

613
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,930
Your mother is the descendant of the White Emperor Shaohao

614
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,950
and the Divine Tree of Jianmu.

615
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,480
Her true form shares

616
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,840
the same origin as the Divine Wood that transformed into the power of Baize,

617
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,640
inheriting its spiritual vein.

618
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,870
Therefore, during the Blood Moon eight years ago,

619
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,380
the disappearance of the Baize Token

620
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,790
severely injured her.

621
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,270
Mom!

622
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,430
She was forced to manifest her true form.

623
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,510
Mom!

624
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,030
Mom!

625
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,520
Even if my mom turned into a tree

626
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,290
and returned to her true form,

627
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,640
why has she never talked to me

628
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,470
or been willing to respond?

629
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,410
With the loss of the Baize Token

630
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,170
and the Goddess absent from her position,

631
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,860
the Wilderness has fallen into disarray.

632
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,290
Therefore, Lord Bai Yan lost her soul

633
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,710
and had no choice but to stay in her true form

634
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,390
in the world.

635
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,670
Mom,

636
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,360
can you hear me?

637
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,420
I...

638
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,260
I'm Jiu.

639
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,380
I'm back.

640
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,970
I'm back.

641
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,400
Can my mom return to her original form?

642
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,540
As long as the Baize Token is repaired

643
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,840
and the Wilderness is restored,

644
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,630
your mother will come back.

645
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,310
Why did no one tell me?

646
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,680
You were too young at that time.

647
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,950
I didn't know

648
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,080
how you would accept

649
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,480
all of this after I told you.

650
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,870
For an ordinary person, it's indeed hard to accept

651
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,710
without going through all this.

652
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,680
But Bai Jiu has the right to know the truth.

653
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,180
Although he is young,

654
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,060
he is much more mature than children his age.

655
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,940
I believe

656
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,350
that if you had told him

657
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,650
the truth back then,

658
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,840
Jiu would have understood.

659
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,130
If you

660
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,020
had told me the truth earlier,

661
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,950
perhaps I wouldn't have been used by Wen Zongyu.

662
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,240
I'm sorry.

663
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,020
No.

664
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,030
It was my fault.

665
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,460
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,840
I was wrong.

667
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,590
I'm sorry.

668
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,640
I hurt you guys.

669
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,410
All of you

670
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,960
have been sincere to me,

671
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,130
but I have let down your trust.

672
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,660
Jiu.

673
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,120
Jiu,

674
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,190
you've grown up.

675
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,510
The bond between father and son,

676
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,170
the loyalty between friends,

677
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,630
rights and wrongs, gains and losses—

678
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,340
you can understand them on your own.

679
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,460
It's okay to make mistakes.

680
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,610
As long as

681
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,800
you can bear the cost of growing up

682
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,380
and try to make amends.

683
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,840
The sea of suffering is endless.

684
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,920
As long as you return to the shore in time,

685
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,380
there will still be a brilliant sunset waiting for you.

686
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,550
In fact,

687
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,710
the real culprit

688
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,950
is not you, this easily fooled

689
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,270
little bunny.

690
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,270
But the truly cunning and deceitful wolf.

691
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,430
Stop hiding.

692
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,990
Come out.
