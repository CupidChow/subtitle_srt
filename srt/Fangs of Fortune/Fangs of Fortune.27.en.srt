[Fangs of Fortune]

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,979
[Episode 27]

3
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,690
Wen Xiao.

4
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,430
What a ridiculous farce!

5
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,430
It was already utterly foolish for Bingyi's descendant

6
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,700
to choose self-sacrifice.

7
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,510
And the evil demon, who was destined to be killed by him,

8
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,090
was actually willing

9
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,520
to be frozen solid with him.

10
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,610
I'm willing too.

11
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,560
But I'm not strong enough.

12
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm always not strong enough. I hate myself for that.

13
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,270
My master.

14
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,970
My best friend.

15
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,270
My beloved.

16
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,180
They died in front of me one by one.

17
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,850
All I could do…

18
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,160
was watch helplessly.

19
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,750
It turns out

20
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,420
you're all fools.

21
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,800
Thousands of years have passed.

22
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,950
The remains of my soul

23
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,010
are already fading.

24
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,070
I didn't expect

25
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,870
to witness such ridiculous

26
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,020
yet sincere bonds.

27
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,400
You're making this old soul of mine

28
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,520
miss the vibrant

29
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,920
mortal world.

30
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,230
Open it.

31
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,510
Dried flowers?

32
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,480
Mr. Zhuo intentionally left them behind.

33
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,210
They must be a useful clue.

34
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,270
Useless.

35
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,840
Useless?

36
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,980
He got these useless dried flowers

37
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,010
on his birthday

38
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,990
many years ago.

39
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,620
I didn't know it was his birthday

40
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,980
and didn't prepare a gift.

41
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,560
So I randomly picked some flowers

42
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,130
outside the Demon Hunting Bureau

43
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,540
and gave them to him.

44
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,190
I didn't expect him to still keep them.

45
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,430
My name is Wen Xiao.

46
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,080
In terms of seniority,

47
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,900
you should call me Aunt.

48
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,550
I'm glad to meet you.

49
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,420
I heard that today is your birthday.

50
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,820
You're in mourning

51
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,260
and can't celebrate it.

52
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,200
As your elder,

53
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,530
I'll give you

54
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,300
a small gift.

55
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,500
Wild flowers?

56
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,750
No!

57
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,720
How rude.

58
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,760
These are holy flowers from the Wilderness,

59
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,940
known as Zhi Chu.

60
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,270
They can make people forget their worries.

61
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,260
Zhi Chu…

62
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,390
Can they really make people forget

63
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,230
their worries and troubles?

64
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,900
Well,

65
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,400
actually,

66
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,500
only you can free yourself

67
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,950
from worry.

68
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,420
The book says

69
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,620
all life is suffering;

70
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,280
you can only find relief in yourself.

71
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,650
All life is suffering.

72
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,429
You can only find relief

73
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,340
in yourself.

74
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,750
Yes.

75
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,870
So,

76
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,400
I hope you can stop dwelling in misery

77
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,550
and sadness.

78
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,950
Besides,

79
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,790
I noticed you always wore dark blue.

80
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,910
The color of these flowers

81
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,510
goes very well with you.

82
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,730
So beautiful.

83
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,110
But I'm wearing…

84
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,670
white ramie now.

85
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,950
You won't always wear white.

86
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,220
Just like the snow out the window.

87
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,450
It'll eventually stop

88
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,440
and melt.

89
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,220
When flowers bloom on the hill,

90
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,460
the view out the window will definitely be colorful.

91
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,450
Everything I want to tell you…

92
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,920
has been written in it.

93
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,270
Read it, and you'll know.

94
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,160
Zhuo…

95
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,440
He was a fool.

96
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,110
He was too foolish.

97
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,630
At that time,

98
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,740
I told him…

99
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,630
Just like the snow out the window.

100
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,640
The snow will eventually stop…

101
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,870
It'll eventually stop…

102
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,980
and melt.

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,580
and melt.

104
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,650
The world won't always be white.

105
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,440
When flowers bloom on the hill,

106
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,520
the view out the window will definitely be colorful.

107
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,970
But now...

108
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,080
Look at him.

109
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,970
Look at him!

110
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,460
Look at him.

111
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,790
In the past thousands of years,

112
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,670
many demons and humans

113
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,310
have come here.

114
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,170
But only you guys

115
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,870
shocked and surprised me.

116
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,230
So,

117
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,080
I'm willing to give that boy

118
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,040
and that great demon another chance.

119
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,680
Within my soul

120
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,700
lies a realm of illusions

121
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,560
that can glimpse into the past

122
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,590
and foresee the future.

123
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,290
If he can pass the test,

124
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,020
I'll save him.

125
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,610
Are you

126
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,750
willing to wait?

127
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,630
Bingyi.

128
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,360
You've been thinking about it for seven days.

129
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,310
Any results?

130
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,930
Why does it have to be me?

131
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,620
Because in the whole world,

132
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,810
only you can do it.

133
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,070
But you'll die.

134
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,430
If the world can be saved,

135
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm willing to do it

136
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,810
and don't mind dying.

137
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,690
Ying Long.

138
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,420
You endured the pain of breaking your bones and horns

139
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,630
to forge this sword.

140
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,630
You gave this sword to me

141
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,210
and fought alongside me

142
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,690
to kill demons.

143
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,550
I can't do it.

144
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,820
The cloud sword is like a bone

145
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,030
attached to your left arm

146
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,840
to give you protection.

147
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,970
The light sword

148
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,310
is like a sharp horn

149
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,210
that can kill enemies for you.

150
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,500
It can cut clouds

151
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,840
and give off light.

152
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,370
That's why this sword is called

153
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,020
Cloud Light.

154
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,000
But you're not my enemy.

155
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,680
If the one who wields this sword

156
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,990
has to be me,

157
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,830
I don't understand

158
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,470
why I need to hold it against you

159
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,860
while there are so many other demons in the Wilderness.

160
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,990
After the great war,

161
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,170
time and space were thrown into chaos,

162
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,960
and the world collapsed.

163
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,790
Look at the night sky.

164
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,760
It's dark,

165
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,860
devoid of stars and the moon.

166
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,220
Such a world…

167
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,990
makes me really sad.

168
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,140
If it can't be restored…

169
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,190
the Wilderness and the mortal world

170
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,500
will be doomed.

171
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,910
I should contribute my last bit of power.

172
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,270
But how can the dark sky

173
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,470
be starry

174
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,560
and splendid again?

175
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,730
I have the power of creation,

176
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,360
so I should sacrifice my life

177
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,150
and become stars.

178
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,810
It's my duty

179
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,980
and honor.

180
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,280
Once one star is lit,

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,660
all stars will begin to shine.

182
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,670
Just let me be the first star.

183
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,410
The Cloud Light Sword is meant for both protection

184
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,930
and killing.

185
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,010
Only by killing me with it

186
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,870
can all living beings in the world be saved.

187
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,620
One should follow one's heart…

188
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,150
but forcing my best friend to kill me

189
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,980
is too cruel.

190
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,200
I'll do it myself.

191
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,040
Remember.

192
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,710
This is my choice,

193
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,990
not yours.

194
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,890
You don't have to bear any blame

195
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,300
or guilt.

196
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,990
I didn't expect you

197
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,680
to pass my test.

198
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,650
It was a test?

199
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,740
Your choice

200
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,840
was the same as my choice back then.

201
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,910
Otherwise,

202
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,650
you'd have to stay in the realm of illusions forever.

203
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,070
Luckily, I made the right choice.

204
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,580
Otherwise, I'd have to stay here forever

205
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,110
and listen to your nagging.

206
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,240
It turns out that the talkative one was not Bingyi

207
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,590
but Ying Long.

208
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,480
I chose to kill myself

209
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,610
and become stars.

210
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,810
It was my fate.

211
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,910
Protecting the world

212
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,950
with his sword until he died

213
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,870
was his fate.

214
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,010
Both he and I

215
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,020
seemed miserable,

216
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,280
but neither of us had any regrets.

217
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,710
Then we are indeed alike.

218
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,050
We both wanted to die

219
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,110
but didn't want our friends to die for us.

220
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,820
But Bingyi was soft-hearted.

221
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,750
He used a drop of his blood between his eyebrows

222
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,980
to extract a shred of my soul.

223
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,370
He then attached it to that dragon bone

224
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,670
and sealed it in the forbidden area of the Bingyi Clan.

225
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,780
People in his clan

226
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,400
were all soft-hearted.

227
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,750
But unfortunately,

228
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,730
you must have seen

229
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,510
your future just now.

230
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,470
Future?

231
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,540
Oh?

232
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,150
So

233
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,290
Zhuo Yichen saw the future,

234
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,910
and you saw

235
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,040
the past.

236
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,250
Although I didn't see the future,

237
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,590
I can guess what it's like.

238
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,900
It's not what you want,

239
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,660
but that day will eventually come.

240
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,450
Just like the fate of Bingyi and me.

241
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,640
You two

242
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,180
are really like us.

243
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,750
Long time no see.

244
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,530
Long time no see.

245
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,130
Do you understand

246
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,080
the illusion just now?

247
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,870
You understand

248
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,330
the illusion just now, don't you?

249
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,480
Yes.

250
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,270
Ying Long wasn't killed by Bingyi.

251
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,790
He chose to die himself.

252
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,800
But for thousands of years,

253
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,120
some people have believed that

254
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,450
Ying Long lost his sanity

255
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,670
and destroyed the world.

256
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,570
Bingyi killed him,

257
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,570
and it served him right.

258
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,110
In this world,

259
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,770
lies and truth have always coexisted,

260
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,640
just like good and evil,

261
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,070
day and night.

262
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,460
People always say demons are heartless.

263
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,840
But Ying Long

264
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,340
was righteous and selfless.

265
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,320
He didn't want

266
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,600
to go down in history.

267
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,730
He only wished to become dim starlight

268
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,310
and pierce through the dark night.

269
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,560
So,

270
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,120
being a demon

271
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,240
or a human

272
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,600
is merely a matter of title

273
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,500
and identity.

274
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
Just become

275
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,720
who you want to be.

276
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,450
As Bingyi's descendent,

277
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,780
you inherited his power.

278
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,080
So you should always remember that

279
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,880
the Cloud Light Sword is not meant for killing

280
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,280
but for protection.

281
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,260
Whether you're a human or a demon in the future,

282
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,930
only when you still wish to protect the world

283
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,120
can you be able to do it.

284
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,680
Go to the east of the Wilderness

285
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,650
to ask for a dragon scale.

286
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,730
Dragon scale?

287
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,670
Dragon scales can repair everything,

288
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,820
including the Cloud Light Sword.

289
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,690
Understood.

290
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,750
Thank you, Mr. Ying Long.

291
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,190
However,

292
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,300
it's not easy to get a dragon scale.

293
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,930
Don't worry.

294
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,310
My friend is here.

295
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,710
We'll go together.

296
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,870
Oh?

297
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,490
This time,

298
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,550
you won't ask me to get lost again, will you?

299
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,750
Zhao Yuanzhou!

300
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,270
Alright, alright.

301
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,780
Bingyi once said

302
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,570
the two most beautiful things in the world

303
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,540
are

304
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,490
a false alarm and a reunion after a long separation.

305
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,110
Having a friend who truly knows you,

306
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,530
you'll have no regrets in life.

307
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,650
I've been looking forward

308
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,290
to the return of my old friend.

309
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,210
Unfortunately…

310
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,500
You have his demon blood,

311
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,410
so meeting you

312
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,980
is another kind of reunion with him.

313
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,790
At the end of my life,

314
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,160
I got to witness

315
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,510
the deep bond among you four.

316
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,440
I hope in the future,

317
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,940
you guys can still

318
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,590
travel around the world

319
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,070
and have adventures

320
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,110
in the sun and under the moon

321
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,590
so that my sacrifice

322
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,370
to rebuild this world

323
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,050
can be worth it.

324
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,520
Actually,

325
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,890
we're not four

326
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,950
but five.

327
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,610
We did everything we did

328
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,030
to save the fifth person.

329
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,860
Then I hope when you reach the end,

330
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,200
all your hardships

331
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,030
will turn out to be false alarms

332
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,510
and fangs of fortune.

333
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:47,680
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

334
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:55,360

♫Find you♫

359
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,550
It's okay now.

360
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,080
Alright.

361
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,310
It's all over.

362
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,690
It's fine now.

363
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,980
I'm back.

364
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,430
Zhuo.

365
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,639
As a mortal,

366
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,980
you're not strong enough to carry Bingyi's blood.

367
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,350
I can't change that,

368
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,170
but I can give you the last dragon bone of mine

369
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,679
to help you develop an inner core

370
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,570
and become a demon.

371
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,030
But from now on,

372
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,110
you can only live as a demon.

373
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,250
You can't be a human anymore.

374
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,300
Are you sure you want that?

375
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,870
After experiencing everything in the illusion just now,

376
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,570
I don't care about that anymore.

377
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,290
However,

378
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,620
Mr. Ying Long,

379
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,400
the last shred of your soul

380
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,400
is in that dragon bone.

381
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,900
After giving it to me,

382
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,970
will you

383
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,250
completely disappear?

384
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,780
Zhuo.

385
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,260
Ying Long has long followed the way of Heaven

386
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,000
and become the sun, moon, and stars.

387
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,740
The last shred of my soul

388
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:07,980
only exists until now because Bingyi

389
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,450
wouldn't let me disappear back then.

390
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,050
That guy

391
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,790
was really stubborn.

392
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,640
I just didn't expect

393
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,100
to meet you after being trapped here

394
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,510
for thousands of years.

395
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,490
I'm very happy.

396
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,080
Maybe

397
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,960
this is Bingyi's blessing

398
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,940
for you.

399
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,310
Zhuo.

400
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,150
Zhuo.

401
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:29,820
I...

402
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,340
I think I have it.

403
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,510
The inner core!

404
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,080
I mean I have the inner core now.

406
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,550

430
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,800

So cool.

434
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,530

♫I sing under the moon and swing my sword to the wind♫

436

437

♫You say there are countless rules in this world♫

444

What is this?

451
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,940

Monkey!

457
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,190
You're indeed a stubborn mule.

458
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,630
Goddess, thank you. You found the Baize Token

459
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,000
and restored the Wilderness

460
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,980
so that I could regain my true form.

461
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,010
Ying Lei said

462
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,970
you're all Jiu's friends,

463
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,470
especially

464
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,170
his favorite person, Mr. Zhuo Yichen.

465
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,230
He's the closest to you.

466
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,110
Thank you for taking care of him.

467
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
I failed to take good care of him.

468
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,450
Otherwise,

469
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,360
he wouldn't have been possessed by Li Lun.

470
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,430
So Li Lun tried to stop us from going to the forbidden area of the Bingyi Clan

471
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,510
because he didn't want us

472
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,720
to repair the Cloud Light Sword.

473
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,610
When we fought yesterday,

474
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,670
I threw

475
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,850
some special spice on him.

476
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,530
No matter where he hides,

477
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,910
I can smell him

478
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,420
and find him.

479
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:52,870
Your good nose is such a great help, Ying Lei.

480
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,550
You're indeed a Mountain God.

481
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,380
Mr. Zhuo,

482
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,710
did you just praise me?

483
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,660
It's so rare.

484
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,420
After visiting the forbidden area of the Bingyi Clan,

485
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,720
Mr. Zhuo

486
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,400
became even better at sarcasm.

487
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,010
But Goddess,

488
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,560
the Longyu Clan has always

489
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,950
lived in seclusion.

490
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,100
After the Wilderness collapsed,

491
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,840
they disappeared.

492
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,650
I don't know where they are.

493
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,730
I know where Princess Longyu is.

494
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,680
Back then,

495
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,100
she went to the mortal world against her clan's rule

496
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,330
and killed someone there.

497
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,590
My master

498
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,120
imprisoned her somewhere in the Wilderness.

499
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,360
She can't go anywhere

500
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,600
unless summoned by Baize Goddess.

501
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,510
The dragon scale has detoxifying properties?

502
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,600
Who's there?

503
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,080
So their next step

504
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,600
is to look for the dragon scale of the Longyu Clan.

505
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,240
In the Chongwu Camp,

506
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,070
you watched Bai Jiu grow up.

507
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,420
He's like a brother to you.

508
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,580
Can you watch him die?

509
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,480
You came to me alone.

510
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,350
Is something bothering you?

511
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,810
Lord Bai Yan, you're so sensitive.

512
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,990
I want you to take a look at this for me.

513
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,800
Is there anything wrong

514
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,010
with the Baize Token?

515
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,750
Why does my heart hurt

516
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,090
like it's burning

517
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,620
every time after I play the wooden flute?

518
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,790
And it gets worse every time.

519
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,740
