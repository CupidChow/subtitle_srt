[Fangs of Fortune]

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,979
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,150
Are you a god?

4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,240
I am a demon.

5
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,390
Gods aren't the only ones

6
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,140
who can grant your wish.

7
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,740
Demons can do it too.

8
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,680
There must be a price, right?

9
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,419
Of course.

10
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,750
I'm willing.

11
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,980
Aren't you going to ask

12
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,940
what the price is?

13
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,350
I'm willing

14
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,430
no matter the price.

15
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,080
God,

16
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,880
Bodhisattva,

17
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,760
I wish for my illness to disappear,

18
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,220
for me to become stronger.

19
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,280
Let me help my sister

20
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,290
so that she won't have to carry the burden alone.

21
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,050
May my sister

22
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,360
be a happy, free,

23
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,450
and unrestrained woman.

24
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,860
May I no longer be a bystander

25
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,530
and instead share the burden.

26
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,550
Look.

27
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,140
His wish was so strong.

28
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,020
He was sick,

29
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,220
but he was determined.

30
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,660
Everything he did

31
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,110
was just to live on

32
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,970
to share your burden

33
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,400
and give you freedom.

34
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,030
But you...

35
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,180
You suspected him

36
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,040
and humiliated him.

37
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,520
He wanted to take the bow and arrow to share your burden.

38
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,720
But in the end,

39
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,720
he died under your bow.

40
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,570
Do you deserve

41
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,160
being called his sister?

42
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,230
Shut up!

43
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,640
You want to kill me?

44
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,770
Just like

45
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,909
how you killed your brother?

46
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,470
Just let go.

47
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,790
But what's the use of killing me?

48
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,760
You're just venting your anger

49
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,810
and deceiving yourself.

50
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,670
It was I

51
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,350
who helped him realize his wish,

52
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,510
while you

53
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,050
kept saying you were acting for his own good,

54
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,690
but you made him suffer so much.

55
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,910
He would rather be a demon

56
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,160
than be a human.

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,890
Pei Sijing,

58
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,610
your arrow

59
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,030
shouldn't point at me.

60
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,409
It should point at yourself.

61
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,650
A heartless person

62
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,840
also has tears?

63
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,909
Does Pei Siheng know you cried for him?

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,840
Have you ever felt guilty

65
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,700
in the days and nights after his death?

66
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,690
Have you ever,

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,150
for even a moment,

68
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,380
truly understood him?

69
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,240
Until his death,

70
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,950
the last words you left for him were...

71
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,110
You've committed countless sins.

72
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,010
You are unforgivable.

73
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,690
I was wrong.

74
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,440
Actually,

75
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,830
you feel guilty too.

76
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,360
You want to

77
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,620
personally apologize to Heng,

78
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,300
right?

79
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,770
Yes.

80
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,020
I owe him this.

81
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,270
I can take you to Heng

82
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,590
and let you apologize

83
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,440
in person.

84
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,500
Pei Sijing,

85
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,000
are you willing?

86
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Sister Pei!

87
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,100
Sister Pei, don't trust him!

88
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,920
Sister Pei, let me in!

89
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,170
Sister Pei!

90
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,090
Are you willing?

91
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,120
Sister Pei!

92
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,540
Sister Pei!

93
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,820
How?

94
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,460
How do I open this?

95
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,490
How do I open this?

96
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,390
I...

97
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,340
am willing.

98
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:28,150
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

99
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,040
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

100
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,770
♫Holding brilliance in the right hand♫

101
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,740
♫Biting down on all panic♫

102
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,230
♫Wiping away frost with the left hand♫

103
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,120
♫I finally look up♫

104
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,020
♫You're in front of me♫

105
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,510
Sister Pei!

106
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,700
I fulfilled your wish,

107
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,040
but you repaid me with betrayal.

108
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,950
Sister Pei.

109
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,610
Don't listen to his nonsense.

110
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,790
Your brother's nature is pure and kind.

111
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,690
He must have been tricked by this weasel

112
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,070
and that's why he became a demon.

113
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,700
He is the culprit.

114
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,710
Sister.

115
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,310
Why didn't you come to see me?

116
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,230
You turned me into this.

117
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,250
Sister.

118
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,100
I missed you.

119
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,150
Nonsense.

120
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,910
If you really hate your sister,

121
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,080
you wouldn't want her forgiveness.

122
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,970
I'm indeed sinful

123
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
and unforgivable.

124
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,100
But Sister,

125
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,780
I know I was wrong

126
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,650
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

127
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,750
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

128
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,770
♫I'm a black-and-white wound♫

129
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,580
But she still...

130
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,380
♫You're the vibrant red color♫

131
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,950
personally killed her own brother.

132
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,320
♫How can I not remember♫

133
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,960
♫You're always by my side♫

134
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,750
She never asked him why

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,790
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

136
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,600
or showed any pity.

137
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:34,010
♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

138
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,290
Her actions were swift

139
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,110
and her heart was firm.

140
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,240
You said she has no heart.

141
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,980
But do you think Sister Pei is happy?

142
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,950
She lives in pain and self-blame every day.

143
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,880
It's fake.

144
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,270
It's merely to ease

145
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,080
her conscience.

146
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,030
I don't know what's fake.

147
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,510
I only know you both don't say what you mean.

148
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,940
You always call me a child,

149
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,210
but even I am more honest than you.

150
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,030
You adults

151
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,950
easily say hurtful words,

152
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,020
but you hide your love in your heart.

153
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,530
Instead of being insincere,

154
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,910
the truth is what you should say,

155
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,750
right?

156
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,620
Mother, I don't understand.

157
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,310
Bai Jiu, you're still young.

158
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,350
Of course you don't understand.

159
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,700
But in this world,

160
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,190
love and hate coexist.

161
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,310
Often, just a slight difference in thought

162
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,970
can produce hatred from love,

163
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,710
and become an obsession.

164
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,580
This obsession

165
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,270
then becomes hatred.

166
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,290
This hatred

167
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,070
contains

168
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,100
deep love.

169
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,080
Heng.

170
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,910
Do you hate me?

171
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,750
I hate myself more.

172
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,870
Ridiculous.

173
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,790
In this world,

174
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,610
it is hard to distinguish between gratitude and resentment.

175
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,410
It is hard to erase love and hate.

176
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,390
All sincerity

177
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,340
will be betrayed.

178
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,410
Pei Siheng.

179
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,010
The person who killed you is right in front of you.

180
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,600
Take

181
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,170
your revenge.

182
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,510
You are indeed from a family of demon hunters.

183
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,240
Your brother can't defeat you.

184
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,940
Let me try.

185
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,110
Zhi Mei.

186
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,090
Zhi Mei is the most popular candidate

187
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,900
for the top courtesan of Tianxiang Pavilion.

188
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,880
You're well-informed, Mr. Zhuo.

189
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,820
I just didn't expect it.

190
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,280
You're so strict and orderly usually,

191
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,900
but you actually have such refined interests.

192
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,890
My refined interest

193
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,060
is killing demons that yap.

194
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,410
The annual courtesan selection of Tianxiang Pavilion

195
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,540
has caused a stir in Tiandu.

196
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,780
It's hard not to know.

197
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,410
Zhi Mei was unpopular before.

198
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,170
Now,

199
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,890
she's overwhelming the other competitors.

200
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,750
It means Cheng Huang has indeed fulfilled her wish.

201
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,010
Cheng Huang controlled Zhi Mei's puppet to kill,

202
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,290
setting up Cheng Huang's formation,

203
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,940
and absorbing the power of life.

204
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,360
Zhi Mei and the puppet are one.

205
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,510
The puppet absorbed the vitality of the living.

206
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,880
Zhi Mei

207
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,830
naturally regained her youthful beauty too.

208
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,360
If the murderer was Zhi Mei's puppet,

209
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,000
why was it Pei Siheng at the crime scene?

210
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,930
Or

211
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,840
was the Pei Siheng here

212
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,630
also a puppet?

213
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,580
I saw plum blossom petals

214
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,350
at the crime scene.

215
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,480
Look at the plum blossom petals

216
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,069
all over the stage.

217
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,970
It means the killer was indeed

218
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,790
Zhi Mei's puppet.

219
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,069
Maybe Pei Siheng

220
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,369
was only sent by Cheng Huang to save Zhi Mei's puppet.

221
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,890
There are no plum trees in the yard.

222
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,770
Where did these petals come from?

223
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,830
The plates are still warm.

224
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,940
That means

225
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,290
the murderer is still here.

226
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,940
Before, we didn't understand

227
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,140
why Pei Siheng became a demon

228
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,450
and why he came back to life.

229
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,460
Now we understand.

230
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,900
Pei Siheng

231
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,460
must have made a wish to Cheng Huang too.

232
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,360
You're indeed made of wood.

233
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,600
Sister is in danger.

234
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,260
Go save her!

235
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,270
Sister Pei!

236
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,500
Zhu Yan.

237
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,230
Surprised?

238
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,890
Old geezer.

239
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,860
I'm quite surprised.

240
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,940
I didn't expect

241
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,440
you're still as impolite as before.

242
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,260
I didn't expect

243
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,650
you would have hooked up with Li Lun.

244
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

245
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,250
Is that sundial

246
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,180
Li Lun's precious treasure?

247
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes.

248
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,660
So what?

249
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,290
Based on my understanding of Li Lun,

250
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,070
he won't give it to you for no reason.

251
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,720
Tell me.

252
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,120
What shameful deal did you two make?

253
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,800
Isn't the malicious energy on Zhao Yuanzhou

254
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,350
enough?

255
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,440
No.

256
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,010
How do you know so much?

257
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,960
Here.

258
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,190
I keep my word.

259
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,780
Since you know him so well,

260
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,290
why don't you take a guess?

261
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,350
To make you open the Kunlun Gate,

262
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,660
right?

263
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,600
Good guess.

264
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,860
Only demons like me

265
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,350
who have lived for tens of thousands of years

266
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,290
can do it.

267
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,520
Who is it?

268
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,940
A friend from the Demon Hunting Bureau?

269
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,390
I'll lend you the Truth Eye

270
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,680
and let you remember

271
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,330
what I look like.

272
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,270
Who are you?

273
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,980
Are you Ying Zhao's grandson?

274
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,730
You know me?

275
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,730
Of course.

276
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,260
I was taken care of Ying Zhao before,

277
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,850
so I don't want to hurt you.

278
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,310
Get out of my way.

279
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,690
Since I was asked to guard here,

280
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,390
I won't let anyone

281
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,650
inside.

282
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,960
With just you?

283
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,650
Cheng Huang.

284
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,420
You're an old demon who's lived for tens of thousands of years.

285
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,920
Instead of retiring,

286
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,350
you came to the mortal world without permission

287
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,750
and killed the innocent.

288
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,680
Do you admit your crime?

289
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,500
You have the power of the Qiankun,

290
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,490
yet you killed the innocent.

291
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,810
Do you admit your crime?

292
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,490
You are…

293
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,060
Baize Goddess?

294
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,720
Yes.

295
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,050
I'm here to capture you today.

296
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,110
Return to the Demon Hunting Bureau to be punished.

297
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,430
Evil?

298
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,190
I'm helping them realize their wishes.

299
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,490
You look for those with a wish

300
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,910
and bewitch them,

301
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,470
turning them into puppets.

302
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,670
Then you manipulate the puppets to kill

303
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,070
and absorb other people's lives

304
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,320
to fulfill their wishes.

305
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,250
If this isn't evil, then what is it?

306
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,610
I can grant your wish.

307
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,040
Are you willing?

308
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,380
[Tavern]

309
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,270
That's right.

310
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,590
Actually, the one who was killing

311
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,120
was not your brother,

312
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,710
but the puppet I made.

313
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,970
Kill this puppet and take revenge!

314
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,810
You've always been cold-hearted.

315
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,330
Let me see

316
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,550
if you can

317
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,850
do it now too.

318
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,530
Sister Pei.

319
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,230
I'm going to kill you

320
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,650
to avenge my brother!

321
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,250
Heng is my masterpiece.

322
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,450
I was very satisfied,

323
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,310
so I took him as my disciple.

324
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,480
Unfortunately,

325
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,370
Heng doesn't listen to me anymore.

326
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,450
It's useless to keep him.

327
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
But now it seems

328
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,500
you still can't bear to kill him.

329
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,160
How about

330
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,550
I help you?

331
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,300
Brother!

332
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Even the Original Goddess couldn't do anything to me.

333
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,430
You,

334
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,780
with only half of the Baize Token,

335
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,760
think you can order me to stop?

336
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,890
I'm old now.

337
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,060
I feel tired when I move.

338
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,900
I'm not in the mood

339
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,560
to play with you kids anymore.

340
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,550
Since you like staying in the sundial so much,

341
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,250
you can stay

342
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,520
until the end of the world.

343
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,510
Heng.

344
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,410
Before,

345
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,350
I wondered countless times

346
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,230
if you would cry

347
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,600
for me when I died.

348
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,130
Why wouldn't I?

349
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,370
Of course I would.

350
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,390
Because you are my brother.

351
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,800
You've always been

352
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,520
cold and distant since childhood.

353
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,630
I never understood your emotions.

354
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,590
When I was young,

355
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,790
I got angry and said

356
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,830
that even if I died,

357
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,510
you wouldn't shed a single tear for me.

358
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,270
But now,

359
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,690
I realized

360
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,320
I don't want you to cry at all.

361
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,590
Sister.

362
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,570
Don't cry.

363
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,910
I don't deserve you to cry for me.

364
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,010
Heng.

365
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,330
I'm sorry.

366
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,710
If...

367
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,670
If I could let you finish back then...

368
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,930
Back then,

369
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,640
I only...

370
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,230
Don't blame yourself.

371
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,880
I didn't kill them,

372
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,030
but I caused the disaster.

373
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,790
It was me.

374
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,030
I killed so many innocent people.

375
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,909
You didn't do anything wrong.

376
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,840
I just want you

377
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,520
to forgive me.

378
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,440
Don't blame me.

379
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,050
Sister.

380
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,150
After I die,

381
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,630
♫I guard the eaves♫

382
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,040
I won't be able to do anything for you anymore.

383
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,090
♫And watch the times fade♫

384
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:13,310
♫You hold the flame and watch the night♫

385
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,100
Heng

386
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,130
♫I count the winters♫

387
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,550
What else can I do for you

388
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,760
♫And waited for one more year♫

389
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,070
♫My heart is full of passion♫

390
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,570
Good

391
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,610
Good.

392
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,140
Live

393
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,460
♫The stars dazzle and the crescent moon curves♫

394
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,870
And

395
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,740
♫The guilty greed♫

396
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,300
♫Thousands of dark hairs, long and short♫

397
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,810
Heng.

398
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,560
♫The cruel entanglement♫

399
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,430
Don't leave me.

400
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,360
♫Lend me the cold lamp for one night♫

401
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,740
♫Let regret stay before dawn♫

402
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,670
Heng.

403
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,230
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

404
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,100
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

405
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,250
♫In the sky of floating snowflakes♫

406
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,890
♫You are the only warm bloom♫

407
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,660
♫But why don't I remember♫

408
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,430
♫How much the plot has twisted?♫

409
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,330
♫I forgot the bitter karma♫

♫Helpless♫

♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,520
♫I'm a black-and-white wound♫

♫How can I not remember♫

417
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,740
♫You're always by my side♫

418
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,630
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

419
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:38,310
♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

420
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,990
Cheng Huang said we're going to stay here

421
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,400
until the end of the world.

422
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,260
Zhao Yuanzhou,

423
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,270
what should we do?

424
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,910
He's the one who controls the sundial.

425
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,880
If he won't show up,

426
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,450
it's indeed troublesome.

427
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,890
Appear.

428
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:49,930
I hope I can

429
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,430
pass the imperial examination

430
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,160
and become an official who pleads for the people.

431
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,240
I hope I can find my true love

432
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,810
and be together forever.

433
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,810
If I can give birth to my child,

434
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,590
I will repay you for my wish.

435
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,540
It's a normal puppet without memories.

436
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,870
This puppet...

437
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,940
What?

438
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,260
I've seen her

439
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,220
in the album of past goddesses that my master gave me.

440
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,730
She was the Original Goddess.

441
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,850
The Original Goddess?

442
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,200
You didn't know?

443
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,480
Just now,

444
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,980
Cheng Huang mentioned it.

445
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm so young.

446
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,340
How would I know?

447
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,030
I didn't exist

448
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,090
when the Original Goddess appeared.

449
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,140
Only an old monster like Cheng Huang

450
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,250
would have met the Original Goddess.

451
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,600
Then why does Cheng Huang have a puppet of the Original Goddess?

452
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,670
Could it be

453
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,110
she also had a wish that she couldn't tell

454
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,840
and was cheated by Cheng Huang?

455
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,350
The goddess's wish

456
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,400
was peace between the two realms,

457
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,070
for kindness and evil to have consequences,

458
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,500
and for bad demons like Cheng Huang to be punished.

459
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,230
How could she be cheated by him?

460
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,810
But

461
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,230
it's evident

462
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,430
that Cheng Huang treated this puppet

463
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,490
very differently.

464
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,890
The paint on it was retouched

465
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,110
after it faded.

466
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,730
It's exquisite.

467
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,680
Hmm...

468
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,040
I got it.

469
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,410
Let's use this puppet as a hostage.

470
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,790
Old thing,

471
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,350
I'll count down from three.

472
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,830
If you don't come out,

473
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,730
I'll destroy this puppet

474
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,640
and twist off her head.

475
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,080
Three.

476
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,500
Two.

477
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,170
One.

478
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,390
If you don't come out,

479
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,150
I'll kiss her.

480
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,810
Ridiculous.

481
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,540
This is an emergency.

482
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,920
It calls for desperate tactics.

483
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,350
This tactic is too desperate.

484
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,150
The desperateness is too tacky.

485
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,610
Are you really not coming out?

486
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,520
You bastard!

487
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,500
Give it back!

488
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,210
Otherwise, none of you can get out.

489
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,150
Well,

490
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm not in a hurry to go out.

491
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,030
I just want to hear some legendary gossip.

492
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,640
What's your relationship

493
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,650
with the Original Goddess?

494
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,000
How could a heartless demon

495
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,190
have anything to do with the goddess?

496
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,310
Why not?

497
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,890
Didn't the cruelest demon in the world

498
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,950
also call Zhao Wan'er his sister?

499
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,540
How can you compare with me?

500
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,540
Wan'er and I were really like siblings.

501
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,440
But you...

502
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,200
You secretly painted the goddess's puppet

503
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,860
but cut back on the fabric,

504
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,480
making her seem a bit frivolous.

505
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,290
Shut up!

506
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,340
I'll kill you!

507
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,920
Stop!

508
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,720
Shut up or stop?

509
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,950
Zhu Yan.

510
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,850
Brother Zhuo!

511
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,420
Brother Zhuo.

512
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,020
We came out of the illusion.

513
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,210
I don't think so.

514
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,510
Zhao Yuanzhou,

515
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,870
where are we?

516
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,320
This mountain and stone

517
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,230
is the way from the Wilderness to the Kunlun Gate.

518
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,030
But this is not the Wilderness.

519
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,630
It's just a replica of the Wilderness.

520
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,140
We're still in Cheng Huang's illusion.

521
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,120
Why did you

522
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,010
invite us here?

523
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,770
Didn't you want to know

524
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,580
about the Original Goddess?

525
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,670
No one wants to know

526
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,910
about your stupid love life.

527
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,230
Hurry up and—

528
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,170
I want to know.

529
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,110
The original Baize Token

530
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,920
was divided into two.

531
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,540
The Original Goddess

532
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,200
and the strongest Great Demon of the Wilderness

533
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,750
managed it together.

534
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,370
After the ancient flood,

535
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,220
the gods fell.

536
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,600
The human and demon worlds

537
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,950
fell into chaos.

538
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,260
I was ordered by White Emperor Shaohao

539
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,430
to rule the demons in the Wilderness

540
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,330
and protect all beings.

541
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,030
But as destined by fate,

542
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,590
I, Baize, am a celestial beast

543
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,100
and am immortal,

544
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,170
but I’m willing to sacrifice myself

545
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:16,090
and transform into the power of Baize

546
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,160
to be passed on in the world.

547
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,110
Each generation, I will choose

548
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,340
the purest human

549
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,550
to control all demons.

550
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,230
Bless everything.

551
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,830
Invulnerable to all evil.

552
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,800
We promise to work together

553
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,840
and guard the Wilderness.

554
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,650
And guard the Wilderness.
