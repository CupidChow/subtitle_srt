[Episode 26]

3
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,190
We've caught the demon.

4
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,009
Shut up!

5
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,450
Where's Zhuo?

6
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,400
Mr. Zhuo...

7
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
ran away.

8
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,910
Everyone,

9
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,730
the Chongwu Camp has caught the demon who committed the crime last night.

10
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,920
He is the monster captured by the Chongwu Camp:

11
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,520
Ao Yin.

12
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,230
So he is a demon.

13
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,140
Yeah.

14
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,329
Ao Yin

15
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,940
is best at transforming.

16
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,050
He can transform into anyone.

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,620
He was the one who killed the Prime Minister.

18
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,829
We've finally caught him this time.

19
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,760
The Chongwu Camp is impressive.

20
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,579
Yeah.

21
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,840
You have caught such a powerful demon.

22
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,390
Impressive.

23
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,760
We rely on the Chongwu Camp to protect us.

24
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,670
The Demon Hunting Bureau covered for demons.

25
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,470
No.

26
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,290
She is not Ao Yin.

27
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,580
He should be

28
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,670
a demonized human with Ao Yin's capability created by Wen Zongyu.

29
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,170
But why would Wen Zongyu help us?

30
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,930
I guess he wants Mr. Zhuo's Cloud Light Sword.

31
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,130
Otherwise, he won't be able to kill me

32
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,470
or take my inner core.

33
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,590
So,

34
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,410
he can't let anything happen to Zhuo.

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,920

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,260

♫Love, hate, absurdity, mistakes♫

♫The dream never ends♫

59
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,850
Right?

60
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,210
It's also hard to accept.

61
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,520
Right?

62
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,060
So this is how you felt

63
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,420
when you lost control.

64
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,830
It's like having a very deep dream

65
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,680
and being gripped by fear beyond control.

66
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,590
It's okay.

67
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,180
It's all in the past.

68
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,010
Zhao Yuanzhou.

69
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,430
I understand you now.

70
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,750
Many times,

71
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,350
when I held the Cloud Light Sword,

72
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,500
I asked myself in my heart

73
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,990
if I should

74
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,600
kill you or not.

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,250
It seemed each choice

76
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,350
left a part of me

77
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,030
unconvinced.

78
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,610
Only when

79
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,400
I became you

80
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,520
did I finally understand.

81
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,670
I never thought

82
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,590
that one day,

83
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,870
you would become a demon.

84
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,270
You lost control due to the malicious energy

85
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,560
and killed your loved ones.

86
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,650
The shadow

87
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,610
has weighed on you ever since,

88
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
with nowhere to hide.

89
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,910
If

90
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,690
I could feel those earlier,

91
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,340
perhaps I would have dropped the Cloud Light Sword.

92
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,750
But now,

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,150
the sword is broken.

94
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,350
Maybe

95
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,590
God thinks I'm too stubborn

96
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,950
and hesitant.

97
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,760
So he made a decision for me.

98
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,390
Otherwise,

99
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,170
if I really kill you,

100
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,510
I definitely will regret it.

101
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,630
I can't kill him.

102
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,250
Ying Long's prophecy

103
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,390
seems to be wrong.

104
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,470
No.

105
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,280
Ying Long's prophecies have never been wrong.

106
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,310
Because it's not a prophecy.

107
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,910
It's a curse.

108
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,910
I think I said too much.

109
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,790
I'm not this talkative usually.

110
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,310
I guess it's because of Bingyi's blood.

111
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,610
He must have been a very talkative demon.

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,700
Have you ever heard of this?

113
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,270
Humans are naturally humans

114
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,640
because they were born humans.

115
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,270
While demons

116
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,250
need to cultivate hard to become humans.

117
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,530
Monsters are simple,

118
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,360
but instinctively bloodthirsty.

119
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,850
We are more like animals.

120
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,730
They want to hunt when they're hungry.

121
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,360
When they're in danger,

122
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,990
they bare their fangs.

123
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,380
Humans are a type of animal.

124
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,200
But over the course of time,

125
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,500
they have created civilization,

126
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,760
defined good and evil,

127
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,470
and formulated laws and regulations.

128
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,690
So,

129
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,470
humans

130
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,240
are called humans because they

131
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,790
have done many things

132
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,180
that only humans can do.

133
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,270
Just like Bingyi.

134
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,810
So,

135
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,830
do whatever you want

136
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,430
to become what you want to be.

137
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,710
Do whatever you want

138
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,130
to become what you want to be.

139
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,800
Yes.

140
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,350
Why are you suddenly so knowledgeable?

141
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,760
You do know me well.

142
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,800
Actually,

143
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,600
Wen Xiao told me that.

144
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,560
Don't be smug.

145
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,120
So,

146
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,790
even though you've become a demon,

147
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,850
it doesn't matter.

148
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,200
You can still be ambitious,

149
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,260
cherish what you have,

150
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,910
and enjoy your life.

151
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,010
What about you?

152
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,680
What about me?

153
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,600
Do you want to be a demon

154
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,760
or a human?

155
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,570
♫Who misses the youth gazing at the bitter sea♫

156
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,430
I...

157
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,030
♫He shouted and wanted to be heard by the world♫

158
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,040
have never changed.

159
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,120
I've always been

160
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,760
♫The cruel debts of fate♫

161
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,590
♫Are exchanged for the phrase "I'm willing"♫

162
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,580
a great demon seeking death.

163
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,880
♫Wind blows in the distance♫

164
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,810
♫The distant boat approaches the shore♫

165
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,630
Persistent demons

166
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,670
cultivate hard,

167
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,470
hoping they can be immortal.

168
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,340
You really are an anomaly.

169
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,570
Brother.

170
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,950
Have I

171
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,000
turned myself into an anomaly?

172
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,390
It doesn't matter even if I'm considered an anomaly.

173
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,190
Your eyes lie.

174
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,240
But your heart

175
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,120
will tell you the answer.

176
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,810
We will always be with you.

177
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,840
As Ying Lei said,

178
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,470
we formed a family

179
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,710
consisting of

180
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,510
humans,

181
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,390
gods,

182
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
demons,

183
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,310
and half-gods, half-demons.

184
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,590
We are family.

185
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,780
Yichen.

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,440
Do you know most people

187
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,770
avoid using Chen in their names?

188
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,920
Yes.

189
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,630
Because Chen has a significant meaning.

190
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,560
It symbolizes imperial power.

191
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,260
It's too much for ordinary people.

192
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,630
But Father

193
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,550
insisted on using Chen in your name.

194
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,420
Father said

195
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,410
the meaning of Chen

196
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,640
is actually a roof that shelters all.

197
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,330
With a roof,

198
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,130
people can shelter from the wind and rain.

199
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,110
With a roof,

200
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,150
there is a home.

201
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,810
But Mr. Zhuo,

202
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,590
only you can fulfill my wish.

203
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,650
Please.

204
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,030
I guess I won't be able to keep my promise.

205
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,870
Bingyi's demonic power

206
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,170
is getting stronger.

207
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,600
I may not be able to make it

208
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,830
to fulfill your wish.

209
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,840
Actually, I'm not afraid of death.

210
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,510
I just hope that before I die,

211
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,380
the Cloud Light Sword can be restored.

212
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,720
In this way,

213
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,550
I can at least save Jiu.

214
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,110
After I die,

215
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,970
remember

216
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,670
to take good care of...

217
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,110
Hey.

218
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,300
Stop.

219
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,030
Things like last wishes

220
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,570
are the most annoying.

221
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,920
You haven't reached the end of your life.

222
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,010
You should continue to move forward.

223
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,380
We'll move forward together.

224
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,670
What took you so long?

225
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,100
You two had that much to say?

226
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,380
He asked me to take care of you.

227
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,440
I don't know if that means he wants me to marry you.

228
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,270
Nonsense.

229
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,270
Just kidding.

230
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,150
He didn't say that.

231
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,120
But I know he must think so.

232
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,680
He hopes I can take care of you

233
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,840
and protect you.

234
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,570
Perhaps

235
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,040
you're the only one

236
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,510
he cares about the most

237
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,690
and worries about the most.

238
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,930
Couldn't you two talk about something good?

239
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,080
You

240
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,070
should care about your injury first.

241
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Let me take a look.

242
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,359
Has

243
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,000
no one ever

244
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,910
helped you apply ointment?

245
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,220
I'm a demon.

246
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,440
My wounds can heal immediately.

247
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,270
No need to apply ointment.

248
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,190
Some wounds can't.

249
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,710
You mean the wounds on my back?

250
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:45,900
No.

251
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,700
The wounds in your heart.

252
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,010
By the way,

253
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,310
it's very dangerous to go

254
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,970
to Bingyi Clan's forbidden area.

255
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,070
So before that,

256
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,830
we need to do something.

257
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,820
I know.

258
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,040
We need to go back to Mount Kunlun

259
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,770
to activate the Star Formation

260
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,550
and restore the Wilderness.

261
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,720
All sources converge.

262
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,820
Yin and Yang reflect each other,

263
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,530
and Heaven and Earth work in harmony.

264
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,510
Unite.

265
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,680
Honey.

266
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,030
Great!

267
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,070
The Kunlun Gate

268
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,600
has finally been restored.

269
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,950
What's wrong?

270
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,300
Nothing.

271
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,990
Let's go to Bingyi Clan's forbidden area now.

272
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,310
Aren't you going to invite us to go

273
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,710
to Bingyi Clan's forbidden area together?

274
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,900
You go first!

275
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,920
I'll stall them!

276
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,350
Ying Lei!

277
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,010
Mr. Zhuo,

278
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,660
it's not that easy

279
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,870
to break Mountain God's barrier!

280
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,670
But you...

281
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,570
I have the Shanhai Portal!

282
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,400
You go first!

283
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Okay.

284
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:11,760
Let's go!

285
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,290
After passing through this cave,

286
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,690
we'll reach Bingyi Clan's forbidden area:

287
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,830
the Qijuan Cave.

288
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,630
Zhuo!

289
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,950
These are...

290
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,810
monsters' bodies and skeletons.

291
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,680
Why did so many monsters

292
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,910
want to break into Bingyi Clan's forbidden area?

293
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,510
What on earth is in it?

294
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,310
Since so many demons risked their lives to come,

295
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,510
it must be something rare in this world.

296
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,730
There has been a legend in the Wilderness.

297
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,850
It says there is an ancient treasure

298
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,240
in the forbidden area of Bingyi Clan.

299
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,150
An ancient treasure?

300
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,230
Some people say

301
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,090
it's the Holy Ice Spring Water that can prolong life.

302
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,540
Some people say

303
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,430
it's a mysterious herb that can improve cultivation by 1,000 years.

304
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,590
There is another extreme statement.

305
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,980
The treasure hidden inside

306
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,230
can make any of your wishes come true.

307
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,120
Still, they ran away.

308
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,750
Should we continue to go after them to Bingyi Clan's forbidden area?

309
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,550
No need.

310
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,490
Bingyi Clan's forbidden area

311
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,400
is extremely dangerous.

312
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,770
We don't need to take the risk.

313
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,030
What if they really find a way

314
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,890
to restore the Cloud Light Sword?

315
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,230
Do you know

316
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,650
why Bingyi Clan's forbidden area

317
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,070
is so mysterious?

318
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,510
Because in the forbidden area,

319
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,960
there is a monster that has survived

320
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,110
since ancient times.

321
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,340
Wait.

322
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,150
What's wrong?

323
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,290
It's my responsibility

324
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,150
to restore the Cloud Light Sword.

325
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,650
I want to walk the path

326
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,800
on my own from here.

327
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,470
You guys go back.

328
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,080
Nonsense.

329
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,570
Why is it your responsibility

330
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,320
to restore the Cloud Light Sword?

331
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm about to die anyway.

332
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,880
I can put up a desperate fight.

333
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,150
I have nothing to fear.

334
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,480
But you guys are different.

335
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,810
You still have so many things to do

336
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,160
in the mortal world.

337
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,070
Mr. Zhuo, don't you think

338
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,560
you're being condescending?

339
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,360
Mr. Zhuo...

340
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,050
is in a dilemma.

341
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,540
Right?

342
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,280
Let's give up

343
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,040
restoring the Cloud Light Sword.

344
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,770
If we can't restore it,

345
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,350
you'll die,

346
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,110
and I'll live.

347
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,180
But everyone in this world will suffer.

348
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,020
If we restore it,

349
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,790
I'll die,

350
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,070
and you'll live.

351
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
And everyone in this world can live.

352
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,470
So,

353
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,190
it's better to restore it.

354
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,200
Even if it's restored,

355
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,590
please don't die.

356
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,170
Zhao Yuanzhou,

357
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,250
if you promise me that,

358
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,540
I'll go in with you.

359
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,470
I can't promise you that.

360
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,370
Because my life

361
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,630
is actually in your hands.

362
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,990
I can only promise you

363
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,750
I won't seek death anymore.

364
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,230
Is that okay?

365
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,720
Okay.

366
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,170
Wen Xiao.

367
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,390
Pei Sijing.

368
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,480
Wait for us here.

369
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,190
If we don't come back,

370
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau.

371
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,310
Zhuo Yichen!

372
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,070
Wen Xiao.

373
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,160
Call me Aunt!

374
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,390
What?

375
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,270
This matter

376
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,080
is non-negotiable.

377
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,760
Don't talk back.

378
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,590
But I...

379
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,630
What?

380
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,870
Family ties in the mortal world

381
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,990
are scarier than the demonic power in the Wilderness.

382
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,850
You shut up too!

383
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,980
You've known them for quite some time.

384
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,520
It's impossible to get rid of them.

385
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,050
Let's go.

386
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,560
Don't forget what you promised me.

387
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,500
I promised you

388
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,180
a lot of things.

389
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,630
I'll fulfill them one by one.

390
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,970
If I can't fulfill all my promises,

391
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,590
don't blame me, Mr. Zhuo.

392
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,470
Who is here?

393
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,960
Who is asking?

394
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,360
Shut up.

395
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,240
Aren't you ashamed?

396
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,840
Is it necessary to be scared?

397
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,970
No matter how scary he is,

398
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,040
he's still my ancestor.

399
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,500
Would you be afraid when you visit someone's grave?

400
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,450
I'm a great demon.

401
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,480
Why do I need to visit a grave?

402
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,680
Shut up.

403
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,990
It doesn't matter who I am.

404
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,590
But you...

405
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,080
Your eyes

406
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,650
look like his very much.

407
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,780
Bingyi's descendant,

408
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,060
why are you here?

409
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,530
My Cloud Light Sword is broken.

410
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,360
I came here to see if there's a way to restore it.

411
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,330
Oh?

412
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,910
I didn't expect

413
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,710
the Cloud Light Sword

414
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,450
to be broken one day.

415
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,600
The Cloud Light Sword

416
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,880
was broken by me.

417
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,510
I've let my ancestors down.

418
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,330
I specially came here

419
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,600
to ask for help.

420
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,470
Sir, do you know

421
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,890
how to restore it?

422
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,790
The Five-Colored Stone can restore it.

423
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,700
Unfortunately,

424
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,690
you destroyed the Five-Colored Stone too.

425
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,800
How did you know that?

426
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,100
The demon tattoo on his body

427
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,940
means

428
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,040
he has absorbed

429
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,230
Bingyi's blood sealed in the Five-Colored Stone.

430
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,020
This young man

431
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,160
will become a demon soon.

432
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,920
Is there any other way?

433
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,010
Yes.

434
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,920
Please enlighten us.

435
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,790
Of course.

436
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,950
But I have one condition.

437
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,170
What's that?

438
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,700
Since Bingyi left,

439
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,310
I've been all alone.

440
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,590
It's cold and lonely here.

441
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,130
Every minute is like torment.

442
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,430
Bingyi's descendant,

443
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,510
listen carefully.

444
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,620
My condition is

445
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,110
you choose one to accompany me here.

446
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,910
Then I'll tell you

447
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,020
how to restore the Cloud Light Sword.

448
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,120
Accompany you here?

449
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,030
What does that mean?

450
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,390
Since you're Bingyi's descendant,

451
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,680
you must know how to use the freezing technique.

452
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,080
If you freeze one person into ice

453
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,650
and leave that person here

454
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,660
to accompany me forever,

455
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,050
I'll tell you how to restore it.

456
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,550
What do you think?

457
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,840
I'm not going to do that.

458
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,900
I don't want to restore

459
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,370
the Cloud Light Sword.

460
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Then all of them should stay.

461
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,860
Leave one here

462
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,150
or leave three here.

463
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,850
It's up to you.

464
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,450
Ms. Pei.

465
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,250
I've never had a chance

466
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,920
to thank you properly.

467
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,300
Zhuo Yichen,

468
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,880
what are you going to do?

469
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,620
Thank you

470
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,060
for protecting Wen Xiao

471
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,840
and everyone all this time.

472
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,710
No need to thank me.

473
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,040
I didn't protect Wen Xiao

474
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,570
for your sake.

475
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,580
Everything I want to tell you

476
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,170
has been written in it.

477
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,090
You'll understand after reading it.

478
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,910
Do you

479
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,490
still remember

480
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,970
what I told you before?

481
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,880
Those harsh words you said?

482
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,000
I forgot them long ago.

483
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,110
I am

484
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,390
broad-minded

485
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,920
and I don't hold grudges.

486
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,230
Zhao Yuanzhou,

487
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,570
every time you messed around,

488
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,580
I would stare at you.

489
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,350
You would always give in and look like you were scared.

490
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,570
But I know

491
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,120
you've never been afraid of me.

492
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,050
You're not even afraid of death.

493
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,460
Take good care of Wen Xiao for me.

494
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,310
She likes to go on adventures

495
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,520
and cause trouble.

496
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,440
Do your best to stop her.

497
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,190
But she may not listen to me.

498
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,380
She will.

499
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,710
Zhuo.

500
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,440
Zhuo Yichen.

501
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,310
Zhuo!

502
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,390
Zhuo Yichen!

503
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,150
Zhuo Yichen!

504
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,590
What are you going to do?

505
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,430
Zhuo!

506
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,240
Zhuo!

507
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,630
I choose myself.

508
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,750
Zhuo!

509
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,530
After the Cloud Light Sword is restored,

510
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,910
it will find a new master in the mortal world.

511
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,470
Find him

512
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,950
and ask him to save Jiu.

513
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,550
In this way,

514
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,910
I'll have no regrets.

515
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,010
Zhao Yuanzhou.

516
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,350
Zhao Yuanzhou!

517
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,430
Zhao Yuanzhou!

518
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,250
Zhao Yuanzhou!

519
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,250
Get them out of here!

520
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,550
Go away!

521
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,570
I've always wanted to die.

522
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,830
Everyone can be satisfied

523
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,070
if I die here.

524
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,230
Zhao...

525
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,440
Zhao...

526
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,620
Zhao Yuanzhou.

527
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,280
Go.

528
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,330
I'm a 1,000-year-old great demon.

529
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,060
I don't believe I can't break

530
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,530
your ridiculous and heartless ice with all my power

531
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:43,140
and all the malicious energy in this world.

532
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,490
Break.
