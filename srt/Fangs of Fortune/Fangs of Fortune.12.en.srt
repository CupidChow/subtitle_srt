Hey.

We were just lying

It was fake.

154
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,400
I learned from a book

that this kind of demon can deplete water

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,960
What's in this incense burner?

196
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,300
This is Lingxi Villa.

197
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,360
Of course it's a rhinoceros horn.

198
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,700
Burning rhinoceros horns

199
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,100
can connect Yin and Yang.

200
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,510
It can help me attract the malicious energy in and outside the villa.

201
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,490
Mr. Zhuo.

202
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,690
Do you know what malicious energy is?

203
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,130
Hatred in this world

204
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,990
transforms into malicious energy.

205
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,540
It's natural sustenance for fierce beasts.

206
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,820
It can also awaken the hatred and pain

207
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,180
deep in your heart.

208
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,310
Come on.

209
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,810
Listen to the hatred deep in your heart.

210
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,920
Let it tell you what to do.

211
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,360
Kill him.

212
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,690
It's dark in the secret tunnel.

213
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,230
Let's use the Baize Divine Power

214
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,140
to explore it.

215
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,030
As a great demon,

216
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,770
you actually need my power

217
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,750
to feel the barrier?

218
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,030
Actually, I can do it myself.

219
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,530
Just say it if you want to hold Xiao's hand.

220
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,830
How old are you?

221
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,010
You already understand this kind of thing?

222
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,280
I remember I first knew what love is

223
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,770
when I was 370 years old.

224
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,760
Zhao Yuanzhou.

225
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,740
Go to jail.

226
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,630
Let's go.

227
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,190
Let's go.

228
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,950
Let's go.

229
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,190
What's wrong?

230
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,410
Our route here has been completely blocked off.

231
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,070
Kill him.

232
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,460
You scared me.

233
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,870
Friend,

234
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,850
why are you so mysterious?

235
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,350
What is this?

236
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,630
In a world plagued by a disease,

237
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,540
Qing Geng Goddess used red pigments

238
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,350
to dye Jinli stones

239
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,090
and gave them to everyone

240
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,640
to ensure their safety.

241
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,180
The people on the mural

242
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,010
also have the red bead bracelet.

243
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,450
Qing Geng Goddess?

244
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,400
Everybody wants to be a goddess.

245
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,620
Do they really think it's very easy to be a goddess?

246
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,070
I learned from a book

247
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,580
that Qing Geng lives on cypress trees,

248
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,790
living off their flowers and fruits.

249
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,190
It does have the ability to ward off plague.

250
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,850
Qing Geng...

251
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,330
can only protect herself from plague.

252
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,150
In fact,

253
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,890
she is just an ordinary demon.

254
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,870
I saw her in the Wilderness before.

255
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,670
She was always flying in the forest.

256
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,190
She was noisier than Jiu.

257
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,820
How can a small sparrow

258
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,510
be called a goddess?

259
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,089
Most so-called deities exist

260
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,750
merely to satisfy people's desires.

261
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,650
When they want something,

262
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,829
they turn to deities.

263
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,760
But when a calamity strikes,

264
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,450
they would complain

265
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,790
that deities are unresponsive,

266
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,430
nature is merciless,

267
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,710
and all beings suffer.

268
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,970
Then they would do bad things without guilt

269
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,240
and shift the blame

270
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,640
to those imagined deities.

271
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,890
If everyone wearing this bead died,

272
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,580
it was not for warding off the plague.

273
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,000
Could it be...

274
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,460
But there's only an ordinary mural here.

275
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,310
There is no exit.

276
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,030
Fei.

277
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,750
Fei?

278
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,240
He's so mysterious.

279
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,370
Since Qing Geng

280
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,260
wants to be a goddess desperately

281
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,030
and wants everyone

282
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,580
to worship her as a goddess,

283
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,500
let's just do it.

284
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,430
What?

285
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,670
Goddess, you...

286
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,330
Let's go.

287
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,420
We don't know what's inside.

288
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,670
Zhao Yuanzhou,

289
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,890
you go first.

290
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,320
I'll follow in the rear.

291
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,990
Let's go.

292
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,470
Wen!

293
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,070
Goddess!

294
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,830
Great Demon!

295
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,090
Open the door!

296
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,840
So, is what you found an exit

297
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,150
or a trap?

298
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,880
Whatever it is,

299
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,320
we can only move forward.

300
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,750
Come on.

301
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,800
Protect me.

302
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,410
Or we'll die together.

303
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,470
Of course.

304
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,730
Open the door!

305
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,120
Why won't it open?

306
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,010
Sister Pei, pray...

307
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,950
The door is not responding.

308
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,470
It won't

309
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,060
open.

310
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:54,920
Is it broken?

311
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,870
Sister Pei!

312
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,870
Sister Pei, what's wrong?

313
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,540
Sister Pei!

314
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,230
Gosh!

315
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,480
Sister Pei, you have been infected with the plague!

316
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,270
The plague?

317
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,930
Zhuo.

318
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,380
Zhao Yuanzhou.

319
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,740
Zhuo.

320
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,260
Zhuo.

321
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,080
Don't come near us!

322
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,270
He's being controlled by malicious energy.

323
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,670
He's very dangerous now.

324
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,310
Why is there so much malicious energy on you?

325
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm going to kill you.

326
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,330
We share the same thought and are like-minded.

327
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,990
But you can't do it now.

328
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,450
Don't move.

329
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,010
I'm helping you.

330
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,870
I'm going to kill you.

331
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,770
I promised you long ago, right?

332
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,150
But not now.

333
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,630
It's you, an evil bird.

334
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,650
I've heard a lot about you,

335
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,670
Zhu Yan.

336
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,760
After seeing you today,

337
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,250
I think you truly are as insufferable as the rumor says.

338
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,080
In order to control the malicious energy on him,

339
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,410
you must have used a lot of demonic power.

340
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,380
I have plenty of demonic power.

341
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,280
I know that.

342
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,030
But you can't restore it

343
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,110
within a short time,

344
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,910
can you?

345
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,150
I didn't expect

346
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,780
the famous evil demon

347
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,430
to hurt himself in order to save someone.

348
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,030
Zhu Yan,

349
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,220
I didn't know you have such a kind heart.

350
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,470
The person I want to save

351
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,420
is not just someone.

352
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,290
He's my good friend.

353
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,000
You consider him as your good friend.

354
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,360
But what does he consider you as?

355
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,710
Zhuo Yichen,

356
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,890
who is the man standing in front of you?

357
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,790
My sworn enemy.

358
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,930
What should you do when your enemy

359
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,760
is standing in front of you?

360
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,160
I should kill him.

361
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,480
Zhuo.

362
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,060
Zhuo.

363
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,180
What exactly do you want?

364
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,470
I want your inner core.

365
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,610
You have one.

366
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,060
Why do you want mine?

367
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,060
In this world,

368
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,810
only your inner core

369
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,660
can destroy the seal of the Baize Token.

370
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,520
I want to break the Baize seal on me

371
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,060
and regain freedom.

372
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,110
Seal?

373
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,410
Because of this damn seal,

374
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,470
I've been trapped in Lingxi Villa

375
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,670
and I can never go out.

376
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,180
Baize Goddess was so cruel.

377
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,350
Zhuo Yichen,

378
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,520
what are you waiting for?

379
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,740
Kill him!

380
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,380
Zhuo.

381
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,810
Zhuo!

382
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,800
Zhuo!

383
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,710
The malicious energy and demonic energy here are really strong.

384
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,340
They even blinded me.

385
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,560
I didn't realize there is a seal of the Baize Token.

386
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,150
You two were acting to trick me?

387
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,100
No.

388
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,660
I was not acting.

389
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,680
My fear was real.

390
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,440
Mr. Zhuo's Cloud Light Sword

391
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,780
is really scary.

392
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,980
I am scarier.

393
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,260
Do you want to try?

394
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,590
Okay.

395
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,830
When did you regain your consciousness?

396
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,200
Don't move.

397
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,370
I'm helping you.

398
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,200
I'm going to kill you.

399
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,390
I promised you long ago,

400
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,070
right?

401
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,420
But not now.

402
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,150
Let me kill...

403
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,410
You've regained your consciousness, right?

404
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,820
Why do you still look stupid?

405
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,130
You're the stupid one!

406
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,260
Don't you want to know Qing Geng's real purpose?

407
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,730
Do what you're good at.

408
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,070
Now?

409
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,350
I don't think it's a good time.

410
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,150
Acting.

411
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,640
I meant acting.

412
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,990
Oh.

413
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,690
Are you sure you are not taking this opportunity to settle personal grudges?

414
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,900
No!

415
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,470
Mr. Zhuo,

416
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,700
are you

417
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,310
ready?

418
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,210
Shut up!

419
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,840
What a pity.

420
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,360
Indeed, the seal of the Baize Token can be broken.

421
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,520
But it requires me to use the malicious energy

422
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,510
to cast the spell myself.

423
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,680
If I die,

424
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,610
it'll be useless even if you have my inner core.

425
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,790
The one who tricked you into taking my inner core

426
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,060
is either a fool or a liar.

427
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,160
You're a liar.

428
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,450
In this world,

429
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,720
no one believes in sincerity.

430
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,130
Hypocritical people always win.

431
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,830
Forget it.

432
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,930
I just want to know who tricked you

433
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,730
into taking my inner core.

434
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,850
I can guess it even if you don't tell me.

435
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,500
There is a loathsome and familiar smell

436
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,460
on you.

437
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,890
-Wen Xiao!
-Wen Xiao!

438
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,590
So hot.

439
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,690
Your hand...

440
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,160
It really hurts.

441
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,040
I meant that thing on your hand.

442
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,440
It's the plague.

443
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,930
Wen Xiao.

444
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:22,920
Zhuo!

445
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,270
Jiu,

446
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,510
stay away from me.

447
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,150
Yes.

448
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,990
Come.

449
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,590
Stay away from her.

450
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,270
I'm half-god and half-demon.

451
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,750
I have the bloodline of the God Race.

452
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,680
I should be fine.

453
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,230
Well,

454
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,100
I'm fine too.

455
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,240
That's strange.

456
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,780
No.

457
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,140
She's having a high fever.

458
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,640
We need to get out of here as soon as possible.

459
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,870
Otherwise, she'll be in danger.

460
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,510
Okay.

461
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,040
Even if I have to break my knife,

462
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,920
I'll dig a tunnel and crawl out.

463
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,590
Eh?

464
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,940
Fei?

465
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,620
Qing Geng?

466
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
What Qing Geng?

467
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,540
Isn't the one he was helping Qing Geng?

468
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,720
Are you sure?

469
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,590
Yes.

470
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,700
She looks exactly the same as the one on the mural.

471
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,290
Take care of Sister Pei here.

472
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:35,880
Hey.

473
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,680
Bai Jiu!

474
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,640
Hey.

475
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,900
Don't come near me!

476
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,540
I don't need you to save me

477
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,850
or help me.

478
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:22,990
Gosh!

479
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,950
You're hurt.

480
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,420
Let me do it.

481
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,470
I'm a doctor.

482
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,390
Why do you want to save me?

483
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,570
My master always said

484
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,000
doctors are benevolent.

485
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,220
We can't just let people die.

486
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,440
Doctors are benevolent.

487
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,690
If I tell you

488
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,700
I am the culprit who spread the plague,

489
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,449
will you still save me?

490
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,409
Actually, I've already guessed it.

491
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,350
You spread the plague

492
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,040
through those red bead bracelets, right?

493
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,000
That red bead...

494
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,960
was stained with Fei's blood.

495
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,520
Why did you do that?

496
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,280
Do you know I was

497
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:44,920
a goddess worshipped by everyone?

498
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,659
I've lived in this town

499
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,130
for a few hundred years.

500
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,070
People worshipped me

501
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,659
and prayed to me

502
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,429
that I could protect them

503
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,700
from the plague.

504
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,090
Their piety and faith

505
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,380
gave me strength.

506
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,000
So I blessed them

507
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,180
and protected them.

508
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,460
It was like

509
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,330
feeling guilty for receiving their gifts

510
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,750
and wanting

511
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,260
to give them something in return.

512
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,180
But one day,

513
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,000
Fei came here.

514
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,210
He is the origin of plague by nature.

515
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,600
I did everything I could,

516
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,790
but I still couldn't stop the calamity.

517
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,230
Please save us.

518
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,770
Many people died due to the plague.

519
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,130
The survivors vented their anger

520
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,440
and called me a liar

521
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
and a fake god.

522
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,510
They destroyed Lingxi Villa

523
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,990
and splashed dirty water

524
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,200
and filthy things

525
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,550
on my statue.

526
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,630
No one wanted to believe me

527
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,280
or worship me anymore.

528
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,930
Shortly afterwards,

529
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,310
Baize Goddess also came.

530
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,860
She realized Fei causes plague,

531
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,630
while Qing Geng can ward off plague.

532
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,780
I'm the natural enemy of Fei.

533
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,430
In order to suppress Fei's plague miasma,

534
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,540
Baize Goddess

535
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,020
[Lingxi Villa]

536
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,670
sealed us

537
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,830
in Lingxi Villa.

538
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,360
I've been sealed here

539
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,690
for a few hundred years.

540
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,950
I can't

541
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,750
see the end of it.

542
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,810
You are a mortal

543
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,580
and a young boy.

544
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,270
Your life is short.

545
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,180
You can't understand this kind

546
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,690
of endless suffering.

547
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,290
Someone told me

548
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,710
as long as I spread the plague

549
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,020
to lure you here,

550
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,850
kill Zhao Yuanzhou,

551
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,720
and get his inner core,

552
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,870
I could break the Baize seal

553
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,570
and leave here.

554
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,380
Brother Zhuo.

555
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,530
I know the person you just mentioned.

556
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,870
His name is Li Lun.

557
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,320
Right?

558
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,710
Qing Geng,

559
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,290
you spread the plague

560
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,260
to harm the mortal world.

561
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,860
Do you confess to the crime?

562
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,920
It was not her fault.

563
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,200
It was all my fault.

564
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,660
Because of me,

565
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,610
she was sentenced to life imprisonment here.

566
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,190
So you can speak?

567
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,450
If I were her,

568
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,350
I would also resent fate for being unfair.

569
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,580
I have a way to treat the plague.

570
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,750
As long as you help me save her,

571
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,500
I'll help you save everyone.

572
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,770
Really?

573
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,300
But she's badly injured.

574
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,950
I'm afraid even deities can't save her.

575
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,750
If we were somewhere else,

576
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,650
I'm afraid she couldn't be saved.

577
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,730
But here,

578
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,000
maybe I can give it a try.

579
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,190
You have a way?

580
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,500
Because of the plague,

581
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,880
Sinan Water Town is surrounded by malicious energy.

582
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,010
The stronger the malicious energy is,

583
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,230
the greater my demonic power is.

584
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,540
I can try to use the malicious energy here

585
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,170
to treat her.

586
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,280
Thank you...

587
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,450
for saving her.

588
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,900
She is very important to you?

589
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,870
Yes.

590
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,320
Very important.

591
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,990
I've been cursed by fate since I was born.

592
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,580
Wherever I go,

593
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,410
[Glorious Flowers in Spring and Solid Fruits in Autumn]

594
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,100
plague arises.

595
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,350
Both humans

596
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,810
and demons

597
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,040
consider me the source of calamity,

598
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,150
fearing

599
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,310
me.

600
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,600
But she's different.

601
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,740
She could have been

602
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,330
a Qing Geng bird

603
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,300
flying freely in the clear sky.

604
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,600
I yearned to go to the mortal world

605
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,960
and didn't want to be sealed in the barren Wilderness.

606
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,560
So

607
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,650
I escaped from the Wilderness secretly.

608
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,320
The mortal world is prosperous and bustling.

609
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,450
Grass, trees,

610
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,590
flowers, and leaves

611
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,110
are full of vitality.

612
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,020
Only in the mortal world

613
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,040
do I truly feel alive.
