1
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:06,000
Izu?

2
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:06,800
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:10,200
- The location for the final episode's
outdoor shoot - Hey! That's really nice.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,476
It seems like the director has a shot he
absolutely wants to capture, no matter what.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Director...

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
It's been a long time since
I've done a night shoot.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Here you go.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,500
By the way, can I ask?

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,300
- Will Miss Tendou be filming?
- No, this scene is just for me.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,299
- It's just Akafuji-kun's scene...
- That's right.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,700
He said he wants to see my limits,
so even Yukari-chan won't be on set.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,800
What kind of person is Director Wakaba?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,840
What kind of person is he?

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,300
He's incredibly talented,
but also really eccentric.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,256
Oh, really.

16
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:02,900
I've never seen a director like that before.
He's truly one of a kind.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,200
I hope I can keep working with him.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,700
Oh no, I shouldn't have
asked in the first place.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hajime-san.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,700
Ah! It's nothing.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
So that's how it is.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,985
Good luck with the shoot!

23
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,700
Alright, thank you.

24
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:42,017
- Good morning, sorry to trouble you.
- Good morning, looking forward to it.

25
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,300
Hajime-chan...

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Hajime-chan.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Mr. Haibara, great job out there.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,700
What's wrong? Is something up?

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,499
No... it's nothing.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,900
Yeah, right. Of course there is!

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,680
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
hiding in such a corner, would you?

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,480
It's Akafuji-kun, isn't it?

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Huh?

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,700
So it really is about him.

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,029
What did that guy do?

36
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:29,200
That bastard! I swear
on my entire acting career!

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,000
Pull out all the buds of his talent!

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,499
Pull out all the buds of his talent!!

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,200
That's not it!

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,000
It's just that I simply feel
uneasy and a bit down, that's all!

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I see.

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
I see.

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,500
You feel like he's closer to Director Yamabuki than
he is to you, so it's been bothering you, right?

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,241
Hajime-chan, you really
like Akafuji, don't you?

45
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:10,800
Huh? No, that's not it! There's
nothing going on between us...

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,766
I feel so much better
after saying it out loud.

47
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,283
Thank you for listening
to me, Mr. Haibara.

48
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:24,000
Hajime-chan, wait!

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,000
I just came up with a great idea.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,000
Because I'm Hajime-chan's
big brother, after all!

51
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,532
Good idea?

52
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,633
Yeah, leave it to me. Don't worry.

53
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,000
After all!

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm Hajime-chan's older brother, after all.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,299
Director! The actors are all ready.

56
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,180
Really?

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,500
Please wait a moment.

58
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,500
I Became the Main Role of a
BL Drama Season 2 (Episode 5)

59
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,700
Yuichiro! That was amazing!

60
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,099
That was absolutely amazing!

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,047
- Amazing! Yuichiro.
- Thank you so much.

62
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,700
Absolutely perfect!

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,599
Hajime-san?!

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
What's wrong, Yuichiro?

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
It's nothing, don't worry about it!

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,266
- Perfect, absolutely no problem.
- Really, thank you so much!

67
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,400
Sorry, could you please
help check the screen?

68
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,100
That should be impossible!

69
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
This is a real headache.

70
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,100
I never expected it would happen in Izu.

71
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Saw a vision of Hajime-san.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,500
That was close.

73
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,800
I almost got caught.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
How should I put it?

75
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,200
That director.

76
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,600
That's the guy who's "the
closest man to Cannes"!

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,800
Awesome! Yuichiro!

78
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Mr. Haibara.

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you so much.

80
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,200
I'm fine now.

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,417
Because I was curious about their
relationship, I ended up running to the set...

82
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,500
And I even followed
them all the way to Izu.

83
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,000
I feel completely off.

84
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,500
Then... let's go sightseeing!

85
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,600
I really want to try
orange-flavored ice cream!

86
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,300
Thank you for waiting.

87
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,499
This is orange ice cream.

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,685
Thank you.

89
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,300
Wow! That looks delicious!

90
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,900
- Here you go, Hajime-chan.
- Thank you.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm going to dig in!

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
This is so delicious!

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,077
Hajime-chan, do you want to try
putting some ice cream on your nose?

94
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:20,800
Huh, on my nose?

95
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,622
Mr. Haibara, you're about to fall!

96
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:25,622
Thank you.

97
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:29,100
No way, they look nothing alike.
That can't be the real person!

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,360
- Thank you, everyone. Great job out there.
- You did great.

99
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:43,975
(Saw Haibara Ryunosuke and Aoyagi Hajime together in Izu)

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,999
((Doesn't look like they're filming. Is this
a private meetup?)) (Tell me this isn't true!)

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,599
(Spotted Aoyagi Hajime and
Haibara Ryunosuke shopping in Izu)

102
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,599
(I'm taking the afternoon off
and heading straight to Izu!)

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,399
(Aoyagi Hajime and Haibara
Ryunosuke are in Izu.)

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Hajime-san...

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
With Mr. Haibara...

106
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Why?

107
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,000
Time passes by leisurely.

108
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,410
It's really warm, and it feels amazing.

109
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,330
Maybe it's because of this kid
that weekends feel so wonderful.

110
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,700
This is just way too obvious.
They're totally showing off their relationship!

111
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,199
I remember there's a place
that sells this ice cream...

112
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
So, how is it? How does
your favorite lasagna taste?

113
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, not bad.

114
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,700
What's wrong? Did you bite your tongue?

115
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,740
Just now, I suddenly felt a strong chill.

116
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,620
Damn it, the shoot's been over for
ages, but he still won't pick up the phone.

117
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Ah! Haibara is in Izu too!

118
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Looks like you're having a great time.

119
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,520
10 seconds.

120
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,600
Alright, I'm starting now.

121
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
Start, 9! The countdown has begun.

122
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,080
- Hajime-chan, come here.
- Okay.

123
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,500
6 5 4 3

124
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,300
Alright, I think I got the shot.

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
Feels pretty good.

126
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,500
I want to take a selfie and
upload it to social media.

127
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Let me take a picture of Hajime-chan too.

128
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Got it!

129
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,360
Mr. Haibara?

130
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,200
- Hajime-chan, let's go over there.
- Sure!

131
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,600
- Wow, that's amazing! So beautiful!
- Too close!

132
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,050
Do you want to eat something?

133
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,150
That's way too close!

134
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,500
No matter how you look at it, that's
definitely not the distance between brothers!

135
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Mr. Haibara said.

136
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,100
I just want to be
Hajime-san's older brother.

137
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
This really is a trick!!

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,500
I had such a great time today, Hajime-chan!

139
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
What's that sound?

140
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm so happy I got to go on a
date with Hajime-chan today.

141
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,600
Huh? What's that sound?

142
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Let's head to the hotel
next and really relax!

143
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Really relax at the hotel?!

144
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,800
Inn, overnight stay,
yukata, open-air hot spring.

145
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,581
Later tonight, let's have a little drink...

146
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,500
Is this...

147
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
An affair?

148
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,200
No... Hajime-san would
never do something like that.

149
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,900
Could it be that they found out I have
zero experience when it comes to love?!

150
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,500
That's why Hajime-san was drawn
to Mr. Haibara's mature charm...

151
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,900
What should I do...?

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yuichiro.

153
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Director!

154
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
I've been watching your every move.

155
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,700
If possible, would you
like to talk with me?

156
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,500
Actually...

157
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I see.

158
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,200
The source of your fiery passion for acting.
Is it Aoyagi Hajime?

159
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,200
Yes, that's right.

160
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,700
It's what drives my acting, and it's
also the strength that keeps me going.

161
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
What a beautiful relationship.

162
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
But...

163
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,600
This might all be coming to an end.

164
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,800
Hajime-san and Mr. Haibara
are going to the inn together.

165
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:29,292
What am I supposed to do...?

166
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,945
No worries, Yuichiro!

167
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:35,100
Of course there's a problem!

168
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,810
From the word association game: “inn,” “overnight
stay,” “yukata,” “open-air hot spring.”

169
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:43,100
And then, at night,
it's time for a little drink!

170
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,170
Alright, just leave it to me.

171
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,600
Let's go.

172
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Haibara.

173
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What's wrong?

174
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,348
I dragged Mr. Haibara into this too.
What am I even doing!

175
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:08,000
I didn't get dragged into this, I volunteered myself.

176
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,700
Akafuji-kun is just doing
his job. I shouldn't be jealous.

177
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Lately, even when he has intimate scenes with
actresses, I can't help but feel uneasy...

178
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't help but feel...
am I becoming weird?

179
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,000
And you even followed us all
the way to the on-location shoot.

180
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,100
I really don't want
Akafuji-kun to see me like this.

181
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,800
Hajime-chan

182
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,700
(1 hour ago)

183
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,500
The hotel where Mr. Haibara is staying.
We actually used it before during a previous shoot.

184
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,100
Letting you sneak in is a piece of cake.

185
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Sneak in?

186
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Sorry to bother you.

187
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,899
Ah, long time no see!

188
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,700
I'm Wakaba Yamabuki, the director.

189
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,999
- This is...
- Nice to meet you, I'm Akafuji Yuichiro.

190
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Nice to meet you. Looking
forward to working with you.
Sorry for the trouble.

191
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:12,600
- I'm ready.
- Please come in.

192
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
That's Yuichiro for you.

193
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,300
The costume looks perfect!

194
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,800
Thank you.

195
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Not at all.

196
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,200
No matter which version of Hajime-chan
it is, they're all adorable to me.

197
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,500
Mr. Haibara.

198
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,200
Hajime-chan~

199
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm a little tired.

200
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,586
Let's go back to our room.

201
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,500
Alright... Are you okay?

202
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
I can't walk on my own anymore~~

203
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,099
Hajime-chan, help me walk~~

204
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,078
- Okay.
- Thank you.

205
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,099
No problem.

206
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,524
Is the room that way?

207
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:33,300
It should be this way, right?

208
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,800
Ah! Haibara! Not there!!

209
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,458
It's all good!

210
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,100
Wait for me a second.

211
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
Sorry about that!!!

212
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,600
A... Akafuji-kun!

213
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
(Final Episode)

214
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,400
We're dating now, right?

215
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,599
Wait for me, Hajime-chan!

216
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,499
Yuichiro is now experiencing
a failure called "love."

217
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,624
I want to go on a date!

218
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,738
There's something I need
to tell you, Hajime-san.

219
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:47,178
We've been together for a while now.
Do you think there's a chance for our relationship to go further?
