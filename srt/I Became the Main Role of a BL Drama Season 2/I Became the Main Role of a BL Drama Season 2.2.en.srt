1
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Should we... maybe move on to...
the next step after kissing?

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Hajime

3
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,120
I've been waiting for you to say that.

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
Mr. Akafuji.

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Sorry for being rude.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
No way, no way, no way, no way!!

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,300
No matter how much I try to imagine
it, I just can't move on to the next step!

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
First of all, my past experiences
with love are actually...

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
What is this?

10
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,499
(My Little Sister is a Magical Girl)

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Sorry.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,732
I really can't accept
this kind of interest.

13
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,800
Let's break up.

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,500
That's the only thing left.

15
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,796
But, Hajime...

16
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,500
I'm actually not very
good at kissing scenes.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
My ex-girlfriend also
said I was really clumsy.

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,471
Ex-girlfriend.

19
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:53,000
So you've had a girlfriend before.

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,743
Actually, Hajime, do you think I
have a lot of experience in love?

21
00:01:59,543 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm really not good at
acting in kissing scenes.

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,200
So I want to practice.

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,440
Is it okay to say it like this?

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,076
What am I really...

25
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:18,400
What should I do?

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Please get ready quickly.

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Alright.

28
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,010
Should I just be honest and
say it directly instead of hiding it?

29
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,300
I want to get closer to Akafuji.

30
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:45,608
When I was with someone
else before, I never felt this way.

31
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,008
Sorry to interrupt, Hajime.
About this month's schedule...

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,300
"I Became the Main Role of a BL Drama" Season 2
(Episode 2)

33
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:49,006
What? Are you scared to face Hajime just
because you don't have any experience with love?

34
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:51,300
It's not that I haven't,
it's just very rare.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,300
If you keep hesitating like this,
Haibara's going to steal him away from you.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,792
He's been sticking close to
Hajime on set the whole time,

37
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:06,000
so I haven't had any
chance to talk to him at all.

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
I want to talk to Hajime too.

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,009
Alright, I've made up my mind.

40
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,900
Kuromiya, starting today, I'm
appointing you as the monitor.

41
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,422
Report to me immediately about everything
Mr. Haibara does around Hajime on set!

42
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:22,722
No way!

43
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,115
- Why?
- I don't want to get involved in this mess!

44
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,400
Is that okay, Kuromiya?

45
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,390
If you don't cooperate, the
next time we're on set together,

46
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:41,016
even if you're alone with
a girl, I won't help you out.

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,900
You're so sneaky!

48
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Well then...

49
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:51,408
What's your decision?

50
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:52,900
Ugh! Seriously.

51
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,733
You're really annoying.

52
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,900
Kuromiya, I'm counting on you.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
You're really good at making dumplings!

54
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Is that so?

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Akafuji, you're really amazing.

56
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
I really need to ask
Mr. Haibara about this.

57
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,600
I need to say what I'm thinking.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I really want to ask.

59
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I really want to say it.

60
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,900
I just can't bring myself to ask!

61
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
I just can't get the words out!

62
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,900
No matter what, I've got to find
a way to start a conversation.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,881
Speaking of which, you and
Kuromiya are on the same set, right?

64
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:03,981
Yeah.

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
But I haven't had any
chance to talk at all.

66
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Why is it like this?

67
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,900
Great! Let's steer the
conversation over to Mr. Haibara.

68
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Hold on a sec, this is something
Kuromiya gave me a while ago.

69
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,781
Akafuji, have you seen Ryoga lately?

70
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,800
Yeah, we often go to the sauna together.

71
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
I see.

72
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Closer than I am.

73
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,700
Ryoga gets along better with you, right?

74
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,200
A sauna really does make you
feel refreshed and clear-headed.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,100
It helps clear your mind, and
memorizing lines goes a lot smoother too.

76
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,300
Oh, I see.

77
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,600
As expected, Mr. Akafuji
is really impressive.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,012
What?

79
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:59,462
You went to the sauna for work, right?

80
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:03,500
Uh... yeah.

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,120
The conversation seems to
be heading in a weird direction.

82
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:10,284
But you always manage to
take good care of yourself.

83
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,000
I really admire you for that.

84
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,000
That's not true at all.

85
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,000
I... I'm really not someone
worthy of your respect.

86
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,276
Even with such a busy schedule, you still manage
to do all this. That's honestly impressive.

87
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,200
Thank you.

88
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,704
Whenever I get the chance,
I just want you to think I'm cool.

89
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:36,338
And I even pretend like I
have a lot of experience in love.

90
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm just that kind of lousy person.

91
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
This is it.

92
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,500
This dumpling is as huge as my worries.

93
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,180
Wow.

94
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
So big.

95
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Mr. Akafuji...

96
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,500
Miss Tendou, you've worked hard.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,906
You're still the same as ever.

98
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:17,907
Did something happen?

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,945
The script for the final episode
was honestly heartbreaking to read.

100
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:23,819
Especially this scene.

101
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:28,000
The pain of not being able to show your
true self in front of the one you love.

102
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,100
It really makes me feel awful.

103
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,500
Ah! It really does make you feel upset.

104
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,099
- Hey!
- What's up?

105
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,722
Wait a second.

106
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:39,722
Please wait a moment.

107
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,940
Is the chance for a
comeback really that slim?

108
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,493
But honestly, why is it so hard to just
be straightforward about how you feel?

109
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,798
That's because I don't want
to let the other person down.

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,599
But you know, if it's someone you love,
even their flaws seem adorable, don't they?

111
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Don't you think so?

112
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,299
-Don't you think so too, Mr. Akafuji?

113
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,900
No matter what, just being
alive is already adorable.

114
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,293
See? I told you so.

115
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:05,900
The other person feels the same way.

116
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,200
Actually, if you don't show your
true self, it might feel even lonelier.

117
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,900
That's true, I can't argue with that.

118
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Don't run.

119
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Captain!

120
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Captain!

121
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Don't worry about me, go after him!

122
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Let's go!

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,443
They'll definitely add CG to this, right?

124
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, no problem.

125
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,623
OK

126
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,546
OK

127
00:10:03,546 --> 00:10:04,469
OK

128
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,699
No problem.

129
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,342
Then let's use a higher
trajectory to send it back.

130
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,857
Hajime, please help me up.

131
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:17,629
Thank you.

132
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,529
Here, have a bite.

133
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:25,300
Ah, thank you.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to dig in.

135
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,500
This tastes amazing!

136
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,000
You've got some cream on your lips.

137
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,264
Really?

138
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Over here, too.

139
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Thank you.

140
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,550
Time to start shooting a lot!

141
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:53,500
Alright, I'll leave it to you two.

142
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,025
Oh, not bad!

143
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:55,546
Not bad, not bad.

144
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:56,483
Yeah, that's exactly the feeling.

145
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:57,483
But still,

146
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,925
It's totally fine to go a bit
harder, no problem at all.

147
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,899
Just let that person come alone.

148
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,880
Yeah, that's right, exactly.

149
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:04,000
Ah, not bad, not bad.

150
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,940
Are you kidding me?!

151
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,180
Alright, cut! OK!

152
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,500
That's the exact expression.

153
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,800
Huh?

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,900
What just happened?

155
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:23,376
We probably haven't started filming yet.

156
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,799
Wasn't that the official take?

157
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,276
We haven't officially started filming yet.

158
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,649
It doesn't even count as a rehearsal.

159
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,699
Not even a test shoot?

160
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,857
No problem, Director.

161
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,417
I can perform that kind of
scene as many times as you want!

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,900
Amazing! Yuichiro.

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Alright! Let's start shooting!

164
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,681
We'll resume filming at 2:30
PM. Thank you for your help!

165
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,709
The best actor, Akafuji Yuichiro.

166
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:59,042
I'll never let him go.

167
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,200
Let's do something big together!

168
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,800
Director Yamabuki is a rising
star who's getting a lot of attention.

169
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I remember, he was called "the man closest
to the Cannes Film Festival," right?

170
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
So close!

171
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Hi.

172
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,200
Mr. Ryoga.

173
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,058
Feels like it's been a while
since we last saw each other.

174
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,000
Isn't it because you've only been
talking to Mr. Huaiyuan lately?

175
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:34,524
Huh? Really?

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
Lift me up! Lift me up!

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Here, have a bite.

178
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Ah, thank you.

179
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,793
This is so good!

180
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:47,393
You've got some cream on your lips.

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,409
Not there.

182
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,409
It's over here.

183
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Thank you.

184
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You're right.

185
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
I only remember chatting with Mr. Huaiyuan.

186
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Honestly.

187
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,140
What's the relationship
between Haibara and Hajime?

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,240
What's their relationship?

189
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:13,200
If all you did was act together as kids,
isn't your relationship a little too close?

190
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,195
Haibara has always been
like this, even back then.

191
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:21,728
He probably still sees me
as that child star I used to be.

192
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:24,784
You might be the only one
who thinks that, you know.

193
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:25,260
What?

194
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:27,992
By the way, how are things
going between you and Yuichiro?

195
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,389
Are you getting along well?

196
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,045
Ah, wait a second.

197
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,700
Yeah, what's up?

198
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,014
Hmm... how should I put this?

199
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:39,000
Could it be.

200
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,349
He's really annoying.

201
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,100
- Huh?
- So gross.

202
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,533
So annoying.

203
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,799
- Ah! No, that's not it...
- It's all good.

204
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,229
I understand how Hajime feels.

205
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,939
That guy is really clingy.

206
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,940
No, that's not it!

207
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,100
Ah! Sorry about that.

208
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,725
I wasn't thinking that at all!

209
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,700
So what's really going on with you?

210
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
I just...

211
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,200
I want to get to know Mr. Akafuji better.

212
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,860
I guess... I just want
to get closer to him.

213
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
But.

214
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Am I the only one thinking this way?

215
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Lately, I've been feeling a bit uneasy.

216
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,935
Ah! What am I even saying!

217
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:25,100
Sorry, just forget
everything I said earlier.

218
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,100
Um, Hajime.

219
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,672
- Let's go somewhere nice later.
- Somewhere nice?

220
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, let's go!

221
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,170
Ah, no way!

222
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,699
- We still have scenes to shoot, right?
- Wait! Hold on!

223
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,200
Let's go after we're done.

224
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Haibara.

225
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
You look full of energy.

226
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,400
Izuru.

227
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,174
The sauna really is amazing.

228
00:15:36,374 --> 00:15:39,100
My restless mood instantly calmed down.

229
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,300
Kuromiya, you're late!

230
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Ah! Akafuji, great job out there.

231
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,980
- Hajime???
- We just finished up at the same time, so I invited him to come along.

232
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Actually, I've always
wanted to try out a sauna too.

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,160
It's finally time to face it.

234
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Hajime's...

235
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,215
- 3.141592
- Mr. Akafuji?

236
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:18,339
Hey! Shuuichiro?

237
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:22,046
- 57288491492
- Are you okay?

238
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,822
Pull yourself together!

239
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,900
5820974944

240
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
- No, no, no.- Great-grandmother!

241
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:41,124
No way, get back!
You can't come over here.

242
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,055
- No, no, you can't come over here.
- What?

243
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:49,658
No way.

244
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:50,700
No way.

245
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,059
Hey! Akafuji!

246
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,300
Hey, are you okay?

247
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,139
- Hang in there!
- Akafuji, you're going to be fine!

248
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,860
I'm fine.

249
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,300
Mr. Akafuji!

250
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,900
Are you okay?

251
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Hajime.

252
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,200
Ah! Don't move so suddenly!

253
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Huh...

254
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:38,000
I can't believe I'm lying on Hajime's lap.

255
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,652
Mr. Akafuji!

256
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
You suddenly collapsed.

257
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,100
I can't exactly say I crossed
over to the other side of pi!

258
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,470
You went in before us, so
you probably got overheated.

259
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,800
Get some good rest.

260
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,004
But... doesn't your leg hurt?

261
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:02,504
It's all right.

262
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
Then... I'll just lie down
for another ten minutes.

263
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,500
Is this okay?

264
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Yeah.

265
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Of course.

266
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,800
Thank you.

267
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,400
This is just like...

268
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Aoyagi Hajime-style wireless charging.

269
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Unforgivable!

270
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,900
Oh no! I tore Hajime's face!

271
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,599
(Next Episode)
I like Hajime even more than you do!

272
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
I love Hajime more than anyone else!

273
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,067
Mr. Haibara really cares about Hajime!

274
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,300
He always said he wanted to be my brother.

275
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,876
(The one who loves Aoyagi
Hajime even more is...)

276
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,050
Can you meet all of Hajime's needs?

277
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,400
I have to protect Hajime.
