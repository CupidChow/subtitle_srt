1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,750
Ah~ Haibara-san! Not there!

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,130
It's okay.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,520
Leave it to me.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,540
- There!
- I'm going to put it in now!

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,540
Sorry about that!

6
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,790
Akafuji?

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,370
Oh no...

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,410
Huh...
Hmm...

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,850
That's right.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,240
Um...

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,940
Hajime-san.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,880
What a coincidence running into you in Izu!

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,060
Akafuji... Could it be that he found out about everything?

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,270
Hajime-san?

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,350
Seriously.

16
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,600
So embarrassing.

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,180
So embarrassing.

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,570
So embarrassing! So embarrassing! So embarrassing!

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,570
This is so embarrassing.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,560
So embarrassing! So embarrassing! So embarrassing!

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Hajime-san~

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Hajime-san!

23
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,220
Please wait for me!

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,560
Hajime-san.

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,570
Wait a second.

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,260
Please wait!

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,280
Hajime-san.

28
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,840
Please wait!

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,310
Wait for me!

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,050
Wait for me!

31
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,570
Hajime-san!

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,490
Akafuji!

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,830
Are you okay?

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,690
I'm fine.

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,450
Feels like the situation is the opposite of last time!

36
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,520
Akafuji-kun, wait for me!

37
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,980
Hajime-san.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,990
Are you okay?

39
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,820
Yeah.

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,930
Ah, um... this outfit is for the shoot—it's a costume.

41
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,080
Uh...

42
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,420
I wandered around during breaks in filming.

43
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,540
And I thought I heard Hajime-san's voice.

44
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,500
When I opened the door and saw you were actually inside, it really startled me.

45
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,640
That's pretty much it...

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,030
Me too.

47
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,550
I heard Akafuji is on location in Izu.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,870
I thought this is really great.

49
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,980
And I just couldn't help but come over.

50
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,320
I see.

51
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,420
Hold on a sec.
Sorry.

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,200
(Yukari-chan calling)

53
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,700
Do you know how many times I've called you?

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,580
Ah!

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,950
Uh...

56
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,160
If you don't let me know when the shoot is over, it's going to be a real problem for me.

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,680
Sorry.

58
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,920
Please be mindful from now on.

59
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,830
Yes.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,210
About tomorrow's shoot,

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,270
it looks like the schedule was changed at the last minute.

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,890
It turned out to be a 1-day break.

63
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,690
Is it a day off?

64
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,570
It's director Yamaguchi.

65
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,320
I've already heard most of it over the phone.

66
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,740
Oh, right!

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,870
That's exactly how Yuichiro is right now.

68
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,810
Now's the time to add some fuel called “love” to the fire.

69
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,290
So that the fire in his heart doesn't burn out.

70
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,560
And it's also my responsibility to make these feelings even greater.

71
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,840
Right now, I...

72
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,370
I think this is what I can do as a director.

73
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,480
Director...

74
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,990
So.

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,590
Please have a great time, but don't go overboard.

76
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,490
Got it.

77
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,710
Hajime-san.

78
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,280
I have a day off tomorrow.

79
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,760
Huh?

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Today's shoot is already over.

81
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,260
We can really relax for a bit.

82
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,680
Then... I want to go on a date.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,800
Date?

84
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,350
Of course, no problem.

85
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,750
Since we finally made it to Izu...

86
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,220
Because we came here.

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
The ocean~

88
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,800
The ocean~

89
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,800
But...

90
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,140
For some reason, we ended up at a beach that feels like a crime scene.

91
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,780
No!

92
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,910
Focus on the date!

93
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,310
It's already really late today,

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,640
but if we have the day off tomorrow, I really want to go scuba diving or do something like that.

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,380
Huh?

96
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,040
That's a little...

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,430
People might see us.

98
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,710
I see.

99
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,140
If we go scuba diving.

100
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,380
The staff might recognize us.

101
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,240
Akafuji is really professional, so that's probably why he's concerned so much.

102
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,030
Yeah.

103
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,460
I just have this feeling that

104
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,660
this kind of situation...

105
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,760
It feels like the sound of the waves is urging me to dig for the truth!

106
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,560
Hajime-san~.

107
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,580
Why did you...

108
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,420
Why did you come to Izu with Haibara-san?

109
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,330
What is this?

110
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,010
The sound of the waves feels like it's demanding a confession from me.

111
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,560
Actually,

112
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,680
I came all the way to Izu because I'm concerned about Akafuji and Director Yamabuki~.

113
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,060
It Haibara-san.

114
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,340
Got a last-minute work assignment.

115
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,410
You can use the room however you like.

116
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,870
By Hajime-chan's official big brother.

117
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,630
Good luck with work, thank you!

118
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,160
I've become Hajime-chan's official big brother!

119
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,020
It's getting dark.

120
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,610
Yeah.

121
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,520
Do you want to go back to the hotel?

122
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,960
Sure.

123
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,210
For today's bed setup,

124
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,850
Hajime-chan's official big brother will take care of it.

125
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,090
Haibara.

126
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,790
Um...

127
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,340
Did we forget to lay out the comforter?

128
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,030
I'll go get another one.

129
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,950
Hajime-san...

130
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,030
We're dating, right?

131
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,560
I've always felt uneasy.

132
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,280
Uneasy?

133
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,250
Why do you think that?

134
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,100
Akafuji, you're really popular.

135
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,860
You're the next breakout star.

136
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm just not sure if you'd really be happy…

137
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,600
being with someone like me.

138
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,590
That's not true at all.

139
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,960
We've been together for so long.

140
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,020
But our relationship hasn't changed at all.

141
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,480
Am I the only one who wants to take things further...?

142
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,850
The reason I came to Izu... is because I'm concerned about what's going on between you and Director Yamabuki.

143
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,870
Huh?

144
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,230
It's not just Director Yamabuki.

145
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,840
Lately, even when you have intimate scenes with actresses,

146
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,670
it always makes me feel really uneasy inside.

147
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,040
Even though I know it's all just work.

148
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,170
I'm letting my personal feelings get way too mixed up with work!

149
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,890
I really hate this side of myself.

150
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,640
Hajime-san.

151
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,640
What you just said...

152
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,520
I was really, really happy to hear that.

153
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:31,450
I also have... something I need to tell Hajime-san.

154
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,680
Actually, I...

155
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,460
I can't swim.

156
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,280
Huh?

157
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,160
So.

158
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,100
About scuba diving...

159
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,030
that's why I reacted so awkwardly.

160
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm a... total landlubber who stands out no matter what.

161
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,260
And what I've been hiding...

162
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,390
is more than that.

163
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,350
I don't have much experience with relationships.

164
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,820
Way less than Hajime-san.

165
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,200
And I get super jealous, too.

166
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm very concerned about Hajime-san's ex-girlfriend.

167
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,480
To be honest, I've always been concerned about Haibara-san too.

168
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,850
The reason I wore staff uniforms

169
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,800
was also to sneak into the inn and investigate the relationship between you two.

170
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,300
Huh?

171
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,100
So that's how it is.

172
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,910
And with Kuromiya too!

173
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,060
You've always called me by my full name.

174
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,530
But you called Kuromiya by his first name, "Ryoga"!

175
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:19,710
Hajime-san is always saying things like I'm "amazing" and stuff.

176
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:28,750
But honestly, I'm really lame and have a lot of flaws.

177
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,790
The only thing I can be proud of

178
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,210
is that I'm a bigger fan of Aoyanagi Hajime than anyone else.

179
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,570
Yuichiro.

180
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,790
Thank you.

181
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,590
All of this right now makes me really, really happy.

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,090
Hajime-san.

183
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,930
I'm really glad I got to meet Yuichiro.

184
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,440
This is such a headache.

185
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,200
I can't imagine my life without Yuichiro anymore.

186
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,310
Wow!

187
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,210
This one is so cute.

188
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,850
Then let's get a matching set.

189
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,780
Here you go, Hajime-san.

190
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Thank you.

191
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,460
Actually...

192
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,260
I have something I want to give you, too.

193
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,560
Welcome back.

194
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,430
I'm back.

195
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,000
That's great.

196
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,030
My heart's still beating.

197
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,570
Huh?

198
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,030
Still not used to it?

199
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,930
I think so...

200
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm afraid... I'll never get used to this sight, not even until the day I die!

201
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,680
Your smile is just too charming.

202
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,600
All my fatigue just disappeared in an instant.

203
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,450
Really?

204
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,350
That's great.

205
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,430
I'm way too sleepy—it feels like I'm fighting a demon king or something.

206
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,390
Here's a smile for you.

207
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
(I Fell in Love with My Childhood Friend Season 2)
(TV Drama Project Proposal)

208
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,370
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

209
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,690
The sequel is officially confirmed.

210
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,420
Our wild fantasies actually reached the heavens!

211
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,170
This is awesome, I'm so happy!

212
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,020
Thank you, everyone.

213
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,030
I'll do my best.

214
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,830
The sequel will be even better, and there will be new members joining too!

215
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,500
New member...

216
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,020
Sounds really interesting!

217
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,750
For the role of Shirasaki, who stirs up their relationship,

218
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,830
we asked Haibara Ryunosuke for help.

219
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,870
Is it Haibara san?

220
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,470
As fro Momoshiro and Mizutani...

221
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,210
is their relationship finally coming to an end?

222
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,430
Will they start down the path of a more mature love?

223
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,680
Just when the audience was thinking that, Shirasaki showed up.

224
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,840
I get the feeling those two are totally fine now!

225
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,310
Akafuji has calmed down.

226
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,300
As their manager, I feel relieved too.

227
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,070
I want to settle down too~

228
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,950
No way!
I really want to!

229
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,020
No way!

230
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,660
I make lasagna for you every day, you know.

231
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,250
If it's twice a week...

232
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,040
Kuromiya san is coming in.

233
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,340
Good morning.

234
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,900
Haibara-san is coming in.

235
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,990
Sorry for the trouble.

236
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,060
Good morning.

237
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,660
Good morning, everyone.

238
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,250
Huh?

239
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,430
Please.

240
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,810
Thank you.

241
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,110
Thank you.

242
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,450
Thank you.

243
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,640
Hello, Tendou-san.

244
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,960
Hello, Haibara-san. Nice to meet you for the first time.

245
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,470
Nice to meet you.

246
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,620
You're Hajime-chan's older sister, right?

247
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,550
I'm the older brother.

248
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,750
- Please have a seat.
- Ah! Thank you.

249
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,050
Kuromiya.

250
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

251
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,600
I've always felt your eyes on me, you know.

252
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,140
Alright, I'll be your big brother too.

253
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,570
N-no... that's not it.

254
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,990
Um...

255
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,890
It's more than enough that you have the heart fro it.

256
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,010
Huh?

257
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,580
Thanks!

258
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,490
What's wrong?

259
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,760
Don't be shy!

260
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,320
I really... thank you from the bottom of my heart.

261
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,860
No need...

262
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:42,840
Sorry.

263
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,230
I'm counting on both of you.

264
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,380
Alright, shining bright.

265
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,210
Let's go.

266
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,930
Are there still any parts that need to be fixed?

267
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,540
Alright, let's start this scene from the top.

268
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,800
Thanks for your help.

269
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,580
Then please start the camera.

270
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,650
We're about to shoot scene 4.

271
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,280
Alright, we're rolling.

272
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,270
Let's do this for real.

273
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,780
Ready.

274
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,550
Action.
