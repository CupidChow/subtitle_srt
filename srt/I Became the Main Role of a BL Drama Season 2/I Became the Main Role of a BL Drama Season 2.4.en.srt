1
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,206
I'm thinking of having Hajime-chan
play the role of a doctor next time.

2
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:30,247
The idea of a doctor
sounds pretty good.

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,475
It might feel a little unreliable, but I think a
strong sense of justice will shine through.

4
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:35,923
Yeah, plus the character's
ranking is pretty good too.

5
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:39,620
I hope he can use this opportunity
to become a more professional actor.

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,854
Thanks to you being my manager,
Yuzuru-chan, it's really amazing!

7
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:44,422
Thank you for listening to me.

8
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:45,943
Same here, I really appreciate it too.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,800
Yukari-chan.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,600
Were you just chatting with Mr. Haibara?

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Huh?

12
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:59,000
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What's up?

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Jealous?

14
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,010
Are you jealous or something?!

15
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:03,800
Of course not.

16
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:05,600
Why would I ever get jealous?

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,999
Hey, Yukari-chan! Let's
grab a drink together today.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,820
Not going!

19
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,852
Hey, let's go!

20
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,612
- Not going!
- Come on, please!

21
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,372
Go by yourself.

22
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:16,373
Not interested.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,900
Are you close with Mr. Haibara?

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, you could say we've
known each other for a long time.

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,500
I was seriously injured in an accident. At that
time, the person who took my place was Haibara.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,100
Back then, you...

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,299
Actually, you don't really have to
quit the entertainment industry, do you?

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,300
No, no, no, the guy I eat
with left this behind too.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
Did your manager try to stop you?

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,800
Nope! He was more like, “This is the time
to make money, so what exactly do you want?”

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,800
It can't be helped! After
all, he's not exactly wrong.

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,100
What's that supposed to mean?!

33
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:06,214
The one suffering the most, both physically
and mentally, is clearly the actor...

34
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,246
And he can't even understand
something that basic.

35
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:10,499
That person isn't even fit to be a manager.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,526
Since you're a manager,
you should be thinking things through with the actor—

37
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:16,300
finding a way for them to
keep working, even if it's tough.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,200
I really wish my manager
was Yukari-chan, too.

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Huh?

40
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:38,916
Please don't do that in public.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,120
So it's okay as long as it's not in public?

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,032
Hey, I want to come over
to your place and hang out!

43
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,000
Please don't come.

44
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,032
I want to go to your place!

45
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,428
Don't come over.

46
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:51,523
It doesn't matter anyway.

47
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:52,764
So hard to make plans with you.

48
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,457
What's up?

49
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,600
Not satisfied?

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,500
I just feel hopeless about
how I keep going with the flow.

51
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,800
By the way, Yukari-chan.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
It's about time you started
dating me, don't you think?

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,480
I can't be in a
relationship with you.

54
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:17,234
Go out with me.

55
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:19,000
No, I can't date you.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Tch!!

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,099
(Yamabuki Wakaba: Regarding posting
photos of Akafuji Yuichiro on social media)

58
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,180
Is someone looking for you?

59
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,831
No, it was an email from Director Yamabuki.

60
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh!

61
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:35,200
Oh, he's the “man closest to Cannes”!

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,700
He's that genius type who's
also super passionate, right?

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,014
The kind who just throws all
common sense out the window?

64
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:45,846
He may be a genius type, but whenever the director
wants to post Akafuji's photos on social media,

65
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,652
he always contacts
me first to confirm.

66
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,799
Thank you for your support.
This is Director Wakaba Yamabuki.

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Please forgive me for
reaching out so suddenly.

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,500
Regarding the posting of photos of your company's
actor, Akafuji Yuichiro, on social media.

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Wow! That's such a huge contrast.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,899
Someone who's called
a genius or a free spirit.

71
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,260
Surprisingly, he's actually really organized
when it comes to getting things done.

72
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
More importantly,

73
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,223
How long are you planning to stay?

74
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:19,817
Huh?

75
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:21,677
It's about time to
head back, isn't it?

76
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,300
I mean it.

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,900
I like you, Yukari-chan.

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm so pissed off!

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
What?

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Did your acting get worse after you
left showbiz? Your lines sound so fake.

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Hey, hey!!!

82
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Enough, please just go back now!

83
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,000
Yukari-chan, that's so mean!

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,520
There's no way we could ever be together...

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,364
Are you the type to
confess your feelings first?

86
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:09,500
I'd probably make the
other person say it first.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
He's the one I like.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,920
I would never say something
like "I like you" that easily.

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,000
I like you, Yukari-chan.

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,940
I'm not someone who gives up that easily.

91
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,000
Yukari-chan, that's just too much!

92
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
But...

93
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,000
I love you.

94
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,220
Why would you fall for someone like that...

95
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
That really pisses me off.

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,100
"I Became the Main Role of a BL Drama" Season 2
(Episode 4)

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,500
The distance between those two...
has it gotten even closer than before?

98
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,549
The best partner.

99
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,699
With you, I can go anywhere.

100
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,400
The world? No, even the universe.

101
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Ah, Miss Tendou!

102
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,560
Hajime-kun, long time no see.

103
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,326
I happened to be filming in the studio next
door, so I thought I might run into you.

104
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm honored.

105
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,800
Did something happen again?

106
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Talk to your sister about
it and let your feelings out.

107
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,100
It's just a story about
a friend of a friend!

108
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,806
It seems like he has someone he likes. But if that
person is really close to someone else...

109
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:41,700
It just feels a little heavy inside.

110
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,200
Of course you would.

111
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,829
But this is the first time
I've ever felt this way.

112
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:49,898
When I was with someone
else before, I never felt this way.

113
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:53,700
That's why I have no idea what to do.

114
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,500
And... it seems like my friend's friend
is really troubled by this right now.

115
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,526
I see.

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,474
But that feeling of frustration actually
grows the more you like that person.

117
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,870
A little down, but still in love?

118
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,700
The more frustrated I get,
the more I end up liking them.

119
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
Uh...

120
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,000
I think I get it, but at the
same time, I'm not so sure.

121
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,176
Yeah! Even though I end up feeling tunnel vision,
or just really annoyed with myself and stuff like that.

122
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,676
But still...

123
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,465
Something that can stir up your
emotions this much, aside from yourself.

124
00:09:37,466 --> 00:09:39,500
It's not that common, is it?

125
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm honestly jealous of Hajime-kun's friend's friend
getting to meet someone like that!

126
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
I get it.

127
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,300
Aoyagi Hajime is just too adorable.
It's impossible not to sigh, right?

128
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm just sighing at your usual
die-hard fan behavior, that's all.

129
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Are you two really dating?

130
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
You've got a point.

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,100
Did something happen
between you and Aoyagi-san?

132
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,389
Hajime-san seems to think I'm this “perfect
person who's super passionate about work.”

133
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:03,300
A perfect person? You?

134
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,900
But just like you saw, I'm
really just a fan of Aoyagi Hajime!

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,557
But I don't want to ruin the image of
Akafuji-kun that Hajime-san has in his mind.

136
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,355
I'm afraid he'll end up disliking me...

137
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
So I end up unconsciously
trying to act cool.

138
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,600
And lately,

139
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,500
I end up not knowing how
to act in front of Hajime-san...

140
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,700
Why don't you just say
all of this directly to him?

141
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Huh?

142
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,925
Anyway, with your personality, even if you keep
trying to act cool, you'll slip sooner or later.

143
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,527
Might as well mess up early and get it over with.

144
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,300
Huh?! Do I really need Spartan
training just to fall in love?

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,200
I thought you were going to
give me some good advice.

146
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,500
How long are you planning to
stay Aoyagi Hajime's die-hard fan?

147
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,360
Didn't you already work up the
courage to tell him how you feel?

148
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,591
One thing I can say is that, for
you, Aoyagi-san might be like the sun.

149
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:15,000
But at the same time, he's also Icarus.

150
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,600
Hajime-san is... Icarus?

151
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,900
What I mean is, compared to what you imagine,
Aoyagi-san is a much more real, genuine person.

152
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,400
I get that we all tend to see our favorites
through rose-colored glasses, too!

153
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
Lay down your weapons and surrender.

154
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
I like you, Yukari-chan.

155
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,800
Though I'm not really in a
position to judge others, either.

156
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,500
Let's give it our all together!

157
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Alright...

158
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Got it!

159
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,360
Yuichiro, do you have a
moment to talk right now?

160
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,471
Alright.

161
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:37,320
About this scene, didn't we say
at first that we wouldn't go all in?

162
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,867
Yeah, that's right.

163
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:39,952
But I still think going
into the water is better.

164
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:40,600
That's right.

165
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,115
Yeah, that's exactly the feeling.

166
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:43,799
Yeah, there's absolutely
no memory of it, right?

167
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,046
Alright.

168
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,800
So I'm going to the
beach to look for my mom.

169
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,206
Actually, I meant it's
better to go into the sea.

170
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:49,641
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly it!

171
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:50,153
Got it.

172
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:52,500
A little down, but I still like it.

173
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,355
The more down I feel,
the more I end up liking it.

174
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,399
That's exactly how it feels.

175
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,759
- Director, sorry about that.
- Huh?

176
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,496
- Could you wait for me just a moment?
- Sure.

177
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Hajime-san.

178
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,600
Do you want to go home together today?

179
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,370
Sure! Good luck with the shoot!

180
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:12,700
Thank you, Hajime-san.

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,691
- Akafuji-kun, great job out there!
- Kijima-san, you worked hard too.

182
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,586
You're waiting for Hajime-kun, right?

183
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:35,587
Yeah.

184
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,774
Actually, there was a last-minute change to
the location, so the end time is now uncertain.

185
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,750
I see...

186
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:46,100
Hajime-kun asked me to
tell you to head back first.

187
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,389
Sorry about that.

188
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,400
No problem, please tell
Hajime-san to keep it up for me.

189
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,000
Why did you have to die?!

190
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,500
Kiryu Yuzuru?

191
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Yes!

192
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,733
You're watching a pretty old-school video.

193
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,699
Mr. Yukuri asked me to watch it, saying it
would help me improve my acting skills.

194
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,000
He said Kiryu Yuzuru's acting is the best.

195
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,800
Eh... really?

196
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,700
He was Mr. Yukari's favorite back in his youth!

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
A favorite...!

198
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,000
- Well... I'll head out first!
- Okay.

199
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,899
Wait a second!

200
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,416
- Do you hate it?
- Hate... Don't treat me like a kid.

201
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,692
What if a child watches it?

202
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,816
Let go of me.

203
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,660
Because you said you'd make me whatever I wanted
for dinner, that's the only reason I let you come.

204
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,300
You really are something else.

205
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
Hey, Yukari-chan.

206
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
You're ignoring me!

207
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
Well, I'll just keep
talking to myself then.

208
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,700
I heard about it from
Akafuji-kun yesterday.

209
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,800
So Yukari-chan is a fan of Kiryu Yuzuru?

210
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,200
You've collected all the
magazines and DVDs, haven't you?

211
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
And also...

212
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,500
Yukari-chan, you're from Saitama, right?

213
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,401
Could it be... that Mr. Y from Saitama, who sent in 500
postcards for the magazine's prize drawing,

214
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:04,589
is actually you?

215
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:06,500
So it was actually Yukari-chan?

216
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,500
Come to think of it, Yukari-chan
is totally in love with me!

217
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,721
Five hundred postcards. That's gotta
mean you're super, super, super into me!

218
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:20,300
That's not it!

219
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,856
Whoa! Hold on... That
actually kind of hurts.

220
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:28,399
That was close! That was
really close, Yukari-chan!

221
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,200
Yukari-chan!

222
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,000
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

223
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,700
Kijima-san, why do you
have a bandage on your face?

224
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Hmm... Something small happened.

225
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Please don't push yourself too hard.

226
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
So, Hajime-kun, are you okay?

227
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Huh?

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,666
If you ever want to slack off
together again, just let me know.

229
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,500
I'll be lazy with you.

230
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Having Kijima-san as my manager
really makes me feel so happy.

231
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,400
I feel really lucky to be
Hajime-kun's manager, too.

232
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,200
Is it Izu?

233
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
The schedule can be adjusted...

234
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,300
When I'm with Akafuji-kun...
inspiration just keeps flowing.

235
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,300
Look.

236
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,403
Look, look, look!

237
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,879
Here it comes! It's happening again!

238
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:54,300
Thank you so much for
valuing our Akafuji so highly!

239
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,800
I want to push him to his limits.

240
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,000
I hope he can focus on filming by himself.

241
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
So...

242
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,200
I hope he can come to Izu on his own.

243
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
That's not a problem.

244
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, I see. That's great, then.

245
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,800
I already...

246
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,009
(Next Episode Preview)
Izu?

247
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,085
(A Trip to Izu: Love and Panic)

248
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,585
You really don't see
many actors this talented.

249
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:08,754
You even made a special trip all the way to Izu.
It feels like you're hiding something.

250
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:10,320
Hajime-san and Mr. Haibara are together!!

251
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:11,397
Since we're here, let's make the
most of it and do some sightseeing.

252
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:12,687
(Where will the love rectangle go...?!)
If possible, please tell me about yourself.

253
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:15,482
Next... let's have a good talk.

254
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:16,800
Could it be an affair?!
