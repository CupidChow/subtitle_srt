1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Momoshiro, happy birthday!

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,900
Yaoyi-san! Please blow out the candles!

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,920
- Huh, is that okay? You don't have to be so polite.
- No problem, go ahead and blow them out!

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,800
Isn't this workplace bullying?

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
Yaoyi-san would never
make me feel that way.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Then I won't hold back.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,640
As Momoshiro's representative,
please allow me to blow out the candles.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
Happy birthday, Momoshiro!

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,500
- So empty...
- Yeah...

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,341
The series has already
finished airing for half a year.

11
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,500
But even now, I still go looking to
see if there's a magical episode 9!

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,138
Hehehe.

13
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,400
What's that laugh supposed to mean?

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Actually...

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,700
I've already come up with the
outline for the sequel to "Blue Love."

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,900
That's...!!

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,200
(I Fell in Love with My Childhood
Friend Season 2) (TV Drama Proposal)

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,500
I Became the Main Role of a
BL Drama Season 2 (Episode 3)

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,143
I'm planning to submit
this proposal next time.

20
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:53,599
What will happen?!

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,300
What will happen?!

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
What will happen?!

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,399
Ah, what's going to happen!

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,300
What will happen?!

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,300
What's going to happen?!

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,382
First, let's start with a cozy
at-home date on the weekend!

27
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,203
Just like this, sitting
together on the couch.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,800
You're really happy to
be with me, aren't you?

29
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
(Transforming into Mizutani)
Shut up, you idiot!

30
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,178
It's so great that we get
to have a day off together.

31
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:32,123
Yeah! I'm really,
really happy.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Huh?

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,891
Why are you praying?

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Because it's just so sacred!

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Here it comes.

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,567
Hey!

37
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:50,630
Wait, wait, wait!

38
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,161
You even got your glasses ready!

39
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:56,600
I thought it would be more exciting
this way, so I brought it from home.

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,500
As expected, the two of them still
have to start off with this kind of vibe.

41
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,800
Oh, should we order some more fries?

42
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,536
Mu-chan never fails to be so thoughtful.

43
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,100
I ordered the large size.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Actually, you know...

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,900
I'm planning to add a new
character in the sequel.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
- Could it be...
- That's right.

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,500
As the rival in love.

48
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,500
Shirasaki.

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Shira—saki!

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Shirasaki is the tough boss who was
transferred back from the overseas branch.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Before Mizutani switched jobs, he
was Momoshiro's direct supervisor.

52
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,374
(Representing Shirasaki)

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,400
With his sharp instincts, he immediately
realized that Mizutani and Momoshiro were dating.

54
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,600
Has the actor for
Shirasaki been decided yet?

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,700
The choice for Shirasaki is...

56
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,900
Haibara Ryunosuke.

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,599
- Mr. Haibara!
- Hi, I'm here to hang out.

58
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:12,024
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,582
What brings you here all of a sudden?

60
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,524
I just happened to be in the area.

61
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,799
This is a souvenir,
specially made orange juice!

62
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:21,823
Huh?

63
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
Actually, they all taste the same.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,700
It's just the packaging that's different.

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Each one is just as cute
as you, Hajime, right?

66
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Thank you, Mr. Haibara.

67
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,943
Don't you have a scene to shoot today?

68
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,800
Are you filming around here?

69
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,500
Mr. Haibara.

70
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,300
Just like Kuromiya said.

71
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,400
Just by standing there,
he exudes a mature charm.

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Such a powerful presence.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,194
Nice to meet you, I'm Shuichiro Akafuji.

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,933
Hi, Akafuji.

75
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,100
I knew you'd be here.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Huh?

77
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,802
I've always been grateful for
how you've looked after Hajime.

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
I should be the one saying that.
Thanks for always looking out for me.

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,144
Akafuji, I think we really get along well.

80
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:44,244
I'm honored.

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,700
I've always wanted to have a
good talk with Mr. Haibara, too.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I just knew you two
would get along really well.

83
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Oh, it's Mr. Haibara.

84
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Huh, does the image not fit?

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,347
No, the appearance is a perfect match.

86
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:15,700
But according to the setup,
doesn't Shirasaki like Momoshiro?

87
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,580
That's right, that's right.

88
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,500
How should I put this...

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Feels more like this side.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
It feels more like this part.

91
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,533
Ah, that's true.

92
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,700
Mr. Haibara really
cares a lot about Hajime.

93
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,079
I really like that scene in the original.

94
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,900
Could it be...

95
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
I'll just get straight to the point.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mizutani.

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,400
I like Momoshiro even more than you do.

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
I get it!

99
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Shirasaki, who's usually so calm,
says this line in such a cool way.

100
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,800
- Ah! This is just so heart-throbbing.
- My heart feels completely captivated.

101
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Picture Haibara saying this line.

102
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,100
I'll just get straight to the point.

103
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Akafuji.

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,500
I like Hajime even more than you do.

105
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,600
- I can totally picture Mr. Haibara saying that in my mind.
- Same here, I pictured it too.

106
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,000
I... I love Hajime more than anyone else!

107
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,700
Akafuji.

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Let me make this clear first.

109
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,500
My love for Hajime runs
deeper than anyone else's.

110
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,700
If we're competing, I won't lose either!

111
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,764
Um... are you guys okay?

112
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:23,200
Then let's have a showdown, Akafuji!

113
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Showdown.

114
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,138
A showdown between rivals in love
sounds pretty interesting, doesn't it?

115
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,374
Maybe that's not a bad choice.

116
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:40,150
Right!

117
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:43,174
How about suggesting it to the coach?
What kind of showdown should we have?

118
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,600
Should we just settle
it with a fight after all?

119
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,300
Something like this?

120
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:53,700
No, no, no, that would totally
change the whole world of "Blue Love"!

121
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,000
- Good point.
- A showdown...

122
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,300
What should we choose?

123
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,340
What should the showdown be about...

124
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,760
What exactly do you mean by a showdown?

125
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
That is...

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,400
"Who knows Hajime better?" A quiz showdown!

127
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
About me?

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I got it.

129
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Please drink.

130
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,543
Since it's a showdown, of
course there has to be a “reward.”

131
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:02,544
A reward, huh?

132
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
That's right.

133
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,500
The winner gets to make a request
to Hajime. How does that sound?

134
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Huh?

135
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:20,011
Is that okay, Hajime?

136
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,411
Huh?

137
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Alright.

138
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,600
What kind of request is Mr. Haibara
planning to make to Hajime?

139
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,100
I've got a bad feeling about this.
I have to win this match, no matter what.

140
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I'll protect Hajime.

141
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,500
So, can I ask the first question?

142
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Go ahead.

143
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,900
Here comes the question!

144
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,600
In the movie "Magic Panic High School" that
Hajime starred in, which character did he play?

145
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,272
- The spirit of the school pond!
- That's right!

146
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,943
In Monthly Actors,

147
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,500
What are Hajime's
thoughts on playing this role?

148
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:17,499
Even I forgot about that!

149
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,199
This was a role I rarely got to
try, and I really enjoyed playing it.

150
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,743
Dot dot dot.

151
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:20,421
Sorry about that.

152
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:21,421
A little shy.

153
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Correct.

154
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,500
Alright, it's my turn
to ask a question now.

155
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,100
The question comes from Hajime's
manager, Mr. Huangdao's social media.

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,754
What snacks did Hajime bring to
the set of "Blue Love" as a treat?

157
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
No way...

158
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:46,500
That's way too obscure.

159
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,700
Imagawayaki.

160
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,000
In your hometown, isn't it called “Oyaki”?

161
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
That's correct.

162
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,200
Amazing!

163
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Add one more large order of fries.

164
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,200
But anyway...

165
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Shirasaki.

166
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,560
Time to show what you've got!

167
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,940
Show them what you've got!

168
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,900
Sequel! Sequel!

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
- Sequel! Sequel!
- Sequel! Sequel!

170
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
Akafuji, you're doing pretty well!

171
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,040
Mr. Haibara is impressive, too.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,281
If this keeps up, we won't
be able to determine a winner.

173
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,879
How about...

174
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,625
Next, let's have Hajime ask the questions!

175
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,725
Should I be the one to ask the question?

176
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Whoever answers Hajime's question
first wins. How does that sound?

177
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,100
I agree.

178
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm counting on you, Hajime.

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,612
Uh... what should I do?

180
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,800
I've never really thought about
questions about myself before.

181
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Alright, here comes the question!

182
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
My favorite.

183
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,800
What kind of dessert is it?

184
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,100
Hajime's favorite dessert is.

185
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,800
Orange cake.

186
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Uh...

187
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,633
Huh?

188
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,833
Isn't it?

189
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,519
Hajime's favorite dessert is.

190
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,720
Apple pie.

191
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
Apple.

192
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
That's correct.

193
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
For real?!

194
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,100
For real?!

195
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm Aoyagi Hajime.

196
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,400
Mr. Haibara, I look
forward to your guidance.

197
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,100
The orange cake that Mr. Haibara
brought is really delicious.

198
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,900
(The treat brought by Mr. Haibara Ryunosuke
"orange cake" Here for everyone to enjoy.)

199
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Hajime, you've really grown up.

200
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Mr. Haibara.

201
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,000
- Akafuji.
- Yes.

202
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,860
Being able to have such an exciting match.
I'm really happy.

203
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Me too.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Thank you very much.

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But you know what?

206
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Only the spot as Hajime's big brother.

207
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,100
I'm definitely not giving it up to you!

208
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,900
The spot of being the big brother.

209
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
So, Hajime.

210
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
See you on set.

211
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Alright.

212
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,000
What should I do about this?

213
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,067
What should I do?

214
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,500
What exactly does "the position
of an older brother" mean?

215
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Mr. Haibara always said
he wanted to be my brother.

216
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I see.

217
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,000
No! That's not it at all!

218
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,702
Honestly, I don't really get what
Mr. Haibara is thinking either.

219
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:32,037
Plus, I'm actually younger than Hajime.

220
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:36,100
No matter what, I just
can't be Hajime's big brother.

221
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
That's true.

222
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
What a strange person.

223
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,800
But as an actor, I really respect
him, and I think he's a great senior.

224
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I can understand that.

225
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
And just like that, the day is over.

226
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
What a busy day off!

227
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,599
Hajime.

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,667
What?

229
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,000
I won the match, didn't I?

230
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,000
So, can you agree to my request?

231
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Huh?

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,800

233
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,400

235
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:36,975
Getting to hear the live version of
the Orange Song is just awesome!

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,464
Ah, I want to record it. Can
you sing it one more time?

237
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:41,600
Alright, no problem.

238
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,400

239
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600

241
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
I couldn't eat it.

242
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I just can't eat it.

243
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,085
If your face gets cut in half,
that's really hard to watch.

244
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,086
I can't eat it.

245
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't cut into the face.

246
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,800
Can you eat it?

247
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,400
I just can't eat it.

248
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Ah~.

249
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,500
I really want to see
Momoshiro and Mizutani!

250
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,800
Yaoyi-san, we really have
to work hard for the sequel!

251
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Momoharu!

252
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
"Blue Love."

253
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,200
- Momoharu!
- "Blue Love".

254
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Momoharu!

255
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
"Blue Love!"

256
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,692
Momoharu!

257
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
"Blue Love!"

258
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,280
- Should we add some more large fries?
- Yes!

259
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,000
- I'm feeling energized now.
- That's great to hear!

260
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,900
This really is the best reward.

261
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,130
- But I'm the only one singing.
- I get to have Moe's singing all to myself.

262
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:11,924
This is the greatest crime
in the history of the universe.

263
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,148
You're being way too dramatic.

264
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Huh?!

265
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,071
Did I want a sequel too much, and
ended up hallucinating the two of them?

266
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:23,600
Me too, and it was super vivid.

267
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,920
We have to get up early
tomorrow, so let's head home.

268
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,380
Let's do it.

269
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
It's too dangerous over there.

270
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,457
Let's take the back door.

271
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,800
Alright, excuse me.

272
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,099
(Next episode preview) (Another
romance begins) Please, go out with me.

273
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,000
I can't date you.

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's just too much.

275
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:25,944
There's no way we could date.

276
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,439
(I want Yukari to be my manager too.)

277
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,249
- Want to go home together today?
- Sure.

278
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,476
(The ominous shadow draws
closer to the two of them) I already...

279
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,300
I can't stop thinking about him.
