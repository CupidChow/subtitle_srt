1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,800
I'm about to give out.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,800
This is absolutely amazing.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,200
They're actually back-to-back now!

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh my god! It's a head pat!

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
It's just so captivating.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,876
I'm so grateful that we can still have special features
like this even after the drama has finished airing.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,022
It's become a huge hit overseas too!
The reviews are absolutely amazing!

8
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,000
The number of views has
already surpassed nine million!

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,231
I'm really looking forward to the
sequel of "Blue Romance" too.

10
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:46,900
Alright, absolutely!

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Absolutely! You two are amazing!

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,428
Could you move to the front for the shoot?

13
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:57,429
Alright.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,233
Awesome! Awesome!

15
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:02,655
So awesome!

16
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:04,077
Awesome!

17
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,500
That's really awesome!!

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
Awesome! Awesome!
Seriously, that's amazing!

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,199
That's just amazing!

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,799
Ah~ Isn't that just way too cute!

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Hajime is so adorable!

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,400
"I Became the Main Role of a BL Drama" Season 2
(Episode 1)

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,614
Akafuji, your hair's gotten longer.

24
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,649
Yeah, I grew out my bangs for my next role.

25
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,900
I see.

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,500
Huh, is it weird?

27
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,009
Ah, sorry.

28
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,300
You were just so handsome,
I couldn't help but stare.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
Am I really that good-looking?

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
You're really handsome,
seriously, incredibly handsome!

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,917
Back in the day, I definitely would
have fainted in a situation like this.

32
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,317
Hajime.

33
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,100
Sorry, I need to step away for a moment.

34
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Hello, Mom?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,520
Sorry for calling you out of the blue.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Um...

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,740
There's something I've
always wanted to say to you.

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,900
Thank you for giving birth
to such a handsome me.

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,900
Yeah, no matter what,
I just wanted to tell you.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
That's it for now.

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,500
Hajime and I confessed
our feelings to each other.

42
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:57,491
I like you.

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,900
As Akafuji Yuichiro.

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Me too.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Not as Mizutani.

46
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,000
But as Aoyagi Hajime.

47
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Realizing I have feelings
for Akafuji Yuichiro.

48
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,300
This fact

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,600
I've finally gained the strength
to look Hajime in the eyes.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I already have.

51
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Something has changed.

52
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
That's great.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,900
Cool.

54
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,110
Hajime, would you like some apple pie?

55
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, thank you.

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,100
After we started dating, Akafuji
was just as gentle as ever.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,124
Wow~ That looks delicious!

58
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,200
Thank you, Akagi.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,000
It's seriously super bouncy!

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
- With Hajime.
- I'm digging in!

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Now I can hold eye contact
for more than 10 seconds.

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,800
Akafuji always wants to make me happy.

63
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:18,047
I've changed, I really have!

64
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm digging in too.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Delicious.

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,299
Really?

67
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,733
It tastes even better than usual.

68
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:28,400
Akafuji, you've always stayed the
same, and that really makes me happy.

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,900
But...

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,160
Next time, I'll be playing a detective.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,176
Since it's my first time playing a
detective, I'm really looking forward to it.

72
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,291
Mr. Haihara, who has looked after me since my
child actor days, will also be in this production.

73
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,676
So I'm really looking
forward to seeing him.

74
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,436
It's Mr. Haihara Ryunosuke, right? You two
worked together on “Detective and Detective-kun.”

75
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,134
That's amazing, you actually knew that.

76
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:51,535
Of course. When it comes to anything related
to Hajime, I know everything inside out.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Hajime.

78
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,764
Huh?

79
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,500
Are you feeling a bit tired?

80
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Huh?

81
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,846
You have to get up early tomorrow, right?

82
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,700
- Sorry, I stayed too long. I'll get going now.
- Not at all...

83
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,456
The new show is on the same TV channel, so
maybe we'll run into each other during filming.

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Yeah.

85
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,733
It would be amazing if I could see you.

86
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,133
You can just drop me off here.

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,953
Well then, good night.

88
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,122
Sorry to bother you.

89
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,123
Good night.

90
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
But...

91
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
our relationship too.

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Since then... there's been
absolutely no progress.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,850
No... Back then, we
were still living together.

94
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,500
Now we're actually living apart.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Are we really going to be okay
if things keep going like this?

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,100
Is the next drama Akafuji will star
in directed by Yamabuki Wakaba?

97
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,387
Isn't he known as "the man
closest to the Cannes Film Festival"?

98
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,388
Yes.

99
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,383
- But this is his first time directing a drama.
- Still, it's sure to become a hot topic.

100
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:41,323
I hope this can become a
valuable experience for Akafuji.

101
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:44,500
- A draft beer, please.
- And a screwdriver, too.

102
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,984
Speaking of which... I
don't think I've ever asked.

103
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,709
Yukari, what made you want to
become a manager in the first place?

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Um...

105
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Raise your hands.

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
What's wrong?

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Seeing an actor I like leave the
industry because of a scandal or rumors.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
If I had been there with you back then.

109
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Then I could have prevented
all of this from happening.

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I see.

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,000
If my manager had been like
you, maybe I'd still be an actor now.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,040
Do you still have any
attachment to being an actor?

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Not at all.

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,400
Now, as Hajime's manager,
I'm really enjoying every day.

115
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
So, what's next?

116
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,200
- You really never learn, do you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

117
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
This is bad...

118
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,000
Hajime's newly released photobook is the
best-selling one in the past seven years.

119
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,234
A sudden surge in demand out of nowhere.

120
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,300
If I can't get my hands
on Hajime's photobook...

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,400
What should I do?!

122
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,880
If I end up missing the release time and can't buy it, I'll
just get there and see a “Thank you, sold out” sign left.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,499
This is just too much.

124
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,800
I can't accept this!

125
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
Are you okay?

126
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,100
I'll find a way to get it.

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,888
Who said I was talking to you about that?

128
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:32,912
I'm talking about this.

129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Your official account is starting
to look just like a fan account.

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,801
Because the fans are totally shipping you two as a couple,
there hasn't been any official response on social media.

131
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,860
But you're still an up-and-coming
actor with a bright future ahead of you.

132
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm really sorry.

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Seriously.

134
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,320
Still acting like this even
after you started dating.

135
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,700
Is this really okay?

136
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Ah! Let's go with Ludwig von Beethoven's
“Ode to Joy” for the background music.

137
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,300
Finally, I get to meet you.

138
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,100
I'm the director, Wakaba Yamabuki.

139
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,521
I remember Yukari once said he's “the
man closest to the Cannes Film Festival.”

140
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:16,152
Nice to meet you, I'm Akafuji Yuichiro.

141
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:17,153
Yeah.

142
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,714
Too close! Way too close! Way too close!!

143
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:22,800
Forget about Cannes,
your face is way too close!

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've always been really interested in you.

145
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,700
Ah, thank you.

146
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,700
Even though this is my first time directing a TV
drama, my passion for the job is second to none.

147
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,914
Challenge is what leads to growth.

148
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:46,500
Without growth, there's no progress, right?

149
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Yeah...

150
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,958
That's right, just as I thought.

151
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,676
- Your acting really is unforgettable.
- Ah~ Finally, after all that effort.

152
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,766
I saw Hajime.

153
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:55,400
Amazing.

154
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:59,972
Ninety percent of the view is blocked.
I can barely see Hajime now.

155
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:02,805
- You said you acted that way because you trusted the script, right?
- Hajime

156
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,829
Mr. Haibara!

157
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:07,700
- Got it? Hmm, what are you looking at?
- What's going on over there?

158
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,761
I think it should be fine.

159
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:12,300
I really trust you.

160
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
I'm counting on you.

161
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:15,162
I'm counting on you.

162
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay.

163
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:19,676
Lift you up, lift you up~

164
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:23,463
Let's work hard together.

165
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:25,400
One day, we have to go to Cannes together.

166
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
What the heck?

167
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
What is this?

168
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
A chaotic scene?

169
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,038
Here he goes again...

170
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,194
What was that scene just now?

171
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,100
That “lifted up high” scene.

172
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,788
Seeing Hajime from the
lifted-up perspective is basically

173
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:09,500
like having a front-row seat
in the rock zone at a concert.

174
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,838
Damn it!

175
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:15,575
My spot in the rock zone got taken!

176
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Good morning.

177
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,846
Still the same as always.

178
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,575
The director is here!

179
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,638
Good morning, everyone!

180
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:30,600
Nice to meet you.

181
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,266
Alright, I'm Director Yamabuki.

182
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:38,267
Please take care of me.

183
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,217
Please take care of me.

184
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,000
Alright, I'll get straight to the point.

185
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
This work is an ensemble drama centered
around the struggles of modern young people.

186
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,900
Each character carries their own worries,
afraid of forming connections with others.

187
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
But... they just can't stand being alone.

188
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,600
What I want to capture are
these delicate inner emotions.

189
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,579
I want to cherish those feelings
that can't be put into words.

190
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,100
And to paint that picture
together with everyone.

191
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
That's right.

192
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
That's it.

193
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,800
That's the expression.

194
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,580
What?

195
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,400
That look in his eyes, as if he's
carrying all the darkness inside.

196
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,900
He's already completely in character now.

197
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,100
Akafuji, no, Shuichiro!

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Awesome!

199
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,600
Everyone, give a round of applause.

200
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Okay.

201
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,085
Looking forward to working
with you from here on out.

202
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:01,805
- Got it.
- Let's do our best together!

203
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,700
Alright, let's start reading the script.

204
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,149
How does it feel now that Hajime
and Mr. Haibara are finally together?

205
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,500
Mr. Haibara.

206
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,226
That's just unbelievable.

207
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:18,763
How is it so unbelievable?

208
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:19,800
Exactly...

209
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,000
- That's just insane.
- Stop going around in circles.

210
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,200
Ah, he's really got a lot of charm.

211
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:32,384
Charisma?

212
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,572
How should I put it, that
kind of aura they give off.

213
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,000
Really captivating.

214
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,500
Definitely not the type
you'd ever want as a rival.

215
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Alright, good luck!

216
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,140
- It's time to tell him how I feel directly.
- What?

217
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:57,005
How about giving 99 roses to Hajime?

218
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,200
Doesn't the number 99 feel kind of unlucky?

219
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,058
99 roses stand for eternal love.

220
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:05,004
- What?
- I have to let Hajime know how I feel right away.

221
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,365
Stop it! What you're doing is seriously
creeping people out in every possible way!!!

222
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Creepy?

223
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,500
Love that's too heavy,
Hajime will end up running away from you!

224
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,300
My love.

225
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Is it too much?

226
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm going to dig in.

227
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Mmm! This tastes great.

228
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Thanks for having me.

229
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Huh?

230
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,400
No, it's nothing. I just couldn't
help but say it when I saw your smile.

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
Akafuji, you really are interesting.

232
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Hajime.

233
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,247
What's wrong?

234
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,000
What kind of relationship
do you have with Mr. Haibara?

235
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,240
Is your relationship close
enough that you'd let each

236
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,382
other do something like
lifting each other up in the air?

237
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No, I'm just glad it suits your taste.

238
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,300
Um... Mr. Akafuji.

239
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,300
Tomorrow's your day off, right?

240
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,100
Yeah.

241
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
If you're willing.

242
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,840
Would you like to stay over tonight?

243
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Is that okay?

244
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
Of course you can.

245
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,600
Then I'll gladly accept your invitation.

246
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Hajime.

247
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Mr. Akafuji.

248
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Good night.

249
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Hajime?

250
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Aren't you off tomorrow?

251
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
It's okay.

252
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Should we... maybe take
the next step... after kissing?

253
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
The next step after a kiss.

254
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm fine.

255
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
So, what that means is...

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
About that...

257
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,400
(Akafuji's late great-grandmother)

258
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Mr. Akafuji.

259
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Mr. Akafuji.

260
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
Did I scare you?

261
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,500
Good morning, Mr. Akafuji.

262
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Good morning.

263
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
I...

264
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,600
- Yesterday.
- Oh no, I'm sorry.

265
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,245
Oh, right.

266
00:19:42,246 --> 00:19:44,678
I just bought some bread
from the bakery nearby.

267
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,912
Looks like it just came
out of the oven. Let's dig in!

268
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:49,000
You're right, it looks really delicious.

269
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,047
At that moment, I still didn't know that on the other
side of the Sanzu River, there was an even farther world.

270
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:07,800
No, no, you can't come over here.

271
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,368
(Next episode preview) Hey, cut it out!

272
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,683
(Rival in love approaching fast!) You've got
some whipped cream on the corner of your mouth.

273
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:44,684
(A rift forms between the two...) I just
wanted to get to know Mr. Akafuji better.

274
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,383
Why doesn't he show more of himself?

275
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:49,100
If you keep hesitating like this,
Grayhara's going to steal him away.

276
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,894
Huh? I only remember
chatting with Haibara.

277
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,900
I need to ask him about Haibara.
