Makeup is necessary. Most foreign girls wear makeup.

But besides you, no one else around me wears makeup.

Tang Ya, do you wear makeup?

I...

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,170
It's not allowed in school. You're going to host the foreign guests.

39
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,850
Wearing makeup is etiquette.

40

I should put on some makeup then.

41
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,410
I have to leave a good impression on them for our school. Right?

42

Do you have cosmetics? I can do the makeup for you.

43

I do. Dabao SOD lotion.

Blush and lipstick?

48

Are you a girl?

49
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,310
Well, my mom doesn't have any either.

50
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,380
- Would you lend me yours?
- No problem.

51
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,030
Come to my home after school, I'll test the makeup on you.

52

But your mom is at home.

53
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,180
- Let's go to Zhang Qi's home then. Ms. Zhang Ling may not be at home.
- Okay.

54
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,460
Shiyin, I brought you some chocolate.

She'll be interpreting tomorrow and talking the entire day.

65

- Come back. Come back.

72

73

76

Exactly, I'll lecture her.

Okay. Go. This kid...

78

It's good that you didn't peel the scallion.

Otherwise, you'd make it bald.

Well, let's use this lipstick only.

No way. You must apply full makeup.

86

No way.

87

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,370
- It will be exposed then.
- No way.

- As expected of Ms. Zhang Ling.

95
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,970
These are premium cosmetics.

96
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,370
Are these expensive?

97
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Let me tell you. Any of these is as expensive as a PS2.

98
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,723
- That expensive?
- Yeah!

99
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:29,530
I'd have sold them secretly if I had known earlier.

100

My mom doesn't use them anyway.

Ms. Zhang Ling doesn't wear makeup?

102
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,361
She? She doesn't even wash her face when she's busy.

103
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,410
Where does she find the time to apply makeup?

104

- Mr. Liu.

199
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,950
Have a seat.

I...

203
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,220
I applied some makeup

204
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,990
to showcase the school's image.

205
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,210
Don't do it again.

206
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,630
Okay!

Okay. Let's go.

211
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,390
Why does your face look redder than just now?

212
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,750
It's so itchy. I scratched it.

213
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,220
That's not right. It must be an allergic reaction.

214
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,910
I'm fine. Let's go, sir.

215
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,000
No. Go to the hospital.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,480
I'll take care of the delegation.

223
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,030
It's an allergy to some chemicals.

224
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,910
It's fine.

225
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,670
But I can't guarantee full recovery.

226

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Disfigured? It's too late to realize it. Scared now?

You must not cry.

232
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,840
Tears can irritate the skin.

233
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,620
Stop crying. Come on.

for my daughter to recover quickly?

237
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,240
I'll prescribe her some medications.

238
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,120
But she needs to work on it by herself.

239
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,010
Don't eat stimulating food.

240
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,320
Go to bed at a regular hour.

241
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,670

242
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,820
And apply the ointment on time.

243
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,800
Generally, it shouldn't be a problem.

244
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,360
Did you hear it? Careful with what you eat.

245
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,310
Don't eat anything you shouldn't.

246
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,210
By the way, don't touch the allergic area with your hands.

247
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,683
Okay.

248
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,510

250
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
I'll throw them away.

251
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,620
Those are not cosmetics.

252
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,590
Do it after the meal.

253
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,720
She threw away my stuff.

254
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,820
There's not even a non-veg dish. Look.

255
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,970
You can't blame your mom.

256
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,820
Fish induces heat. Meat induces phlegm.

257

Vegetables keep you safe.

258

In your current condition,

259
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,390
having whole-veg meals is the safest.

260
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,550
It's easier said than done.

261
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,720
You ate duck neck secretly. What do you have to say about that?

262
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,510
I'm a man. How can I have vegetables only?

263
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,871
Besides, at midnight, I secretly... No.

264
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,790
How can you blame me for seeing me eat something at midnight?

265
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,350
Well, I had to rummage around for something to eat.

266
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,900
Why can't you have a meat-free meal?

267
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,530
Let me tell you.

268
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,960
Don't tell your mom about it.

269
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,680

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,190

I brought this brat to apologize to you.

279
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Well, this spoiled brat took my expired cosmetics

280
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,770
and gave them to Xue.

281
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,320
I'm going to disown him.

Yes. Go and take a look yourself.

Is it so serious?

294
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,800
Zhang Qi, give my face back to me!

295
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,350
I didn't know that cosmetics had expiry dates.

296

You've caused me so much harm. How dare you dodge!

297
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,240
How do you want to vent out your anger?

298
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,940
Hit me then. As long as it can please you.

299
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,140
Not going to hit me?

300
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,440

So what?

302
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,000
This is rather serious.

303
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,820
Do you wish that I was disfigured?

304
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,350
You scared me to death.

305

Let me have a look.

306
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,750
It does look a little red.

307
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,440
But it's better than I thought.

308
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,920
What do you mean?

309
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,140
It's itchy and painful. I can't touch it. I can't even have meat.

310
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,431
I'm warning you. Don't irritate me these few days.

311

Tell me.

312
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,820
Well, be my errand boy for a week.

313
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,350
What? You don't want to?

314
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,250
Okay. You call the shots.

315
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,140
That's more like it.

316
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,400
Come on, massage me.

317
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,933
Hurry up.

318
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,210
Gentle.

319
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,720
Apply more pressure.

320
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,740
Luckily, your face is fine.

321
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,500
If something were to happen to your face, what should you do?

322
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,990
You're already rather ugly.

323
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,930
What are you saying?

324
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,470
I'm saying that even if something were to happen to your face,

325
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,990
it wouldn't be a big deal.

326
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,260
From now on, your meals are on me.

327
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,170
Do you really mean it?

328
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,790
Of course.

329
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,510
Great. Then, I want to eat at Quanjude, Bianyifang,

330
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,400
Dadong, and Siji Minfu.

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,260
Those with duck meat specialties?

332
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,680
Can you spare the ducks?

333
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,790
What? You don't want to?

334
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,750
I'm okay with it. Let's go there one by one.

335
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,420
Carry on.

<i>[Outpatient Clinic]</i>

337
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,600
Doctor, why did it become worse? The skin is dry and itchy.

338
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,960
Look. There are even fine lines.

339
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,340
I won't have wrinkles, will I?

340
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,650
Having wrinkles is a small case.

341
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,550
But it's a rather slow recovery.

342
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,400
Did you eat things that you shouldn't?

343
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,840
She didn't. We didn't allow her to do that.

344
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,000
She must have eaten something secretly.

345
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,210
What's going on?

346
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,440
Did you give her something behind my back?

347
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,280
No. It's...

348
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,890
That day, she ate some fish.

349
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,900
See? She can't have seafood.

350
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,490
Fine.

351
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,720
You take care of her.

352
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
Doctor, we'll keep her on the diet.

353
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,931
- Mom!
- Come on.

354
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,070
Abide by my requirement, okay?

355
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,880
Well, it's late. Don't cook.

356
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,310
Let's eat out. My treat.

357
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,411
Eat? All you know is eating.

358
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:41,671
The young one is ignorant. The old plays a fool, too.

359
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,350
It has been so many days. She couldn't go to school or meet anyone.

360
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,410
Don't you feel anxious?

361
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,820
Don't hit her so hard.

362
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,720
Will she remember it then?

363
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,940
Don't scratch!

364
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,880
When kids from other families get hurt,

365
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,450
their moms are so worried about them.

366
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,500
All you wanted was for me to remember it.

367
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,200
Stop crying.

368
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,610
Tears irritate the skin.

369
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,110
I won't stop!

370
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,650
It has been so many days. You didn't say anything pleasant to the ear at all.

371
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,540
You threw my stuff away. You forbade me to have meat.

372
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,770
Can't I cry now?

373
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,000
Why are you yelling at me? Why are you yelling?

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,960
Did I cause the allergy? Did I cause it?

375
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,790
You're so fierce. I don't want to see you again!

376
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,790
Where are you going?

377
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,450
Follow her.

378
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,790
She's hurt. She'll be all right after crying.

379
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,410
Then, come home with me now.

380
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,510
Why?

381
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,500
Help me prepare her favorite food.

382
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,050
Geez.

Stop crying.

387
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:11,210
Tears hurt the skin.

388
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,820
It hurts.

389
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,750
Take off your mask. Let me have a look.

390
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,843
It's ugly.

391
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,140
I've seen it all.

392
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,890
Even your sniveling look during childhood.

393
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,890
But I still played with you, didn't I?

394
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,870
It's a hot summer.

395
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,780
Won't the mask make it worse?

396
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,433
Tell me. Why are you crying?

397
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,350
What do you think?

398
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,020
I failed in becoming an interpreter.

399
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,310
I was disfigured. And my mom keeps scolding me.

400
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,770
- What is the main reason?
- The interpreter thing of course.

401
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,350
I was looking forward to it.

402
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,570
The entire alley knew about it.

403
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,580
I couldn't do it at last. So shameful.

404
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,000
There's nothing to feel ashamed of.

405
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,910
After a week, I guarantee that everyone won't remember it.

406
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,380
Others might forget it,

407
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,340
but not the teacher, I'm afraid.

408
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,110
Then, I can kiss the opportunity to study abroad goodbye.

409
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,260
Opportunity comes to those who are prepared.

410
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,630
You didn't manage to be the interpreter, but you've worked so hard for it.

411
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,350
Your efforts won't be in vain.

412
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,710
You just need a chance to practice.

413
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,820
Moreover, if you want to practice speaking,

414
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,850
my mom can help you.

415
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,850
Then, what about my face?

416
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,310
If my face doesn't recover, I'm afraid

417
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,300
no one will want me anymore.

418
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,550
How old are you now?

419
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,070
Why are you so concerned about such a thing?

420
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,370
You're worried that you can't get married?

421
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,383
All right.

422
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,690
If that day comes, I'll marry you.

423
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,480
If you can't get married,

424
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,283
I'll marry you.

425
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,363
All right?

426
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,090
I think it's all right.

427
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,250
Come on.

428
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,283
Thank you, Boss.

429
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:01,090
The tissue is on your credit.

430
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,380
Hi, lad. What are you looking for? Do you need any help?

431
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,640
These are cosmetics for girls.

432
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,090
Are you getting a gift?

433
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,170
Yes.

434
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,580
How old is she?

435
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,780
A high school student.

436
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,480
I know it then.

437
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,610
What about this?

438
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,450
It's pink and tender. It suits teenage girls well.

439
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,540
Okay. Thank you.

440
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,820
What about a bottle of perfume?

441
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,470
This is called the Taste of First Love.

442
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,400
No, thanks.

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,440
He's shy.

444
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,340
Mom, you suddenly brought me to the mall.

445
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,850
You didn't bring Dad along.

446
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,780
You're not selling me off, are you?

447
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,920
Selling you off?

448
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,500
I have to pay the difference if that were so.

449
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,600
Then, why are we here?

450
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,030
Shopping, of course.

451
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,690
Shopping? You're so stingy.

452
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,850
What did you say?

453
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,170
Huh? What do we buy?

454
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,070
What do you think?

455
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
Sunian, why are you here?

456
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,310
I came to get something for my mom.

457
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,960
What did you buy?

458
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,340
Hey, why are you so nosy?

459
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,850
We'll get going.

460
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,900
Bye, Mrs. Shao.

461
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,980
Bye, Sunian.

462
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,453
Mom!

463
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:49,430
Why did you bring me to the cosmetic counters?

464
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,420
I've never used these kinds of things.

465
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,110
And you don't know how to use them.

466
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,000
I've thought it through these few days.

467
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,980
You've grown up. You'll be going to the university soon.

468
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,130
It's normal to want to look beautiful.

469
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,790
Instead of forbidding you to use them, it's better to buy you some good ones

470
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,400
in case you do it recklessly and end up in the hospital again.

471
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,613
Miss.

472
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:15,590
Hi.

473
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,740
Can you recommend something suitable for my daughter?

474
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,450
What is your price range?

475
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,500
The best.

476
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,240
This is our latest series.

477
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,450
It has good moisturizing and sun protection effects.

478
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,740
Try it.

479
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,750
Let my daughter try it then.

480
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,100
Xue, come over.

481
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,770
It's okay. Try it.

482
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,590
This has a good sun protection effect.

483
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,300
And it's moisturizing.

484
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,780
It's very suitable for young girls like you.

485
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,510
How is it?

486
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,680
It has a good sun protection effect.

487
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,980
- It's suitable for the outdoors.
- Really?

488
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,300
It has a mild scent.

489
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,210
I'm home.

490
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,410
Sunian, you're home.

491
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,070
What is this?

492
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,763
For you.

493
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,860
For me?

494
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,440
It's not a festival or my birthday.

495
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,310
Why did you get me a gift?

496
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,210
I suddenly thought of it.

497
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,900
So sweet.

498
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,820
This seems to be...

499
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,750
for girls.

500
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,580
I just grabbed it.

501
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,550
Just make do.

502
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,440
Well, I think you didn't buy it for me,

503
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,050
but for someone else

504
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,330
and you didn't give it to her.

505
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,440
I need to study.

506
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,510
Hey! Tell me.

507
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,600
I can help you with it.

508
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,530
Do you need me to give it to her for you?

509
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,980
<i>[Class 1 Grade 11]</i>

510
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,400
<i>[Song of the Pipa by Bai Juyi]</i>

511
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,000
Before we dismiss, I have something to tell you.

512
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,030
The 10th-anniversary school celebration is around the corner.

513
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,740
This time, the performance is going to be the grandest in history.

514
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,330
If you're good at something, you can participate in it.

515
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,960
Those who want to give a show may register with the entertainment committee.

516
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,510
But it must not affect your studies.

517
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,670
- Okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

518
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,590
Okay. Class dismissed.

519
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,461
- Shiyin.
- Quick.

520
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:10,630
Register it for me. A play.

521
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,510
- What's the name?

522
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,240
I haven't thought of it yet. Just write "Shao Xue's show".

523
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,400
Quick. Write it down.

524
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,133
Go on.

525
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,920
- What's the show?
- A play.

526
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,680
Amazing. What's the story?

527
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,550
I haven't thought of the story yet.

528
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,310
But the casts are in place, waiting for my instruction.

529
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,350
I reject it.

530
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,420
Why?

531
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,990
<i>[Competition Class]</i>

532
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,900
<i>[Keep Quiet]</i>

533
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,210
I already feel tired studying every day. I don't have time to sleep.

534
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,480
Where do I find the time to act in a play?

535
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,510
Then, why did you help Qiaomu shoot a short film?

536
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,680
Keep your voice down.

537
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
I was forced into it.

538
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,750
I'll be the director this time. Aren't you going to do it for my sake?

539
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,730
You'll be the director?

540
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,300
Are you looking down on me?

541
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,500
I'll ask Sunian.

542
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,680
He won't act.

543
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
Sunian will definitely join.

544
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,113
I reject.

545
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,110
Why, Sunian?

546
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,400
I don't want to act.

547
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,130
You're so frank.

548
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,340
You don't even give me a reason.

549
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,620
Then, Grade 12 students are not allowed to participate.

550
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,130
You're not allowed to register. It's not that you can't participate in other shows.

551
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,860
Then...

552
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,200
I just don't want to act.

553
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,310
Told you.

554
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,000
Can I reject?

555
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,890
What's your reason?

556
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,580
I have to work at the supermarket.

557
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,630
So I don't have the time.

558
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:35,170
Shiyin, I have been abandoned by the whole world.

559
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,200
I only have you now.

560
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,980
I can't act.

561
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,000
What's your reason?

562
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,060
I'm doing the opening dance. It's very important. I don't have the time.

563
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,730
The audition hasn't started yet. Why are you doing the opening dance then?

564
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,930
We're the school's dance troupe. We're exempted from the audition.

565
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,180
What will you be dancing to then?

566
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,780
Revelry of Doomsday.

567
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,960
It's the school celebration. Why are you dancing to the Revelry of Doomsday?

568
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,450
It sounds great, isn't it?

569
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,880
Our choreographer has such a unique idea.

570
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,310
He returned from overseas. Handsome and mesmerizing.

571
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,440
Are you crazy?

572
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,740
Didn't you order a song dedicated to Wang Haoran?

573
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,490
Wang Haoran?

574
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,830
Wang Haoran was just someone I liked on a whim.

575
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,000
I've never spoken to him.

576
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,060
But I adore this teacher very much.

577
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,460
If you'd seen the way he danced, you'd definitely be fascinated by him.

578
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,240
Your enthusiasm only lasts three minutes.

579
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
After the dance, you'll change your target.

580
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,830
Join me in my play.

581
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,490
Art is what will be everlasting.

582
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,691
Am I a half-hearted person?

583
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,110
Yes, you are!

584
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,820
A bunch of traitors.

585
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,480
Xue, don't be angry.

586
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,450
I've been betrayed by the whole world!

587
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,400
No one is willing to act in my play!

588
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,000
I've registered and written half of the script!

589
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,890
If you need someone,

590
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,300
I...

591
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,790
I can join.

592
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,850
Really? Are you willing to act in it, really?

593
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,000
If you are, whether the male lead, the female lead,

594
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,200
the righteous party, or the villain, you can choose to play any role.

595
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,100
Just give me a minor role.

596
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,030
I'm... not presentable.

597
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,200
What are you talking about?

598
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Look at your big eyes and high nose bridge.

599
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Under the light after applying some makeup, you'll look stunning.

600
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,730
- Xue.
- What is it?

601
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,100
What about... I'm talking to my female lead.

602
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,280
- Actually, I can act...
- Aren't you going to dance to Doomsday or something?

603
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,550
Go ahead!

604
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,940
It's a deal then.

605
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,600
I'll write the script now.

606
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,240
Xue...

607
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,800
Jin Ning and Zheng had a row?

608
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,300
Impossible. We live next door.

609
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,700
Why didn't we hear any noise?

610
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,400
Keep your voice down.

611
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,000
Do they speak loudly like us?

612
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,600
I just noticed it.

613
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,600
The two crossed each other without speaking a word.

614
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,700
I don't believe they'd have a row.

615
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,400
Look.

616
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,100
I've known Jin Ning for over a decade.

617
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,000
She has never spoken harshly.

618
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Jing Ning is the apple of Zheng's eyes.

619
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,000
He loves her so much.

620
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
How could he have a row with her?

621
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Stop.

622
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,900
Ms. Jin, getting some water?

623
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Look. What did I tell you?

624
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,200
<i>[One week ago]</i>

625
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,000
<i>Jin Ning, dinner is ready.</i>

626
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,300
<i>Wait a minute. I'll be right there.</i>

627
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,800
<i>Let's have dinner first.</i>

628
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,820
<i>[A few days later]</i>

629
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
<i>You seldom eat on time.</i>

630
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,600
<i>It's bad for your stomach.</i>

631
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,200
<i>Let's have dinner first.</i>

632
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,500
<i>It's the climax.</i>

633
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,900
<i>Don't disturb me.</i>

634
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
<i>[Just one day ago]</i>

635
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,000
<i>Can you stop it for a while?</i>

636
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,700
<i>It's almost over.</i>

637
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,600
<i>Please. Can we have our dinner first?</i>

638
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,600
<i>It's the climax.</i>

639
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,600
<i>You always say so.</i>

640
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,100
<i>Have dinner first.</i>

641
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,380
<i>- Turn it on.
- No. Have dinner first.</i>

642
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,500
<i>If you don't, I won't eat.</i>

643
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,200
<i>You... Sunian!</i>

644
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
<i>Look at your mom. She...</i>

645
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,600
<i>- What have I done?
- You're being unreasonable.</i>

646
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
<i>I...</i>

647
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,600
<i>I'll check in the kitchen.</i>

648
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,000
<i>Be good.</i>

649
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,200
<i>Can we have dinner first?</i>

650
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,000
<i>How could you reproach me in front of our son?</i>

651
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
<i>He was just right here.</i>

652
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,800
<i>Apologize.</i>

653
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,700
<i>You're the unreasonable one and I need to apologize?</i>

654
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,600
<i>Why should I?</i>

655
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,600
<i>You've changed.</i>

656
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,800
<i>Aren't you going to console her?</i>

657
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,300
<i>No.</i>

658
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,000
<i>It's time to cure your mom's bad habit.</i>

659
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,600
<i>You have my admiration.</i>

660
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,200
It was a matter of having dinner or watching television.

661
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
What was there to argue about?

662
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,600
Dinner's ready.

663
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,900
We should eat when it's time for dinner.

664
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,600
Why must she watch the television?

665
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Couldn't she watch it after dinner?

666
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,600
No wonder you can't find a girlfriend.

667
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,400
You need to go along with women.

668
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,480
You women are so troublesome.

669
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Xue, I'm leaving.

670
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,600
I'll show you the completed script tomorrow.

671
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,500
- I...
- What is it?

672
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,900
I'm going to tailor-make a female lead role for you.

673
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,500
You... You're indeed going to let me play the female lead?

674
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Of course.

675
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,500
- I can't. I have stage fright.
- Stage fright?

676
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,000
I feel nervous on stage and can't say a word.

677
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,900
It's fine. I feel nervous on stage, too.

678
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,200
Just practice more.

679
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,000
Xue, I... I don't know how to put it.

680
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,900
But I'll embarrass you.

681
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,000
It's better not to choose me.

682
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
Sorry.

683
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
Tang Ya!

684
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,100
You're home.

685
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,200
Dad, where's Mom?

686
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,500
She's having dinner at Xue's home.

687
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,200
She's still mad?

688
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,400
It has gotten worse.

689
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,600
Jin Ning, eat up.

690
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,400
Here. Try this smoked tofu.

691
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,800
- Ms. Jin Ning.
- Thank you.

692
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,000
Why did you have a row with Mr. Zheng?

693
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Xue, are you full?

694
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I haven't even started.

695
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,500
No. We have different living habits.

696
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,800
That's how life is. Having a racket.

697
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
- That's the fun.
- That's right.

698
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Yes. Look at my mom and my dad.

699
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,600
They have so much fun every day.

700
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,200
Xue, we adults are talking.

701
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,400
Why do you interrupt?

702
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,900
Jin Ning is here.

703
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,500
Don't lecture our girl at dinner time.

704
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,100
Did I lecture her?

705
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,400
You... You didn't reproach her. But you reproached me.

706
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,600
No. You yelled at her. But you reproached me.

707
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,100
Did I?

708
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
Look, you deny it.

709
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,200
This is the way I talk.

710
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,800
Did I yell at her?

711
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,300
Isn't that yelling?

712
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,500
She barely came here for dinner. Yet you had to lecture our kid at the dinner table.

713
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,900
I know what you're up to!

714
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,400
Was class tiring today?

715
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,100
No.

716
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,700
Do you have a lot of homework?

717
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,600
No.

718
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
I...

719
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,600
Is the food salty?

720
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Dad, don't force it.

721
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
Sunian!

722
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,500
- Mr. Zheng.
- Xue.

723
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,800
You're still having dinner?

724
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,900
Almost done.

725
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,600
Have you had dinner? Join us. There's chicken.

726
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,800
I already had dinner.

727
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,500
Did Ms. Jin Ning eat well?

728
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,100
Yes.

729
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,200
That's good then.

730
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,100
Dad, I'm full.

731
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,400
- Let's go.
- We'll get going then.

732
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,700
- Bye, Mr. Zheng.
- Bye.

733
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,600
