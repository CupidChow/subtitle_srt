78

82

There's no water heater and no toilet.

83

Please accompany me.

86

Every time I go back, I'm always so unhappy.

87
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:04,714
My aunt doesn't talk to me.

88
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,334
My grandma's hearing isn't that good.

89
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,504

93
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,474
She's now at my house, talking to my mom.

94
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:23,965
She said, if you're willing to go, you can go.

95

102

It will be cold in the countryside.

103

Also, when you have a meal there,

104
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,964
don't eat how you always do at home.

105
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:55,834
It doesn't matter if you like the food or not, you must eat them.

106
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,964
Don't leave any leftovers, understand?

107
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:00,574

- You must eat more fruits, okay?
- Don't...

109
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,100
Mom! I'll be gone only for a few days.

110
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:09,034
Don't worry. I'll treat your daughter like mine.

111
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,084
- I'll take good care of her.
- Exactly.

112

I'm not worried.

113
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:15,795
It's just that my crazy daughter would behave wildly without me around her.

114
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:18,854
- Listen...
- Madam. I'll watch her.

115

- Enough, stop talking already.

118

It'll be dark if you keep talking.

119
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:27,674
What do you mean? It's still early.

120
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:28,864
It gets dark earlier during winter.

121
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:30,254
- Go now, Lin.
- Look at that kid.

122
00:07:30,255 --> 00:07:32,335
- Lin, hurry now.
- Xue, listen to me.

123
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:35,154
- Don't take off your sweater.
- Bye-bye.

124

126
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:46,064

128
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,715
You're not wary at all.

129
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
Were you hoping that I'd go so that you could enjoy yourself at home?

130
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:58,044
What are you doing?

131
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,015
There's a mosquito.

132
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,285
Why did I let her go?

133
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:20,655
Sunian, why are you still so bad at playing games?

134
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:24,145
I'll go home and study, then.

135
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:28,094
Why are you studying on your holiday? You must be crazy.

136
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,164
Don't go.

137
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,815
I'll feel lonely if you leave.

138
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,444
Don't worry. I won't abandon you.

139

141
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:46,094

- Exciting?

142
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:47,574

143

Don't tell anyone about this.

144
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,834
I don't think that's a good idea.

What do you think, Xue?

162
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:23,994
Does it feel like the house is hidden among the plants?

163
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:25,004
It looks awesome.

164
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:28,964
Our family wanted to book a tour group to a happy farmhouse just like this before.

165
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:32,954
- Luckily, you didn't join it. Otherwise, you would have regretted it.
- Mister.

166
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:35,300
Stop being sarcastic and carry these things.

167
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:36,764
Mom, I...

168
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:38,804
Your dad will get upset if you keep talking.

169
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,954
Behave.

170
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:41,574
I've told you to endure these couple of days.

171
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,534
Just two days.

172
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:43,764
Take this.

173
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:45,915
I said take it.

174
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,004
- Can you carry it, Xue?
- Yes.

175
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,334
Look how strong Xue is.

176
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,134
I won't be in your way, then.

177
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:54,364
I'll talk to you again.

178
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:56,144
- Lin.
- Give it to me.

179
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:58,204
- We're back.
- Carry on.

180
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:00,074
I'll see you later, Madam.

181
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,934
- Madam.
- Are you working on something?

182
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:04,384
- Mister and Madam, how are you?
- Hello, Mrs. Gao.

183
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,935
See you around. Come and visit, okay?

184
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:11,234
Aunt.

185
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:13,414
- Sister.
- You're back.

186
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:14,864
Happy New Year, Sister.

187
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:16,574
- Sister.
- You're back.

188
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,574
Didn't you say you'd arrive tonight?

189
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,334
Mom waits for us at the entrance of the village every time.

190
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:22,685
So I didn't tell her the correct time.

191
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:26,414
Sister, why are there so many people at home?

192
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:28,414
They've installed the toilet you sent.

193
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:29,614
They're looking at it.

194
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:30,934
Really?

195
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:33,624
- I'll check on Mom.
- She is inside.

196
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:36,544
We're going to have preserved radish for dinner.

197
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:37,320
It smells so good.

198
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,490
Mom, why are there so many people?

199
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:42,715
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

200
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:45,314
Two days ago, your dad installed a new toilet for your grandma.

201
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:46,934
- Don't just stand there.
- Come.

202
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:48,264
Why install a new toilet?

203
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,094
Why do you think we installed a new toilet?

204
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:51,274
Your grandma is old.

205
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:52,534
It's inconvenient for her to go to the toilet.

206
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:54,694
She has a hard time getting up and squatting.

207
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,844
Moreover, didn't you say

208
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:59,094
it's inconvenient not having a toilet here?

209
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,995
I'm not going to share a toilet with them.

210
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,845
Then, hold it in.

211
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:06,334
You're such a spoiled brat.

212
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:08,525
Why didn't you hold it in, then?

213
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,544
That sounds just like it!

214
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:16,954
Did I scare you? Xue, follow me.

215
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:19,454
I'll show you something nice.

216
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,414
This is the toilet the city folks use.

217
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:24,194
It's very convenient.

218
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,954
Mister, why don't you try and sit on it.

219
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,434
See how it feels.

220
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,195
Just sit.

221
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:33,095
Just sit, Mister. That's right.

222
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:36,595
- How does it feel? Is it comfortable?
- Yes, it is.

223
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:38,124
After you use it, just close the lid.

224
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,354
You're done after you flush it down with water.

225
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:42,524
This is great. Really nice.

226
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:45,315
My tooth!

227
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,514
- What happened?
- My tooth! I dropped it.

228
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:49,704
My tooth fell.

229
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:51,154
Your tooth fell.

230
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:52,564
It's all right.

231
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,335
Later, I'll find a way to get one for you.

232
00:12:57,725 --> 00:13:00,474
Shiyin, why didn't you join us?

233
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:02,614
An elderly dropped his fake tooth in the toilet just now.

234
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,214
It was hilarious.

235
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:05,764
I don't want to see those people.

236
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:08,025
They're just some country bumpkins.

237
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,335
Don't be mad.

238
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:13,475
Look! A goat.

239
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,475
Little cutie.

240
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,005
Come on.

241
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,574
- Xue.
- See how cute it is.

242
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,024
I asked you here to maintain a refined manner with me.

243
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:27,644
Why are you being a country bumpkin now?

244
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:29,484
The goats look refined, too.

245
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:32,865
See? It looks like Zhang Qi.

246
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:45,094
Here we are buying reference books after watching a movie.

247
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,334
Don't you think that's too much of a difference?

248
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:48,904
We need a proper balance between study and play.

249
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,624
If you don't study,

250
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:53,435
you'll rank at the bottom again next semester.

251
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:56,574
At worst, I'll just study overseas

252
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:58,535
and accompany Shao Xue.

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,364
<i>[IELTS Listening]</i>

254
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:05,294
Let's buy some reference books for Shao Xue to study abroad.

255
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:07,245
She'll definitely be happy.

256
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,965
I'll leave it to you.

257
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,355
What's wrong?

258
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:23,484
You don't want her to go?

259
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,315
Do you?

260
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:30,334
Hasn't she been nagging about going abroad?

261
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,135
But if she leaves...

262
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:39,815
Things won't be the same anymore.

263
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,365
Why?

264
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:44,115
She'll be further apart from us.

265
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,225
She'll have a new life and new friends.

266
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:53,994
I think you've studied too much that your brain is twisted.

267
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,484
Life changes every day.

268
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:01,604
But some things can't be replaced.

269
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:03,244
Take your dad, for instance.

270
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,814
A Rolex may look nice,

271
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,954
but he still prefers antique clocks.

272
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:09,434
The two of us are Shao Xue's antique clocks.

273
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:13,014
She may change her friends. Our position will never change.

274
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:17,604
- Are you that confident?
- Of course.

275
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:20,045
When you enter the university and make new friends,

276
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,835
does it change my position in your heart?

277
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,895
Sometimes the truth hurts.

278
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,615
You're just being stubborn.

279
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:32,374
Do you still remember the summer camp when we were kids?

280
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,334
We didn't see each other for only a month.

281
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:38,534
Someone kept asking my mom every day.

282
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,694
"Is Zhang Qi home yet?"

283
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,634
"Where on earth did Zhang Qi go?"

284
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,814
"When is Zhang Qi coming back?"

285
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:47,234
That's because you took my video game away.

286
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:49,764
I know you missed me. Don't be shy about it.

287
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:52,115
Just tell me if you miss me next time.

288
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:55,144
I'll say a few words, okay?

289
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:58,374
Today is Spring Festival.

Welcome!

- Cheers, Mom.
- Happy New Year!

- Stay healthy.
- Thank you.

296
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,219
Mom, have a seat.

297
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,240
Let's start eating.

298
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,619
- Shiyin, eat this.
- Let her do it herself.

299
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,339
Mom, don't serve her food.

300
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,760
She's already a grown-up.

301
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,530
I said, eat this meat.

302
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,240
I can't chew it. Eat this, Shiyin.

303
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,619
Grandma, I'm on a diet.

304
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,560
I don't eat meat.

305
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,439
Do you want fatty meat?

306
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,980
I'll get you some.

307
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,190
Just eat whatever your grandma gives you.

308
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,189
Shiyin's friend, have some meat too.

309
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,079

- Sure.

00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:05,969
Here you go. This was Mr. Lin's favorite dish when he was a kid.

- Thank you.
- Eat more.

314
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,289
It's delicious. Grandma, it's delicious.

315
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,740
Eat more if you like it.

316
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,119
You can eat it if she doesn't want it.

317

00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:39,870
To the art school?

325
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,560
Shiyin,

326
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,260
do you girls feel bored?

327
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,189
There are a lot of things at the market ahead.

328
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,980
I can show you around.

329
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,499
It's okay.

330
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:04,670
Okay, I'll take you later.

331
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,390
Grandma, we're not going.

332
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,209
- Have a candy.
- Thank you, Grandma.

333
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,850
Here's one for you.

334
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,950
Thank you.

335
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,670
I'm going to feed the chickens. You two carry on.

336
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,520
Let me help you, Madam.

337
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,010
Let me help you.

338
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,560
This young lady is so nice.

339
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,179
The chubby one is adorable.

340
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,159
This tall one is handsome.

341
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,359
This one has nothing special.

342
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,699
What do you mean by that?

343
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:15,509
Siyuan, didn't you say Mr. Sun had an assignment for us?

344
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:16,939
Yes.

345
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,169
Qiaomu wants to make a video for her graduation project.

346
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,000
Mr. Sun told me to help her out.

347
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,630
So I'm helping her.

348
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,129
So you lied to us.

349
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,129
No. Think about it.

350
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:30,419
If I can't graduate because of this,

351
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,729
I might not be able to continue working

352
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:34,040
at the Restoration Department anymore.

353
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,710
How do you want us to help you?

354
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,089
I want to make a short film about the national college entrance exam.

355
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,590
So I want to ask the three of you to act as high school students.

356
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,049
What's the content about?

357
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,869
This is what I have in mind for now.

358
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,499
In the first scene, it'll show you studying hard.

359
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,119
The second one will show you giving each other encouragement.

360
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,869
The third one would be you running with all your might.

361
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,219
During the post-editing,

362
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,669
I'll make a montage of these scenes

363
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,499
and show them as a whole picture of the college entrance exam.

364
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:00,370
What do you think?

365
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,940
Nothing new. Not interesting.

366
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,290
Not quite up there.

367
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,569
Whose idea is this?

368
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:12,030
Mine.

369
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,179
Actually, there's still room for improvement.

370
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,589
This is what we came up with after brainstorming for ten days.

371
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,949
Why don't you brainstorm again?

372
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,219
We're already running out of time.

373
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:26,090
If I don't shoot now, I can't submit it next week.

374
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,759
- Something came up at home.
- Something came up at home.

375
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,320
Stop right there.

376
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,510
Come on, guys.

377
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,979
Can't you take it as doing me a favor?

378
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:42,029
Moreover, Mr. Sun asked for this. Do it for Mr. Sun.

379
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:45,329
Do it for Bronzeware Restoration Division. Do it for China's cultural relics.

380
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,899
Am I right? For the great inheritance.

381
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:49,809
You guys need to improve your ideological awareness.

382
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,149
- We do have urgent matters.
- We do have urgent matters.

383
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,809
Stop right there!

384
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,430
No one is going anywhere before we finish the shoot today.

385
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,090
I tried to ask nicely, but you wouldn't listen.

386
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,330
Come on, guys.

387
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,560
Mr. Lin?

388
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,979
Aunt?

389
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:18,020
Ms. Ji Lan.

390
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,679
Shiyin, look! It's you!

391
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,559
Don't see it.

392
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,799
Shiyin, did you grow up at your grandma's house?

393
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,369
No.

394
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,770
I left when I was three years old.

395
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,830
I don't remember anymore.

396
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,759
Why did you keep these photos?

397
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,459
There are so many nice pictures. Why didn't you put them in the album?

398
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,429
You look pretty cute. Look.

399
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,260
See how happy you look.

400
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,519
Grandma, who took these pictures?

401
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,900
I did.

402
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,079
You know how to take pictures?

403
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,940
Wait here.

404
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,939
See this. You were chubby as a kid.

405
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,599
You look so adorable.

406
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,079
Stop looking at it. I looked ugly.

407
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,700
Turn it slowly. I'm not done looking at it.

408
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,189
Her dad bought this for me.

409
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:11,799
It's been so many years. Can you still use it?

410
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,259
Old cameras aren't your average camera.

411
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:14,359
Madam, sit here.

412
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,899
I'll take a picture of you.

413
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,959
Okay. Have a seat.

414
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,119
Don't take it. I didn't wash my hair yesterday. I won't look nice.

415
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,460
Camera, camera, tell me who's the world's fairest of all.

416
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,970
Of course, it's Shao Xue's friend, Lin Shiyin.

417
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,840
<i>Shoe repair!</i>

418
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,809
Change another pose.
<i>Shoe repair!</i>

419
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:42,130
Come in!

420
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,090
Grandma, if your shoes are spoiled, can't you just buy a new pair?

421
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,279
You want candy? It's on the table.

422
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,590
- Okay.
- You guys go ahead.

423
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,220
<i>["National College Entrance Exam Publicity Film"]</i>

424
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,799
There are only ten days left before the college entrance exam.

425
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,700
We'd rather do one more set of questions

426
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,519
than go to sleep.

427
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,530
We'd rather study more than eat.

428
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,799
I can't do it.

429
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,189
Don't think it like that.

430
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,709
This moment has finally come

431
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,149
after we persisted for three years.

432
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,570
Let's overcome this together.

433
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,799
I can't do it.

434
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,630
You said the wrong line.

435
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,940
I said I couldn't do this.

436
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,100
Stop rolling.

437
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,910
Sunian, the shoot is going to be over soon.

438
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,330
Qiaomu, do you want to graduate?

439
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,629
After you finish shooting this,

440
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,930
I don't think you can graduate.

441
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,430
Sunian, I don't want to shoot such empty words either.

442
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,700
Then, what else can you do when the subject is the national college entrance exam?

443
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,530
Tell me.

444
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,479
<i>I dreamed about a villain shooting hidden weapons at me with all his might.</i>

445
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,929
<i>The hidden weapons were mathematical formulas!</i>

446
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:12,810
I have one immature idea.

447
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,940
Tell me.

448
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,839
I think the national college entrance exam should be a battle,

449
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,080
not a publicity film.

450
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,799
What do you mean?

451
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,449
Have any of you watched any animation with a passion for justice?

452
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:28,560
For instance, Naruto.

453
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,460
Slam Dunk?

454
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,010
Saint Seiya?

455
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,310
<i>(Have you watched any of them?)</i>

456
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,060
How is this related?

457
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,389
Leave it to me, then.

458
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,800
Why are there photos stacked together here?

459
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,669
There's no space in the album. So it's all stacked up at the back.

460
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,730
Shiyin, this must be your grandma. Right?

461
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,090
She looks like a star of the Old Shanghai. She looks amazing.

462
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,149
Your grandma must be the daughter of a noble family.

463
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,900
She looks beautiful.

464
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,189
Mom, don't wait here.

465
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,150
I'll call you after he's done repairing them.

466
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,800
It's okay. Go back to what you're doing.

467
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,180
All done.

468
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,330
How much is it?

469
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,839
Three yuan.

470
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,709
Why is it so expensive? Give me some discounts.

471
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,599
It's the new year, so the price has increased.

472
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,039
How about two yuan?

473
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,610
All right.

474
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,440
It was only 50 cents two years ago.

475
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,970
Your grandma is so thrifty.

476
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,570
She can wear a pair of shoes for such a long time.

477
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,429
My dad said my grandpa died early.

478
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,330
To bring up my dad and my aunt,

479
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,700
my grandma lived frugally.

480
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,290
But her life is a lot better now.

481
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,380
But she's still so frugal.

482
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,549
Some habits are hard to get rid of once they are formed.

483
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:08,559
Take me, for instance.

484
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,050
If I don't eat meat for a day, I'll feel sick.

485
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,890
What's this?

486
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,030
Shiyin, look!

487
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,850
Look at these.

488
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,660
These are trinkets sold by some roadside booths.

489
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,220
They look pretty.

490
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,610
They are so old-fashioned.

491
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,709
That's because you've never seen my mom's jewelry box.

492
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,280
Do you like it?

493
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,999
Try it on.

494
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,390
It's okay, Grandma.

495
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,840
Try it. It looks lovely.

496
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,220
It's a rabbit. Were you born in the year of the rabbit?

497
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,370
If you don't wear it, I'll wear it, then.

498
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,880
I'll try it on.

499
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
Do I look cute?

500
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,469
Like the demon from Journey to the West.

501
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,860
Demons look pretty. How do they trap humans, otherwise?

502
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,470
Try it on.

503
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,750
You have nothing to lose anyway.

504
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,559
You look pretty.

505
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,140
So pretty.

506
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,770
Really?

507
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,360
Your grandma should wear one too.

508
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,389
Wear a bangle, Madam.

509
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,260
- I'm too old for this.
- Just wear one.

510
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,710
You see? It looks pretty, right?

511
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,640
Madam, let's take pictures.

512
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,189
Shiyin, take a photo.

513
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,759
Look at the camera. Three. Two. One.

514
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,230
Say cheese!

515
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,759
What kind of person am I in your eyes?

516
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,479
A high and mighty princess who needs to be cared for.

517
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:14,039
Actually, I wasn't like that before.

518
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,319
I arrived in Beijing when I was three.

519
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,359
At that time, other children bullied me

520
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,490
because I dressed like a country bumpkin.

521
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,359
My mom is a proud woman.

522
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,869
At that time, my family didn't make a lot of money.

523
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,999
But my mom still bought me very expensive clothes

524
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,760
to dress me up like a little princess.

525
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,770
When I entered primary school,

526
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,559
no one associated me with being a country bumpkin anymore.

527
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,770
I almost forgot all that had happened

528
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,389
when I was little.

529
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,400
But...

530
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,470
I remember I was pretty happy

531
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,840
while I was here.

532
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,480
Grandma dotes on me and lets me do whatever I want.

533
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,460
Everyone here treats me like a little princess.

534
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,870
But I'm scared people know

535
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,260
that I grew up in the countryside.

536
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,799
I'm terrified they'll find out

537
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,670
that I have a bunch of country bumpkins as relatives.

538
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,090
I'm afraid they wouldn't flatter me

539
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,950
after they've found out.

540
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,709
I'm afraid they'll call me a country bumpkin

541
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,060
and bully me like those people in the past.

542
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,450
So I forced myself to forget the people and my past here.

543
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,469
I remember when I had just arrived in Beijing,

544
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,800
my grandma and aunt always wrote letters to me.

545
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,050
But they stopped writing

546
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,420
because I never replied to them.

547
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,500
I just feel it's a disgrace

548
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
to keep in touch with them.

549
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,530
Actually, I find my mom to be embarrassing, too.

550
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,429
I can make trouble and quarrel with her.

551
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,099
But I mustn't hurt her because I know how much she loves me.

552
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,230
We mustn't hurt those who love us. Am I right?

553
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,459
Today, I saw you help my grandma feed the chickens and take pictures.

554
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:34,510
I suddenly feel it's not embarrassing anymore

555
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,270
because you looked happy and enjoyed yourself.

556
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,920
But I've trapped myself.

557
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,770
I no longer know how to get close to them.

558
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,190
How about...

559
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,660
How about we sleep first?

560
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,609
I'm so sleepy. Let's sleep.

561
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:59,629
We'll talk about this after we wake up tomorrow. Let's sleep now.

562
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,079
Fine, go to sleep.

563
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,799
Silly girl.

564
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,470
My mom called me that, too.

565
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,470
But I know she loves me.

566
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,900
So you must believe your grandma, your aunt,

567
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,490
and the people who love us.

568
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,160
They're willing to give us a chance.

569
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,750
I know that.

570
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,370
Xue, visit us if you have time.

571
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,810
Take care, Madam.

572
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,839
Mom, it's cold outside. Go back inside.

573
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,040
It's okay.

574
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,370
No, Grandma. I can't accept this.

575
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,460
Madam, I can't take this.

576
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,909
- I can't.
- Just take it.

577
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,670
See you, Madam.

578
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,019
- Mom.
- Grandma, keep it.

579
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:10,429
Keep it for yourself.

580
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,620
Shiyin has an allowance.

581
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,759
That's not the same.

582
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,059
- Take it.
- Grandma, I can't accept it.

583
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,980
Take it.

584
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,850
You must buy new shoes for the new year.

585
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,180
You won't like the ones I pick.

586
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,600
So go and buy a pair yourself.

587
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,599
Mom, we'll get going then.

588
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,429
Take care, okay?

589
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:35,119
- Let's get going now.
- Have a safe trip.

590
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,020
Sister, take good care of Mom and yourself, okay?

591
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,020
Thank you, Grandma.

592
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,950
Grandma, see you.

593
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,239
Shiyin's grandma and aunt, goodbye!

594
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,000
Bye-bye.

595
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,889
Go home, Mom.

596
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,920
Drive safely.

597
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,199
Drive safely.

598
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,170
Shiyin, how much did your grandma give you?

599
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,270
<i>[May you be happy and prosperous]</i>

600
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,719
Five hundred.

601
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,340
That much?

602
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,710
Shiyin, do you know

603
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,830
what this 500 yuan means to your grandma?

604
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,790
This is your grandma's expenses for months.

605
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,790
Mom, let's go back inside.

606
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,820
Let me see them longer.

607
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,820
Xiaohong! Xiaohong!

608
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,190
Grandma.

609
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,320
Grandma.

610
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:12,849
Grandma, I'll visit you and call you often.

611
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:16,219
If you want to eat anything, just call me.

612
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,049
I'll make it for you.

613
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:20,950
I like everything that you cook for me.

614
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:26,680
Grandma, when you come to Beijing,

615
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,909
I'll take you out to buy

616
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:32,220
the most beautiful shoes in Beijing.

617
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,989
You're the kindest.

618
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,619
Aunt, you must come with Grandma.

619
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,779
Okay, we will.

620
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,550
Go now. It's not safe when it gets dark.

621
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,939
You must visit me. Don't lie to me.

622
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:50,840
Okay.

623
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,330
Aunt, Grandma, see you.

624
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,140
We'll get going now.

625
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,770
Shiyin.

626
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,620
Shiyin?

627
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,930
So your name is Lin Xiaohong?

628
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,160
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

629
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,930
Xue,

630
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,260
thank you for accompanying me.

631
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,199
Next year, I'll come with you again to visit your grandma.

632
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,909
It's only been several days, and you already miss Xue?

633
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,360
I don't.

634
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,580
Aren't you drawing her?

635
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,239
No. It looks similar, that's all.

636
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,700
How stubborn.

637
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,950
Just like your dad back then.

638
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,630
Mom.

639
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,920
You used to live overseas.

640
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,240
Is it really interesting...

641
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,980
out there?

642
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,300
Of course, it's interesting.

643
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,259
I was still studying at the time.

644
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:29,740
I often talked about art and dreams with others.

645
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,260
We'd plan to watch the sunrise today.

646
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,780
The next day, we'd go to the wheat field.

647
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,469
We had no troubles or worries.

648
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,800
Why did you return then?

649
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,269
I have someone I care about.

650
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:50,830
Anywhere without this person, I just can't stay.

651
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,630
Then, if someone you care about is next to you,

652
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,590
does that mean there's no need to go overseas?

653
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,599
Not necessarily.

654
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,759
Those who have dreams will only come back

655
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,519
after seeing the wonderful world outside.

656
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,430
Only then will they feel content.

657
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,900
Don't worry. If it's yours, it'll be yours eventually.

658
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,259
Shiyin's grandma made this fermented bean paste.

659
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:48,749
I know this. These are dried bamboo shoots.

660
00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:50,450
My mother-in-law dried all these.

661
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,449
She told me to share it with everyone here.

662
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,529
- Really?
- Yes.

663
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:55,739
Zheng said it's delicious if we stew meat with it.

664
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,879
It's tastier after marinating it overnight.

665
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,879
- That's great. So much delicious food.
- Right.

666
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,550
If there's a chance, we'll go back with you.

667
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,769
That's a must. It's a deal, then.

668
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:05,999
We'll go back together for the coming new year. Okay?

669
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:07,449
Okay, it's decided, then.

670
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,029
That's great.

671
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:10,140
Is that place fun?

672
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,350
Of course, it's fun.

673
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,289
There are many little animals except you.

674
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,239
Is it that fun? I'm going next time.

675
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,420
They might feel reluctant to bring you along.

676
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,390
- Ms. Jin Ning, where's Sunian?
- He's at home.

677
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,819
By the way, he said he has something for you.

678
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,580
Really? I'll go and see him then.

679
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,740
I'm coming, too.

680
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,559
Wait, wait. I'm packing up some food for your mom. Wait for a while.

681
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,270
- I'll pack some more.
- Yes.

682
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,169
- Give these to your mom.
- Bring it for Zhang Ling.

683
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,029
That's too much.

684
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:36,090
Take more.

685
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,969
Sunian! Sunian!

686
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:44,790
Sunian!

687
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,520
Sunian, what is it that you want to give me?

688
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,840
It's cold outside. Come in.

689
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,140
Sunian, what do you want to give me?

690
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,870
What are these?

691
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,030
Improve English Conversation, the method of writing composition,

692
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,640
and IELTS question bank for your level.

693
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,030
Sunian, you're too kind.

694
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,300
I always couldn't decide which to buy.

695
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm not that kind.

696
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,840
Actually, I hope you won't make it overseas.

697
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,680
Do you know my favorite place?

698
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,470
The Forbidden City.

699
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,440
Why do I like it then?

700
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,840
I don't know.

701
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,990
Because it'll never change.

702
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,869
At least, while I'm still alive.

703
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:56,030
Not only that, it won't change for hundreds of years.

704
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,449
You're right. As time changes,

705
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:05,209
only the Forbidden City seems to have a "pause" button pressed inside.

706
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:10,389
We can take the time to experience everything without having to rush.

707
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,220
I don't get it.

708
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,349
But I think the people in the image here

709
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,469
are like you, our parents, Mr. Sun,

710
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:22,420
and Mr. Luo as well.

711
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
But you're not like them.

712
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,909
You always say that you want to see the bigger world.

713
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,479
I'd often have this selfish thought.

714
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,490
"I hope that you won't be able to go

715
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,360
and stay here forever."

716
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,930
But your dream to explore the world

717
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,640
should be the same as me wanting to be still.

718
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,950
If it's not fulfilled, it'll be very sad.

719
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,049
I don't want you to feel sad.

720
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:04,540
I hope you can be happy like always.

721
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Sunian, are you afraid I might forget you if I leave?

722
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:28,150
