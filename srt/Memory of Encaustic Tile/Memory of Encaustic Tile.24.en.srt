But what will you do if your health fails you?

Yunsheng.

243

Why did you call him here?

248
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,940
I said I would drive you back, didn't I?

But you have a girlfriend.

262
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:24,015
You should be more mindful.

263
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:28,575
She's a rich young lady.

264
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:31,195
It was just on a whim.

265
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,555
She wants to keep up appearances.

266
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,615
I want connections.

267
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:41,495
It's the perfect deal for both of us.

268
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:47,695
All right. The dorms have an earlier curfew during the holidays.

269
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:50,175

275
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,245
Three years.

276
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:12,765
Within three years, I'll buy it.

281
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:31,035
In the meantime, let's go back to our dorm for the night. All right?

<i>Has Yunsheng... been going out drinking a lot lately?</i>

00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:44,755
<i>I haven't been able to reach him lately.</i>

306
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,925
<i>I'm worried about him.</i>

307
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:51,735
<i>Before he went to Beijing, he was a simple guy.</i>

308
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:53,765
<i>He loved drawing.</i>

309
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,675
<i>He loved designing.</i>

310
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,645
<i>But now...</i>

311
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:58,995
<i>I feel like he has changed.</i>

312
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:00,985
Yunjin.

313
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,565
Yunjin...

314
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:08,125
I'll bring you here and give you the best life.

315
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:22,385
Don't worry... Yunsheng will never change.

316
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,775
<i>Thank you, Sunian.</i>

317
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:27,825
<i>I won't take up any more of your time then. Goodbye.</i>

318
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,375
Mom. Dad. I'm off!

319
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,745
I'm going to study in Beijing.

320
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,305
Not the Arctic.

321
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:16,755
Two suitcases?

322
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,125
That's right.

323
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,705
Besides, her university is only 12 stops away from our house by bus.

324
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,365
Just go and visit her when you miss her.

325
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:27,325

Why are there noises over there? It's noisy.

490
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm still busy here.

491
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,300
I borrowed my classmate's phone to call you. I was afraid you'd be asleep later.

492
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,000
I want to ask if you've eaten the spiced beef I gave you last time.

493
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,400
<i>Yes. I even gave some to my classmates.</i>

494
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,200
Did you give some to Sunian?

495
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,500
I forgot it. I haven't seen him for a while.

496
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,300
Well, you little brat.

497
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,400
You shouldn't forget your old friends

498
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,200
even though you've got some new ones.

499
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
By the way, Mom.

500
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,600
Do you remember Mo Hai I once mentioned to you?

501
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,200
Who?

502
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
I remember.

503
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,400
The excellent kid, right?

504
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,800
<i>Yes, that's him.</i>

505
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,700
He's the head of our school's public relations department.

506
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,600
He took me into the department, too.

507
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,800
We receive foreign guests every day.

508
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,000
There are many practical opportunities.

509
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,900
That's great. You should practice English more.

510
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,400
The more you practice, the more fluent your English will become.

511
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,300
Can you film yourself speaking English sometimes?

512
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,800
<i>So I can show it to our neighbors.</i>

513
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,500
There's nothing to be shown.

514
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,600
<i>Let's not show off and keep a low profile.</i>

515
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,000
<i>You're right.</i>

516
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,600
Okay. Right. Keep a low profile.

517
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,400
Xue, come over here.

518
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,600
<i>[Students' Union]</i>
Take a look at tomorrow's activity plan.

519
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Mom, I'll talk to you later.

520
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm hanging up. Bye.

521
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Talk to your dad?

522
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,400
Okay. I'll pass it to him.

523
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,000
Well, this girl.

524
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,400
She hung up earlier than me.

525
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,600
I didn't expect it.

526
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,000
It's not my fault.

527
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
Soak your feet.

528
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,600
Come on.

529
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,800
Enjoy it yourself.

530
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,500
Getting angry?

531
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,000
I'll enjoy it myself then.

532
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,700
Three, two, one. It's done.

533
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,400
Hurry up.

534
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,400
It's hot.

535
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,700
"How annoying.

536
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,900
I miss her. But she doesn't miss me.

537
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,600
My dear sister. Did you fall for someone else?"

538
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,100
Hey, my noodles.

539
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,000
It serves you right.

540
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,100
Did you see it?

541
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,800
Someone didn't contact him. So he took it out on me.

542
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,000
Because you were too mean.

543
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,600
How long has it been since your neighbor contacted you?

544
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,000
How many times have you met her since school started?

545
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
She's busy studying.

546
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,200
S-Sunian.

547
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,400
Even I don't believe what you said.

548
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
You are meaner than me.

549
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,300
I'm afraid I'll bother her. So I don't contact her.

550
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,400
Maybe she thinks I'm busy.

551
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,200
Contact her then.

552
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,400
See if you can still contact her.

553
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,100
Did you get through?

554
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,800
<i>Hello, who's calling?</i>

555
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,300
Hello. I'd like to talk to Shao Xue.

556
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,800
<i>She hasn't come back yet.</i>

557
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,400
What?

558
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,000
It's so late and she's still outside?

559
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,600
<i>There are many activities for the students' union. Recently, she's been coming back late.</i>

560
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,300
Students' union?

561
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

562
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,000
No. Thank you.

563
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,800
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

564
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,000
Did you get in touch with her?

565
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
She's busy with the activities of the students' union.

566
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,800
Oh, no.

567
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,000
What's with that reaction?

568
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's the students' union.

569
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,900
That's a big-scale blind date site.

570
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
Take a look if you don't believe it.

571
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,600
Your neighbor is now staring at stars

572
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,700
and the moon with her beloved senior

573
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,600
just like Romeo and Julia.

574
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,000
They talk about everything.

575
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,700
It should be Romeo and Juliet.

576
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,600
Come on, that's not the point.

577
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,400
Do you know what the point is?

578
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,200
If the senior shows his affection, there'll be no place for Sunian.

579
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Listen to me. If you don't want to go—

580
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,600
How can I go there at this late hour?

581
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,600
I'll go tomorrow.

582
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
That's right!

583
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,600
Let me tell you.

584
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,000
You might make a fool of yourself if you fight alone.

585
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,600
Yunsheng, go with him tomorrow.
<i> [To The Best Person in The World, From Shao Xue]</i>

586
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
What about you?

587
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
There will be an activity at the students' union tomorrow.

588
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,800
I need to take care of some girls.

589
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
Dismiss.

590
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,900
I asked. Shao Xue isn't here.

591
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,800
Her roommate asked you to look for her at the students' union.

592
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Thank you.

593
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,600
Don't mention it.

594
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Sunian, why did you come here?

595
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
I've been calling your dorm these two days,

596
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,200
but you were away.

597
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,800
We've been quite busy at the students' union in the past two days.

598
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
I go out early and come back late.

599
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,100
- So you were with him this entire time?
- Yes.

600
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,000
An exchange student group came to our school.

601
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
We planned a very big welcome party

602
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,800
and rehearsed a comedic version of "Titanic."

603
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,000
Don't tell me that you're playing Rose while he is playing Jack.

604
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,200
Yes. That's right.

605
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,500
No way.

606
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,000
Why not?

607
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,100
You...

608
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,800
You can't swim.

609
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,300
This is a play.

610
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,100
There's no need to swim.

611
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,800
Continue the conversation without me. I'm going up to change.

612
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,000
Why do you need to change?

613
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I have to dress up. I can't embarrass my senior.

614
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,700
Why don't I show you around?

615
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,000
No need.

616
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,000
Both of you haven't eaten yet, right? Let me treat you.

617
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,800
Not hungry.

618
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,000
Let me buy you some drinks.

619
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,200
- Not thirsty.
- Not thirsty.

620
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Where's your event today?

621
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,200
I want to take a look as well.

622
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,800
Sorry. This is an internal activity.

623
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,100
Well... It's not right for an outsider to be there.

624
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,900
Who is an outsider?

625
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,000
Both of them are childhood friends.

626
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600
Know your place.

627
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
<i>[Girls' Dorm]</i>

628
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,200
I'm done. So? How do I look?

629
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,000
- Stunning!
- Stunning!

630
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,800
The weather is cold. You are wearing too little.

631
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,000
I wore it for the event.

632
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,200
We'll be leaving then.

633
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,500
Xue.

634
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,400
Let me pick you up when it's over.

635
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,000
No need. We will come back together in a group.

636
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Don't worry. I will escort her to the dorm's entrance safely.

637
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm going. Bye.

638
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,200
Oh, Sunian.

639
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,200
There's a nice restaurant selling beef near the entrance. Go and try it.

640
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,500
Bye.

641
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Sunian, it's over.

642
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,700
Our experience in love is definitely not enough.

643
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,800
We need Pei Shu's help.

644
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,500
Look at you guys.

645
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,800
Can't you do anything without me?

646
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,300
Now that I'm here. Let's go.

647
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,600
Xue didn't ask me to come.

648
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,400
You won't come because she didn't ask you to come?

649
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,600
They are both in the "Titanic" play.

650
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,500
The portrait scene will come later.

651
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,200
Stop hesitating.

652
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,500
The more you hesitate, the more she'll be taken advantage of.

653
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

654
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,800
- What's wrong?
- Well, I... I should...

655
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,100
Come on. What are you afraid of?

656
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm here. Sunian, don't worry.

657
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,000
This Mo Hai is just a normal pervert at most.

658
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,100
All his tricks are outdated.

659
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,400
Hey... Stop pulling me.

660
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,900
I'm very angry now.

661
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,800
Sunian, don't worry.

662
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,500
I know all his tricks well.

663
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
He pretends to be the nice guy

664
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,400
and tries to approach her when they are close.

665
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,000
Holding her hands, her waist,

666
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,700
and even play a role in "Titanic" together.

667
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,200
Nonsense!

668
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,100
Sorry, bro.

669
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,400
Don't you think I'm right?

670
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,500
I'm talking to you two. What are you doing?

671
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,200
Sunian, there's no need to worry.

672
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Think about it. From past to present, all the beautiful love stories

673
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,700
are made more touching due to the existence of a villain. Right?

674
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,600
If you can see things that way, you can think of Mo Hai as that guy.

675
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,400
What... What's his name?

676
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,800
Fahai. Yes.

677
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
Think of him as Fahai.

678
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
If you think like that, your relationship with Shao Xue will reach a whole new level.

679
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,300
What a soul-stirring story.

680
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,000
Am I right?

681
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,200
Hello.

682
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,900
I'm the Fahai you speak of.

683
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,200
Who?

684
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,600
Fahai.

685
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,800
The three of you come all the way here just to badmouth people?

686
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,300
Xue, I'm not sure if I should say this.

687
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,200
Don't say it then.

688
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
A man who complains to girls definitely has a bad character.

689
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
What about men who speak ill of others behind their backs?

690
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
We said it in front of him.

691
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
Report.

692
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,000
I told him that.

693
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,300
He said more, but Sunian didn't say a thing.

694
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,700
I don't want to talk to you. I want to hear it from him.

695
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,500
Well... Have a good chat.

696
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,200
Have a good chat.

697
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,200
Speak up, Zheng Sunian!

698
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,800
Why are you calling my full name?

699
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,200
♫ <i>As I traverse this path without minding it</i> ♫

♫ <i>Using this song, this song belongs to us</i> ♫
