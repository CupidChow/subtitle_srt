- Be kind to him.
- Okay.

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,400
Welcome.

67
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
All right. Get back to work.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,300
Look. This is your desk.

69
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,200

Have you reached the Restoration Department?

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,400

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I should call you Mr. Sunian now.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,200
No, I have money.

102
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Why don't you treat me to some good food?

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
Figure out what you want to have then.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, let me think about it.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,300
I'll let you know when I see you tonight.

How is your speech preparation going?

111
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,800
Do you have the confidence to get first place?

112
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Well, I'm well-prepared.

113
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,300
But I dare not imagine getting first place.

114

123
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Your son is now your colleague.

124
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
How does that feel?

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,300
Shao Hua.

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,300
Shao Hua, my co-worker.

127
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,600
Who told you to take the breakfast from my table?

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,300
There are two portions.

129
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,900
I wanted to have one and take one to work.

130
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,400
We're not living together soon.

131
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Start treating yourself as an outsider.

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,100
Don't touch my things.

133
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,000
Knock it off, will you?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
Stop acting crazy.

135
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Hey, what's going on?

136
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,400
You saw it, didn't you?

137
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Your son is now your colleague.

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
My wife is now my co-worker.

139
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,200
What did I do to deserve this?

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Just go over and cheer her up.

141
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
What for?

142
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,300
I did nothing wrong.

143
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,700
I won't let her have it her way!

144
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,300
What happened this time?

145
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
It's such a big house.

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
It's filled with her stuff.

147
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,300
I have only two small drawers.

148
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,800
Even that, she tried to find fault with me.

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
You can't imagine how messy his drawers are.

150
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
It's a pain in the neck.

151
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
I only meant well

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,700
and helped to clean it up for him.

153
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,600
But he said his stuff had gone missing.

154
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,100
He came yelling at me and gave me attitude.

155
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,800
I was through with things.

156
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,300
How much is his junk worth? So what if they go missing?

157
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,800
She lost my things and said I was collecting junk.

158
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
He said I was a junk collector.

159
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,900
It's not like he doesn't know that I love collecting fabrics?

160
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Some clothes are old,

161
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,800
but the material is still good.

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,900
So I took them apart, sterilized them,

163
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,100
and sewed them up.

164
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,000
Isn't that another set of brand-new clothes?

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
What's wrong with that?

166
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
Even if I take those parts

167
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,600
and put them all over the table,

168
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
it won't be laden with them.

169
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
She gets two large wardrobes for herself.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Can't I have two small drawers?

171
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,100
But your drawers aren't small.

172
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,200
Whose side are you on?

173
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
I...

174
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
If this happened to you, you'd be mad too.

175
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
Those things in the drawers were all my precious babies.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
I braved the wind and snow and got them

177
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
one by one from the flea market over the years.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Many of them were vintage items.

179
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,600
Look what she's done. Out of rage, she slammed my drawers

180
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,800
and threw everything on the floor.

181
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,600
Those small parts fell all over the place.

182
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,300
How am I to find them?

183
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,700
That's too much. Those parts are innocent.

184
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,300
- Right?
-That's right.

185
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,800
I didn't mean it.

186
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you know how heavy his drawer is?

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,300
It's filled with junk.

188
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,600
It slipped out of my hand and fell on the floor.

189
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
I felt bad at that time.

190
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,200
I wanted to apologize to him.

191
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,800
But he came arguing with me.

192
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,000
He dug out all the fabrics and threw them on the floor.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,300
He wanted to cut them with scissors.

194
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,200
So I said, "Try cutting them."

195
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Well, did you cut them or did you not?

196
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Of course...

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,200
"If you cut them, I'll fight you till the end!"

198
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
I dare not cut them.

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,200
She's a tigress, perfectly in one piece.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
I'm no Wu Song.
<i>(A tiger-fighting hero in the novel "Water Margin")</i>

201
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,100
I wouldn't dare to mess with her.

202
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,300
So, in the end, you put them back?

203
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,400
I can't look bad though.

204
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,800
What I did was... Pah!

205
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,600
I threw them on the floor.

206
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,300
That, and she got mad again.

207
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,800
She started coming at me and scratched me with her claws.

208
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Then?

209
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
So we fought.

210
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,400
Look! We've lived together for over a decade.

211
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
You can't imagine this.

212
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,000
He said things that were so nasty.

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Look. If you want to know how a man feels about you,

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,900
watch how he is when he fights with you.

215
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,300
You won't know if you don't fight.

216
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,200
But once you do, you can see him for who he really is.

217
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
He held it in all this time.

218
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Do you know what he said about me?

219
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,600
Take a guess.

220
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,500
He called me a tigress

221
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
and said that I'm uncultured

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,300
and that I took away his human rights.

223
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't laugh. He even called me the Queen of Junk.

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So I had enough.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
"I'm a junk collector." "Don't be with me then!"

226
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,900
- "Let's get a divorce!"
- Fine!

227
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,000
Who's afraid of her?

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm sick of this trick.

229
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,200
She wanted to break up with me when we were young.

230
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
Now that we're older, she is asking for a divorce.

231
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
So be it.

232
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,000
It's not like we can't live without each other.

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
Yes, get a divorce.

234
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,300
I know someone in the Civil Affairs Bureau.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,800
Putting a rush, are you?

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Divorce?

237
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,700
Our girl is so big now.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,700
<i>Hello!</i>

239
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,800
My daddy! Mommy!

240
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
Why are you back?

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
Well, I miss you guys.

242
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,600
Your mom must have given you a scare.

243
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Where's Mom?

244
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,800
She went visiting as soon as she got off work.

245
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,700
She said the sight of me made her feel irritated.

246
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,400
It's more serious than I thought.

247
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,800
I bet she's going through menopause.

248
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I thought the same.

249
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,700
Well, Mr. Shao.

250
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,400
Since she's going through menopause,

251
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
you need to be steady.

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Why pick fights with her?

253
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
There's no point even if I back down now.

254
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,300
She alone can pick fights for two.

255
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,400
You should know how Ms. Yu is.

256
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,000
She can get angry, but she won't cool herself off.

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,900
You need to cheer her up.

258
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,800
What about my anger?

259
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Her pile of junk takes up two large wardrobes.

260
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Why don't I have any right to have two small drawers?

261
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,700
Whatever it is, I'm in the right.

262
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,300
So what if you're in the right?

263
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
Can it keep you fed or can you spend it?

264
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,800
If your wife runs away, are you going to live with "right"?

265
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,400
Besides, how can you say that she has a wardrobe full of junk?

266
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
How many clothes has she made for us out of those rags?

267
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,800
Have you bought any clothes over the years?

268
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
It feels great wearing them, doesn't it?

269
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,500
Look. Who among the men around you

270
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,000
dresses better than you?

271
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,700
Mr. Shao,

272
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,100
we should be grateful, should we not?

273
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,999
You tried to talk me out of it.

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,400
Why didn't you do the same with your mom?

275
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,500
To win a hard battle, we have to start with the less tricky one.

276
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,900
You taught me that.

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All right. No instant noodles then.

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,200
I'll take you out to have a good meal.

279
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,100
No. I asked Sunian to go shopping with me.

280
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,400
Shopping?

281
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,300
There's a speech contest in the college.

282
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,400
A lot of leaders of big corporations are coming.

283
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,700
I need to get prepared.

284
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,400
Be well-prepared then.

285
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,300
You might get into a Fortune 500 company.

286
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,200
Right?

287
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

288
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Keep it up!

289
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,100
Bye, Daddy!

290
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,000
Look! The girls here are so pretty.

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,300
It would be great if I could find someone like them to be my girlfriend.

292
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,700
- What are we having?
- Why are you laughing?

293
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,000
- Let's have noodles.
- Don't you want it?
- Okay.

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
- Sure.
- Come on.

295
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Shiyin?

296
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,500
Hi.

297
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,700
- This is...
- Do you know her?

298
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,700
He's my high school classmate.

299
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,500
Go ahead. I'll join you, girls, later.

300
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,600
- Okay.
- We'll go there first.

301
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
Okay.

302
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,000
Well. I'll get going.

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
I'll leave you two to talk.

304
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,300
<i>[Shunda Express Logistics Company]</i>

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

306
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
It was a last-minute decision to help my colleague out.

307
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,600
What's the matter? Are you mad?

308
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,100
No.

309
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,900
You're lying.

310
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,509
Shiyin,

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,800
do you not want others

312
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,000
to know about us?

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,500
No.

314
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,900
No.

315
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Have you eaten? Are you hungry?

316
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,400
I haven't eaten.

317
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,600
Join us then.

318
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,000
Forget it.

319
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,100
I'll take you to have some good food and go shopping for new clothes.

320
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,500
Come on.

321
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,400
Why are they also here?

322
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,100
They wanted to celebrate my first day of internship.

323
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
Go on and shop.

324
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't mind us.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,700
Do you have things to do?

326
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,200
If you have things to do, you can get to it.

327
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Not at all. We're free.

328
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Our main task today is to keep you both company.

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,700
Actually, I have things to do.

330
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:41,169
Xue, here's the thing.

331
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,400
I want to buy a dress for Yunjin.

332
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,800
You two have the same build.

333
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm thinking of asking for your help to try on a dress for me.

334
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,100
That's it? You should have said so.

335
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,400
Pick whichever you want. I'll try it for you.

336
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,600
The one I wanted to buy is at the store downstairs.

337
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
Luxury goods, huh?

338
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,500
If you want, I can buy one for you.

339
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,600
No.

340
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,800
We just started our internships. Let's not be smug.

341
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,200
Come on. Let's go.

342
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
How is it? The food is good, right?

343
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,600
Not bad.

344
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,000
But let's not come here next time.

345
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,400
Why? I love eating steak.

346
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,500
How much is a steak in the supermarket?

347
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,600
I can cook for you, and we can have it at my place.

348
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
But you don't even have a pan for frying steak at home.

349
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
We can go to your place.

350
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,400
What if my parents see you?

351
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Oh, right.

352
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,200
The rehearsal you told me about before.

353
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,600
When's the play?

354
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,400
About that.

355
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,200
The play is over.

356
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,000
Why didn't you tell me?

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,700
I even ordered flowers.

358
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,300
Quickly cancel them.

359
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,000
It was suddenly brought forward.

360
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
It caught me by surprise, too.

361
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,400
Next time then.

362
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
I'll take you there next time.

363
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,300
I've freed up my schedule for tomorrow to spend the day with you.

364
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
But I need to work overtime tomorrow.

365
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Again?

366
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
The regional manager is coming to do an inspection.

367
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
If I perform well, I might have a chance.

368
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,200
What chance could you possibly have?

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,500
So? What do you think?

370
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,600
Is it too revealing?

371
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Are you cold?

372
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,100
Yes.

373
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,000
It's revealing then.

374
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,800
This theory does seem to make sense.

375
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
What do you think?

376
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Should I try a few more?

377
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,400
This will do. Thank you.

378
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll get changed then.

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,800
Why didn't you ask me along?

380
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm so tired.

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You seemed to be having so much fun.

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So we didn't want to disturb you.

383
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
When are we eating?

384
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,300
I came for this meal.

385
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,700
Hello?

386
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,190
Oh.

387
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,800
Okay.

388
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,400
I know. I'll be there soon.

389
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
Who is it?

390
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,600
Xuening.

391
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,000
She wants me to go shopping with her.

392
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,700
Hey.

393
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,400
Not buying the dress for Yunjin anymore?

394
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,100
I'm buying.

395
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,400
I'm going to make the payment.

396
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,000
Please bring it back for me.

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
I'll get going now.

398
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,700
You're really something.

399
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
Only the two of you?

400
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
Where is he?

401
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,200
He's going shopping with another girl.

402
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,800
Isn't Yunjin out of town?

403
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,400
Don't ask.

404
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
See anything you like?

405
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,300
No. It's expensive, ugly, and uncomfortable.

406
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,000
Come on. Let's go and eat.

407
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,400
Come on.

408
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,000
This is nice.

409
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
♪ The big windmill keeps spinning ♪

410
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,400
♪ With a bunch of happy friends ♪

411
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
Where are my friends?

412
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,200
- Dad, what are you doing this early?
- Hush.

413
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
What is it?

414
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,400
Keep your voice down.

415
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,000
Your mom is getting out of control.

416
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
I've been trying to curry favor with her all night,

417
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
but she wouldn't buy it.

418
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Did you do the right thing?

419
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,800
I... served her drinks and gave her a leg massage.

420
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
It didn't work.

421
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
These are getting old.

422
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,500
You need to try something new.

423
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,100
Something new?

424
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Any woman will concede defeat before this.

425
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,600
Romance.

426
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,900
Romance?

427
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,800
Where are you going?

428
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,500
I'll show her romance.

429
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,000
Go back to bed.

430
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
Enough sleeping for me.

431
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,700
I need to get ready.

432
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,000
I have an English speech contest to attend.

433
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,300
Okay.

434
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
- Keep it up.
- Keep it up.

435
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Stupid old man.

436
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,200
Where did he go so early in the morning?

437
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,489
<i>My wife, I was wrong.</i>

438

<i>Just like mice love rice.</i>

451
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:08,230
Sleeping on the couch makes my back hurt.

452
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,329
You smelly mouse.

453
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,809
Come and fold the quilt.

454
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,750
Mr. Shao.

455
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,089
You're wearing a new top.

456
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,730
Dongge made it for me.

457
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,390
Mr. Shao.

458
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,650
The embroidery on your shirt is so pretty.

459
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,030
- My wife made it herself.
- Looks great.

460
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,089
Fetching water?

461
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:21,489
I'm going to fetch water now.

462
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,250
Off you go.
<i>[Beijing welcomes you]</i>

463
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,928
There are only so few people fetching water today.

464
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:26,029
Hey, Old Zheng.

465
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,169
You're riding too slow.

466
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,409
You've reconciled with Dongge?

467
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:37,808
She ignored me all day and quietly made me a new top.

468
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,970
Give me the bag. I'll take it for you.

469
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,730
That looks better.

470
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,929
Fellow colleagues, it's time to fetch water!

471
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,690

Xue.

482
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,168
Someone from Huanyu Investment came and asked about you.

483
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:31,089
- For real?
- Yes.

484
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:32,930
That's him.

485
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,748
I told him you are just a freshman.

486
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:37,929
He finds it quite a shame.

487

Indeed, it is.

488

Don't worry.

But it's an investment company.

495

Why would they want to recruit me?

00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:03,749
In the past two years, they have been expanding their business overseas.

497
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:06,290
So there is an urgent need for translators.

498
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,849
But won't it be too stressful to work there?

499
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:11,369
No...

500
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,149
No worries.

501
00:26:13,149 --> 00:26:16,888
As long as you have more than two years of experience there, other companies will want to hire you.

502
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:19,650
- All right. You may begin.
- It has begun.

503
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,670
Good afternoon, dear professor.

504
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:25,370
My name is Mary from Zhejiang Province.

505
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,669
Shiyin!

506
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:30,449
Xue!

507
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,850
Isn't this our big-time emcee?

508
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,490
I'm here to grace you with my presence.

509
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,949
Well, Xue, I'll get going then.

510
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:42,709
- Okay. I'll catch you later. Bye.
- Bye.

511
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,609
Bye.

512
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,108
Xue, you'd better keep your distance from him.

513
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,289
We're only taking part in a speech contest together. What brings you here?

514
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:57,390
Look. There's a store event at the beauty salon that I always frequent.

515
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,749
Annual card members will get a free package of Queen's Spa.

516
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,009
I'll take you to experience the extravagant life of an upper-class lady.

517
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:03,489
That's too extravagant.

518
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,869
No, I can't.

519
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:08,110
I have a date with Sunian.

520
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,430
What are you guys doing?

521
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,249
We're going to watch the new "Harry Potter" movie together.

522
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,349
Again? You can go next time.

523
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:19,048
Giving up a free spa treatment is like throwing money away.

524
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:22,628
That point alone does make me feel a little soul-crushing.

525
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:26,610
But I dare not stand Sunian up.

526
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,510
Xue, look. To keep a guy interested,

527
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,689
you need to play hard to get.

528
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,909
This time, stand him up for once.

529
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:36,888
Then, show up in front of him looking dazzling.

530
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,050
Half the work, twice the effect.

531
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,449
Well. How do I tell him?

532
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:47,089
Just sending him a text will do. Come on.

533
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:47,989
Let's go.

534
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:50,609
What should I text him?

535
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:22,900
<i>[From Xue. Sunian, something urgent came up. Let's watch the movie another day.]</i>

536
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,020
<i>[What's so urgent?]</i>

537
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,169
Mimi.

538
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,330
Where did it go?

539
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,590
Mimi. Mimi.

540
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,168
Why... This is... It seems a little weird.

541
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:54,670
I'm still not used to being colleagues with you.

542
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,890
After some time, you'll get used to it.

543
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,690
Go and have fun after you get off work.

544
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,410
Don't spend time alone.

545
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,630
I had a date with Xue.

546
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,609
But something came up.

547
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,988
Well, let's get off work then.

548
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,508
Let's go home together

549
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:21,250
and make a few dishes when we get home.

550
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,730
Go about your business then.

551
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,600
<i>[Beauty SPA]</i>

552
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:35,029
Why are you pulling a long face?

553
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:37,088
Sunian asked what was so urgent.

554
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,709
I don't know how to reply to him.

555
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:42,469
Say you have a thesis to write.

556
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:43,888
Is that a good idea?

557
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:45,268
Studying hard is good, right?

558
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:46,829
Come on.

559
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:51,930
What's going on?

560
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,370
- Hello?
- Didn't you go to the movies?

561
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,090
Not with Shao Xue?

562
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,888
She said she had things to do.

563
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,749
I saw her. In a beauty spa.

564
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:15,110
You must be mistaken.

565
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,729
<i>How's that possible?</i>

566
00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:19,149
She's here with her friend.

567
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:21,089
<i>Look.</i>

568
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,770
Hello?

569
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,189
Oh, no. Oh, no.

570
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:28,408
Who were you talking to?

571
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:30,130
Didn't I tell you? My roommate.

572
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,870
Why are you giggling then?

573
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,629
I pulled an opposite stunt as a matchmaker.

574
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:35,529
What?

575
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,850
You won't understand.

576
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:42,049
Look. Sometimes, conflict is the catalyst for love.

577
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,148
Come on. I'm in a good mood. It's on me today.

578
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:46,748
So what are we going to do?

579
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,530
Nothing over 300 yuan.

580
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,709
That's so stingy of you.

581
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:55,048
A beauty care package worth over 1,000 yuan is just so comfortable.

582
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:56,390
Right?

583
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,309
Better than going to the movies, right?

584
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:02,008
Of course. Way better.

585
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,520
<i>[From Sunian: How's your beauty treatment?]</i>

586
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,810
How does Sunian know that I'm at the spa?

587
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,988
What's going on?

588
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:20,789
Oh, no. I'll go out and make a phone call.

589
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,570
<i>Sunian, are you busy?</i>

590
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,508
Not as busy as you.

591
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:52,430
Indeed, I'm at a spa.

592
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:55,609
I can explain.

593
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,469
Lin Shiyin has a membership card.

594
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:01,849
It just so happens that there's a free beauty treatment only for today.

595
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:03,348
So she's more important than me?

596
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:04,769
No.

597
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:08,329
This treatment is worth 1,888 yuan. It's free.

598
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:11,050
There won't be another chance. It's now or never.

599
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,489
Well, I get it then.

600
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:14,068
Money is more important than me.

601
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:17,930
Well, go on then. Enjoy yourself.

602
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:23,309
Oh, no.

603
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,929
Sunian's other personality has shown up.

604
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,009
Applying a facial mask is so crucial.

605
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:36,289
Don't get distracted.

606
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,268
Look, Sunian.

607
00:32:37,268 --> 00:32:39,590
All of a sudden, I feel like going to the movies.

608
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,608
I want to go so badly.

609
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:42,230
I'm coming over to see you now.

610
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,329
No. It's boring to go to the movies.

611
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:47,328
No, it's not! It's fun!

612
00:32:47,328 --> 00:32:49,349
My life depends on this movie.

613
00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:50,709
Don't you say no to me.

614
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:53,749
If I can't watch this movie today, I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

615
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:54,690
<i>I'll wipe it off my face now.</i>

616
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,508
<i>After I'm done, I'm coming over to see you.</i>

617
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,368
No. What a waste.

618
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,029
<i>Sunian, I have to relax to enjoy a beauty treatment.</i>

619
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:02,669
<i>I can't relax if you're not happy.</i>

620
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:04,729
Besides, with you acting this way, I'm just absorbing toxins.

621
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,928
Think about it. If you won't let me come over, you'll be upset.

622
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:08,569
The beauty treatment would have just been in vain, and there will be no movie time.

623
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,210
It would be all for nothing.

624
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,729
<i>Sunian, I'm begging you.</i>

625
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:15,489
<i>Let me come over to see you.</i>

626
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:17,450
All right then.

627
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,930
I'll wait for you at the cinema.

628
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,940
<i>Be safe.</i>

629
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:22,709
Well, see you later. See you later.

630
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,989
- Shiyin! I have to go now. Rain check, all right?
- What's the matter?

631
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:34,009
Sunian is mad. When this guy gets angry, no woman is a match for him.

632
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:35,489
I have to go. Bye!

633
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,210
Slow down! Don't fall!

634
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,249
<i>Legilimency!</i>

635
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,088
<i>Harry.</i>

636
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:57,910
<i>Sirius.</i>

637
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:00,529
<i>I'm going to vomit.</i>

638
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,390
<i>Stop it!</i>

639
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,249
<i>Is this what you call control?</i>

640
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:06,368
<i>We've been at it for hours!</i>

641
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:08,049
<i>I can do the breath!</i>

642
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:12,650
Sunian, would you like some popcorn?

643
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:14,650
No.

644
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,430
How about milk tea?

645
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,420
<i>My father was a great man.</i>

646
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,740
<i>Your father was a swaggard.</i>

647
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,070
<i>I take after my father.</i>

648
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,030
- Well.
- Watch the movie.

649
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,510
Stop talking.

650
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,930
<i>Come on, Winnie.</i>

651
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,600
<i>Snape!</i>

652
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,630
<i>Billy Armis.</i>

653
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,190
<i>Enough.</i>

654
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,920
Sunian, that movie was pretty good. Right?

655
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:13,110
Why don't I treat you to another movie tomorrow?

656
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,570
No need.

657
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,290
Go home now.

658
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:24,489
<i>What do I do?</i>

659
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,549
<i>How did I patch things up with Sunian the last time I pissed him off?</i>

660
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,029
<i>Sunian, please don't be mad.</i>

661
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:40,128
<i>Next time, I'll save you some candied hawthorn berries.</i>

662
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:41,310
<i>I'm not eating them.</i>

663
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,149
<i>Then I'll set off fireworks for you.</i>

664
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:45,109
<i>I'm not watching them.</i>

665
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,069
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

666
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:00,069
<i>It won't hurt anymore if you stop being mad at me.</i>

667
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:02,429
<i>Be careful next time.</i>

668
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:36,830
<i>Sunian!</i>

669
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,170
<i>Open the window and take a look!</i>

670
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:16,850
Does it hurt?

671
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,550
It won't hurt anymore if you stop being mad at me.

672
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,369
You're still so careless.

673
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,650
Let me take a look.

674
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,809
Promise me. Don't be mad at me.

675
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,850
Then, I'll show you.

676
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,369
All right. I won't be mad.

677
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:34,909
Look! It doesn't hurt anymore.

678
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:40,710
Sunian.

679
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,430
Don't be mad anymore.

680
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,429
I promise you.

681
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,870
I won't lie to you again.

682
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,770
Smile, will you?

683
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,269
Sunian.

684
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,230
Sunian.

685
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,510
Sunian.

686

♫ <i>Missing you</i> ♫

Xue.

00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,569
What brings you here?

695
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,489
Didn't you go to the movies yesterday?

696
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,049
The beauty salon gave me a few boxes of masks.

697
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,890
So I brought them over for you.

698
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,570
Thank you.

699
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:52,129
Well, how did the movie go?

700
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,949
Is Sunian still mad?

701
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,529
Not anymore.

702
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,668
Well, is there any progress between you two?

703
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,770
No, not at all.

704
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,448
All right. Enjoy. I'll get going.

705
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:08,870
Shiyin!

706
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,569
I have a question for you.

707
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:17,070
Does it make two people closer

708
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,750
when they go from good friends...

709
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,750
to lovers?

710
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:26,030
Is something going on between you two?

711
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,728
No! Nothing is going on.

712
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:31,590
I was just asking.

713
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,269
Well, it's hard to say.

714
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:41,830
Before you get together,

715
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,410
you'll think everything about him is good.

716
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,069
But once your relationship is confirmed,

717
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:53,150
you will find that it's completely different

718
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,189
from what you thought.

719
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:02,150
Aren't things going well for you and Wu Huan?

720
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,629
It's a long story.

721
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:17,130
If two people live in different circles,

722
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:20,950
they will not have a lot of common topics.

723
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,729
Unlike the time when we were in high school,

724
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:26,089
spending all day together.

725
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:30,089
Besides, once you start a relationship,

726
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:33,449
there's no going back to being friends.

727
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:41,070
So, Xue, you have to give serious consideration to that question.

728
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:54,989
Sunian, I'm leaving.

729
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,289
Where are you going at this late hour?

730
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,069
A business meeting.

731
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,269
You seem busy, huh?

732
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,109
Why are you smiling?

733
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,389
I'm not.

734
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,669
Why would you smile for nothing?

735
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:36,809
Something must be up.

736
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,569
Tell me.

737
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,989
Get back to your games.

738
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,409
Pei Shu.

739
00:42:02,669 --> 00:42:03,750
Let me ask you something.

740
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,190
Ask away.

741
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:16,269
Well, if two people...

742
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,730
kissed,

743
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:25,349
does it mean they are together?

744
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:27,029
You're asking the right person.

745
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:29,270
I know all about kissing.

746
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,049
Look. Before you kiss a person, you have to first confess your feelings.

747
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:34,288
She has to say yes first.

748
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:36,870
If you kiss her before you even confess,

749
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,310
that's considered an indecent act.

750
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,509
Confess?

751
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:45,269
Who did you kiss?

752
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,050
I'm asking you a question! Who did you kiss?

753
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,170
