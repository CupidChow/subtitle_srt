Eat more. Don't waste it. Eat.

107
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,359
At least give me some meat.

108
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,679
You have had too much meat, so your mouth gets greasy.

109

My state in this family is...

110
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,790
I'll eat.

111
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,250

119
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:16,070

There's no way I'd get bullied.

Sunian?

124
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,329
A good kid like him is being bullied?

125
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:30,299
Today, after school, someone removed Sunian's bike's valve cap.

126
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,020
Who did it? That's hateful.

127
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,399
No idea. But don't you worry.

128
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,570
I have his back.

129
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,019
Listen up.

130
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,930
Act when you have to.

131
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,340
Don't make unnecessary trouble.

132
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,120
Don't worry. I know what to do.

133
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,249
Sunian, any fresh news from school lately?

134
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:06,040
The usual.

135
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,900
You guys must have a new task, right?

136
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,590
No.

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
What's wrong?

138
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,599
No one has anything to share. How frustrating.

139
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,620
Sunian.

140
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,650
What happened to your book?

141
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,400
Someone scribbled in it.

142
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,300
Is it that same punk?

143
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,700
Sunian, you can't just let this slide.

144
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,800
They'll walk all over you.

145
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,400
That's right.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
Shall we also steal his valve cap tomorrow?

147
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
That's too childish.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,100
If you ask me, we'll just confront him at the school entrance and beat him up.

149
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,600
That's enough. I don't want trouble.

150
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,900
Do your homework.

151
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Sunian, Xue needs liquid paper.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,500
Go help her get it. It's in my room.

153
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,800
Why don't you go get it?

154
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
You have long legs so you're faster.

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes. I wrote it wrong.

156
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
Do you know who that guy is?

157
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I've asked around.

158
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,400
That punk is in the same class as Sunian. His name is Zhuang Dada.

159
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,500
He stole Sunian's valve cap, scribbled in his books, trampled on his uniform.

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,900
Sunian's lost his mind studying.

161
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,700
He had no reaction despite being bullied like this.

162

Tomorrow morning, stay out of Sunian's sight,

go to his classroom, and pass a love letter to Zhuang Dada.

Why should I?

Do you think he'll show up if I openly declare war?

169
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Why should I do it? You do it.

170
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
Do you want me to profess my love for him?

171
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,000
You're professing your love?

172

I'm professing my adoration for Xue's watch.

Yes. Thanks for the help.

It's not from me. Thank you.

Sunian, what a coincidence.

196

You're going to confront Zhuang Dada.

197

I just wanted to give him a warning.

Shao Xue isn't part of this, I hope.

But neither of them showed up.

204
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,400
I'm guessing he saw Shao Xue and wasn't interested.

Just let it go in the left ear and out from the right.
