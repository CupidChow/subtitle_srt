and asked me if her son looked like math material.

00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:17,460
I told her with that kind of mentality, her son most probably will fail math.

Now, I just think being ordinary is the best thing ever.

Go ahead, Qiaomu. I'll be fine.

153
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,130

154

156
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,250
Go keep her company.

157
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,569
Save some for me.

158
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,220
I will.

00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,969
Just the three of us now.

161
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,800
Why did everyone leave when I'd just arrived?

162
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,310
No one likes you, perhaps.

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,620
Qiaomu, don't be sad.

164
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,770
Siyuan was a bit harsh today.

165
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,050
He brought me to his classmate reunion.

166
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,260
His classmates are now either businessmen or technical experts.

167
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,360
He was clearly upset that day.

168
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,850
So I wondered if he was envious of them or had some other thoughts.

169
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,190
His degree is pretty good.

170
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,540
He can get a pretty high starting salary if he works for a big company.

171
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,260
So I asked around to see if there was a job vacancy.

172
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,640
I finally found him a tech job,

173
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,260
but he just decided that he wouldn't take it.

174
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,849
Siyuan is a traditional man.

175
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,350
If it was you who found him the job, he would feel too ashamed to take it.

176
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,150
I asked Master.

177
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,560
He said that Siyuan was struggling to get by.

178
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,040
I was doing this for him.

179
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,250
I know. Whatever you do, Qiaomu,

180
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,260
it's for Siyuan's own good.

181
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,190
I guess I'm too meddlesome.

182
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,640
Look at the mess now.

183
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,900
I pissed off everyone.

184
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,739
Why are you all here?

185
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,660
Master, why are you out here?

186
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,930
Just to get some air.

187
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,899
It's more like you miss your cigarette and you are not allowed to smoke inside.

188
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,400
Come. Let's all go to my place for some tea.

189
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,350
Thanks, Master.

190
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,970
Tell me then.

191
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,640
What do you like about Siyuan?

192
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,850
I don't know.

193
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,750
Not knowing is right.

194
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,449
If you can list out the reasons about why you like him,

195
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,019
then it's just business, not love.

196
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,089
You found him a job out of kindness.

197
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:52,140
But do you know what he truly desires?

198
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,120
I'll let you in on a secret.

199
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,970
Before you came here,

200
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,990
Siyuan was pondering about whether he should stay or not.

201
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,070
He couldn't make up his mind.

202
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,419
But the day he met you,

203
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,849
he suddenly came to a decision.

204
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,650
I know about that!

205
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,510
He thought to himself,

206
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,080
if the girl he likes wants to stay here,

207
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,809
then he has no reason to leave.

208
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,139
After Siyuan decided to stay,

209
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,539
he faced a lot of pressure.

210
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,299
His parents didn't want him to stay.

211
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,489
They wanted him to find a better job and earn more money

212
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,779
so that he could live a comfortable life in Beijing.

213
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,209
But after considering everything,

214
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,419
he still thought that all those things

215
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,639
didn't hold a candle to the metal scraps in his hands.

216
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,380
That's what he's like; very stubborn.

217
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,220
That's what you like about him, right?

218
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,660
Master, why did I fall in love with an idiot?

219
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,920
When I was young, I was an idiot too.

220
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,500
This is my late wife.

221
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,310
You have never mentioned her.

222
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,680
She passed away long ago.

223
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,929
It was so long ago

224
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,300
that I don't feel like mentioning it.

225
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,540
My late wife

226
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,780
never had one good day with me.

227
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,770
There was this auction house who came to me.

228
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,969
They offered me a high salary to be their antique appraiser.

229
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,779
Back then, my son wanted to study abroad.

230
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,930
We were trying to find the funds.

231
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,539
I was in a dilemma and I didn't know what to do.

232
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,820
So I came back and asked my wife.

233
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,310
She told me

234
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,680
to do what I valued the most.

235
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,419
And so I thought hard.

236
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,000
What exactly was it that I valued the most?

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,570
If I became their antique appraiser,

238
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,849
I would earn a lot of money

239
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,710
but that would be the ceiling of my pursuit.

240
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,210
If I stayed in the restoration workshop,

241
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,130
I could still leave something for this world.

242
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,940
I thought that had more value.

243
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,210
So I stayed.

244
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,179
Qiaomu, are you still mad at Siyuan?

245
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,570
Yes.

246
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,089
He stayed here for you.

247
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,940
Why are you still mad at him?

248
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,860
I'm mad because he kept everything to himself.

249
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,969
You didn't have your lunch. Why don't you grab a bite at my place?

250
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:04,139
I'm good. You two have fun.

251
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,650
I'll go back now.

252
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,650
Have a safe trip.

253
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,200
- See you.
- Bye

254
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,589
I didn't know Mr. Sun was part of such an amazing story

255
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:25,940
when he was young.

256
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,560
Xue.

257
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,849
I want to visit a place.

258
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,620
Where?

259
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,680
I am Aisin-Gioro Shaoxue!
<i>(Aisin-Gioro: family name of the Manchu emperors)</i>

260
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,749
Sunian, why did you want to come here all of a sudden?

261
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:01,110
I had to drag you here all the time.

262
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,810
I just want to have a look.

263
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,329
We've been here so many times.

264
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,780
What else is there to look at?

265
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,650
Did you hear what Mr. Sun said?

266
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,550
Which part?

267
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,900
He said many things.

268
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,850
He said he wanted to leave something for this world.

269
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,619
Have you thought about what you want to leave for this world?

270
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,060
Something... tasty or fun!

271
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,140
I want to leave something for this world, too.

272
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,320
I hope what I leave

273
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,900
will still be admired by many after a century.

274
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,140
Just like the Forbidden City.

275
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,750
I don't get it.

276
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,380
I can't explain either.

277
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,200
I just want to be like Mr. Sun

278
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,530
and have no regret when I talk about the choices I made...

279
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,500
when I become an old man.

280
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,689
I know what you want.

281
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,579
It's the saying, "I regret nothing for I did not squander my life away,

282
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,209
I'm ashamed of nothing for I did not toil blindly in vain."

283
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,590
So what's your choice?

284
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,139
It's okay. Take your time.

285
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,180
No matter what you pick, I'll be by your side.

286
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,849
You'll be leaving soon.

287
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,810
Who told you that?

288
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,970
I'm staying.

289
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,260
You're studying abroad.

290
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,809
I wasn't chosen.

291
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,419
Impossible.

292
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,209
You scored so well in IELTS.

293
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,019
I failed the interview.

294
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,299
But it's fine because I don't feel like studying abroad anymore.

295
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,869
My parents are also very happy to hear that.

296
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:04,620
They say I should stay if I want to.

297
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,870
No, there must be another solution.

298
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,650
What's up?

299
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,539
Do you really want me to leave?

300
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,459
Of course not. But you...

301
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,569
It's more than enough already.

302
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,410
I'll stay and just cling to you.

303
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,200
What are you doing?

304
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,540
I'm making a wish.

305
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,690
The wish I made was to see you smile.

306
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,909
You should make a wish, too. Your wish will come true here.

307
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:47,130
Come. We'll do it together.

308
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,220
<i>I wish I could find something I want to do.</i>

309
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,650
<i>And I wish everything around me</i>

310
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,640
<i>can remain the same.</i>

311
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,049
It's almost noon now and she's still not here.

312
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,980
That's unacceptable.

313
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,760
Be mad at her all you want now.

314
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
You might not be able to anymore.

315
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,220
What do you mean, Master?

316
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,620
Qiaomu is really upset this time.

317
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,770
She might have left already.

318
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,019
Master, you're saying

319
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,040
that Qiaomu doesn't work here anymore?

320
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,870
If you don't apologize,

321
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,480
even I can't save you.

322
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,980
I...

323
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,600
Master, I'll take a day off.

324
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,879
Mr. Sun, didn't Qiaomu take a day off for her school?

325
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:57,550
This young man is too slow.

326
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,780
I'm giving him a nudge.

327
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,079
<i>[Kou Siyuan]</i>

328
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,939
That's all for today's lecture.

329
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,030
Class is dismissed.

330
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,089
Who are you looking for, mister?

331
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,060
F-Fu Qiaomu!

332
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,720
Fu Qiaomu! Fu Qiaomu.

333
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,500
Why are you looking for me?

334
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,240
Why did you quit?

335
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,409
Quit what?

336
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,340
You're still lying to me?

337
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,029
What lie? Are you crazy?

338
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,999
- Are you leaving with that man?
- Who?

339
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,820
The one who drives a Mercedes-Benz.

340
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,809
She is the one who drives a Mercedes-Benz.

341
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,550
It's her.

342
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,739
Who said only men could drive a Mercedes-Benz?

343
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,980
You owe her an apology, too.

344
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,769
I asked her to find you a job and you turned it down just like that.

345
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,880
What?

346
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,119
I thought you thought I was too poor so you found me a new job.

347
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,739
I didn't say that.

348
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,259
I just thought you wanted a better job.

349
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,499
I did.

350
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,259
But after you came, that thought disappeared.

351
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,199
How does my presence have anything to do with whether you want to change your job or not?

352
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,409
It has everything to do with it.

353
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,049
If I change my job, I have to leave.

354
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,779
How far can you go anyway?

355
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,259
I have to leave the Restoration Department.

356
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,019
And if I do that, how can I still be together with you?

357
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:24,120
Even if you leave the Restoration Department, we can still be together!

358
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,609
Are you dumb?

359
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,699
If I leave the Restoration Department, we can't even meet up.

360
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,019
How can we be together like that?

361
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,499
Are you dumb, too?

362
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,129
I can't take this anymore.

363
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,699
She already confessed to you

364
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,309
and you're still taking everything literally.

365
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:37,489
Dude, how did you survive this far with that level of emotional intelligence?

366
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,079
<i>- Exactly.
- Dump him!</i>

367
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,710
<i>- Don't stay with him.
- Dump him.</i>

368
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,540
Fu Qiaomu!

369
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,080
I know I'm not good with words.

370
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,680
I suck at communicating

371
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,670
and I don't know how to impress a girl.

372
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:09,200
Before now, I didn't even know what loving someone felt like.

373
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,890
But after I met you,

374
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,500
I think loving someone

375
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,200
means I want to be with her every day.

376
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,220
I like you.

377
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,260
I want to be with you every day.

378
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,000
Can I?

379
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,450
<i>Say yes!</i>

380
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:40,910
<i>- Kiss!
- Kiss!</i>

381
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,440
<i>[Chinese Arts History and the Pinnacle of Chinese Arts]</i>

382
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,089
Mr. Luo.

383
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,219
You can do so many other things for this weekend.

384
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,640
Why come here?

385
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,270
I...

386
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,820
I'm here to look at the tree.

387
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,680
That tree is growing quite nicely

388
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,569
but you have seen it for many years already.

389
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,940
You're not sick of it yet?

390
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,920
I'll show you something you're supposed to look at.

391
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,990
This is your mother's final drawing.

392
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,150
Although it is incomplete,

393
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,690
I can tell it's a masterpiece.

394
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,290
She started decisively

395
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,700
but ended her touches on a melancholic note.

396
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,160
The upper one is the original work.

397
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,000
The original author must have hidden

398
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,850
many feelings in his heart.

399
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:12,540
It's hard to replicate what he was feeling.

400
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,349
But the one who tried imitating the original painting

401
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:20,979
had this generous sentiment that rivaled that of the author.

402
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,810
Before your mother left, she told me

403
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,950
she couldn't let go of this painting.

404
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,400
Strictly speaking,

405
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,580
this cultural relic is but a Xuan paper.
<i>(For Chinese calligraphy and drawing)</i>

406
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,080
It has no life.

407
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:49,290
But when you pour your soul into it,

408
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,590
it bears a part of you.

409
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,750
If the relic is there, the people will be too.

410
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:03,090
Humans are bound to leave this world sooner or later.

411
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,270
If you can leave something for this world,

412
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,700
then your life is not wasted.

413
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,500
You're just 18 years old.

414
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,030
If you're sad, you can just cry.

415
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,290
Cry it out, make a big fuss,

416
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,910
cry some more, and then it's over.

417
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,500
You move on and live.

418
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,260
Live for yourself...

419
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,120
and for your mother.

420
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,750
Mr. Luo.

421
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,450
I want to be like my mother.

422
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,030
I want to finish...

423
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,090
this incomplete painting of hers.

424
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,800
<i>[Teachers' Office]</i>

425
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,500
Dad, what did the teachers say?

426
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:57,110
They said you shouldn't switch to arts.

427
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,130
They asked me to talk to you.

428
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,170
Can you tell me what's on your mind?

429
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,680
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

430
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,020
I want to join the Restoration Division

431
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,050
and replicate old paintings.

432
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Don't force yourself...

433
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,889
because of...

434
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,110
because of anyone else.

435
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,050
I'm not forcing myself.

436
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,020
I really want to do it.

437
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,910
Dad, I want to be like you.

438
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,940
I want...

439
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,370
to leave something...

440
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,270
for this ever-changing world.

441
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,500
I get it.

442
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,390
I'll support whatever you want to do.

443
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,369
Let's go. PE class is now.

444
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,590
You can go first. I'll catch you later.

445
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,980
Go back to your seat.

446
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,129
Your PE teacher is busy right now.

447
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,330
This class is now a math class.

448
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,299
Math class again?

449
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,640
Quit complaining.

450
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,509
Both of you, bring back those who ran to the field.

451
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:25,849
The lesson will begin in five minutes.

452
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,180
Those who are late will have to answer questions in front of the blackboard.

453
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:36,700
Xue, why doesn't Shiyin attend the classes anymore?

454
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,540
She's occupied.

455
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,250
What happened to Lin Shiyin?

456
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,020
Nothing.

457
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,330
Xue, do you know what Wu Huan likes?

458
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,110
Why? Do you want to give him a present?

459
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,409
No!

460
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,980
I was just curious.

461
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,499
Shao Xue, someone's looking for you.

462
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,649
Zhang Qi?

463
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,520
No. Hotter than Zhang Qi.

464
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,610
Sunian!

465
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,100
Sunian.

466
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,190
Slow down. I won't run away.

467
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,710
What are you staring at?

468
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,510
You have been eating well. You look better, too.

469
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,170
Xue,

470
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,329
I need to tell you something.

471
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,920
Go ahead.

472
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,560
I want to switch to arts.

473
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,979
I want to apply to the Academy of Fine Arts.

474
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,030
Qiaomu's school?

475
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,170
What do you want to learn?

476
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,930
Drawing. After I graduate,

477
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,639
I'll replicate old paintings.

478
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,790
Did the teachers agree to it?

479
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,200
No, but I must insist.

480
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,649
But can you still change your major now?

481
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,939
Those who pick arts started drawing in Grade 10.

482
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,279
- You don't have faith in me?
- Of course, I do.

483
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:07,619
I just don't have faith in the taste of those people.

484
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,499
Sunian, will you work in the Restoration Department then?

485
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,980
I want to finish...

486
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,500
my mother's incomplete drawing.

487
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,189
- What are you doing?
- I'm cheering you up.

488
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:35,049
Sunian, just do what you want to do.

489
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,860
You'll succeed.

490
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,179
Time for class!

491
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,019
Go back to your classroom for your class.

492
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,129
I should head back now.

493
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,290
Bye, Sunian.

494
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,819
Bye!

495
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,849
Look at the color of this patch.

496
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,980
It's too new.

497
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,739
When it comes to color,

498
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,649
try learning it from Moshui.

499
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,810
She's very sensitive to it.

500
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,849
Why is Moshui absent again?

501
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,440
She took a day off.

502
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,910
She did?

503
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,849
She didn't tell me.

504
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,500
Dongge. Come with me.

505
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,000
I need to tell you something.

506
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,960
Keep looking for it.

507
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,259
Look for a darker color.

508
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,329
Okay.

509
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,860
Hurry.

510
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,750
Hurry up.

511
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,680
Hurry up.

512
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,780
What's the hurry?

513
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,250
What happened?

514
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,890
Shiyin is making me worried sick!

515
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,710
She was doing just fine in school

516
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,430
but she decided to quit school all of a sudden.

517
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,410
She quit school?

518
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,599
She took some broadcasting classes behind our back.

519
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,619
And she even played truancy to attend some specialized courses.

520
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:52,459
Her father found out.

521
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,649
Before I could reprimand her, she delivered a speech.

522
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:59,310
She said, "My dear father and mother,

523
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,939
I am an extraordinary girl.

524
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,219
I have a dream and my dream is to be an excellent host.

525
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:07,539
I hope both of you can support my dream."

526
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,009
Stop laughing.

527
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,809
She's raising my blood pressure. Seriously!

528
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,299
All right.

529
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,699
Why would she want to be a host?

530
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,659
She must have seen how glamorous

531
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,339
the hosts are on the TV and wants to be one herself.

532
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:24,669
Tell her how hard it is to get into that kind of school.

533
00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:26,929
One in a hundred odds!

534
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,889
I told her everything. I even got mad at her.

535
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,770
And she gave me an ultimatum.

536
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,469
She said if I wouldn't support her dream, she would quit school.

537
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:39,560
Quit school?

538
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,650
I'm out of wits so I came to you.

539
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,299
- Calm down.
- Dongge,

540
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,449
can you tell this to Xue?

541
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,890
Let Xue talk to her.

542
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,329
Perhaps she'll listen to Xue.

543
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,870
Okay.

544
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,710
But I still think asking one kid to discourage another kid

545
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,020
will yield no result.

546
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,440
I'm doomed.

547
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,409
Relax.

548
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,130
- Calm down.
- What should I do?

549
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,059
In my opinion, as a parent,

550
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,479
we are our child's gatekeepers when it comes to important matters.

551
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:17,370
You're right.

552
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,020
You know what?

553
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,179
I'll talk to Xue.

554
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,190
If Xue won't do it,

555
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,980
I will talk to Shiyin myself.

556
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,659
My dear Dongge.

557
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,659
Having your help in this critical moment.

558
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,659
Don't you worry.

559
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,219
No, thanks.

560
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,349
If I talk to Shiyin, we won't even be friends anymore.

561
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:38,219
Aren't you good friends with Shiyin?

562
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,299
You will let her walk the wrong path like this?

563
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,219
What wrong path?

564
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,289
Broadcasting and hosting is a good major. It suits Shiyin.

565
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:47,220
Fine.

566
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,080
I knew you would take her side.

567
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,099
So unreliable.

568
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,410
How irritating.

569
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,870
It's okay if you won't help me

570
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,409
but I'm telling you right now.

571
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:05,819
Sit for the National College Entrance Examination properly.

572
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:08,480
Do not think about other irrelevant things.

573
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,449
What got into her?

574
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,450
Did something tick her off?

575
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,409
She is worried about Ms. Ji Lan and Ms. Kang.

576
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,779
What happened to Ms. Kang?

577
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,170
She's been absent for two days.

578
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,060
Should I check on her?

579
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,220
That might work.

580
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,009
You can visit Ms. Kang

581
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,910
so that your mother won't have a lot on her plate.

582
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,430
You can reduce her burden, too.

583
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:50,079
Reducing my mother's burden is my duty and my calling.

584
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,299
<i>Why are you shouting?</i>

585
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,190
<i>I'm not deaf.</i>

586
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,270
<i>Come back early.</i>

587
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,600
Go.

588
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,790
I'll go then.

589
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,870
See you, Mom!

590
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,380
Are you new here?

591
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm Li Yuan. I've been studying in this atelier for three years.

592
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,409
I know this place inside out.

593
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,120
Come to me if you have any questions.

594
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,370
How old are you?

595
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,480
18.

596
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,780
So young. You're about to graduate soon.

597
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,900
Where are you applying?

598
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,520
Academy of Fine Arts.

599
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,120
Here comes another one.

600
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,579
How long have you been drawing?

601
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,000
I just started.

602
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,179
When's the entrance exam?

603
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,890
This year.

604
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,709
My friend. You were drunk last night, weren't you?

605
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,409
I've been applying to it for three years.

606
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,219
You have no prior knowledge and you want to get into the Academy of Fine Arts after a few months of learning?

607
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,560
I learned some rudimentary tricks.

608
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,060
Really? From who?

609
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,830
My mother.

610
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,329
My mother taught me how to sing too,

611
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,060
but you don't see me applying to a conservatoire.

612
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,690
What does your mother do?

613
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,280
She replicated old paintings.

614
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,779
Not bad. Replicating old paintings.

615
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,790
Where? Under a bridge?

616
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,910
In the Restoration Department.

617
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,750
Then she has...

618
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,960
Your mother, has she met Sir Luo Huaijin?

619
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,010
Mr. Luo is my mother's master.

620
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,569
My friend, can you put in good words for me?

621
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:10,650
Can we draw first?

622
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,750
Go ahead.

623
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,869
My friend, can you put in good words for...

624
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,780
Continue, please.

625
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,650
Ms. Kang.

626
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,790
Ms. Kang, are you here?

627
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,329
Xue?

628
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,619
Ms. Kang, I'm here to pay you a visit.

629
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,330
If you're busy, I can go back.

630
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,270
You came in time. Come in.

631
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,489
Ms. Kang, are you expecting someone?

632
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,000
Sit.

633
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,490
Why are you staring at me?

634
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,449
You look different now.

635
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,489
How do I look normally then?

636
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,420
You look beautiful.

637
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,160
But today, even more so.

638
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,179
What a sweet-talker.

639
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,100
Your mother sent you here, didn't she?

640
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,109
No. No. I came here of my own volition.

641
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,449
But my mother is a tad worried about you.

642
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,160
I'm glad you came here instead.

643
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,280
Because I don't feel the need to hide anything from you.

644
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,120
Try this.

645
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,659
Is this Suzhou cuisine?

646
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,290
Sweet and sour. It's delicious.

647
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,900
I haven't made it in a long time.

648
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,430
My culinary skill isn't as good as before.

649
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,760
Ms. Kang, drink moderately.

650
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,850
Alcohol is not good for your health.

651
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,610
It isn't, but it can help me

652
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,790
forget unhappy memories.

653
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,769
Ms. Kang, is today an important day?

654
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:41,290
You cooked so many delicious dishes.

657
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,500
♫ <i>My memory does all the hard work for me</i> ♫

658
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:15,600
♫ <i>All the memories are embedded deep within my heart</i> ♫

659
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,140
♫ <i>The past I've been hiding from year after year</i> ♫

660
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,159
♫ <i>Carved into the days long gone</i> ♫

661
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:31,000
♫ <i>Although simplicity is plain, its vibrancy has never faded</i> ♫

662
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,660
♫ <i>Those songs in the past</i> ♫

663
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,380
♫ <i>They had accompanied me through everything</i> ♫

664
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:46,140
♫ <i>Singing about the stubbornness of our youth</i> ♫

665
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:53,720
♫ <i>Using this song to boost our courage as we sing</i> ♫

666
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:02,040
♫ <i>Please don't cry because you have me</i> ♫

667
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,400
♫ <i>Until I saw the bustling city</i> ♫

668
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,020
♫ <i>Until I realized that it was once within my reach</i> ♫

669
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:32,900
♫ <i>I was this sober once but I still did the same thing</i> ♫

670
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,520
♫ <i>As days go by, I wish to forget</i> ♫

671
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,420
♫ <i>But unknowingly, I remember them again</i> ♫

672
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,180
♫ <i>I remember the deep feelings that were long gone</i> ♫

673
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,420
♫ <i>Within those simple days</i> ♫

674
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:55,880
♫ <i>Those songs in the past, they had accompanied me</i> ♫

675
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:03,600
♫ <i>As I regretted our parting during our youth</i> ♫

676
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:11,300
♫ <i>Those songs in the past, they had accompanied me</i> ♫

677
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,220
♫ <i>Please don't cry again</i> ♫

678
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:23,140
♫ <i>And don't ask when I'll return</i> ♫
