got married, and gave birth to you.

She might be nagging you every day,

but she did it for your own good.

She is frugal.

She won't eat anything good because of you.

your Two Plus One program to study abroad,

199
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,100
and even your marriage in the future, she planned all of it.

200

She has saved various funds for you.

So, you should not be so stubborn sometimes.

Just like that.

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
I've not seen her for almost a month.

319
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,400
We argue whenever we see each other.

320
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,600
This can be considered my birthday present.

321
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
How wonderful.

322
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,200
She gave it to you in advance and gave you so much.

323
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,000
I really hope my mother could give me money every time.

324
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,800
Why did you argue with her again this time?

325
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,500
I told her it was fine even if I couldn't find her

326
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,800
because I'm used to it.

327
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,700
I wanted her not to blame me

328
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,800
if she couldn't find me in the future.

329
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,500
Zhang Qi,

330
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,000
Ms. Zhang Ling is busy at work for your sake.

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,800
There's no need for polite words between us.

332
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,000
Both of us knew...

333
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,700
how lazy my mother was before my father left.

334
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,000
She's not some kind of capable woman.

335
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,600
After my father left,

336
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,900
she hasn't stopped working.

337
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sure she made enough money.

338
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why is she still so busy?

339
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,900
She's just afraid to be with me alone.

340
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,100
You are overthinking.

341
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,700
I know.

342
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,280
She will think of my father when she sees me.

343
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Why did I tell you so much?

344
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
I must be out of my mind from doing all those questions.

345
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,200
Next week, let's have Pizza Hut every day.

346
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm going back.

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,700
Zhang Qi!

348
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
It's not your birthday yet.

349
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Don't grow old now. Change back.

350
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,300
<i>What are their parents trying to do?</i>

351
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,600
<i>They even came to our house</i>

352
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,700
<i>and asked us to let their son go.</i>

353
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,900
I am Shiyin's mother!

354
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,900
Don't I know what... what my daughter is like?

355
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm telling you, if it wasn't their son lying to her with pretty words,

356
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm sure she wouldn't have been fooled.

357
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,500
Calm down.

358
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,600
The school is taking this matter seriously.

359
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,400
So, I came here to learn more about this matter.

360
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not right for their parents to do that.

361
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Not right? What do you mean?

362
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Their parents were so impolite.

363
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
They came here and raised a ruckus

364
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,800
until everyone from the alley heard them.

365
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,200
My child is a girl.

366
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
How can my daughter go out with dignity in the future?

367
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,700
- When rumors are out...
- Enough.

368
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,800
- It'll be so embarrassing!
- Stop shouting.

369
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,300
Do you think it's not embarrassing enough?

370
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,400
It is embarrassing!

371
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,600
I am her class teacher.

372
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,400
I believe Shiyin is a good kid.

373
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,800
She wouldn't do anything out of line.

374
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,600
So, both of you should calm down.

375
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,900
Don't give Shiyin too much pressure.

376
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,100
After this, just let the school handle this matter.

377
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,600
Handle this immediately and think of something

378
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,000
to prove my daughter's innocence.

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,400
That's enough.

380
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,700
Have you heard about Shiyin?

381
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,500
Yes. How could she do that?

382
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,700
That was so embarrassing.

383
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,500
Ms. Li. Ms. Liu.

384
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Xue, wait.

385
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,000
You are close with Shiyin. Don't learn from her.

386
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,600
Xue, has school ended?

387
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,000
We are going back. Let's go.

388
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,900
Ji Ian, don't cry. - It's bad for your health.
- Mom. Dad. I'm back.

389
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,100
I watched Shiyin grow up.

390
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,200
How can I not understand her?

391
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,600
Yes.

392
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,300
Ignore what they say.

393
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,400
Why do you care about people who spread baseless rumors?

394
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,800
Yes. We should live our own life.

395
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,600
Sure.

396
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,800
Do you want me to accompany you?

397
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,300
Sure. Calm down.

398
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
Calm down. I...

399
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,300
- Why did you hang up so early? I'm still...
- The phone bill is expensive.

400
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,000
Mom, what happened to Shiyin?

401
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,500
She has a complicated relationship with a male student.

402
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
That's not the worst.

403
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,000
That guy insisted Shiyin was the one who pestered him.

404
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
His parents went to Shiyin's house to complain

405
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,500
and said they could pay as long as

406
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
Shiyin let go of their son.

407
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
I'm telling you.

408
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,800
Those words were so unpleasant.

409
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,500
That's not what happened!

410
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,100
Wang Haoran is a jerk!

411
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,200
He fooled Shi...

412
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
You knew about this?

413
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,000
Do I...

414
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
know about it?

415
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,000
I... guess... so...

416
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,000
You... She guesses so?

417
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
Why did you hit me?

418
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,100
Why didn't you tell us?

419
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,900
Aren't you good friends with Shiyin?

420
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,200
What are good friends?

421
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Good friends should monitor each other,

422
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,900
improve together, and study together!

423
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,200
That's the right way.

424
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm telling you. If we had known about this earlier and stopped it from happening,

425
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,500
it wouldn't have ended up this way.

426
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,600
Besides, a girl's reputation is important.

427
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,300
The neighbors are all pointing their fingers now. They are...

428
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,000
Xue.

429
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,700
Look into my eyes.

430
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
Look into my eyes and tell me.

431
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,100
Are you hiding something from me, too?

432
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm not.

433
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm warning you.

434
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,400
Use Shiyin's matter as a warning.

435
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Someone at your age should study well at school.

436
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
Don't think of any nonsense.

437
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,000
You can't scold her regarding this.

438
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,100
Our daughter is similar to me. She's stubborn.

439
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,500
Besides, this is other people's business.

440
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,600
Why are you so anxious and getting mad?

441
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,800
You are always siding with her.

442
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,200
How can I not be anxious?

443
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Look how anxious Ji Ian is.

444
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,400
Fine. I don't want to argue with you two.

445
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,900
I'll simply make some food for you two.

446
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,400
Eat here while I go to accompany her.

447
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
I'm going right now.

448
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,700
Why are you going there?

449
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,200
Something happened to Shiyin. I'm going to see her.

450
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
Why don't you...

451
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,800
Forget it. Just wait for a while.

452
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Why?

453
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Everyone is talking about her now.

454
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
Just let them talk.

455
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,800
You should avoid her in case they talk about you too.

456
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,600
Mom, I think you are a bit mean.

457
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,300
I'm mean? What do you mean?

458
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,700
Look at her. I care for her and she says I'm mean.

459
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,800
This is...

460
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,200
- Mr. Shao. Ms. Yu.
- Sunian.

461
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,300
Xue, my mother bought this for you.

462
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
Sunian, great timing.

463
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,600
You are my benefactor.

464
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,000
Xue wants to visit Shiyin badly. I'm stopping her from going.

465
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,300
I'll be relieved if you go with her.

466
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,600
Go.

467
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,800
You're so mean.

468
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,700
Mean.

469
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,900
Let's go, Sunian.

470
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
We are leaving then.

471
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,800
Go on.

472
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,000
This child is...

473
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,700
Mean.

474
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,200
Everyone cares about their child.

475
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,700
I am Ji Ian's good friend.

476
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,400
I don't mind arguing and quarreling with her.

477
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,100
But my daughter is a good kid.

478
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,800
I don't want people to talk behind her back.

479
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,700
Sunian, don't you think Wang Haoran is too much?

480
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,800
Indeed.

481
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,400
I thought his worst trait was being pretentious.

482
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,800
I didn't expect he would do something like this.

483
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,400
Shiyin must be very sad now.

484
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Didn't you get into a quarrel?

485
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
That is our internal conflict.

486
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,100
You don't understand the friendship between girls.

487
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
No matter how serious our quarrel is,

488
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,200
we will unite as long as an external enemy appears.

489
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,400
Ms. Ji.

490
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Xue.

491
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,200
Ms. Ji.

492
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,400
I want to talk with Shiyin.

493
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,300
She locked herself inside her room.

494
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,000
She won't open the door for anyone.

495
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,200
Why don't you give it a try?

496
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,300
Shiyin.

497
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
Shiyin.

498
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,200
Open the door.

499
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Let's talk.

500
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,700
Shiyin.

501
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,200
If you don't open the door,

502
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,500
I'll think you're still angry at me.

503
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,400
Shiyin.

504
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,800
Ms. Ji.

505
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,100
Although I don't know the details,

506
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,300
Wang Haoran's words can never be trusted.

507
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,200
But his mother said

508
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,700
he is a very pure boy.

509
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,000
According to my opinion about him,

510
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,200
he is anything but pure.

511
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
You can go to the school and ask around.

512
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,100
Ask the boys. Don't ask the girls.

513
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,500
Then, you'll know how bad he is.

514
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
That jerk.

515
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,500
I'm sure he fooled Shiyin.

516
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,300
After meeting someone like him,

517
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,000
just take it as a lesson

518
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,400
and don't mind other people's opinions.

519
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Thank you, Sunian.

520
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,200
I will listen to what you say.

521
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,400
Ms. Ji.

522
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Why don't you tell us

523
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,800
when Shiyin is willing to come out?

524
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,800
All right.

525
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,500
Xue, thank you for coming to see her.

526
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,000
Ms. Ji, don't say that.

527
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
I'll be leaving with Sunian first.

528
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,500
Don't be sad.

529
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Shiyin is definitely not what they say she is.

530
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,400
Goodbye, Ms. Ji.

531
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,700
Stop thinking about it.

532
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,400
It's her matter after all.

533
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,600
You can't shoulder that for her no matter how close you two are.

534
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,100
I just don't get it.

535
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,700
Why did Shiyin meet either a bad teacher or a bad student?

536
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,900
Sunian, you must not fall in love early.

537
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,100
Who can I fall in love with?

538
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,300
I heard many girls have been passing notes to you.

539
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,500
Do you have any girls you like?

540
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,800
No.

541
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,200
What about pretty ladies?

542
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,400
I can't see them anyway.

543
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,400
No matter how pretty they are,

544
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,200
it doesn't matter since they are not in front of me.

545
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,000
All right.

546
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm going home. Bye.

547
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,600
Shiyin.

548
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,700
Don't feel sad.

549
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,400
It's not worth it.

550
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,800
They are not worthy of the Little Li Flying Daggers you requested.

551
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,600
Actually, I knew all along.

552
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
You were the one who requested the Little Li Flying Dagger songs.

553
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm sure you like this song a lot.

554
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,600
Every time when I hear you requesting this song,

555
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,300
I would be judging that person.

556
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,400
I think all of them don't suit you.

557
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,300
But I also believe the best Li Xunhuan

558
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,900
will be waiting for you in the future.

559

- Good morning.

562
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,400
Come to my house tonight after school.

563
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,200
I have a huge plan to tell you guys.

564
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
Sure.

565
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,400
Why aren't you feeling excited?

566
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm excited.

567
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
What's wrong with her?

568
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,000
What a jerk Wang Haoran is!

569
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,800
I have been feeling disgusted about him.

570
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,900
<i>[Diligent, Grounded, Efficient, Thoughtful]</i>

571
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,200
Isn't she ashamed to come to school?

572
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,400
Exactly. She was always flaunting in the past.

573
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,200
Now, she's down in the dumps.

574
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,400
What are they talking about?

575
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,600
What's wrong with Lin Shiyin?

576
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Don't you know? She has been embarrassed.

577
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,400
What's wrong with Shiyin?

578
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,500
She got bitten by a dog.

579
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,100
Huanhuan.

580
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,000
Hurry up.

581
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,700
Come to my house tonight to discuss a big plan.

582
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,600
All right.

583
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,400
Why are you looking dejected as well?

584
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,200
Shiyin's not happy.

585
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,200
Although WangHaoran and his mother are both disgusting,

586
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,900
Shiyin is partly at fault too.

587
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,200
Don't say that.

588
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
What's wrong with that?

589
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,800
Have you forgotten how she treated you?

590
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,500
She deserved it.

591
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,200
Shut up!

592
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,959
Why did you appear?

593
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,439
Whenever I hear someone badmouthing Lin Shiyin,

594
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,999
I will appear automatically.

595
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,680
Wait! Aren't you quarreling with her?

596
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,000
So what? If you quarrel with Sunian,

597
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,800
will you leave him be?

598
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,200
If he quarrels with me because of Wang Haoran,

599
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,400
of course, I will.

600
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
Simple-minded. Men are all the same.

601
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,400
- I'm lazy to explain.
- Wait!

602
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,700
I'm excited about celebrating my birthday, but all of you are so dejected.

603
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,300
What now?

604
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,000
Zhang Qi, sorry.

605
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But we are really not in the mood.

606
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,700
Unless we solve Lin Shiyin's issue first.

607
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,800
Fine.

608
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,800
Beg me. I have an idea.

609
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,600
- What is it?
- What is it?

610
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
It's still that idea.

611
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Come. Let's go and eat Pizza Hut.

612
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,300
No. No. It's bad if parents see us.

613
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,000
Shiyin, wait.

614
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,500
Why? Do you want to laugh at me, too?

615
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,400
No.

616
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,900
I don't think it's worth it because of Wang Haoran.

617
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,000
Move aside.

618
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
No.

619
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,000
Ms. Miao,

620
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
are you free tonight?

621
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,600
What is it?

622
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
<i>Students, please pay attention.</i>

623
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,700
<i>Please hear a recital from Grade 11's Wang Haoran.</i>

624
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,400
<i>The title of the recital is "I'm really shameless".</i>

625
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,800
<i>Hello, I am Wang Haoran.</i>

626
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,200
<i>I was the one pestering Lin Shiyin</i>

627
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,400
<i>but I didn't dare to tell the truth</i>

628
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,300
<i>because I'm afraid of my mother.</i>

629
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,000
<i>If she is angry,</i>

630
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
<i>she won't give me any pocket money.</i>

631
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,000
<i>Out there, I'm invincible.</i>

632
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,600
<i>[Announcement Room]
You're only pretending!</i>

633
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,100
<i>You are right. Yes.</i>

634
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,400
<i>- I was only pretending.</i>
- Move.

635
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
No.

636
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,500
Move!

637
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,800
I'll let you in when the announcement is over.

638
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,000
- You're defying my orders?
- You can't go in!

639
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,800
<i>My mother is very strict with me at home.</i>

640
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
<i>Louder!</i>

641
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,800
<i>So, I have to write a report when I'm at home</i>

642
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
<i>even when I want to use the toilet.</i>

643
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
<i>I did everything in my power to steal the limelight.</i>

644
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,800
<i>I bully the ones who perform better at the Drama Club.</i>

645
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,600
<i>I also ordered the basketball team players</i>

646
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,700
<i>to give me all the scoring chances.</i>

647
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,900
<i>But I have to admit that I'm very talented.</i>

648
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>Say something useful!</i>

649
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,200
<i>Keep reflecting on your mistakes.</i>

650
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,800
- You can't go in!
<i>- I fooled many girls.</i>

651
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,700
<i>But Lin Shiyin is a hard target.</i>

652
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,600
<i>So, I got angry</i>

653
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
<i>and told everyone that she was pestering me.</i>

654
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,000
Remember to lock the door when it's over.

655
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,300
Yes!

656
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,600
Shiyin is so pitiful.

657
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,200
We'll be leaving.

658
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,900
Huanhuan.

659
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,300
Come, let's go home together.

660
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,500
What's wrong?

661
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,000
You're still ignoring me?

662
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,400
You've been ignoring me for a long time.

663
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,100
You know that?

664
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,400
You always came to me when we quarreled previously.

665
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,000
This time, you wouldn't talk to me at all.

666
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
Didn't I find you yesterday?

667
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,300
You were the one who didn't open the door.

668
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,800
I was embarrassed yesterday. How could I reconcile with you?

669
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Why didn't you find me earlier?

670
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,900
Who told you to get along with Wang Haoran all the time?

671
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,200
I did it to anger all of you.

672
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,100
Didn't I get so angry until I couldn't eat and drink?

673
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,800
What else do you want me to do?

674
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,600
Don't be angry anymore.

675
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,300
You are so ugly when you're angry.

676
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,500
Got it.

677
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
Do you know what's going on?

678
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,500
No.

679
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Aren't you the friend of all maidens?

680
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,000
This is beyond my understanding.

681
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,100
That's enough.

682
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,400
What are you two doing?

683
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,800
Let's go home and discuss my birthday celebration.

684
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,700
Come, let's go home.

685
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,700
<i>[High School Essay Training Camp]</i>

686
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
What is this?

687
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,900
You're taking us

688
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,000
to an essay training camp on your birthday?

689
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,600
This is a distraction.

690
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,900
Celebrate my birthday at the beach with me on the weekend.

691
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,800
We depart on Saturday morning. Two days and one night.

692
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,300
We'll come back on Sunday night.

693
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,400
Did you become stupid from competition class?

694
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,200
My mother won't agree to it.

695
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,100
This is the key tool.

696
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,100
This is the High School Essay Training Camp that my mother's unit organized.

697
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,200
Two days one night with guidance from famous teachers.

698
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,700
With this, our parents will definitely agree.

699
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,600
They will surely ask Ms. Zhang Ling directly.

700
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,000
My plan is always perfect.

701
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,500
My mother forgot her phone during her business trip.

702
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,700
When the parents call her, they will be calling this phone.

703
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,300
To respond to teachers' calls, I've pre-recorded

704
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,800
my mother's voice messages to reply to anything.

705
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,500
But why don't we go to Xidan District and just eat KFC?

706
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,600
Going to the beach is far and troublesome. Right?

707
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,000
After this, we have people who will go for the NCEE,

708
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,800
study abroad, participate in competitions, work,

709
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,000
and even an arrogant one.

710
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,200
We don't have time to gather anymore.

711
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,000
Shouldn't we leave some wonderful memories?

712
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,600
All right. Dismissed. Action.

713
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,400
I want to join this on the weekend.

714
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,200
It's organized by Zhang Ling's unit?

715
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,900
Why didn't I hear her mention this?

716
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,400
Never heard of it.

717
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,600
Ms. Zhang Ling is too busy.

718
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
She forgot about it so she asked Zhang Qi to gather people for her.

719
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,400
She asked for Zhang Qi's help?

720
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,700
All of us are going.

721
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,200
Let me ask her.

722
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,600
It's so late. Don't call her.

723
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm just calling to ask.

724
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Hello, Zhang Ling.

725
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,400
<i>I'm in a meeting. Be quick.</i>

726
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,000
You're in a meeting so late at night?

727
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,300
I'm hanging up. I don't want to disturb you.

728
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,000
<i>Just say it.</i>

729
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
Xue brought home this flyer

730
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,400
about the High School Essay Training Camp.

731
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,900
She said it's organized by your unit.

732
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,000
Is that true?

733
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
<i>Yes.</i>

734
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,800
There are many famous teachers on this flyer.

735
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,400
It's two days and one night and it's free?

736
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,700
Are you doingsome kind of charity?

737
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,100
<i>It's my idea.</i>

738
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,800
That's great.

739
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm just asking.

740
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,300
Can parents follow along?

741
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,800
<i>No one does that.</i>

742
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,000
<i>Do you think you're special?</i>

743
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
I'm just asking.

744
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,400
- Besides...
- I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

745
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,000
Hello?

746
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,600
She's too busy. I really shouldn't call her at this time.

747
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,000
She hung up beforeI finished talking.

748
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,900
I already told you not to call her.

749
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,500
Seriously.

750
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,600
Xue, just go.

751
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,700
That's not right.

752
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,300
Why do I remember Zhang Qi's birthday is this weekend?

753
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,800
Why did you all choose to study

754
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,600
instead of having a feast?

755
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
