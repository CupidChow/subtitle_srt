164
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
<i>We'll surely win in the next round.</i>

165

<i>Don't touch them before washing your hands.</i>

166

Come!

167
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,200
Hurry, kid!

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,500
Have you washed your hands?

169
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,800
- Not yet?
- Come.

170
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,500
- Thank you, Mister.
- It fell off.

171
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
- Is it sweet?
- I haven't tried it yet.

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
No one wants to play with him.

173
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
- Have some cherries.
- No.

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
It's too sour for me.

175
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,700
It's especially sweet.

176
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,800
Sunian, Zhang Qi, come and take a look.

177
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I just washed them. Here.

178
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
This photo... This photo is very precious.

179
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Who is it?

180
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,000
Look over here.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
- Is there anyone you know?
- Mr. Sun.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,800
Baiqing?

183
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
He's wearing a protective suit.

184
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
That's right.

185
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
You're right.

186
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,000
Can you guys tell which one of them is Baiqing?

187

191

Sunian, can you not spoil our mood?

- Eat up.
- Thank you.

You should eat up. Why are you serving her? Just eat your pizza.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
You guys should eat up.

195
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,800
This meal is on me.

196
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,500
Why are you suddenly treating us to a meal?

197
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,100
I just want to thank everyone for taking care of me.

198
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,000
You're too courteous.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,400
I'll treat you guys to a meal next month.

200
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
At least you had treated us to a meal before,

201
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,000
unlike someone who hasn't treated us to a meal before.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Do you know how many people want to treat me to a meal?

203
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,600
You guys are taking my presence for granted.

204
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,100
Wu Huan, did something happen?

205
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
I...

206
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,160
I don't plan to continue my studies.

207
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,000
During the epidemic, I couldn't find a job.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,700
We were really tight on cash.

209
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,600
So I plan to work hard and earn money.

210
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,800
And with my grades,

211
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I think there's no need for me to continue my studies.

212
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,000
So after this meal,

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
we will cease to be classmates.

214
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
But we will be friends forever.

215
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,500
I will work hard and earn more money so that I can treat you guys to better meals.

216
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
I wish you guys luck.

217
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Good luck to me as well.

218
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,100
I wish you luck.

219
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,100
What are you doing? Aren't you eating?

220
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,200
It's about Wu Huan. He's going to drop out of school.

221
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Why?

222
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
He needs to work and support his family.

223
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,600
He needs to take care of his mother, too.

224
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,700
This child has had it rough since young.

225
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,400
Of course. He was born without a father.

226
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,000
His mother is always sick as well.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,200
They're barely surviving with the government's aid.

228
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,600
I heard that Wu Huan was working during his free time.

229
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,400
But when the epidemic came,

230
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,800
it was even tougher for him.

231
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,500
I realized that I wasn't his true friend.

232
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,100
I didn't even know that he was in such a difficult position.

233
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,600
And he treated us to a meal at Pizza Hut today.

234
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,400
Eating is the only thing you know.

235
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,600
How much did you eat?

236
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,700
Remember to return the money to him tomorrow.

237
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,500
That's not suitable.

238
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,700
Wu Huan takes after Xin Jie. They have great pride.

239
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,200
Wu Huan is nothing like her.

240
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Wu Huan has a nice personality.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,700
He's unlike his mother at all.

242
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
How about this?

243
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's create a donation fund for him in secret to pay for his living expenses.

244
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That way, he'll be able to go to school.

245
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,600
If you truly want to do this,

246
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,100
I'll be the first to donate.

247
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,200
Xue! Xue.

248
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,400
Zhang Qi? Have you eaten?

249
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,200
Mister, Madam. I had my dinner outside.

250
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
In the future, you can come to our house for dinner when your mother isn't around.

251
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,300
You're too courteous. I've never treated you guys as outsiders.

252
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,400
- Why were you looking for me?
- Come on. I have something huge to discuss with you.

253
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
I'll leave now.

254
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
- Hurry!
- Let me change my shoes!

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,400
This child is so reckless.

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Our daughter is getting more and more sensible.

257
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,100
She takes after you.

258
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Of course.

259
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,500
It'll be troublesome if she takes after you.

260
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,400
I summoned everyone here today to discuss Wu Huan's matter.

261
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,900
Wu Huan is dropping out of school mainly because of huge economic pressure.

262
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,900
- Why don't we...
- Set up a plan to help him get through this?

263
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,400
- How did you know what I was going to say?
- Because we are always in sync!

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,100
Sunian, what do you think?

265
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,999
I'm not sure about that.

266
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,200
It's Wu Huan's decision to drop out of school.

267
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
Actually, we shouldn't interfere.

268
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,200
I agree.

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,000
We just need to set up a fund and deliver the money to him.

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,200
As for the money itself,

271
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,500
he can choose whether to use it for school or to pay his living expenses.

272
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I agree.

273
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,800
All right. Let's do it tomorrow.

274
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,100
I can only help out.

275
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,600
I won't join you guys.

276
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Why?

277
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Everyone has a right to choose.

278
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
They don't need others to interfere with their decisions.

279
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
But he's our good friend.

280
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,300
Even so, he can make his own choice.

281
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,600
We should respect his decision.

282
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,100
Bye.

283
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,200

Who's here?

331
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,900
My friends are here.

332

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400

334
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,300
Sit down.

335
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,880

Thank you.

338
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,100
You guys haven't eaten yet, right? I'll make lunch for you guys.

339

No need for that. We're here to deliver good news to you.

I'm really grateful to you guys for this.

346
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But I can't accept this.

347
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,400
Wu Huan, it was hard for us to collect this amount of money.

348
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
We don't mean anything else. We just want to help you.

349

I appreciate your kind intention.

351
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,800
But please take back the money.

352
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Wu Huan, serve your friends some fruits.

353
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800

00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000

How's your mother doing lately?

360
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,200
She's doing fine. But she's quite busy.

361
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,000
She's always on a business trip.

What should we do with the money?

368
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why don't we mail the money to him?

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,200
Wu Huan won't accept it.

370
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,600
But I heard that he accepted the Restoration Division's donation.

371
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
That's right. He accepted the school teachers' donation as well.

372
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,500
Why is he accepting their donation but not ours?

373
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,400
Wu Huan won't accept our donation simply because of us.

374
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,500
He's trying to protect the last sliver of his pride.

375
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
What should we do then?

376
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,800
Since it has come to this,

377
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
there's only one person we can turn to.

378
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,400
Who is it?

379
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,200
Lin Shiyin.

380

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
I scolded your son today.

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,400
You're here to get even with me, huh?

387
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,600
Seems like your son is totally spoiled, huh?

388
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,800
He can't even take a mild scolding like that?

389
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you know what my son is doing?

390
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,700
Every day, right after school, he has to go to work!

391
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,000
He's serving customers!

392

I'm an unlucky wretch.

393

I wasn't good enough to stay in the same division as you.

394

My son is unlucky as well!

You can't stay like this forever!

your paintings contain both motion and stillness.

if you knew how much I admired you back then,

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
you would know how sorry I feel for you.

419

Senior, for some things, after you put them down,

420
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:26,934
you can pick them up again.

421
00:22:26,934 --> 00:22:28,700
Do it for your child's sake.

422

Although he didn't show the steps, the answer is correct.

487
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,563
That means your question is too simple.

488
00:27:57,564 --> 00:27:59,123
Give him a new question.

489
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:00,643
A cubic equation is more or less the same as a quadratic equation.

490
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:04,094
Mr. Zhang, give me a quartic equation question.

491
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:30,474
Can you understand it?

492
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:32,693
I can't.

493
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:35,154
I think even undergraduates can't understand it.

494
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:38,453
He finished the question.

495
00:28:38,454 --> 00:28:40,224
Is it correct?

496
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:53,894
You're amazing.

497
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:56,053
Was Zhang Qi that amazing before?

498
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:58,663
Wait! Why is he only showing the answer without the steps?

499
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:00,323
I'm sure you memorized the questions.

500
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:03,413
For one variable cubic and quartic equations, they have their root formula.

501
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:07,543
So as long as you're used to the questions, you'll be able to solve them by doing substitutions.

502
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:10,264
Not all subjects are as long-winded as Language.

503
00:29:10,264 --> 00:29:12,123
Every language question is a waste of our time.

504
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,883
He's right.

505
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,694
What do you mean by that?

506
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:17,804
He's right about the first half.

507
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,194
Mr. Liu, if you don't believe me,

508
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:23,894
you can ask Mr. Zhang to come up with a quintic equation question.

509
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:25,984
A quintic equation doesn't have a root formula.

510
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:28,463
I can only solve those which have depressed polynomial

511
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:30,434
because it's not included in the Galois group.

512
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:32,023
You're a genius.

513

00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,824
<i>Xue! Xue!</i>

647
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:20,154
My silly son.

648
00:38:20,154 --> 00:38:21,243
Mom, why are you here?

649
00:38:21,244 --> 00:38:23,604
Why can't I be here?

650
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:26,953
Zhang Qi, just now, your mother said

651
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:28,394
she would pack you and send you to me.

652
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:30,934
But you showed up of your own accord. You can stay here tonight.

653
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,544
Madam, is Xue home?

654
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,803
No. Why?

655
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:36,734
I didn't see her after school.

656
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:38,983
Maybe she's avoiding you because she doesn't want to see you.

657
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,354
How is that possible?

658
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:43,854
Zhang Qi, have you guys obtained your test result?

659
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,704
Yeah.

660
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:48,094
How did Xue do on the test?

661
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,194
- Madam, I'll make a move first.
- Zhang Qi!

662
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,724
Ms. Dongge is speaking to you.

663
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:54,024
Zhang Qi, it's fine.

664
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:56,704
Just tell me how she did on the test.

665
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,704
She...

666
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,624
Her grades are still the same!

667
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:06,254
- I'm sure she messed up the test.
- Ge.

668
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:08,493
She didn't dare to come back because of her lousy grade.

669
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:09,683
Ge, where are you going?

670
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,943
- Ge?
- I'm sure she messed up the test.

671
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:13,453
- Calm down! She's just a child!
- Madam.

672
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:14,723
Don't follow me. It's fine.

673
00:39:14,724 --> 00:39:17,373
- I'll look for her.
- Ge!

674
00:39:17,374 --> 00:39:18,533
- What's wrong?
- It's about Xue.

675
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:20,384
- It's nothing.
- What happened to Xue?

676
00:39:20,384 --> 00:39:22,723
Ge! Calm down!

677
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:24,934
Where are you going?

678
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:27,434
Wait! Wear your shoes first.

679
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,364
Where are you going in your slippers?

680
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:30,603
Where are you guys going?

681
00:39:30,604 --> 00:39:31,603
I'm going to find Xue.

682
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:32,723
Xue?

683
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:34,803
We saw Xue at the sundry shop

684
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:36,794
when we were buying groceries.

685
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:39,474
Dongge! What happened?

686
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:42,634
Dongge is furious because Xue messed up her test!

687
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,244
Ge!

688
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:53,314
Speak nicely.

689
00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:56,584
What did Xue do again?

690
00:39:56,584 --> 00:39:58,224
It's nothing.

691
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,604
Mom.

692
00:40:04,724 --> 00:40:06,634
Let's go home!

693
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:08,013
Dad! Dad!

694
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:09,834
- Let's talk over this!
- Her bicycle!

695
00:40:09,834 --> 00:40:10,853
Send it to us later!

696
00:40:10,854 --> 00:40:12,394
Try your best only to lecture and educate, all right?

697
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:14,103
- Speak nicely!
- Okay!

698
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:16,384
- You!
- Sunian, come!

699
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,193
Dongge! Let's talk over this!

700
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,373
- It's fine.
- Be gentle.

701
00:40:22,374 --> 00:40:24,423
- Xue, don't be afraid.
- Ge, you see...

702
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:25,643
It's fine.

703
00:40:25,643 --> 00:40:27,853
- Wait!
- This is nothing.

704
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:29,344
- Dongge!
- Ge!

705
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,803
It's fine!

706
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,394
Don't worry.

707
00:40:32,394 --> 00:40:34,364
Dongge!

708
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:35,973
- It's fine.
- Calm down.

709
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:39,174
Dongge, I'm still outside.

710
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:43,283
Hold it right there!

711
00:40:43,283 --> 00:40:44,894
- Stop right there!
- Dongge, don't intimidate your child!

712
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:46,993
- Protect Xue, okay?
- Let's talk another day!

713
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:49,704
I think she should be fine.

714
00:40:49,704 --> 00:40:51,704
Forget it. Let's go.

715
00:40:55,474 --> 00:41:00,024
Do you think Xue can overcome this ordeal?

716
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:04,914
It doesn't look good for her.

717
