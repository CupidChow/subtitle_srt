about who you want Xue to marry?

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,510
I've never...

47
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,060
I never really thought about who she will marry.

49
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,010
someone like you is not bad.

What's that expression?

61
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,311
So that's your reaction after all this time apart?

62
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,123

Why did you come back this time?

77
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,290
I'm going to take the postgraduate admission test soon.

78
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,730
I came back to visit everyone.

79
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,550
It's lonely being here alone.

80
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,830
Are you still single?

81
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,270
What's wrong with being single?

82
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,370
Why don't you find a girlfriend?

83
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,880
No one is good enough for me perhaps.

84
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,460
You're still the same.

85
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,660
You still like to run that mouth of yours.

86
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,570
Are you planning to ask Xue to move in with you?

87
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,450
I haven't told her yet.

88
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,410
How do you plan to tell her?

89
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,670
Just tell her directly.

90
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,650
How can you do that?

91
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,600
Girls always want something special.

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,950
If you simply do it, there will be arguments in the future.

93
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,570
Did you study crosstalk abroad?

94

Just trust me.

96

Why are you staring at me?

97
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,920
You have never been in a relationship before.

98
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,000
How did you get all this experience?

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,900
If you don't believe me, ask Lin Shiyin.

100
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,950
She has had many relationships.

101
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,190
You want Xue to move in with you?

102
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,070
Don't you know...

103
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,890
Don't I know what?

104
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,600
Nothing.

105
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,410
How do you want me to help you?

106
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,770
Just tell me

107
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,200
whether Xue likes to do things in a special way.

108
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,920
No.

109
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,013
That's great.

110
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,290
But that doesn't mean you don't need to do it.

111
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,850
It's something real.

112
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,881
It will become memories that you will look back on in the future.

113

Zhang Qi is really the friend of all women.

114

Do you know what kind of special things that Xue likes?

115
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,460
You've asked the right person.

116
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,580
When I was young, I asked Xue a question

117
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,060
about whether she wanted her lover to appear riding on rainbow clouds

118
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,530
or come by helicopter.

119
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,580
What do you think her answer was?

120
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,330
Riding a broomstick.

121
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,680
She also wants the Nimbus 2000.

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,060
Don't doubt it.

123
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,550
I'm sure you know how much she loves Harry Potter.

124
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,083
Keep going.

125
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:15,670

Doing that will make me closer to her so I'll have a better chance.

You haven't given up after all these years?

167

Think about it.

168

If we work together in the same city in the future,

169

we can take care of each other, too.

170
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,960
Besides, I'm not good at chasing girls.

171

You can give me some ideas.

172

Well...

173

I still need to consider it.

Sure. Just think about it.

175
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,600
But if Huanyu wants to hire you,

176
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
you must never let the chance slip by.

I've heard of it.

Also, I heard it's quite a busy job.

I can only come back once a year in the future.

I don't want you to leave either.

322

I am almost 50 years old now.

323
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:11,995
There's a fierce woman in the family.

324
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:17,745
I only have a cute and active daughter to make me happy.

325
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:20,165
Do you think I want you to leave?

326
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:29,265
Speaking of which, the opportunity is yours.

327
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:33,510
You will be responsible for your choice

328
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,585
and its consequences.

329
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:40,035
So you don't need to listen to anyone

330
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,455
about whether to go or not.

331
00:22:42,455 --> 00:22:44,945
Just follow your heart.

332
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:50,305
Dad, why are you so nice?

333
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:52,965
Your mother is the one who's nice.

334
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:57,605
She helped you with everything without any complaints.

335
00:22:57,605 --> 00:23:00,155
I dare not be responsible for everything.

336
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:05,605
Because I'm very afraid that one day you'll point at me

337
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:08,415
and say it was all because of me.

338
00:23:11,135 --> 00:23:13,955
Tell me then.

339
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:16,935
If I go,

340
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:19,365
will my mom get sick from anger?

341
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,715
Definitely.

342
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,125
But it's all right.

343
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,275
She'll be fine...

344
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:29,935
because parents are best at compromising.

345
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:37,105
Tell me. Can I really selfishly abandon

346
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:42,125
the person I love for my dreams?

347
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,755
How can you say that?

348
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,305
Will you sever ties with us after you leave?

349
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:51,345
Don't feel so burdened.

350
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:54,165
We have our own lives.

351
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:59,660
Maybe both of us will become active again after you leave.

352
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:08,205
So, ask yourself whether you want to go or not.

353
00:24:09,195 --> 00:24:11,545
If you want to go,

354
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:13,985
I will...

355
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:17,825
help you with the rest.

356
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,605
Sure.

357
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:25,885
Dad, cheers!

358
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:33,675
What?

359
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,275
Sunian rented an apartment?

360
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,126
Yes. He wants to live with you.

361
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:40,255
He played Harry Potter yesterday to invite you.

362
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,135
He can tell me that directly.

363
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:45,565
Whose idea was it that made him go through all that?

364
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:51,955
Shiyin, what's wrong?

365
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,900
Why are you so quiet?

366
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:56,238
It's fine.

367
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,925
But, Xue,

368
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:02,735
I think you need to tell Sunian as soon as possible.

369
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:06,165
Tell him about what?

370
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:11,435
I received a job offer from Huanyu's headquarters.

371
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:14,075
That's good news. Why won't you tell him?

372
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,745
You're afraid that he won't agree?

373
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:24,025
I haven't told him about my previous travel overseas for my interview.

374
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:28,595
Xue, you gave up an opportunity of studying abroad during high school.

375
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:30,745
That was such a waste.

376
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:32,235
You can't miss it this time.

377
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:34,175
Talk to him.

378
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,035
<i>[Xue: Sunian, are you getting off work? I'm going to find you.]</i>

379
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:44,705
Mr. Luo, we are leaving.

380
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,420
<i>[I'll go and find you.]</i>

381
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,870
<i>[Let me find you. I'll bring you to a place tonight]</i>

382
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,685
- Master.
- Help me deliver this to Mr. Sun later.

383
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:16,365
Tell him I bought this especially for him.

384
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:18,315
Then, you can get off work.

385
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,025
Has Xue decided to go abroad?

386
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:30,405
Yes.

387
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:34,565
She received an email from overseas, right?

388
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:38,165
She went there for two weeks for that interview.

389
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,325
If she didn't want this opportunity,

390
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,075
why did she go so far for an interview?

391
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,985
<i>Are you willing to let her go?</i>

392
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:46,955
<i>Old Man.</i>

393
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:49,055
<i>I'm not.</i>

394
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:52,515
<i>Working abroad is different from studying abroad.</i>

395
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:55,265
<i>If she's doing well, she will be staying there.</i>

396
00:26:55,265 --> 00:27:00,655
Besides, she will feel sad if she can't go.

397
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:02,515
I want to ask you.

398
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:08,325
Don't you feel sad when Baiqing went abroad?

399
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:10,195
There's nothing to be sad about.

400
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,835
<i>Look at you. You are overthinking.</i>

401
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:14,515
<i>Our children have grown up.</i>

402
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:16,325
<i>They have their own ideas.</i>

403
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:20,025
<i>As a parent, we should support them whenever possible.</i>

404
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:57,065
Are you surprised?

405
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:02,745
Yes.

406
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,518
Xue.

407
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,205
You are good at lying sometimes

408
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,845
but sometimes, you're not.

409
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,845
I... I'm not lying.

410
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:19,965
You got a job offer

411
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,725
but you didn't tell me.

412
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:23,845
When were you planning to tell me?

413
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:27,975
I... I came here today to tell you about it.

414
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:30,325
I didn't tell you previously because

415
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:33,745
I hadn't thought of how to tell you.

416
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:37,775
Have you thought it through now?

417
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,995
Not yet.

418
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:43,745
But I don't want to hide it from you anymore.

419
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:47,235
When you went to the interview,

420
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:49,535
you'd already thought about everything.

421
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:54,035
I went to the interview because I thought it was an important opportunity.

422
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:56,505
I wanted to give it a try to see if I could get the job.

423
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:58,845
I'll decide later whether to go or not.

424
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:01,415
You should have told me then.

425
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:03,365
Am I that unimportant?

426
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:05,185
No. It's because you are too important.

427
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:06,925
That is why I was not sure how to tell you.

428
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,795
I'm afraid...

429
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:12,215
I'm afraid you might not understand.

430
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:16,805
If I don't understand you, who does? Mo Hai?

431
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,325
Why are you bringing him up again?

432
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:19,645
Both of you went together.

433
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:20,955
He is just my senior.

434
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:22,995
He is your senior now. What about in the future?

435
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,805
Are you trying to deliberately start a quarrel again?

436
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,715
I'm starting a quarrel?

437
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:29,405
When you were planning your future with someone else,

438
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:30,925
I was decorating our home!

439
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:32,925
When did I plan my future with someone else?

440
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:36,335
This is the home that you wanted. Not the home that I wanted.

441
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:54,525
So, you don't want me as well?

442
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:56,966
No. That's... That's not what I mean.

443
00:29:56,966 --> 00:30:01,615
I... I... I'm just very confused. I...

444
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:04,545
Sunian.

445
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:09,315
Sorry, I...

446
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:11,475
Let's talk about it next time.

447
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,100
<i>[Wenrentang Pharmacy]</i>

448
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,135
<i>[Counter]</i>

449
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:08,968
Xue.

450
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,588
Shao Xue.

451
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:26,165
Why are you here?

452
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:28,575
Mr. Qian asked me to take care of his shop.

453
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:35,465
How was your talk with Sunian?

454
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:41,405
Zhang Qi, tell me.

455
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:45,025
Can you only choose one between the person you like

456
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:47,695
and the thing you like to do?

457
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:49,935
Sunian doesn't agree?

458
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:54,565
I shouldn't have gone for the interview and hidden it from him.

459
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:57,898
Xue, you shouldn't think that.

460
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:00,946
- Actually...
- Boss. Check out, please.

461
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:02,688
Coming.

462
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,785
Don't mind me. I'm leaving.

463
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:23,725
<i>Sunian.</i>

464
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:26,645
<i>Zheng Sunian.</i>

465
00:32:27,605 --> 00:32:29,445
<i>Open the door.</i>

466
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,985
<i>Zheng Sunian.</i>

467
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:34,245
What is it?

468
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,785
What's wrong? Am I not welcomed here?

469
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:44,365
We are both adults.

470
00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:46,098
Drink with me.

471
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:10,805
I saw Xue just now.

472
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,765
Did you two have a quarrel?

473
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,235
Because she lied to you about the interview abroad?

474
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:19,685
There's no need for her to lie to me.

475
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:22,336
Didn't she lie to you because she thought you wouldn't let her go abroad?

476
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,715
But it's true that I don't want her to go.

477
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,515
Who are you to disagree with it?

478
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:28,065
She already gave up once for you.

479
00:33:28,065 --> 00:33:29,935
Gave up on what?

480
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:32,805
The exchange student opportunity in high school.

481
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:34,425
Why do you think she didn't go?

482
00:33:34,425 --> 00:33:37,115
- She failed the interview.
- And you believed her?

483
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:39,825
She got 8.5 in her IELTS.

484
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,195
Ms. Jin Ning just passed away at that time.

485
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,015
You were so dejected.

486
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:52,935
You skipped classes all the time.

487
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:57,010
She was afraid no one would accompany you if she left.

488
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,605
I'd rather she had left then.

489
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,975
If she left then, how can you be who you are today?

490
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:12,340
Sunian, it wasn't easy for Xue to lie to you.

491
00:34:13,205 --> 00:34:14,305
But you should know

492
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:17,115
that she's always wanted to go abroad since she was young.

493
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:19,995
This is a rare opportunity for her.

494
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
She told me the things that are most important to her are to go abroad and you.

495
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:27,085
She doesn't know what to do either.

496
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,365
Sometimes, you need to learn to let go.

497
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:34,550
Even if you let her go abroad, she'll still come back.

498
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,715
Have a chat when you're both free.

499
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,558
Cheers.

500
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:09,628
Mom.

501
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,905
I haven't visited you for some time.

502

<i>[Madam Jin Ning's Grave]</i>

503
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,645
You won't blame me, right?

504
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:33,105
You used to say that I was quiet.

505
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:36,805
I kept everything inside my heart.

506
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,305
I have something to say now.

507
00:35:44,595 --> 00:35:47,095
But I don't know who I should say it to.

508
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:03,115
Mr. Zheng, you're back?

509
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:04,205
Xue.

510
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,735
You bought so many things.

511
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:06,995
<i>[Beijing Instant Noodles]</i>
It's my afternoon break.

512
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:09,795
I wanted to buy some things and bring them back.

513
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,630
- Let me help you.
- There's no need.

514
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,440
It's fine.

515
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,775
Come in.

516
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:30,538
Mr. Zheng, why did you buy so many instant noodles?

517
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:31,955
Sunian is not here.

518
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:34,135
I don't want to cook alone.

519
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:35,245
This is convenient.

520
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:36,785
Come and eat at our house then.

521
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:39,390
It's unhealthy to keep eating instant noodles.

522
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:49,925
Put this over there.

523
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:56,205
<i>When Ms. Jin Ning was still around,</i>

524
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:58,925
<i>Mr. Zheng was totally different.</i>

525
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,435
<i>He was still quiet</i>

526
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,765
<i>but his eyes were always smiling.</i>

527
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:06,705
<i>Unlike now, his eyes are always empty.</i>

528
00:37:06,705 --> 00:37:09,135
<i>I suddenly feel afraid.</i>

529
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:14,705
<i>What will happen to Sunian</i>

530
00:37:14,705 --> 00:37:16,825
<i>if I suddenly go somewhere else?</i>

531
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,475
What else? Right.

532
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:19,885
I need to take this to Sunian's house.

533
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:22,935
- Let me do it, Mr. Zheng.
- Sure. Here.

534
00:37:28,685 --> 00:37:31,555
Many things have happened recently.

535
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:33,895
I quarreled with Xue.

536
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,265
I know.

537
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:40,075
She didn't lie to me on purpose.

538
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,225
She was afraid that I would be worried.

539
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:53,025
It was partially your fault, too.

540
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:57,435
You told her so many stories back then.

541
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:01,655
You made her look forward to the outside world.

542
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:05,145
You also liked going everywhere in the past.

543
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:11,005
When Dad brought you back,

544
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,775
did you complain about him?

545
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:18,445
But both of you were so happy after that.

546
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:22,635
Does it mean...

547
00:38:25,235 --> 00:38:27,785
that even if I'm selfish for once,

548
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,525
it'll be okay?

549
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:39,575
As long as I treat her very well...

550
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:42,535
just like how Dad treated you,

551
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:47,465
Xue...

552
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:53,255
will also be very happy.

553
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,268
Right?

554
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,850
<i>[I and Xue's Room]</i>

555
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:36,855
Xue, I'm going back to work.

556
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:38,685
When you leave later, just lock the door.

557
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:43,375
Mr. Zheng, I'm going with you.

558
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:51,545
You saw and heard about the outside world.

559
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:54,905
But she hasn't been there yet.

560
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:58,905
Her dream is within reach

561
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,935
but she has to give up.

562
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:05,235
And the reason for that every time...

563
00:41:07,815 --> 00:41:09,675
is me.

564
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:12,485
Now,

565
00:41:15,795 --> 00:41:18,495
she's probably feeling quite sad. Right?

566
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:29,385
I can't bear...

567
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:38,755
to see her feel sad.
