Ms. Kang, is today an important occasion?

What's with all the delicious food?

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,180
Today...

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,430
Today is his death anniversary.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,900
Actually, I don't even know if it's today.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,630
His body was discovered three days after he jumped into the lake.

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,330
That's why I don't want to face these three days

Why did I tell you all of these things?

44
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:17,940
You're still young. Now, you just need to believe

45

that this world is filled with great things.

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,290
Ms. Kang, your makeup today looks amazing.

47
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,999
Can you teach me how to put on makeup?

48
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,629
My makeup skills were terrible back then.

49
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,590
Zhang Qi even teased me for it.

50
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,909
Okay. I'll teach you how to put on makeup.

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,420
If you two still don't agree to it, I'll skip school tomorrow as well.

- Shiyin.
- Stop following me!

Where... Where are you going?

67
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,080

But my mother isn't happy with it.

87
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,620
So why did you take up broadcasting in the first place?

88
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,040
I was born to be a host, okay?

89

- How dare you laugh at me?
- I'm not laughing at you.

Have you been a host before?

I've only done it at the school's radio station.

I'm afraid you won't be able to convince your parents with this.

94
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,789
You need to let them witness your performance as a host.

So what should I do?

96

I have an idea. The place I worked in is going to hold their anniversary celebration soon.

97
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,899
I'll beg my supervisor to let you be the emcee of that event.

98

Moreover, how can you be on TV

- Yeah.

159

This child doesn't behave like this usually.

160

We spoiled her rotten at home.

161
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,940
Actually, Shiyin is pretty amazing.

162
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,820
She's performing very well considering it's her first time doing it.
- But...you will get another chance in the future.

163
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,140
- Mister. Madam. I'm sure you two are most concerned about Shiyin.

164
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,549
This time, she isn't being willful. She's serious about it.

Sunian... this is your first time here, right?

169
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,220
Actually, it's my first time here as well.

170
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,629
Actually, I was pretty afraid.

171
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,530
I was afraid that I might have become dumber and uglier.

172
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,339
What should I do if I didn't live up to Ms. Jin Ning's expectations?

173
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,240
If I were as exceptional as you,

174
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,809
I'm sure I can visit Ms. Jin Ning with my head held high.

Let's go.

176
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,650
Sunian, it's over here.

177
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,909
<i>[Grave of Ms. Jin Ning]</i>
Ms. Jin Ning, Sunian and I are here to visit you.

178
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:12,669
Ms. Jin Ning, these are your favorite cakes and flowers.

179
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:16,630
Sunian bought all of these especially for you.

180
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,299
Ms. Jin Ning, I've finished all the books you gave me.

181
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,319
Now, my English result is very stable.

182
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,509
I almost got a full score for every subject except for the essays.

183
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,290
I'm amazing, right?

184
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,869
Shiyin has taken up broadcasting.

185
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,439
In the future, she'll be a famous host.

186
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,929
If you were still around,

187
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:40,550
I'm sure you'd watch her show every day.

188
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,229
By the way, Siyuan and Qiaomu have become a couple.

189
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,640
Oh, I forgot the main point.

190
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,919
Sunian is studying art now. He's trying to get into the Academy of Fine Arts.

191
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,069
He's determined to complete the drawings you couldn't complete.

192
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:56,269
I think this is a tough task to complete.

193
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,100
But I think Sunian can surely do it.

194
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,160
Ms. Jin Ning, I'm sure you think I'm talking too much.

195
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,030
Why don't I ask Sunian to speak with you?

196
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,210
Don't leave!

197
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,670
I don't know what to say.

198
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,850
Ever since she was hospitalized,

199
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,210
I was so afraid that I had to stay behind my father.

200
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,470
I only dared to speak when she spoke to me.

201
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,870
On the day she left,

202
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,239
I actually had plenty of things I wanted to tell her.

203
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:49,249
I wanted to tell her that I loved her and I admired her.

204
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:53,000
I feel very proud whenever I call her "Mom."

205
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,610
But I told her nothing.

206
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,690
I just looked at her.

207
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,820
I didn't say a word.

208
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,480
She asked my father a question.

209
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,839
She thought I was afraid of her

210
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,480
because of her hideous looks.

211
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,400
I wanted to tell her that it wasn't the case.

212
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,240
It wasn't the case at all.

213
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,380
I was just afraid.

214
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,450
The way she looked at me...

215
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,690
was filled with regret and distress.

216
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,900
From her eyes,

217
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,630
I could tell that she was wondering how I could cope...

218
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,900
after she passed away?

219
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,450
Xue, I regret my decision!

220
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,199
I regret that I didn't tell her how I felt

221
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,509
when she was still alive.

222
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,210
I regret that I didn't hug her...

223
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,670
and tell her,

224
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,900
"Mom,

225
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,180
I do love you very much.

226
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,880
You're not scary at all.

227
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,749
You've always been the mother whom I admired the most."

228
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,050
But I told her nothing.

229
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,840
Now, she's gone.

230
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,400
It's useless for me to say all of these

231
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,960
in front of her grave.

232
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,760
She can't hear me anyway.

233
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,960
Sunian, that's not true.

234
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,550
As long as they're your heartfelt words,

235
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,470
I'm sure Ms. Jin Ning can hear you.

I won't disappoint you.

Ms. Jin Ning, please give Sunian your blessings.

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:17,419
<i>[Academy of Fine Arts Batch 2004 Admission List]</i>

317
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,170
<i>[Traditional Chinese Painting, Zheng Sunian]</i>

318
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:24,481
Did Sunian receive his admission notice?

319
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:26,012
Yeah.

320
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:28,742
Now, everyone else can let out a sigh of relief.

321
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:31,482
This child is exceptional.

322
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,281
It's hard to get into that academy.

323
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:35,031
But he did it anyway.

324
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:36,912
He suffered a lot for it.

325
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:38,541
There were plenty of medicinal patches

326
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,092
on his arms and shoulders.

327
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:42,991
Zheng said it was the effect of practicing his drawing 24/7.

328
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:46,992
I think he didn't suffer for nothing since he got into the academy.

329
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,072
Only Xue is left.

330
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:55,582
You're only nervous now?

331
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:27,861
Sunian!

332
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:29,632
Mr. Zheng!

333
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:33,632
Sunian! Sunian!

334
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,332
What's the matter?

335
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,851
Sunian, our hairdryer is broken.

336
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:43,522
Can I borrow your hairdryer?

337
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:45,962
Come in.

338
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:51,512
Sunian, where's Mr. Zheng?

339
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:53,482
He went out to buy breakfast.

340
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,382
Next time, don't go outside when your hair is wet.

341
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:02,552
It's because my hairdryer is broken.

342
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:12,362
Let me do it.

343
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,511
Let me blow your hair dry.

344
00:26:13,512 --> 00:26:14,711
It's okay. I can do it myself.

345
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:16,911
The electricity will leak as it hasn't been used for a while.

346
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:19,001
It's the same no matter who does it.

347
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,241
I can block the current with my hand.

348
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:20,991
That won't do.

349
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,101
Electrifying my head is a better option.

350
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,242
You need to use your hands to draw.

351
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,102
Turn around.

352
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:37,892
And here. This part is wet.

353
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,101
It's almost done. I think it's okay now. Sunian, I'll leave now.

354
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:52,851
No. It's not dry yet.

355
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:54,712
You'll catch a cold.

356
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:35,652
Sunian, I have something to discuss with you.

357
00:27:35,652 --> 00:27:37,342
What's the matter?

358
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:45,721
Can you trim your bangs just a little bit?

359
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:49,071
- Why?
- They're too long. They're blocking your eyes.

360
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:51,932
You shouldn't let them block your beautiful eyes.

361
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:55,192
Sunian, time for breakfast.

362
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:57,962
Mr. Zheng, you're back?

363
00:27:57,962 --> 00:27:59,652
Xue?

364
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:01,141
Have you eaten breakfast yet?

365
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:02,761
- Not yet.
- Great timing.

366
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,231
You can share it with Sunian.

367
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:06,301
If this is not enough, I think there are some biscuits over there.

368
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,762
Mr. Zheng, aren't you going to join us?

369
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:10,101
I'll eat breakfast on my way to work.

370
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:12,091
I have to go. It's time to work.

371
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,431
- Goodbye, Mr. Zheng.
- Goodbye.

372
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:19,002
Xue, accompany me to buy some fruit later.

373
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:20,422
Sure.

374
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,061
I need to send some fruit to Mr. Luo.

375
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:24,381
I managed to get into the Academy of Fine Arts

376
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:26,582
thanks to his guidance.

377
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,731
What do you wish to eat? I'll buy some for you, too.

378
00:28:30,682 --> 00:28:32,872
Bananas, apples, pears, strawberries, oranges!

379
00:28:32,872 --> 00:28:36,022
Let's finish our breakfast and buy them!

380
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:37,482
Okay.

381
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:45,432
Mr. Qian, seems like your shop is fancier right now.

382
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,481
Didn't you only sell apples and pears in the past?

383
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:49,331
Look at all the fruits you have right now.

384
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:51,141
People strive to improve themselves, right?

385
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:54,702
I've purchased some high-quality fruits, too.

386
00:28:54,702 --> 00:28:56,961
How much does a box of cherries cost?

387
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:59,411
Usually, it's 80 yuan. But I'll sell it to you for 60.

388
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:02,612
60? This is daylight robbery! These are just big cherries.

389
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:04,101
Who are you trying to fool?

390
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:06,101
Mr. Qian, get me two boxes of them.

391
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:08,011
- All right.
- Wait!

392
00:29:08,732 --> 00:29:10,781
I would rather swallow the money directly.

393
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,271
It's my treat.

394
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,711
Why are you being stingy?

395
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,541
Even so, it's still your money.

396
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:16,821
You need to save your money.

397
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:19,551
You'll have to spend a lot when you're studying in the future.

398
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,912
Forget it. How about this?

399
00:29:22,912 --> 00:29:25,312
You guys can have one for free.

400
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,511
What do you think?

401
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:36,122
- Isn't it sweet?
- It's pretty sweet.

402
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,232
It's sweet and delicious.

403
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:39,581
Since it's delicious, you should buy some.

404
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:40,632
No, thanks.

405
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:43,771
Well, that was a waste. Why didn't you guys invite me?

406
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,172
I'm going to visit Mr. Luo later.

407
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:47,502
I'm buying some fruits for him.

408
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:48,721
Seems like no one else will remember me

409
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:50,322
after we get into college.

410
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,002
Goodbye.

411
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:55,131
What do you want? Pick anything.

412
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:56,832
It's my treat.

413
00:29:57,652 --> 00:30:00,571
If so, I want 10 boxes of cherries.

414
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,471
- All right.
- Wait a minute!

415
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:04,631
10 boxes? Are you taking a bath with them?

416
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:07,041
- It's Sunian's treat anyway.
- You!

417
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:10,431
So are you guys buying it or not? Can you guys make a decision?

418
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:12,172
No, we're not buying them.

419
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:15,061
Mr. Qian, you opened a stall?

420
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,721
Ms. Deng.

421
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:17,821
You guys are here, too?

422
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:20,472
Aren't you setting up your stall today?

423
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:21,991
I have to return to my hometown.

424
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:23,471
But why?

425
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:25,522
My son is getting married. I'm returning to help him out.

426
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:28,072
If so, when will you come back?

427
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:31,692
I'm not coming back.

428
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,832
You're not coming back?

429
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:39,191
We had the roujiamo you made since we were little.
<i>(Street food; primarily stewed pork served between bread. Called a Chinese hamburger)</i>

430
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:42,191
Where should we get them when

431
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:43,942
you're not coming back?

432
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,332
She's right, Ms. Deng.

433
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:49,341
When I hear that from you,

434
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:50,711
I guess I didn't spend the past decade

435
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:52,862
selling roujiamo in vain.

436
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:57,472
Ms. Deng, please take care of yourself.

437
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:59,652
We will miss you.

438
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:05,041
You guys should also be obedient and take good care of yourselves.

439
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,411
I still need to catch my train.

440
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:08,821
See you.

441
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:11,262
- Goodbye, Ms. Deng.
- Goodbye.

442
00:31:11,262 --> 00:31:13,051
Ms. Deng, have a safe trip.

443
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:14,951
Okay, goodbye. See you guys.

444
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:16,712
Have a safe trip.

445
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:24,112
Ms. Deng is leaving.

446
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:27,362
There's no roujiamo for us now.

447
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:30,702
Mr. Qian, when are you leaving?

448
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:33,141
Thank you for nothing. Can't you say something good for once?

449
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,821
Besides, if I leave and close the shop,

450
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:38,142
who will act as his substitute father when he fails his exam?

451
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:39,761
Where can you stay and cry when you're upset?

452
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:41,621
How can you coax her when she doesn't have a chance to cry?

453
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:44,242
I'm pretty important, you know?

454
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:46,101
How about this? Today,

455
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:48,281
I'll forget about my profit.

456
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,922
You guys can have this box of kumquat on the house.

457
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:55,761
I wish you guys academic success.

458
00:31:55,761 --> 00:32:00,511
Remember, no matter how far you guys go, you'll find me

459
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:03,902
as long as you're back here. Take it.

460
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:06,521
Mr. Qian, you're something else.

461
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:08,781
Hey, don't you guys want to know more

462
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:10,902
about the cherries?

463
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,010
<i>[Corner Sundry Shop]</i>

464
00:32:43,514 --> 00:32:45,513
Is this all you're going to bring?

465
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,373
Two luggage bags are barely enough for me to fit all of my stuff.

466
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:49,653
I'll be studying in Beijing. You're going to a new place.

467
00:32:49,653 --> 00:32:52,044
Of course, you'll have to bring plenty of stuff.

468
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:54,764
But you're bringing too much stuff.

469
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,743
I've collected a lot of comic books and games before this.

470
00:32:57,743 --> 00:33:00,803
Now that I have the time, of course, I need to bring them with me.

471
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:01,964
You're heading to USTC.

472
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:03,923
I heard life there is just like life in our senior year.

473
00:33:03,923 --> 00:33:05,934
You don't have time for entertainment.

474
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:08,804
I'm different from them.

475
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:11,984
That's right. You're thick-skinned.

476
00:33:11,984 --> 00:33:13,974
Xue, hurry up!

477
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:16,923
It's your first day as a senior-year student. You mustn't be late.

478
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:19,834
Xue, hurry up!

479
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:21,654
Aren't you going to eat?

480
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:22,753
I'm heading to Sunian's place.

481
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,403
He's attending college for the first time today. I'll see him off.

482
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,674
I'll come back for breakfast later.

483
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,543
Hurry up! Don't be late!

484
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,544
Take this with you.

485
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:34,713
Dad, it's almost fall season now.

486
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,923
There aren't that many mosquitoes.

487
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:37,794
There are.

488
00:33:39,124 --> 00:33:41,233
<i>- Hello, Mr. Zheng.
- Xue.</i>

489
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:42,994
Sunian!

490
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,844
Why are you here?

491
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:48,163
I slept here last night.

492
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:49,843
Since I was going to leave soon,

493
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:52,333
I came here to talk about life with Sunian.

494
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:53,443
So what did you get out of your chat?

495
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:54,893
Nothing.

496
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:58,203
I was guarding against him the entire night just in case he was up to something funny.

497
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,093
Why are you so serious?

498
00:34:01,094 --> 00:34:02,404
Sunian.

499
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:04,403
Here's a gift to celebrate the start of your college life.

500
00:34:04,403 --> 00:34:06,174
Thanks.

501
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:09,464
You can have yours as well.

502
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:14,764
His gift is so big. Why is mine so small?

503
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:16,074
I'm going to another state, you know?

504
00:34:16,074 --> 00:34:17,503
He's still within the 5th Ring Road.

505
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:19,363
It's easier for you to carry it around since you're going to another state.

506
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:20,653
Enough with the excuses.

507
00:34:20,654 --> 00:34:23,374
From now on, we'll just be normal friends.

508
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:25,033
Can't you just take pity on me?

509
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,043
One of you is entering the Academy of Fine Arts while the other is entering USTC.

510
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:28,783
My mother has been reprimanding me throughout the entire summer break.

511
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,674
And I had spent all of my pocket money as well.

512
00:34:31,704 --> 00:34:33,694
You can have this as well.

513
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:35,543
You should drink more and grow stronger.

514
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:36,553
You have such a potty mouth.

515
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,894
I'm sure someone will beat you up someday.

516
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm running out of time. I'll leave first.

517
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,100
I wish you two a safe journey.

518
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,600
Goodbye.

519
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,100
- What a heartless girl.
<i>- Mr. Zheng, I'll make a move first.</i>

520
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,600
You should leave, too.

521
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
I thought you had a plane to catch tonight?

522
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,000
You're so heartless.

523
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
Fine then.

524
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
I stayed up all night to guard against you

525
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,400
just in case you were up to something funny.

526
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
I'll get some sleep first.

527
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,800
Go now.

528
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,700
Sunian, I'll leave Xue to you now.

529
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,100
Don't make me worry.

530
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,600
Rest assured.

531
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,500
See you during winter break.

532
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,500
Mr. Zheng, I shall make a move now.

533
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,900
Goodbye.

534
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,200
Zhang Qi, you better study hard! Stop playing video games!

535
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
You'll be late if you don't pick up the pace.

536
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,500
<i>[To Sunian, the best person in the world, from Shao Xue]</i>

537
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,600
This gift is pretty exquisite.

538
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,700
Let me see what else you haven't packed.

539
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,900
- Dad, let me do it.
- Let me do it.

540
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,100
Don't forget your things.

541
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,600
Let's go.

542
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,200
Dad, you shouldn't buy instant noodles in the future.

543
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,100
You should eat outside if you have no time to cook.

544
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,400
<i>[Beijing Instant Noodles]</i>

545
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,700
Mainly, it saves me a lot of trouble.

546
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm staying alone.

547
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,600
I don't wish to go through all the trouble just to eat.

548
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,600
I didn't know what to buy for you.

549
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,400
- Anyway, you should keep this money.
- No.

550
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,200
Take it. Put it in your pocket.

551
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,900
Don't lose it.

552
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
I'll call a cab for you.

553
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,300
Dad, no need for that.

554
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,800
I can take the bus.

555
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
All right then.

556
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,000
Be careful, okay?

557
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,900
Dad, I'll make a move now.

558
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
See you, Dad.

559
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,300
Why are you here?

560
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,700
Are you here to find me?

561
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,000
Are you here to keep me company?

562
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,700
Let me give you a scratch.

563
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,000
Are you here to keep me company?

564
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,300
Mom, you should let me make breakfast in the future.

565
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,600
You're already in your senior year.

566
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,100
You should spend more effort on your studies.

567
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,000
Mom, I wish to discuss something with you.

568
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,600
What is it?

569
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,000
I don't plan...

570
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
to continue my studies.

571
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
But why?

572
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
If it's about the fees, I'll think of something.

573
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,400
It's not that.

574
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,500
I'm just not capable enough.

575
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,900
Moreover, it's easier for me to find a job without the pressure to study.

576
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,500
But how could you get yourself a good job

577
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,200
without getting into college?

578
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,400
Mom, don't worry.

579
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,800
Many companies are trying to recruit me right now.

580
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,000
- Really?
- Really.

581
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You should eat up.

582
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,500
Huanhuan.

583
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,300
Your birthday will arrive in a few days.

584
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,400
You should invite your friends over. I'll treat them to a meal.

585
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,300
Mom, I think I'll skip the celebration.

586
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,500
Are you afraid that they might see me in this sorry state?

587
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Of course not!

588
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,400
Zhang Qi and Sunian have gone to their respective colleges.

589
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,300
As for the others, they're busy with the NCEE. They don't have time.

590
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,100
You can give it a try.

591
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,600
By the way, the girl whom you always mentioned,

592
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,400
her name is Lin Shiyin. Right?

593
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,000
I have never seen her before.

594
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,600
Why don't you invite her?

595
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,800
This is your 18th birthday.

596
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,900
You need to celebrate it somehow.

597
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,300
Just treat this as my wish, okay?

598
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,400
Mom.

599
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,700
What's so important that we can't talk about it in the classroom?

600
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,000
Shiyin,

601
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
can you come to my house two days from now?

602
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,200
I'm celebrating my birthday.

603
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,000

My mother wishes to celebrate it for me.

605

Sure. I'll tell Xue about it.

606
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,900
Don't do that.

I...

608
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,900
I only invited you.

But why?

610
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,000
It's awkward to go there alone.

611
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,400
I...

612
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,800

There are four beds when there are only three of us.

638
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,900
Do you know why?

639
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,400
It's because this is the VIP room!

640
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,100
Since this is unoccupied,

641
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,300
I shall take this spot then.

642
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Come on, help me out. Hurry!

643
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Push it inside. Okay.

644
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,100
Please put this up as well.

645
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,500
Thanks.

646
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,100
Come.

647
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,000
Push it to the side.

648
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Not bad at all. Seems like you've trained your body.

649
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Although you look skinny, you're full of muscles.

650
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,600
So, let me introduce myself officially.

651
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,200
I'm Pei Shu. I'm from the design department.

652
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,400
Please take good care of me in the future.

653
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,600
What about you guys?

654
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,400
I'm Zheng Sunian from the Chinese painting department.

655
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,400
I'm Bai Yunsheng from the accessory design department.

656
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,800
Is that all?

657
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,700
You two are something else.

658
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,800
Seems like you two don't speak much.

659
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,400
My brothers, listen up.

660
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,800
Come here. We're already in college right now.

661
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,800
You guys should act more lively.

662
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,500
Am I right?

663
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,800
By the way, I'm treating my senior to dinner tonight.

664
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Why don't you guys join me?

665
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,400
I may not be able to join you.

666
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,200
I have to wait for a call.

667
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,700
A call? From who?

668
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,400
My girlfriend.

669
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,800
You're so loyal. What about you?

670
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,200
I...

671
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,600
