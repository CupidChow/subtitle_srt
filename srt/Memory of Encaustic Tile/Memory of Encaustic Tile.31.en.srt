It's kind of formal.

58

98
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,509

There is no place to sit here.

Take a seat over here.

Let me introduce you two to each other.

127
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,679
This is Yu.

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,509
She's also a student from the Restoration Department.

129

Are you in the facsimile division?

But he went into business later on.

139

I remember he had a lot of leisure time working there.

Why do you seem so busy all the time?

141

Eat up.

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,389
So many eyes are on us.

145
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,160
I'm also feeling a little shy.

146
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,400
Why don't we go out and take a stroll?

147

151

I don't know.

156
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,740
Add a few more dishes.

157
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,149
Ladies and gentlemen.

158
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,479
Elders.

159
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,090

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,500
Why do we need more dishes?

162
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,959
Look.

163
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,839
Look!

164
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,029
He's really something.

165
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,439
<i>[I'm a mute]</i>
Look at your son!

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,150
"I'm a mute."

167
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,500
Gosh, this kid.

168
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,629
The ship has sailed.

169
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,110
I think we should move on to the next plan.

170
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,789
If you two don't knock on the door,

171
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,119
I'll change the code.

172
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,869
Don't be such a stranger.

173
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,930
We've slept together for so many years, right?

174
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,030
Having instant noodles all by yourself?

175
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,529
Come on. We'll take you somewhere nice.

176
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,690
Where to?

177
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,670
Sit down.

178
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,359
Why did you bring me here?

179
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,119
To have coffee.

180
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,150
I don't drink coffee.

181
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,550
I'll buy you some fruit juice.

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,209
Well. I'll see if the fruits are fresh.

183
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,230
- Sit down.
- What?

184
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,269
Sorry, I came late.

185
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,600
But it was so sudden.

186
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,749
Yunsheng said you're a shy guy.

187
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,670
So he told me to introduce myself first.

188
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,029
Also, for some reason, he emphasized

189
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,170
that you're not a mute person.

190
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,359
I work in the HR Department.

191
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,949
I'm a natural socializer. Don't stand on ceremony.

192
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,269
So do you two work in the same company?

193
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,239
No.

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,669
My company has collaborated with him.

195
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,360
I was in charge of it.

196
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,439
I think he's pretty outstanding.

197
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,140
But he doesn't seem like a serious guy.

198
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,190
At first, I was worried that his friend

199
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,020
would be playful like him.

200
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,239
But after seeing you, I'm relieved.

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,570
You don't seem like someone who fools around.

202
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,909
Yunsheng showed me your paintings.

203
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,510
They are so pretty.

204
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,509
I'm curious why you didn't start a business with him?

205
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,670
It'll surely be a promising one.

206
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
We used to be together.

207
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,140
Really?

208
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,620
Why aren't you doing it together now?

209
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,690
You want to do it alone?

210
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,430
He doesn't want me anymore.

211
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,640
Now, he pushes me to someone else.

212
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,540
You two...

213
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,300
You two...

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,770
Scumbag!

215
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,340
I'm not in it with them.

216
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,550
Scumbags.

217
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,520
- Scumbag.
- Scumbag.

218
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,500
<i>[Beijing Fried Sauce Noodles]</i>

219
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,719
<i>Sunian, when did you pick up these skills?</i>

220
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,470
<i>A while back.</i>

221
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,839
<i>Take a good look.</i>

222
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,029
<i>If need be, you can do it yourself.</i>

223
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,839
<i>Slow down then. Go through it once again.</i>

224
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,269
<i>First, boil the water in the pot.</i>

225
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,869
<i>Then put the noodles in.</i>

226
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,229
<i>Wait for four to five minutes, and the noodles will be almost done. Then, take the noodles out.</i>

227
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:56,859
<i>Oh, right. The temperature is very important.</i>

228
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,999
<i>It'll get lumpy if you cook for a long time.</i>

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,570
<i>But if you cook for a short time, it'll be half-cooked.</i>

230
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,020
<i>Did you get all that?</i>

231
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,149
Hello?

232
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,009
What are you doing? Have you eaten?

233
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,919
Not yet. I'm cooking noodles.

234
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,330
So you can cook now?

235
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,429
I'm living away from home now. So I have to learn to take care of myself.

236
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,869
I really miss the time when we were in the alley.

237
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,799
<i>We could invite ourselves to anyone's house for a meal.</i>

238
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,180
<i>But now,</i>

239
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,770
we can only have this junk food.

240
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,599
You chose to walk down this path.

241
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,789
You have to walk down it no matter how tough it is.

242
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,719
Oh, right.

243
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,770
Are you going back for Christmas?

244
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,439
No.

245
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,389
I haven't finished my work.

246
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,369
Are you that busy? Not going back even during the holidays?

247
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:14,549
<i>Here's a word of advice.</i>

248
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,909
<i>Go home if you have time.</i>

249
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,950
<i>Your mom must be missing you.</i>

250
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,380
<i>All right.</i>

251
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,830
- Enjoy your meal. I'm hanging up.
<i>- Hey!</i>

252
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,520
Have you been in touch with him lately?

253
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,869
I have been in touch.

254
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,750
It's just that he doesn't talk much now.

255
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
<i>Hey.</i>

256
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,670
<i>Come on, you two.</i>

257
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,830
<i>Did you not keep in touch at all?</i>

258
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,029
How are you doing lately?

259
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,130
Seeing anyone now?

260
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,490
<i>Or are you still single?</i>

261
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:50,069
I'm seeing someone now. A doctoral student.

262
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,129
When was this? You didn't tell me.

263
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,239
Just recently. It hasn't been that long.

264
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,070
Hurry. Fill me in.

265
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,239
All right. Enough talking.

266
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,170
Let's talk when we meet.

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,560
All right then.

268
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,199
I'm hanging up. Bye.

269
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,750
Bye. Enjoy your meal.

270
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,625
Sunian.

271
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,205
Mr. Shao.

272
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:47,224
How did your blind date go?

273
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:48,875
Did it go well?

274
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:54,925
Not to my liking.

275
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:05,495
Well, your dad might not show it.

276
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:08,024
But he's actually quite worried about you.

277
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:11,984
He doesn't understand how you ended up this way.

278
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:13,934
It's making him worried.

279
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:18,785
Your dad and I have been friends for decades.

280
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:21,325
I can tell at a glance.

281
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,555
I know him too well.

282
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:26,495
He doesn't understand what's going on.

283
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:29,545
But I do.

284
00:16:30,465 --> 00:16:34,025
Are you still waiting for Xue?

285
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:47,965
I've been there before.

286
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,835
I know what's on your mind.

287
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:54,665
But take my advice.

288
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,765
Don't wait for her anymore.

289
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:04,605
Xue is too ambitious.

290
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:08,135
I'm afraid she's not coming back.

291
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:12,505
Consider giving yourself a chance...

292
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:15,995
and start searching for another one.

293
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,515
Are you painting the same thing?

294
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,095
Yes.

295
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,465
This is called a waste of paper.

296
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,365
Take a walk with me.

297
00:19:19,195 --> 00:19:23,674
You were just halfway through the painting, and I destroyed it.

298
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:27,224
It must have made you feel uncomfortable and humiliated, right?

299
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,095
No.

300
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,184
Look.

301
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:36,614
When I was an apprentice, my master was even sterner with me.

302
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,054
You've been working with me for two years, right?

303
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,405
Yes.

304
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:46,675
Tell me. What is the difference

305
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:49,604
between being an apprentice and being at school?

306
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:51,854
Quite a lot, actually.

307
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:55,505
When you talk to me, can you elaborate more?

308
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:58,674
Back in school, they wanted us to have our own ideas.

309
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:02,734
Being an apprentice, I have to replicate other paintings and ensure it's exactly the same.

310
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:08,274
Tell me. What's the hardest part of making a replica?

311
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:12,885
The hardest part...

312
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:16,025
is the shades of color.

313
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:22,505
The brush strokes and shading are very important.

314
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:26,824
But what's more important is getting in the right state of mind.

315
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,904
To replicate a paintingisn't to create original work.

316
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:35,394
So you have to try your best to put yourself into the creator's state of mind.

317
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:40,195
To do that, you have to have an empty heart.

318
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:45,314
If your heart is full, how are you to comprehend the predecessors?

319
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:50,295
Look at you.

320
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,945
You're always thinking too much.

321
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:56,240
But if I were to ask you what you had in mind every single day,

322
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,930
that would be too much, wouldn't it?

323
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:04,104
So tell me. What's really on your mind?

324
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:14,035
I'm thinking about things...

325
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:20,065
that I couldn't get.

326
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:24,464
Yes, everyone has things or people that tie them down.

327
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,195
So do I.

328
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:32,494
But since we're in this line of work, we have to learn to let go as much as we can.

329
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:38,565
Restoring antiques is a practice in itself.

330
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,424
What's wrong with you?

331
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:38,225
This is obviously a pre-docking problem.

332
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:41,035
Fix it. Or I'll fire you.

333
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:42,944
How is it going?

334
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:45,784
The machine learning algorithms can still not get through.

335
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:47,374
How do we fix it?

336
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,774
I'm so sorry, Mr. Smith.

337
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:50,904
We couldn't find a perfect solution yet.

338
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:52,224
What?

339
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,875
Then why did you call me here?

340
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,774
It's an honor to see you, Mr. Smith.

341
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,165
I've heard your speech.

342
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:58,574
Who are you?

343
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:01,085
I'm her technical advisor.

344
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:06,035
Why not try a newer network?

345
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:29,135
Your coffee, Miss.

346
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,545
Thanks.

347
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:36,334
What brings you here?

348
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:38,094
What's wrong? Don't want to see me?

349
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,874
No, if it hadn't been for you, I would have lost my job.

350
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:42,445
Thank you.

351
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:44,195
Where's your Ph.D. girlfriend?

352
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:46,735
Why didn't you bring her along?

353
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,854
We had a fight.

354
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,565
Why?

355
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:53,084
She kept saying that I had unpleasant memories from childhood

356
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:54,235
and couldn't get over my first love.

357
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:55,605
Wouldn't it drive you crazy?

358
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,365
Which first love can't you get over with?

359
00:24:57,365 --> 00:25:00,225
Is it Zhao Ling'er or Liu Yifei?

360
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,474
Since you had a fight, didn't you try to patch things up?

361
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:04,645
I did.

362
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:06,955
She texted me and said this.

363
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:08,715
"You dare not face your innermost emotions."

364
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,035
If it were you, wouldn't it drive you mad?

365
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:12,125
Fight back then.

366
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:15,775
Well, I'd lose.

367
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:18,785
So there are people that you can't beat in an argument?

368
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:21,004
Tell me. What are you doing here really?

369
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:22,605
We had a fight. So I came to relax.

370
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,995
I'll have you show me around.

371
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:30,935
I've been having a lot of work to do lately. I can't take time off.

372
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:32,575
You'll have to go around yourself.

373
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:33,925
Why are you so busy?

374
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,325
You're becoming like a businesswoman just like my mom.

375
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:38,374
Well, I just gained a foothold here.

376
00:25:38,374 --> 00:25:41,685
I want to do my best to strive forward.

377
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:43,374
Don't bury yourself with work.

378
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,555
You haven't been home for two years.

379
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:47,565
Your mom keeps complaining to my mom.

380
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:49,405
Everyone misses you.

381
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:56,555
Well.

382
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:02,285
How's he doing?

383
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:06,965
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

384
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:24,265
<i>Have you reached there yet?</i>

385
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:25,375
I'm already here.

386
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,245
I'm at the supermarket with Xue.

387
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:29,955
Why did you transfer money to me?

388
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,635
<i>Buy yourself some good food.</i>

389
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:35,785
Is it for me or for her?

390
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:37,614
- Zhang Qi.
- I'm hanging up.

391
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:39,135
Cut back on drinking.

392
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:41,084
I got a call from the office asking me to get back.

393
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,035
Help yourself. I have to go now.

394
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,505
What would you like to eat? I'll buy it for you.

395
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:46,085
Anything. I have to go. Bye.

396
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:52,085
Check-in in the north as well.

397
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,615
Come in.

398
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:00,685
Hi, boss.

399
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:03,885
Please. Sit down.

400
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:08,755
You're withdrawn from Mr. Smith's case.

401
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:10,845
He's in charge.

402
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,185
Why?

403
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:16,704
We doubt about your ability.

404
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:18,805
Now, you're in charge

405
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:22,065
only of the basic translation.

406
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:24,265
I can't accept it.

407
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:27,615
Do it, or you quit.

408
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:33,315
I quit.

409
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:41,874
I haven't seen you for just a short while, and you lost your job already?

410
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,985
Stop bringing it up.

411
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:47,205
Why did they fire you?

412
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:50,710
I wasn't fired! I quit!

413
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,040
It's all Frank's fault!

414
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,630
He discriminated against me right from the start.

415
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:56,625
I'm going to sue him!

416
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:58,645
You're still so naive.

417
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:00,804
Did you make a recording? Do you have proof?

418
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,294
Most importantly, do you have money to hire a lawyer?

419
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:06,715
What's wrong with you?

420
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:12,354
If not, you can take this opportunity to go back to China with me.

421
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:14,524
Go home and take a break. Pay everyone a visit.

422
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:15,995
I don't even have a job now.

423
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,445
How would I have the cheek to go home?

424
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:20,245
This is no big deal.

425
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,845
Who's that?

426
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,755
Hello, Senior.

427
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:32,440
Xue,

428
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,960
<i>I'm here to bother you again.</i>

429
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,685
What's the matter?

430
00:28:36,685 --> 00:28:40,085
Right now, I'm the regional head of my company,

431
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,404
<i>and I have to manage the entire branch.</i>

432
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,424
But right now, we're shorthanded down here.

433
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,854
- So, I'm calling to see if you'll reconsider my offer.
- Boss.

434
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,264
About that.

435
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:53,095
<i>I know. Our company...</i>

436
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,234
is incomparable to Huanyu Investment in every way.

437
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,275
<i>But don't worry.</i>

438
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,570
<i>I assure you</i>

439
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,290
that I'll make it worth your while.

440
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:01,234
<i>So...</i>

441
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:02,435
I'll go!

442
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:03,265
Really?

443
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:05,304
Yes! I'll go for an interview tomorrow!

444
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:06,985
There's no interview needed for you!

445
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:08,975
You can start work tomorrow.

446
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:12,274
Senior, we still have to follow the procedure.

447
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:13,504
See you tomorrow!

448
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:16,075
This is great, Shao Xue. You've done me a great favor.

449
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:16,925
See you tomorrow.

450
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:19,735
Bye.

451
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:21,614
I have a new job now.

452
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:23,715
That job offer was too unexpected.

453
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:25,755
Could there be something fishy?

454
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:31,115
Can't you wish me something good?

455
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:33,984
All right. Good luck with your work.

456
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:36,225
May you have a successful career.

457
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:43,895
Please.

458
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:49,365
This is our office.

459
00:29:49,365 --> 00:29:51,065
Please.

460
00:30:02,905 --> 00:30:06,475
These are the pictures of our overseas branches.

461
00:30:06,475 --> 00:30:08,075
Please.

462
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,900
<i>[CEO]</i>

463
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:22,814
Come on, my junior.

464
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:23,925
Senior.

465
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:25,844
Finally, you're here.

466
00:30:25,844 --> 00:30:28,865
I've tried persuading you numerous times.

467
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:30,704
Hello.

468
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,004
- This is...
- Here. Let me do the introduction.

469
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:38,065
This is my partner and my fiancee, Pangxin.

470
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:41,914
Isn't she the girl that you told me about in college?

471
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:43,415
That's her.

472
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:45,825
Hi, I've heard a lot about you.

473
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:47,825
What did he tell you?

474
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:50,924
He's a hopeless romantic. I'm too shy to even talk about it.

475
00:30:50,924 --> 00:30:53,225
Here. Take a seat.

476
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:58,304
Senior, is this a mom-and-pop company now?

477
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,885
No. This translation company is actually quite big.

478
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:06,735
Its headquarters is in China, and the franchise system is implemented elsewhere.

479
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:09,184
The previous owner didn't want to carry on.

480
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:11,205
So I took over.

481
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:14,694
This place is great. Why didn't he want to carry on?

482
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:15,945
Here's the thing.

483
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:20,024
Most of the jobs come from some documentary crews and voluntary organizations.

484
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:22,434
So the places we need to visit aren't always that pleasant.

485
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,355
Many people aren't willing to go.

486
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:28,145
Well, since we were college mates, I'll be candid with you.

487
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:31,214
Working here, you'll basically have to travel all year round

488
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:35,264
and often go to places like Africa, polar regions,

489

00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:41,024
In terms of benefits, I'll do everything I can to give you the best remuneration possible.

491
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,295
But it's going to be really tough.

492
00:31:44,295 --> 00:31:48,295
So under these circumstances,

493
00:31:48,295 --> 00:31:49,664
would you still like to work here?

494
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:51,605
I do.

495
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:55,174
What did I tell you? I was right about her.

496
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:57,584
Well, Senior. When can I start?

497
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,054
No rush.

498
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:03,095
You haven't returned home after you left, right?

499
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:07,135
How about this? I'll give you a few days off.

500
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:08,645
Go home and visit your family.

501

The company will pay for your airline ticket.

Well, thank you, Senior.

I'm getting married soon.

523
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:10,025
- Someone you know.
- Someone we know?

524
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:11,574
I have no idea who that is.

525
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:12,604
It's Tang Ya.

All right, Ms. Anchor. Enough with pleasantries.

Annoying. We're out in public.

Keep up appearances. Here. Take a seat.

538

When did that happen? Tell me about it.

539

I'm starving! Let's order!

540

00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:02,055
Pass me the menu. I'll order.

549
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:17,924
It's been a while since I came here. The menu has changed quite a bit.

550
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:19,214
I'm afraid of ordering the wrong stuff.

551

Sunian, you place the order.

552
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:32,785
Nothing has changed.

553
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:38,885
I'll order then.

554
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:43,194
If you've got nothing planned later, let's go for karaoke at Cashbox after dinner. My treat.

555

Well, I still have work to do.

556

I have to go now.

Xue, you can do your work anytime. But don't skip your meal.

558
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:01,724
It's not that. I have to submit the work tonight.

00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,505
That's right.

567
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,365
Is it that hard?

568
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:40,904
- Hello?

<i>please be serious in fulfilling your obligations, will you?</i>

570
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:46,294
Even a contract couple needs personal freedom, all right?

571
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,154
What was that?

572
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:50,605
Contract couple?

573
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:53,864
I have to go now. Let's have dinner some other time.

Zhang Qi is being ridiculous.

575
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:59,185
He set up the gathering, but he left first.

576
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:19,175
You've been doing well lately?

577
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:21,225
Not bad.

578
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:28,935
We haven't seen each other for two years, right?

579
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:31,325
I often see you on the television.

580
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:36,044
It's not like that. My mom often watches your show at home.

581
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,155
Thank your mom for me.

582
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:48,485
Your work seems to be going well, right?

583
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:50,865
It is.

584
00:39:50,865 --> 00:39:54,085
Well, I bet you have many suitors now.

585
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,964
I've been busy with the show. I don't have time for that.

586
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:06,154
Enough talking. Let's order something.

587
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,605

It's boring to just drink like that.

First question.

612

The theft of an exam paper back in high school.

Why did you come?

614

Back then, during the cultural performance,

617
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:14,555
you wanted to give Xue a birthday gift. Right?

618

♫ <i>Within those simple days</i> ♫

649
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:45,470
♫ <i>Those songs in the past, they had accompanied me</i> ♫

650
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:53,190
♫ <i>As I regretted our parting during our youth</i> ♫

651
00:45:53,190 --> 00:46:00,990
♫ <i>Using this song, this song belongs to us</i> ♫

652
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,720
♫ <i>Please don't cry again</i> ♫

653
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,690
♫ <i>And don't ask when I'll return</i> ♫
