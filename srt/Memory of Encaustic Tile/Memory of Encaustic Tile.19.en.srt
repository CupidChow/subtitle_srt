Mr. Shao.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Why are you, a college student, joining me,

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,200
an old man, in drinking tea and living a healthy lifestyle?

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,600
You do think like an old man.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,700
I learned all these from you.

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,200
I'm being mature.

41
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,399
By the way, Mr. Shao,

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
I heard that the Watchmaker Division is recruiting.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
How is it going?

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,100
Recruiting is hard.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,700
One needs some basics in engineering

46
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
to know how to repair watches.

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,800
Those who major in engineering

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
wouldn't want to take this job.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I want to work here.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,700
You're a gem.

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,300
Times have changed.

52
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,400
Back then, we simply wanted to learn a skill

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
to be able to put food on the table.

54
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,200
That's no longer a concern for people these days.

55
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,600
That...

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Master, why are you here?

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
I told you to ask for some information.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,700
Look at you, always slacking.

59
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,200
I was just about to ask him.

60
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,900
How is Zheng doing?

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,600
He's still the same.

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
He spends all his time repairing watches.

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
He has always been a quiet person.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,600
And now, he's almost become a mute.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
He's also getting thinner and thinner.

66
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,000
That boy...

67
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,200
How can we leave him like that?

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,300
He's not listening to us.

69
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,500

He's now in Grade 12.

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,700
No one knows what his plan is for his future.

73
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,000
Doesn't he always do well academically?

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I heard that he wanted to study physics at Tsinghua.

75

Yes.

76

During the placement test,

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
he was about 200 places below his previous ranking.

80
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
He shouldn't be blamed

81

Sunian!

164
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,600
Yes?

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's go celebrate your birthday.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
I've reserved a place at the restaurant.

167
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,400
When Xue was checking out the menu, her mouth was watering so badly.

168
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes. The restaurant serves amazing food.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,600
You'll regret it if you don't try them. Am I right?

170
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,500
- Yes.
- I told you that I'm not celebrating my birthday.

171
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Stop coming after me.

172
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,100
Please.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,900
Fine.

174
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,200
If you feel like joining us later,

175
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,400
the door is always open.

176
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,800
Why are you here?

177
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,100
You must have smelled this.

178
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,900
Eat up.

179
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,600
My mom is no longer around

180
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,700
and no one feeds you anymore, right?

181
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,000
I shouldn't have said that to Xue and the others,

182
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,000
but I really don't feel like the idea of celebrating my birthday this year.

183
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,100
Do you get it?

184
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
Forget it.

185
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,800
You won't understand what I'm saying.

186
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Why am I even talking to you?

187
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
My mom is gone,

188
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,000
so you have to take good care of yourself.

189
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't miss her too much.

190
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I'll see you again.

191
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,800
Hey.

192
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
I'll get going.

193
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,700
Xue.

194
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,600
Mr. Liu told me that you had rejected the opportunity to study abroad.

195
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,900
You got 8.5 in the IELTS and first place in the interview.

196
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,000
Why did you turn it down?

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,700
Isn't your dream to travel the world?

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,700
Now, my only dream is to cheer Sunian up.

199
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,200
Let's celebrate Sunian's birthday this evening.

200
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
Sure.

201
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,100
I'll get going. Bye.

202
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
<i>Zheng, what are you drawing?</i>

203
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,100
<i>- A cat.
- A cat?</i>

204
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,000
<i>What's wrong?</i>

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
<i>I thought it was a fat mouse.</i>

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,900
<i>It's obviously a cat.</i>

207
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,500
<i>Look.</i>

208
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
<i>Here. I'll show you how to draw a cat.</i>

209
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,900
Xue, it's dinner time.

210
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,700
Xue, go wash your hands now.

211
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,200
- Xue.
- Xue.

212
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,700
We're talking to you.

213
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,500
Xue.

214
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
What's wrong with you?

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,000
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

216
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Dad.

217
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Mom.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,600
What if I tell you...

219
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,000
that I don't want to study abroad anymore?

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Will you be upset with me?

221
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,400
This... Why...

222
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

223
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
Yes.

224
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
Didn't you always talk about

225
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,600
how much you wanted to see the world?

226
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,500
Did you fail the interview?

227
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,500
My dear daughter, tell us what happened.

228
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,200
What actually happened?

229
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
If you are not selected,

230
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,700
we can always figure another way out.

231
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,200
If you've decided to stay...

232
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
That's nice, too.

233
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,400
Your mom has always wanted you to stay.

234
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,800
I know.

235
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,000
I said I wanted to go abroad, and now I changed my mind.

236
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,600
You must think that I'm irresponsible,

237
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,500
but...

238
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,600
I genuinely don't want to go abroad anymore.

239
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,100
Mom, if you are angry at me, just let it all out.

240
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
Why should I be angry?

241
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,200
I'd be happy if you've really changed your mind.

242
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,800
If you stay, I can cook for you every day.

243
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,700
I prepared soup, too. I'll serve it and the dinner will be ready.

244
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Be honest with me.

245
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,500
What actually happened?

246
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,600
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.

247
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Let's have dinner.

248
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,200
Let's have dinner, Dad.

249
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,600
<i>Sunian.</i>

00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,200
There are no stars at all.

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,800
I knew you were a liar.

255
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,700
The star said...

256
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,700
if you're sad, crying will make you feel better.

257
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,600
You shouldn't keep all the sadness to yourself.

258
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,800
Let it all out.

259
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,400
I can lend you my shoulders.

260
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,200
If you don't like it,

261
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
I'll leave you alone.

262
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,700

Hi. Who are you looking for?

277
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,400
Is Mr. Liu in?

278
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,800
Mr. Liu, someone's looking for you.

279
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
Thanks.

280
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,500
- You must be Sunian's father.
- Yes, I am.

281
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

282
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,700
Come on in.

283
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,600
Have a seat.

284
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Hi.

285
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm not in charge of Grade 12's syllabus,

286
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,800
but I'm the newly appointed Head of Discipline.

287
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,800
I'm in charge of all disciplinary issues in this school.

288
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,000
Nice to meet you, Mr. Liu.

289
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Is something going on with Zheng Sunian?

290
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,600
Sunian hasn't been to school for a week.

291
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
He's been absent for a week?

292
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,800
Not exactly.

293
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,200
He's here in the morning,

294
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,000
but doesn't turn up for the afternoon session.

295
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
According to his classroom teacher,

296
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,000
he always looks distracted during lessons.

297
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,100
When he got reprimanded, he remained quiet

298
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,600
and continued doing whatever he wanted to.

299
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm so sorry about that.

300
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,900
I had no idea about what he was doing.

301
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,100
I have to talk to him when I get home.

302
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,600
I wanted to meet you today,

303
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,500
hoping to talk to you about this matter.

304
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,300
I've briefly heard about what happened to your family.

305
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,000
I know this left a great impact on the kid.

306
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,900
However, Sunian is in Grade 12 now.

307
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,100
It's a critical point that will decide his future.

308
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,900
Any mistake, however minor it is, will ruin his future.

309
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,200
To make things worse, Sunian was one of the top students in school.

310
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,900
All of the teachers think that it'd be a pity.

311
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,600
I hope you won't be too harsh on the kid

312
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,100
when you get home. Have a chat with your son

313
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,700
and try to resolve whatever that's bothering him.

314
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,900
See if that works.

315
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,400
Sure. I... I'll find a chance to talk to him.

316
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,700
This will affect his future.

317
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,200
Don't wait anymore.

318
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Talk to him as soon as possible.

319
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
I'll talk to him right after I get home.

320
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,000
Okay. Thanks for dropping by.

321
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,600
It's my duty. Thanks, Mr. Liu.

322
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,500
My deepest condolences.

323
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,900
Thanks.

324
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,400
Let me take care of this.

325
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,700
- I'll get going.
- Take care.

326
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,600
Mr. Zheng.

327
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,200
Zhang Qi.

328
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,000
Why are you here?

329
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,600
It's a school day.

330
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
Look at this muddlehead.

331
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Mr. Zheng, why are you here?

332
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,800
Well. The Head of Discipline was looking for me.

333
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,000
He told me that Sunian had been absent for a week.

334
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,500
Do you know what happened to Sunian?

335
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,800
I have no idea.

336
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,300
Really?

337
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Fine. You should go to class now.

338
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,100
Go ahead. I've got to go.

339
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,900
- Bye, Mr. Zheng.
- Bye.

340
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Exempted from NCEE?
<i>(National College Entrance Examination)</i>

341
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What's with that reaction?

342
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,100
I'm exempted from NCEE!

343
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,600
Look at how she reacted to the news.

344
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
Do it again.

345
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Thank you, sir.

346
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm only in Grade 11. I don't deserve to get exempted yet.

347
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,800
You don't deserve it?

348
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,300
You were a three-time participant in the Math Olympiad.

349
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
You won one silver medal and two gold medals.

350
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,800
Now the USTC is interested in you.
<i>(University of Science and Technology of China)</i>

351
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,400
USTC.

352
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,900
That's so far from home.

353
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,400
Really?

354
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,700
We have an advanced transportation system.

355
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,000
Is it really important where you go?

356
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
If I accept this offer, I'll have to leave home.

357
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I didn't expect you to love your home so much.

358
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,800
What now? It's an opportunity everyone's fighting for,

359
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
and you're going to give it up.

360
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Why can't I give it up? I can earn myself a place in the future.

361
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
You want to earn yourself a place.

362
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Little rascal, look at your transcript.

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,400
Save for mathematics, what other subjects are you good at?

364
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Which university will you be going to?

365
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,000
Let me tell you! When I received this exemption list from USTC,

366
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I smiled from ear to ear.

367
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,600
Yet, you're here talking rubbish.

368
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,200
Why are you so upset? I didn't say that I was going to turn it down.

369
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,100
You must accept this offer.

370
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,400
Zhang Qi, this is no joke.

371
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,200
If you let this opportunity slip,

372
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,430
it'll be one of the biggest regrets in your life.

373
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,900
I need time to think it through. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

374
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,600
That'd be too late.

375
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,200
I'll allow you one day to think about it.

376
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,000
If you still can't figure it out by then, I'll talk to your mom.

377
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,100
Aren't we friends?

378
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,000
There's no need to talk to my mom about this.

379
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,800
I'll get going.

380
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,400
That kid did quite well, right?

381
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,200
I think so, too.

382
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,400
Drink your water quietly.

383
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,500
Why are you walking around?

384
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,500
Qiaomu.

385
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,700
Tonight, we're having a college reunion.

386
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Do you want to come along?

387
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
Why would I want to attend your college reunion?

388
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
They told us to bring a plus-one.

389
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,300
They told you this. Then, you should talk to them.

390
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,400
No. But, no, I mean...

391
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,600
I've been wanting to bring you...

392
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,900
Master.

393
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,100
- Ms. Yu.
- Ms. Yu.

394
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,600
Shao Hua bought some chestnuts.

395
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,100
I thought I should share them with you.

396
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,400
Mr. Shao treats Ms. Yu so well.

397
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,800
That's not true.

398
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,500
He upset me two days ago.

399
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
He only bought this as an apology gift.

400
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,700
Is one bag of chestnuts enough to make you forgive him?

401
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,100
We're already an old couple.

402
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,400
It's hard to find an understanding woman these days.

403
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,000
I love it when Master compliments me.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,400
I shouldn't disturb you further.

405
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,600
- Sure.
- Bye.

406
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,400
It's nice having an understanding wife.

407
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,100
I'll come.

408
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,200
It's just a college reunion, right?

409
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Really?

410
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,400
Master.

411
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,300
<i>[Corner Sundry Shop]</i>

412
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,900
Zhang Qi! Zhang Qi, what's wrong?

413
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Did the teacher ask to see your parents again?

414
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,500
Zhang Qi.

415
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,100
Why are you still here?

416
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm thinking.

417
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,000
What's on your mind?

418
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,300
I was exempted from NCEE.

419
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,900
I'm going to USTC.

420
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,200
That's great.

421
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,000
If that's the case, let me gather everyone here.

422
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
We're going to celebrate this good news.

423
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,800
Keep this to yourself first.

424
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
Why?

425
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
I haven't decided if I want to accept the offer.

426
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,800
This is a great opportunity. Why do you want to give it up?

427
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Is it because you don't want to leave Ms. Zhang Ling?

428
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Or me?

429
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,000
You don't want to leave Xue?

430
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,000
Are you not planning to confess to Xue?

431
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,400
What is there to confess?

432
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,600
Confess your feelings to her.

433
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,800
I don't think it's necessary anymore.

434
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,200
Why not? You haven't told her how you feel.

435
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
How would you know what she thinks of you?

436
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,400
That's a tough question.

437
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,800
Xue, can you bring this for them?

438
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,500
Send the ribs to them.

439
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,800
Do they like eating ribs you cooked?

440
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Xue, listen to your mom. Send this to them.

441
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
The food is getting cold.

442
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,000
I'll be on my way.

443
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,700
Hurry up.

444
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,600
Sunian! Mr. Zheng!

445
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,200
Mr. Zheng.

446
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,400
Xue.

447
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
It's dinner time.

448
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,300
Have you not prepared your dinner yet?

449
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm waiting for Sunian to come home.

450
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
See if there's anything he wants to eat, I'll cook it for him.

451
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
That's why...

452
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Where is Sunian?

453
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,600
I have no idea. I've been waiting for him to come home.

454
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,600
My mom made some ribs for you.

455
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,300
It's a little salty. You have to eat it with rice.

456
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,400
This...

457
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Why not join us for dinner?

458
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,000
It's okay. I have leftovers.

459
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,600
You...

460
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,700
Then, I'll get going.

461
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,800
Xue, look.

462
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,100
I cook something nice for you every time you're here, but today...

463
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,700
Don't worry about it.

464
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,300
I'll get going, Mr. Zheng.

465
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,800
Enjoy the food.

466
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,900
Bye.

467
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,100
Tell your mom I said thanks.

468
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,400
Eat slowly. Don't choke yourself.

469
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay.

470
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Where are you going?

471
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,700
I'm going to do my homework in the yard.

472
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,000
Do your homework in the yard?

473
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The weather is so cold.

474
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,300
I want to wait for Sunian. I don't want to let him slip away again.

475
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,600
This girl...

476
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,700
Let her be. The yard is just right there.

477
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm not worried about her.

478
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm worried about Sunian.

479
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,000
I haven't seen him for days.

480
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,600
Even Xue has to wait at the front door to see if she can run into him.

481
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,300
It's all up to Xue now.

482
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Why are you doing your homework here?

483
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,400
I'm waiting for Sunian.

484
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,800
He has been avoiding me.

485
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,000
Why are you waiting for him?

486
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,200
I want to cheer him up.

487
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,700
Why are you here?

488
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
I ran into Mr. Zheng this morning.

489
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,100
He told me that Sunian had been playing truant.

490
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,200
I thought I should drop by and see how he's doing.

491
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Let's wait for him together then.

492
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,679
Have you told Sunian that you're not going to study abroad anymore?

493
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,840
Not yet.

494
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,130
Don't you dare tell him.

495
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:42,110
I'll find the right chance to tell him about this.

496
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,080
Mr. Liu told me earlier today that I have been exempted from NCEE.

497
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,180
I've been accepted by USTC.

498
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,579
That's great. Amazing.

499
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,400
You get to go to USTC without taking NCEE. Doesn't it also mean that you'll get to enjoy college life before everyone else?

500
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,100
- Do you think I should accept this offer?
- Of course, you should.

501
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,409
With your current grades, do you think you can get into university on your own?

502
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,500
You should be thankful for this opportunity. You have to accept it. You must!

503
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,000
Why are you so lucky? Why am I never this lucky?

504
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,360
Accept it. Quick.

505
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,780
Why are you home so late?

506
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,800
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

507
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,010
Why are you waiting for me?

508
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,759
I'm here to send you good news.

509
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,799
I've been exempted from NCEE, and am going to USTC.

510
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,170
Congratulations!

511
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,180
I don't need that.

512
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,410
I'm sick of getting congratulated.

513
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,380
I want a promise from you.

514
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,450
What promise can I give you?

515
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:25,230
After I go to university, you have to take good care of this girl.

516
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,710
Zheng Sunian, hurry up and pull yourself together.

517
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,030
How can I trust you when you're looking like this?

518
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,710
It's getting late.

519
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,929
You should send Xue home. I've got to go.

520
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,840
Sunian.

521
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,010
Smile.

522
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,880
Sunian.

523
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,780
Smile.

524
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,180
Dad.

525
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,370
You're home.

526
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,660
Have you not had your dinner yet?

527
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,740
I... I was waiting for you.

528
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,219
Go wash your hands. I'll heat up the food.

529
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:38,160
It's fine, Dad.

530
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,450
I'm not hungry.

531
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,400
Sunian!

532
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,380
I met your teacher... today.

533
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,129
He told me you'd been absent from school for a week.

534
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:06,460
Is that true?

535
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,820
Yes.

536
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,200
Sunian, you're in Grade 12 now. You can't keep doing this.

537
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,840
I know.

538
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:23,350
You... Don't bottle up your emotions.

539
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,799
You can talk to me. Okay?

540
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,710
You know...

541
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,760
how I'm feeling.

542
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,520
Yes. I know,

543
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,720
but I don't how to make you feel better.

544
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,410
A very important piece of your heart is missing.

545
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,510
That's why you don't know

546
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,229
what to do and what you should do.

547
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,150
Everything now feels meaningless.

548
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,610
That's how I feel,

549
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,579
but I don't want you to feel the same, Sunian.

550
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:15,860
Yes. We're missing a piece of our heart,

551
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,860
but at the very least,

552
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,180
your heart is not completely empty.

553
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,250
Don't let the wound in your heart grow bigger and bigger.

554
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,110
Find a way...

555
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,110
to fill up the missing spot.

556
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,800
Is that even possible?

557
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,880
Where there's a will, there's a way.

558
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,820
Okay?

559
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,439
Eat more fruits and vegetables.

560
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,350
Stop eating so much meat. It's not good for your health.

561
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:20,200
Meat is so tasty.

562
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,810
You're saying that as if you hate meat.

563
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,420
I love eating meat, too.

564
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,340
I've got to go.

565
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,030
Dou Siyuan, I have good news for you.

566
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,979
One of my classmates' relatives works as a Human Resources manager in an established company.

567
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:00,380
I showed them your resume.

568
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,509
They are very interested in you and wish to invite you for an interview.

569
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:07,080
Why did you show my resume to a random person?

570
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,260
What do you mean by just showing it to a random person?

571
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,030
I simply want to find a better job opportunity for you.

572
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,930
I don't need a new job. I like it here.

573
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,010
The only downside is my pay.

574
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,430
I can't afford a Mercedes-Benz.

575
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,359
Why do you have to talk with that sarcastic tone?

576
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,520
I saw how envious you were of them, so I tried to pull a few strings for you.

577
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,820
Firstly, I'm not envious of anyone.

578
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,969
Secondly, I don't need anyone to pull any strings for me.

579
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:34,909
Do you know how much effort I've put in to earn this opportunity for you?

580
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,109
Sorry.

581
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,130
Thanks for helping, but I don't need it.

582
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,840
<i>- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!</i>

583
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,339
Zhang Qi has done really well.

584
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,979
Yes. He's only in Grade 11, and he's already exempted from the NCEE.

585
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:04,909
Speaking of that, he has certainly made you proud.

586
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:05,999
That's nothing to boast about.

587
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:08,130
You know what. I always knew this would happen.

588
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,130
I knew he would get exempted from the exam.

589
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,700
Think about it.

590
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
The Math Olympiad.

591
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,189
All participants were top students.

592
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,339
- Yes.
<i>- You're right.</i>

593
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,820
He won first place in a competition like that.

594
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,330
Of course, all top-ranked universities in the country would want him as their student.

595
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,820
- Am I right?
- That's too flattering.

596
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,780
I hope my grandson is half as smart as Zhang Qi.

597
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,110
- That's all I ask for.
- I'm flattered.

598
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,170
I mean it.

599
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,630
Why not let Zhang Qi tutor the other kids of the alley?

600
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,189
<i>That sounds like a good idea.</i>

601
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,100
- He can help us all out.
- Sure.

602
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,960
He has nothing to do anyway.

603
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,030
They're all out there waiting for their chance to compliment you.

604
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,900
Why are you hiding at my place?

605
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,229
Forget about it.

606
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,780
Those misters and madams are terrifying.

607
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,570
They want my mom to buy them a meal.

608
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,700
It's as if my mother and I owe it to them.

609
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,490
They will probably try to bring you home next.

610
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,820
Why would they want to bring me home?

611
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,430
They want you to be their son-in-law.

612
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,780
That makes sense.

613
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,610
Someone like you will never be able to find yourself a girlfriend.

614
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,879
Don't talk rubbish.

615
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,609
Zhang Qi is so good-looking and came from a good background.

616
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,380
Ms. Zhang Ling.

617
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,359
Oh, my god.

618
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,060
You must be exhausted.

619
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,420
Have some water.

620
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,759
The role model's mother is finally done giving a talk.

621
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,530
Why did they let you go?

622
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,530
They let me go today, but they will soon come back for me again.

623
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,560
