No. Let's go.

Where is she going?

Isn't he overseas?

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,619
Did you bring him back to develop here?

91
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:29,079
No. I have many research tasks to complete after the pandemic.

92
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,560
He kept saying he wanted to visit China.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,059
So, I brought him back.

94
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,499
- Mr. Sun must be very happy then.
- Hello, Tom.

95
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:38,380
Yes. He grants all his grandson's requests.

96
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,859
But he still doesn't treat me nicely.

97
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:44,059
- How old are you?
- Six.

98
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,019
Six? You're six years old?

99
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,339
Are you guys free later? Let me buy you lunch.

- Sure.
- Sure!

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,579
- It's all right, Mr. Sun.
- Do me this favor.

Besides, we don't eat much.

106
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,278
With all of you here, we can order more dishes.

107
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,719
We won't hold back then.

108
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,800
Of course. I'll be waiting for you outside.

111
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,739
It must be something good.

112
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,800
Save yourself some dignity.

113
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,680
Mr. Sun, so you wanted to eat hotpot?

114
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,399
You don't want to eat this? Let's go to another place.

115
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,298
No. I really feel like eating this.

116
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:28,219
- What's that?
- That is hotpot.

117
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,219
Xue, teach him Chinese.

118
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,539
This is hotpot.

119
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,438
Hotpot.

120
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,259
That's not right. Say it with me.

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,979

122
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,298
Lamb Hotpot.

123

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,580
I miss this so much.

126
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,700
I was in a rush every time I came back.

127
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,839
I couldn't have any authentic ones abroad as well.

128
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,978
After so many years, this restaurant's taste is still the same.

129
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,760
Come back often when you are free.

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,140
I should come back often.

131
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,178
Beijing has changed a lot.

132
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:05,178
We even got lost just now.

133
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:07,099
Mr. Sun, it's normal to get lost

134
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,620
since you spend most of your time abroad.

135
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,199
That might be the case, but this place is full of skyscrapers.

136
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,260

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,479
Does she look like his grandma?

No.

143
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,459
Tom, why did you call her "Grandma"?

144
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,580
She was wearing the same clothes.

145
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,920
The same clothes?

146
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,020
I know.

No.

Sometimes, I would think how nice it would be to not go abroad in the past.

I suffered so much.

160

00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,479
But I was separated from my friends and family.

163
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,638
We might not even meet once a year.

164
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:10,800
I am a doctor but I couldn't do anything when my father was sick.

165
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,319
I feel like I've let my father down...

166
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,699
just because of this.

167
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,819
Mr. Sun, don't worry.

168
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:25,278
You have us to take care of Mr. Sun.

169
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,740
Yes. Leave it to us.

170
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,500
Don't worry.

171
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,020
Okay.

172
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,899
This is a toast to all of you. Thank you.

173
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:39,400
- <i>At this moment, I suddenly understand...</i>
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

174
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,359
<i>why my mother didn't want me to go abroad.</i>

175
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,259
<i>Studying abroad requires a lot of money.</i>

176
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,459
<i>There will be hardships and I'll be so far away from the people I love.</i>

177
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,939
Is it enough? I can order more.

178
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:53,900
<i>Perhaps I will also miss everything from my hometown</i>

179
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,519
<i>and cry just like Mr. Sun if I go abroad.</i>

180
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,699
<i>But I just can't give up</i>

181
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,938
<i>that faraway dream in my heart.</i>

182
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,359
<i>I really want to realize it,</i>

183
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,640
<i>but I don't know whether it's possible.</i>

184
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,160
Why aren't you going back?

185
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm thinking about something.

186
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,799
What is it? You have a long face.

187
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,359
I am thinking whether my decision of insisting to travel abroad is the right one.

188
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:46,859
Actually, I don't really get it.

189
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,260
Why do you want to go out so much?

190
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,978
Do you just want to have a look?

191
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:54,859
My childhood dream was to go out and have a look.

192
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:58,439
I want to learn the histories and cultures of other countries.

193
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,419
Look. The pictures in my room

194
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:04,019
are all the countries I want to go to.

195
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,418
This time, I finally got a Two Plus One opportunity.

196
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,699
I don't want to miss it.

197
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,918
Why did you hesitate again then?

198
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,058
I always didn't understand

199
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:20,239
why my mom opposed the idea of going abroad.

200
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,299
But I spoke with Mr. Sun today.

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,159
I'm the only daughter in my family.

202
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,658
It takes a lot of money to send me abroad.

203
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,759
If I go abroad,

204
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,259
it's like my parents have lost their daughter and money. How sad would that be?

205
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,219
If... they are sick,

206
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:47,320
I can't take care of them when I'm abroad.

207
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,560
If I'm abroad, they will be worried about me.

208
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,739
They will worry about my food, accommodations,

209
00:11:57,739 --> 00:12:00,500
and clothing.

210
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,719
There are too many things to worry about.

211
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,500
Wait for me. I'm going to get something.

212
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,719
What is this?

213
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,259
A recipe book.

214
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,439
Why do you give me a recipe book?

215
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:41,419
Taking good care of yourself is important when you're alone abroad.

216
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,019
You can't even cook.

217
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,199
Will your parents be at ease?

218
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,839
Don't worry about your family. I'm here.

219
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,420
Here. Let me show you.

220
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,540
This book contains your favorite dishes.

221
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,660
They are easy to make.

222
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,819
Tomatoes.

223
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:10,980
First, wash the tomatoes and cut them into pieces.

224
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,059
Next, crack the eggs into a bowl and mix them well with a pinch of salt.

225
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,059
It's easy. You just need some small techniques.

226
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,380
Also, this Minced Meat Eggplant.

227
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,184
First, cut the eggplants into square slices.
<i>[Minced Meat Eggplant]</i>

228
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:28,759
Next, dice lean meat, green onions, and green chilies.

229
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,579
After that, add oil into the wok and add eggplants when it's hot.

230
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,479
Fry them for three to five minutes and remove them from the wok.

231
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,539
Sunian.

232
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,179
It's good to have you around.

233
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,020
Look. There's also Yuxiang Shredded Pork.

234
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,439
Time to eat.

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,640
Wait.

236
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,139
I'm going to ask you again.

237
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,040
Do you really want to go abroad that badly?

238
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,760
I've given it some thought.

239
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,838
I don't want to argue with you because of this matter.

240
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:29,519
Let's vote on it.

241
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,259
One vote each. It's democratic and fair.

242
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:38,238
This is fake democracy. Dad is your puppet.

243
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:41,319
How can you say that? That's rude.

244
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,139
It's fine if you don't want to vote.

245
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,120
We won't talk about this anymore. Let's eat.

246
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,710
Wait!

247
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,560
Okay, let's try it.

248
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,080
I vote to go abroad.

249
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,779
I oppose.

250
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,519
I agree.

251
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,500
- Dad, you've grown a spine.
- Of course.

252
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,900
Thank you, Dad.

253
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,179
Thank you, Mom.

254
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,220
Let's eat.

255
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,159
Mom, have some vegetables. Eat.

256
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,398
<i>[Silian Salon]</i>

257
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,159
<i>Both of you, hurry up. Stop wasting time.</i>

258
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,159
Coming! Here.

259
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,699
Why did Mr. Sun get sick suddenly?

260
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,119
I'm going to change my pants.

261
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,678
Hurry up!

262
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:05,039
How can you say that? Sickness comes quickly.

263
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,738
No one is willing to fall sick.

264
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:09,380
I'm worried. It's National Day.

265
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,639
Don't they have off days at the hospital, too?

266
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,740
- Will there be any good doctors?
- There will be.

267
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,199
Xue, hurry up!

268
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,020
Mrs. Ji Lan and the rest are already at the hospital!

269
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,938
<i>Coming! Immediately!</i>

270
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,578
Wear some warm clothes.

271
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,139
Wear more layers! Wear a pair of long johns, too.

272
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm not feeling cold!

273
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,380
Wear it even if you don't feel cold!

274
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,418
You'll feel warm when your feet are warm!

275
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,500
Wear a mask. You're always catching colds.

276
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:33,558
Dad, Mr. Sun was fine.

277
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,139
Why did he suddenly have a heart attack?

278
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,979
He smoked too much.

279
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:42,340
Yesterday night, he almost suffocated and called emergency services by himself.

280
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,239
He scared me.

281
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,338
His son just went back.

282
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,540
Oh.

283
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,379
Mr. Sun said he would cut ties with anyone who told his son.

284
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,619
Keep it a secret.

285
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:58,318
- All right. Let's go.
- Get the bag for me.

286
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,039
<i>[Peking Union Medical College Hospital]</i>

287
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,099
This old man is like a child.

288
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,739
I know, right?

289
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,278
They are here.

290
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,620
They are all here.

291
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,118
Ji Lan. Tianbao.

292
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,818
Why did you come out so quickly?

293
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:21,399
Don't mention it. He got angry.

294
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:23,859
He said we would trouble the hospital if all of us stay here.

295
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,518
He asked us to leave immediately. Look.

296
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,859
An old child.

297
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,419
- We have to be careful.
- Yes.

298
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:32,099
Mrs. Ji, didn't Shiyin come with you?

299
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,580
She said she had a study group with her classmates.

300
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,039
She is so busy that I can't even see her.

301
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,698
- All right. Go on.
- Go on.

302
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,180
Okay.

303
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,279
- Look at Shiyin.
- See you later.

304
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,060
Come in.

305
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,379
- Mr. Sun, we are here to visit you.
- Old man.

306
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,959
- Give it to me.
- Mr. Sun.

307
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,739
Mr. Sun.

308
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,960
Another group comes after one left.

309
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,838
Our family's relationship with you is different.

310
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,739
I also talked to Jin Ning just now.

311
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:09,278
Our families will take turns to cook for you

312
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,499
and our children will send it to you.

313
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,459
There's no need. I have food here.

314
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:17,300
Mr. Sun, I had to obey my master.

315
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
He missed you and asked me to assist you.

316
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,279
He missed me?

317
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,899
He's not here though.

318
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,939
He's afraid he'll argue with you

319
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:31,460
and make you angry, so he dare not come.

320
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,900
It's true. When a person is sick,

321
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,919
he can't even find a person to argue with.

322
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,979
Everyone is speaking to you nicely

323
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:46,159
because they are afraid you'll die once you get angry.

324
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,179
Look at you. What nonsense are you talking about?

325
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,497
You promised me. When Xue gets married,

326
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:56,139
you will make a set of pottery personally as a gift. Right?

327
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,318
Right, Xue?

328
00:18:57,318 --> 00:19:00,818
Yes, Mr. Sun. I don't want to get married without it.

329
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:04,979
Both of you are really mother and daughter.

330
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,780
All right. Now that you've visited me, you may go back.

331
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,539
Don't waste a good holiday on me.

332
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,458
All right. Just go back.

333
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:18,339
- Mr. Sun, if there's anything you need, you must call us.
- Sure.

334
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,620
- Take good care of yourself.
- Sure.

335
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,578
Goodbye, Mr. Sun.

336
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,030
- We are leaving, Mr. Sun.
- Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming.

337
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,239
Mr. Sun, have a mandarin orange.

338
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,399
I'm good. Give it to him.

339
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,379
He's not worthy of this service.

340
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:44,540
I don't like eating this, Mr. Sun.

341
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,498
This guy... is so stubborn.

342
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,100
What's wrong with me?

343
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,780
Mr. Sun, do you want some water?

344
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,499
No.

345
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,498
You came here so early. Did you not have breakfast today?

346
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,178
It's fine. I can skip a meal.

347
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:03,400
It's not fine. You have a weak stomach.

348
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,620
I'll buy breakfast for you. Wait here.

349
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:14,380
This kid might be stubborn,

350
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,250
but he is nice to you.

351
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,720
Mr. Sun, what are you talking about?

352
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:25,040
- Eat a mandarin orange.
- No. You eat it.

353
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,000
How nice.

354
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,140
Xue! Xue, hurry up! Xue!

355
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,540
Coming!

356
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,680
Ride faster. Otherwise, the food will be cold when you arrive.

357
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,799
I know.

358
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,639
Be safe!

359
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,520
Sunian.

360
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,920
Come on.

361
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
Okay.

362
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,758
Sunian, am I getting lighter?

363
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:07,539
I think I hear a punctured tire.

364
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,580
Nonsense!

365
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,800
Mr. Sun.

366
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,539
Where's Mr. Sun?

367
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,219
Did he escape from the hospital?

368
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:26,540
What are you thinking about?

369
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,939
<i>You can't make this move. If you do that, he'll chase you.</i>

370
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,139
<i>What's your next move?</i>

371
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:31,219
<i>I can use the advisor.</i>

372
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:33,939
What else? Nothing. The cannon is blocking here.

373
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,359
What else can you do?

374
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,819
Do you know how to play?

375
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,339
Yes.

376
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,899
You say you know how to play, but...

377
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,638
Go away. Let me play.

378
00:21:42,638 --> 00:21:44,999
Move aside.

379
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,358
You shouldn't speak as a spectator. Go back to your ward.

380
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,158
- No, you...
- Mr. Sun. Time to eat.

381
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:53,419
Okay. Bad move. So bad.

382
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:54,399
I can't bear to watch anymore.

383
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,799
You are the bad one. Don't come to our ward in the future.

384
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,118
He won't be coming back.

385
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,540
Let's go.

386
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,179
Getting angry at me when he's the one who has bad skills.

387
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:04,140
Bad Chinese chess player.

388
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,759
I went out to eat and you disappeared again.

389
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,539
Mr. Sun, this is the porridge my mom asked me to bring to you.

390
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,640
Thank you.

391
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,759
Qiaomu, where's Siyuan?

392
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,459
He went to my master's house to take some things.

393
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,759
We'll stay for a while longer then.

394
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,179
Sure. Thank you.

395
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:25,199
- Eat.
- Okay.

396
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,278
Sunian also knows how to be considerate now?

397
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:30,919
Sunian has always been considerate.

398
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,640
Sit.

399
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,960
- Have some fruit.
- Thanks.

400
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,140
Only to a certain person, right?

401
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,999
It would be nice if Siyuan were more like Sunian.

402
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,178
At least he wouldn't be single until now. Right?

403
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,399
Why are you looking at me?

404
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,720
I'm looking at you because I think

405
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,378
you must be feeling tired after these few days.

406
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:57,000
Go back and rest.

407
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,558
I'm not going back.

408
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,118
Mr. Sun, are you thinking of smoking again?

409
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,038
I've asked the doctor.

410
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,199
He said conservative therapy was the only thing suitable for your age.

411
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:09,279
What kind of therapy is that?

412
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,718
Conservative therapy means I should leave when my time's up.

413
00:23:12,718 --> 00:23:14,518
You're talking nonsense again.

414
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,758
Conservative therapy is using medication

415
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,719
to assist in living life with good habits.

416
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,079
My master is like a child. He is naughty.

417
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:23,599
The first thing he did after waking up from his nap

418
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,138
was ask Dou Siyuan to go to his house

419
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:28,098
and bring him the Chunghwa cigarettes that he was reluctant to smoke previously.

420
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:30,919
Mr. Sun, I think you're in the wrong business.

421
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,439
You shouldn't be in the Restoration Department.

422
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,818
You should go to that big chimney at the steel factory.

423
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:36,118
What kind of nonsense is that?

424
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,110
It's awesome when Qiaomu starts roasting people.

425
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,360
She is only showing her true nature.

426
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,680
Sunian, I want to film another short video.

427
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,439
Come and act for me.

428
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,000
Whatever you say, Qiaomu.

429
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,798
Well, I need to rest after I eat.

430
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,959
All of you should go back first.

431
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,399
Mr. Sun, don't try to fool me.

432
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,879
I'll say this now.

433
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,999
Don't even try to smoke as long as I'm here.

434
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,879
I'm not smoking.

435
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,058
- Give it to me.
- What?

436
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:15,459
The lighter.

437
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,779
- Sunian, eat a mandarin orange.
- Here.

438
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,639
Didn't you see me? Where did you two go?

439
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:47,338
Mr. Sun is sick and in the hospital.

440
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:48,799
We went to the hospital to visit him and send him food.

441
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,518
Mr. Sun is in the hospital?

442
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,598
Why didn't anyone tell me?

443
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,439
We were too busy these days and forgot about you.

444
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,399
Take me to him.

445
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,358
We just came back, we'll call you next time.

446
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,818
How could you forget me for something so important?

447
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:09,979
That's how much I'm worth in your hearts?

448
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,078
Oh, why are you here?

449
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,479
I'm waiting for you.

450
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,458
I went to your houses to look for you but you weren't there.

451
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,639
The holiday is over soon.

452
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,518
I still have a few movies I haven't watched.

453
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,300
Let's watch a movie at your house in the evening.

454
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,919
Great. Let's call Wu Huan and Shiyin, too.

455
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,358
I called Wu Huan. He will get off work soon.

456
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:30,638
Let's buy some snacks at the supermarket and pick him up.

457
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:33,239
Good idea. What about Shiyin?

458
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,418
- I don't think Lin Shiyin is interested.
- Why?

459
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:40,199
She is getting along well with Wang Haoran and the others.

460
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,477
Why is it Wang Haoran again?

461
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:44,838
Perhaps Lin Shiyin got cheated by Wang Haoran.

462
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,779
Do you think there's something good about Wang Haoran that we didn't notice?

463
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,658
That's impossible.

464
00:25:50,658 --> 00:25:53,658
- You must be jealous of his looks.
- I'm jealous of him?

465
00:25:53,658 --> 00:25:55,779
How can Sunian and I be jealous of Wang Haoran?

466
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:59,779
Sunian is definitely not jealous of him but I'm not sure about you.

467
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:02,118
Let's go and buy some snacks. Hurry up.

468
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:05,259
- Come on.
- Wait for me. I'm going to park my bike.

469
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,860
<i>[Shi Zu Store]</i>

470
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,459
Let me help you.

471
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,478
My shift ends in the evening, I'll help you right now in case you can't do it later.

472
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:22,959
Where are you going in the evening?

473
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,738
Zhang Qi's house. We will be watching a movie.

474
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,118
That's great.

475
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,619
What's so great about it?

476
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,320
It's so great to have friends.

477
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,219
You have friends too. I am your friend.

478
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,479
Xue too.

479
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,700
Of course. I meant friends

480
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,278
who have been playing with you since you were a child.

481
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,960
It's really good.

482
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,040
It's quite good indeed.

483
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,118
What do you want to eat? I'll pay for you.

484
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,299
I'm not picky. Anything will do.

485
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,518
- How's this?
- Great.

486
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,399
Isn't that Wu Huan?

487
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,859
Isn't this Wu Huan?

488
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,379
What's wrong? Are you working and studying here now?

489
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,118
Get a bag of instant noodles for me.

490
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,698
It's right beside you.

491
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:23,820
Help me take it.

492
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,440
One bag is not enough.

493
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,278
I'm taking potato chips. Go and find Wu Huan.

494
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,439
- Boss!
- Boss!

495
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,018
- Come and take a look! This guy is publicly...
- Wu Huan!

496
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:45,839
What's wrong with Wu Huan?

497
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,239
You called for backup?

498
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,278
Fine. Go and call your boss here.

499
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,579
Just wait.

500
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,810
Wu Huan, did you bully him?

501
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,330
<i>[Shi Zu Store]</i>

502
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,959
Move aside.

503
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,199
Boss, it's them.

504
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,450
- Shiyin?
- Boss.

505
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,640
What's wrong?

506
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,118
They bullied me because I was alone.

507
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,558
Who's your boss?

508
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,640
You? Mr. Romeo?

509
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,480
We are all civilized people.

510
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,359
Let's talk it out.

511
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,939
Wang Haoran, it's been so long and you are more useless now.

512
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:27,440
You are all Shiyin's friends.

513
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,199
Let's not get angry over this.

514
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,299
Shiyin, why are you getting along with them?

515
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,839
Come here.

516
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,679
We are all friends. Don't do this.

517
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,638
Shiyin, I won't make this difficult for you.

518
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:41,679
Since none of us is happy about this,

519
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,518
let me think of a better solution.

520
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,078
What solution? A bluff contest?

521
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,598
Basketball. Do you dare accept the challenge?

522
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,718
- Sure. I accept.
- Fine.

523
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:54,598
See you tomorrow afternoon at the basketball court.

524
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,499
You better come.

525
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:01,760
Shiyin, let's go.

526
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,599
Shiyin.

527
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,318
- Lin Shiyin!
- You're a coward if you don't appear!

528
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:10,798
- Just wait!
- You just wait!

529
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,960
They are all from the school team.

530
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:17,518
That group of jerks?

531
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:19,178
I'm fine.

532
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:22,518
Both of you, do your best. What do you want to eat? I'm buying.

533
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,160
Wu Huan, are you all right?

534
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,520
I'm fine.

535
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:55,880
<i>Wang Haoran, do your best!</i>

536
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,779
I'll crush you today.

537
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,319
That's not necessary.

538
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,358
Since this is a competition, let's have a wager.

539
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:07,199
- What wager?
- Whoever loses will kneel down and call the winner Boss.

540
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,960
You'll have to follow my orders.

541
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,798
If you lose, kneel down and apologize to Wu Huan.

542
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,139
All three of you.

543
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:16,419
- That's impossible.
- Let's see.

544
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,679
Fine. Bring it!

545
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,459
Wait.

546
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:22,780
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

547
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,900
I want to have a one-on-one with you.

548
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
He wants to have a one-on-one match.

549
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,639
Huanhuan, are you serious?

550
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,159
Can you do this, Wu Huan?

551
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,739
I'll take care of my own matters.

552
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:41,900
Sure. Don't forget the wager.

553
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:52,500
<i>- Wang Haoran, do your best!
- Wu Huan, do your best!</i>

554
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,919
Here are the rules.

555
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,318
First to eight points wins.

556
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:57,780
You must accept the final result.

557
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,358
Huanhuan, start first. Crush him.

558
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,600
Let him start first.

559
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,159
If you're so great, start first.

560
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:16,478
Sunian, do you think Wu Huan will be fine?

561
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:18,839
Let him try it.

562
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,179
- Ran!
- Amazing!

563
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,040
Wang Haoran, two points.

564
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,839
Nice!

565
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,800
Do your best, Wu Huan!

566
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,418
This is the final shot.

567
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:13,200
Call me boss if you lose.

568
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:18,758
- Do your best, Wu Huan!
- Wu Huan, do your best!

569
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,540
You're not going to accept your loss, right?

570
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,059
I'll give you a chance.

571
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,578
Great! He scored.

572
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,999
Good job, Wu Huan!

573
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,940
He only scored once. Why are they showing off?

574
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,779
Wang Haoran, do your best!

575
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:09,919
- A handicap for you.
- Wu Huan, do your best!

576
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,879
Do your best, Wu Huan!

577
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,839
Do your best!

578
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,238
He won! Sunian, he won!

579
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:57,558
- I said that you'd win!
- Wu Huan, amazing!

580
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:00,178
- I said that you'd win!
- Yes!

581
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:02,999
You were so great!

582
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,580
- Stand there.
- What's wrong?

583
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,239
You said you'd kneel down and apologize.

584
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,518
Zhang Qi, forget it.

585
00:34:08,518 --> 00:34:12,638
No. If we lose, do you think they'll forget it?

586
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,620
I mean let's forget about the kneeling part.

587
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,038
What is it?

588
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,820
- What's wrong?
- Wang Haoran.

589
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,759
Are you trying to be as shameless as possible?

590
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,118
- Zhang Qi.
- Lin Shiyin.

591
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:28,218
Why do you side with someone like him?

592
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,759
Xue, forget it.

593
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,799
Have you forgotten how they bullied Wu Huan?

594
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,438
It was Wu Huan who was annoying Lin Shiyin. Mind your mouth!

595
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:37,200
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

596
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,019
Shiyin.

597
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,758
- Xue, actually, I...
- Don't explain to me.

598
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,158
Explain it to Wu Huan.

599
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,279
Sunian, let's go. Wu Huan!

600
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,080
Xue.

601
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,319
Sunian.

602
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,180
Are you still angry?

603
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,840
Tell me. Why did Shiyin become like this?

604
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,099
Everyone has a different opinion

605
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,519
so they will also have different choices.

606
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,959
We have no way to alter their choices.

607
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,839
But I believe Shiyin can clearly see

608
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,299
who the person is who treats her well.

609
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,600
I hope so.

610
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,879
Get on.

611
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,178
If we keep walking, we'll be having mid-night snacks instead of dinner.

612
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,499
Let's go.

613
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,180
Hold tight.

614
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,300
Wu Huan.

615
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,959
Tang Ya.

616
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,799
Did the supervisor say something because I suddenly requested a leave today?

617
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,518
No.

618
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,839
The supervisor said he had seen the security camera footage.

619
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,198
He knew they were causing trouble.

620
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,479
He wants us to call security if it happens again.

621
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,279
Staff members have rights, too.

622
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,580
He is so nice.

623
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,319
Do you want to come in?

624
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,638
There's no need.

625
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,579
I don't want to disturb your mother.

626
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,858
Why don't you sit here? Let me get you a glass of water.

627
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,140
There's no need.

628
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,399
Have you eaten?

629
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,399
I brought you bread.

630
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,198
Today's bread contains so much meat floss.

631
00:37:07,198 --> 00:37:08,939
It's very delicious.

632
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,839
Thank you.

633
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,759
Why don't you eat it?

634
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:26,610
I have one, too.

635
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:28,900
Sit down then.

636
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,200
Wu Huan.

637
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:59,038
I don't really understand.

638
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,080
Why do you treat Lin Shiyin so nicely?

639
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,999
Maybe I don't know her well. But as an outsider,

640
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,660
I think... she...

641
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,479
isn't worth it.

642
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,638
There's a story.

643
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,499
Do you want to hear it?

644
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,799
When I was a child, many children

645
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,158
weren't willing to play with me because of my family.

646
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,180
I was already being bullied in kindergarten.

647
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:39,959
At that time,

648
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:43,538
I was yet to become friends with Zhang Qi, Sunian, and Xue.

649
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:45,959
<i>Welcome!</i>

650
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,760
<i>Coming up next is Xinxin and Orange.</i>

651
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,959
<i>Please give them a round of applause.</i>

652
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,279
<i>Why is Wu Huan sitting there alone?</i>

653
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,718
<i>No one wants to be friends with him.</i>

654
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,679
<i>Next to go on stage are Tiantian and Yiyi.</i>

655
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,600
<i>Please give them a round of applause.</i>

656
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,080
<i>Will you walk the red carpet with me?</i>

657
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,399
Shiyin was my first friend.

658
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:41,300
So, Shiyin is a light that shines in my life.

659
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,679
But what if this light burns you?

660
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,099
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

661
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,640
I'm just afraid...

662
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,320
afraid...

663
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,200
afraid that it'll get extinguished.

664
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,959
Mr. Sun, you are going to lose again.

665
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,200
Nonsense.

666
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,638
It's still too early.

667
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,558
Mr. Sun, enough struggling. It's no use.

668
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:46,499
Don't boost his morale.

669
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,820
It's getting late. Time to rest.

670
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,120
Mr. Sun, just treat this game as a tie.

671
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,880
Good.

672
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,759
I should save the young people from embarrassment.

673
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,678
Sure. Rest early, Mr. Sun.

674
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,139
- We'll be leaving.
- Okay.

675
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,519
Let me send you two off.

676
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,119
It's fine, Siyuan. We'll be fine.

677
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,419
No way. It's late. It's not safe for two kids.

678
00:41:17,419 --> 00:41:19,959
Siyuan, Sunian is taller than you.

679
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,039
So what? Height doesn't equal strength.

680
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,878
Sunian is good at studying. His brain is filled with books and knowledge.

681
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:28,938
If there's any danger, he won't know how to escape.

682
00:41:28,938 --> 00:41:31,999
Let's go. I'll send you both. I can grab some food as well.

683
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,399
- We're leaving, Mr. Sun.
- Bye.

684
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,719
- Bye.
- Bye.

685
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,640
Eat some hot food.

686
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,198
- You should go too.
- I don't want to.

687
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,399
I don't care about him.

688
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,579
Both of you are really...

689
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,299
♫ <i>As I traverse this path without minding it</i> ♫

690
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,859
♫ <i>My memory does all the hard work for me</i> ♫

691
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:20,980
♫ <i>All the memories are embedded deep within my heart</i> ♫

692
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,519
♫ <i>The past I've been hiding from year after year</i> ♫

693
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:28,319
♫ <i>Carved into the days long gone</i> ♫

694
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:36,160
♫ <i>Although simplicity is plain, its vibrancy has never faded</i> ♫

695
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,920
♫ <i>Those songs in the past</i> ♫

696
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,840
♫ <i>They had accompanied me through everything</i> ♫

697
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:51,540
♫ <i>Singing about the stubbornness of our youth</i> ♫

698
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:59,139
♫ <i>Using this song to boost our courage as we sing</i> ♫

699
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:06,459
♫ <i>Please don't cry because you have me</i> ♫

700
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,760
♫ <i>Until I saw the bustling city</i> ♫

701
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,380
♫ <i>Until I realized that it was once within my reach</i> ♫

702
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:38,379
♫ <i>I was this sober once but I still did the same thing</i> ♫

703
00:43:38,379 --> 00:43:41,880
♫ <i>As days go by, I wish to forget</i> ♫

704
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,779
♫ <i>But unknowingly, I remember them again</i> ♫

705
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,700
♫ <i>I remember the deep feelings that were long gone</i> ♫

706
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,920
♫ <i>Within those simple days</i> ♫

707
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:01,300
♫ <i>Those songs in the past, they had accompanied me</i> ♫

708
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:09,019
♫ <i>As I regretted our parting during our youth</i> ♫

709
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:16,600
♫ <i>Using this song, this song belongs to us</i> ♫

710
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,659
♫ <i>Please don't cry again</i> ♫

711
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:27,380
♫ <i>And don't ask when I'll return</i> ♫
