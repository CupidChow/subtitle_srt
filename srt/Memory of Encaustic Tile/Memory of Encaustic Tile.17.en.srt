I like seeing you.

I'll visit you every day.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,190
You have school.

38
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,520
If your grades go down, your mother will be mad at me.

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,030
I'll come after school. I can do my homework here.

It's better than being next to my mom.

Don't let your mother hear this.

Otherwise...

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Is it hurting again?

44
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,000
Maybe you can take another half of the painkiller.

I'm fine.

Yes, Ms. Jin Ning.

50
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,020
You're the talkative one,

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,380
but you haven't said a word since you came in.

52
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,210
Is it too much to see me in my current state?

53
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,840
Don't say that.

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,510
I've always wanted a wife as pretty as you are.

he's indeed great at it.

57
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,590
Ms. Jin Ning, my mom is on a business trip in Hong Kong.

58
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,150
She's been to many major hospitals.

59
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,470
They have more treatment plans for your condition.

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,800
She wants to talk to you about it.

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,190
She can even transfer you there.

62
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,740
Don't make your mother worry.

63
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,910
Zhang Qi, do as I say.

64
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,800
Tell your mother to take care of herself.

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,790
Beijing has the greatest doctors.

66
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,780
- If they can't do it here, I don't...
- They can cure you.

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,880
They certainly can.

68
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,450
Yes, Ms. Jin Ning. You will get well.

69
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,810
My mom is waiting for you to take her abroad.

70
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,420
She won't go without you.

71
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,960
She doesn't know the language and the customs.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,020
What if she gets lost?

73
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,993
Okay.

74
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,920
I have more free time now.

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,560
I can plan the trip.

76
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,511
Great. I'll tell my mom.

77
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,310
She'll be so excited that she can't fall asleep.

78
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,680
I bet she'll stare at the calendar.

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,313
Okay.

80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,000
- Why are you here?
- Hand me the food.

81
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,720
It's time to eat, Mom.

82
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,390
Sunian, you came just in time.

83
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,270
Take the two of them out and grab some food.

84
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,130
Eating hospital meals has made you lose so much weight.

85
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,510
Listen to me.

86
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,120
Go get some decent food.

- It's okay, Ms. Jin Ning.
- It's okay.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,151
- Take it.
- Never mind, Dad. I have money.

90
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,170

Don't forget to finish your food, Mom.

94

You don't have to come here all the time.

97

Studies are your priority.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,670
If you keep doing this, I'll quit.

99
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,870

100
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,330
Yeah, what did we do?

101
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,610
I am the same person.

102
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,870
I didn't change into a monster. Don't tiptoe around me.

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,920
Okay.

104

Look at your bangs. They are blocking your sight.

I'm fine with anything.

Don't be so mean.

118

Did you sniff too much disinfectant and find enlightenment?

119

You're probably right.

We'll leave it there.

Sunian, I never thought you still cared about those cats.

you are so kind to the cat.

Yeah. I've never had anything so expensive before.

163
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,550
People might think it's not fair for them.

164
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,840
I do what I want.

165
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,340
They don't have to buy it if they don't like it.

166
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,390
Sunian, I've wanted to pay her a visit.

167
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,740
But I got busy lately and can't make the time.

168
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,120
It's okay, Ms. Deng.

169
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,920
She'll crave your food when she sees you.

170
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,150
That's easy.

171
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,530
I'll just make more for her.

172
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,980
Is there any food that she must avoid?

173
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,750
I'll make her some bone soup later.

174
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,200
It's very nutritious.

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,900
It's okay, Ms. Deng.

176
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,220
She doesn't have an appetite.

177
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,200
She can't eat anything.

178
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,493
She was all right, how did...

179
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,330
Sunian.

180
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,750
Trust me, kind people will have good karma.

181
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,240
Your mother will get well.

182
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,380
I believe it, too.

183
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,160
Here, Sunian, take it.

184
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,960
Give your mother my regards.

185
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,750
Let me know when she is available. I want to visit her.

186
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,770
Thank you, Ms. Deng.

187
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,620
Don't mention it.

188
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,870
We'll eat at my house.

189
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,203
Never mind.

190
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,620
My dad is alone at the hospital.

191
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,050
If I go there now, he can take a break.

192
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,810
I'll get going now.

193
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,980
<i>[Ro Jia Mo]</i>

194
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,000
Sunian...

195
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,600
Whenever you need any kind of help, let me know.

196
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,150
Yes. Me too.

197
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,660
Just stay healthy and well.

198
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,503
I'll be fine.

199
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:58,883
See you.

200
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,240
Sunian, wait!

201
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,100
Take this.

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,660
This is...

203
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,020
I prepared some tonics. Give them to your mother.

204
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,680
I can't make the time.

205
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,770
Here, take it.

206
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,270
Go on.

207
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,903
Thank you.

208
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,250
He keeps saying he's fine, but he's just pretending.

209
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,870
Sunian is smiling,

210
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,810
but when I see him smile,

211
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,410
I feel sad for him.

212
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,820
We must stay strong.

213
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,050
As he said, he feels full of energy when he sees me.

214
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,230
I agree with him.

215
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,670
I feel full of energy too when I see you.

216
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,480
That is why I must put this strong point to great use.

217
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,271
I can't help with Ms. Jin Ning's condition, but at least,

218
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:02,450
I can bring them joy.

219
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,630
Sometimes, you really impress me.

220
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,321
You are so optimistic about everything.

221
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,773
Dad.

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,533
Dad?

223
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,741
- You're here.
- What are you doing here?

224
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,833
Your mother chased me out.

225
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,350
She wants me to go home and rest.

226
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,760
This will warm your hands.

227
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,573
I understand.

228
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,620
Zhang Qi and Xue also told me to go home.

229
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,020
I don't want to go home either.

230
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,620
When I'm in that house,

231
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,050
I keep thinking...

232
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,350
how she used to be.

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,030
Dad, be honest with me.

234
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,960
Is Mom's condition...

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
deteriorating again?

236
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,400
The doctor told me...

237
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,870
I should transfer her to the intensive care unit.

238
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,140
What's the difference?

239
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,260
The difference...

240
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,950
Your mother's daily necessities

241
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,750
must strictly follow the doctor's instructions.

242
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,370
We can't be with her all the time.

243
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,810
We only have four hours every day to keep her company, it might not be enough for her!

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,193
So...

245
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,040
How long...

246
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:26,365
is she going to be in there?

247
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,075
Until...

248
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,895
Until she is cured.

249
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:47,948
Dad.

250
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:51,175
Can Mom...

251
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,545
really be cured?

252
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:04,778
Yes.

253
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:08,288
Yes.

254
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,635
I told you...

255
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:40,025
to go home and rest well.

256
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,135
Hello, Ms. Jin Ning.

257
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:46,705
I wasn't expecting you.

258
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:48,625
Please come in.

259
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,178
Come.

260
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,095
Come.

261
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:55,165
Sit next to me.

262
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:58,125
Come closer.

263
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,338
Come on.

264
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,655
How did you...

265
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:12,445
get into this mess?

266
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:17,025
There goes the saying,

267
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:20,125
"No one knows the future for sure."

268
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:25,155
Ms. Jin Ning, I work at a supermarket nearby.

269
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:28,425
If you crave anything, ask Sunian to inform me.

270
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:30,225
I'll deliver them to you right away.

271
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:32,185
Okay.

272
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:37,405
I'm so glad you are so kind to me.

273
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:39,755
Ms. Jin Ning, you need to decide.

274
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:42,185
If not, I'll send you random items.

275
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:43,885
Don't waste your money.

276
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:47,335
I have everything I need here.

277
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,895
If you are sending gifts, send them to your family.

278
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:55,055
Make sure you and your mother eat well.

279
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:00,715
Ms. Jin Ning, I have matters to see to.

280
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:03,465
I should get going. You two carry on.

281
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,305
Mom, I'm going now.

282
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:13,655
He is such a nice kid.

283
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,665
You look well.

284
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,745
And you're the opposite.

285
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,515
I know.

286
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:25,005
What's so funny?

287
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:27,435
How can you still laugh at a time like this?

288
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,475
I'm already bedridden.

289
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:34,225
Whether I laugh or cry,

290
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:36,485
it won't make a difference.

291
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,685
I'm just clinging onto my life.

292
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:43,865
This is nice.

293
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:45,955
What's nice?

294
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:50,835
With you around,

295
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:53,685
I can finally be honest with someone.

296
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,305
Xin Jie,

297
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,345
do you know...

298
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:04,405
what I hate the most at this moment?

299
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:10,025
It's waking up.

300
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:14,265
When I wake up every day,

301
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:19,745
I have to face the frail being I've become.

302
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:23,935
Everyone I care about...

303
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,830
slowly becomes so drained and desperate...

304
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:32,715
because of me.

305
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,735
I don't know if I can...

306
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:42,415
compare my suffering to what you have been through,

307
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:46,465
but right now,

308
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:48,625
I am in a lot of pain.

309
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:53,565
If I could make you feel better,

310
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:56,085
- I...
- It pains me to see you like this!

311
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,265
I thought I hated you.

312
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:08,235
I wanted you to have the worst and most miserable life.

313
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:11,265
But when I learned you've been sick,

314
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:16,225
I couldn't sleep well at night.

315
00:21:16,225 --> 00:21:18,985
I refused to believe what I heard.

316
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,095
Then, I felt this pain in my heart.

317
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:23,955
And then,

318
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:27,445
I began to hate myself.

319
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:32,335
Maybe all those thoughts I had about you

320
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:35,175
had become a reality.

321
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:40,195
Was it my fault?

322
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,855
It's because of my cursed mouth!

323
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:43,815
My cursed mouth!

324
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:47,065
- Maybe it...
- Senior... Senior!

325
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:50,225
Stop it.

326
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:59,035
This is more heart-wrenching than the most depressing TV drama.

327
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,125
Slowly.

328
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:13,815
Sit.

329
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:15,648
Sit down.

330
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,935
Senior.

331
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:27,365
Senior, thank you.

332
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:29,905
Thank you for visiting.

333
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,615
I went to the temple yesterday.

334
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:43,115
I prayed to Buddha

335
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:47,325
so all those thoughtsI had won't come true.

336
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,405
As long as you are well,

337
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:52,935
I'm willing to do anything.

338
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:55,618
No.

339
00:22:55,618 --> 00:22:58,435
Go to the temple again.

340
00:22:58,435 --> 00:23:00,125
Take back what you said.

341
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:04,425
You are now having a better life,

342
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,055
so is Wu Huan.

343
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:08,745
You must pray for yourself

344
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:11,425
and for Wu Huan.

345
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,885
Do not be concerned about me.

346
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:16,895
My life means nothing.

347
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,715
When I die,

348
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:23,895
Wu Huan will finally be free.

349
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:27,235
Senior!

350
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:32,825
Promise me that as long as life can go on,

351
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:36,645
you must never give up so easily.

352
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:45,435
You must stay strong and live

353
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:48,485
so that I can remember you and keep hating you.

354
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:52,525
It's the only thing that gives hope to my life, is that clear?

355
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:56,025
Sure. I'll do my best.

356
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:04,475
Mom, I need to have a word with you.

357
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:09,775
I want to visit Ms. Jin Ning every day.

358
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:12,535
Don't worry, it won't affect my studies.

359
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,535
I'll bring my books there.

360
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:21,725
Wait, you just said

361
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:23,465
you were scared.

362
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,665
I reflected on it.

363
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:28,505
Ms. Jin Ning needs me right now.

364
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:32,645
I cannot run away just because I am mentally weak.

365
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:36,425
I must face the problem bravely to solve it.

366
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:37,858
Am I right?

367
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:42,221
Our daughter has grown up.

368
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:44,295
She sounds like an adult.

369
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:47,165
Dad, I am already 17 years old.

370
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:49,135
I am an adult now.

371
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:51,295
I can't always let you protect me.

372
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:54,165
I must learn to face the problems myself.

373
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:58,558
Sure. I'll visit her with you.

374
00:24:58,558 --> 00:24:59,675
You're coming too?

375
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:04,055
If my daughter knows about facing the problem, I must follow suit.

376
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:05,615
We should spend more time with her.

377
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:09,815
That should give Sunian and his father more time to rest.

378
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:11,348
Okay.

379
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:16,105
The three of us will visit her.

380
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:18,925
- Eat up.
- Okay.

381
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:46,645
Stop looking.

382
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,855
You're already pretty.

383
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,755
Keep it down.

384
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,795
I've been pretty my entire life.

385
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:02,885
When the end is near, I turned into this mess.

386
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:05,825
Don't be silly.

387
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,995
I'm even more hideous when the pain comes.

388
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:12,185
Stop it, or I'll get mad at you.

389
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:24,225
I don't care what the others see.

390
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:27,385
But I must at least be presentable

391
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,035
for my son.

392
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,198
Zheng.

393
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:42,085
Cover for me, will you?

394
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:45,135
When I look the most hideous,

395
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,905
I don't want my son to see me.

00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,455
- What's the matter?
- It hurts.

399
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:23,605
- Is it hurting again?
- It hurts!

400
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:26,178
- How bad is it?
- Mom...

401
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,235
Sunian, call the doctor.

402
00:27:28,235 --> 00:27:30,025
Is it very painful? Hang in there.

403
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,186
What is taking so long?

404
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:37,056
Hang in there. I'll hold it for you.

405
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,605
- It hurts!
- Doctor, it's suddenly hurting. It's very severe.

406
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:41,605
- I...
- Lay still.

407
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:42,956
How about this? The family can wait outside.

408
00:27:42,956 --> 00:27:45,035
- But she... she is in great pain!
- Sir, please do as you are told.

409
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:46,505
She won't be afraid when I'm here.

410
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,815
We need your cooperation. Thank you.

411
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:50,715
- Okay.
- Thank you.

412
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:54,925

Doctor, how is it?

415
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:23,645
She passed out.

416
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:26,035
This will only happen more often from now on.

417
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:29,035
I suggest you transfer her to the ICU as soon as possible.

418
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:30,945
It'll be easier for both of you.

419
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:33,965
When she's awake, you should discuss it with her.

Okay, thank you.

421

Your mother told me...

she didn't want you to see her in pain.

429
00:29:24,335 --> 00:29:26,975
She is too prideful.

430

Let's not make her feel embarrassed.

431

Please.

432

This is for you.

434
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:49,165
It's pretty.

435
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,475
I had a dream.

436
00:30:54,475 --> 00:30:56,305
Really?

437
00:30:58,295 --> 00:30:59,605
What do you see?

438
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:01,645
In my dream,

439
00:31:01,645 --> 00:31:04,335
we were still young.

440
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:08,215
When we first met,

441
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:11,365
you were scratched by a cat.

442
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:16,605
I took you to the hospital for an injection on my bike.

443
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:18,555
On the way there,

444
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:22,605
people were making fun of you.

445
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:28,445
In hindsight, it was baffling.

446
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:32,165
That bike had a small backseat.

447
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:36,655
I could barely ride a straight line, how did you not fall off?

448
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:41,345
Back then... it was almost unbearable.

449
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:47,205
Tell me. How unbearable was it?

450
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,475
Back then, my hand was hurt.

451
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,295
I couldn't hold onto anything.

452
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:56,125
I wouldn't dare to hold your waist with my other hand.

453
00:31:56,165 --> 00:32:00,465
I was sitting at the back, so I had to maintain the balance. Like so.

454
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:04,625

and tell you I was your wife.

460

I'd tell you to marry me.

461

I bet you'd be terrified.

But that wouldn't stop me from telling you.

463
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:47,385
I must tell you...

464
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:52,045
to cherish every second we spend together...

465
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:55,595

Because we have plenty of time to be with each other.

We would have so much time to spend with each other.

Actually, this is my fault.

471
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:18,525
Why should I blame you?

472
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:22,735
You took great care of yourself when you were young.

473
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:27,385
You did your check-ups regularly.

474
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:32,315
But after we got married, you kept everything to yourself.

475
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:35,775
And that eventually got you sick.

476
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,805
This is indeed your fault.

477
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:42,415
You spoiled me.

478
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:46,835
I got too lazy with everything.

479
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:50,215
I was too lazy to get a check-up.

the first thing I think when I wake up...

00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,900
is what new way there is to spoil you.

I mean it.

484
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:14,698

No.

00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,895
You need time to recover.

489
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:28,875
When you get well, you can leave this place.

490
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:32,065
I don't want to go there.

491

Zheng Jin,

492
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:38,835
I thought it through.

493
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:41,635
Everyone dies someday.

494
00:34:42,895 --> 00:34:44,995
Listen to me.

495
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:50,255
The ICU costs too much money.

496
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:54,785
They charge several thousand just for a day there.

497
00:34:54,785 --> 00:35:00,065
Sunian still needs the money in the future.

498
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:05,105
You are just extending my life with money.

499
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,455
It's meaningless.

500
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:13,095
You must live on.

501
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:17,065
You must live on and be well.

502
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:23,815
We agreed, there is still plenty of time.

503
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:27,835
I need to think of more ways to spoil you.

504
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:31,775
When you get well, take me on a ride on a bicycle.

505
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:34,565
I won't hold your waist. I'll spread my arms.

506
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:16,898
Sunian. Sunian!

507
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:19,485
Why are you sitting here alone?

508
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:21,815
I came out to buy breakfast.

509
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:23,815
It's already 11:00.

510
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,125
It's that late already?

511
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,375
I'll buy lunch, too.

512
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,295
Go on without me.

513
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:35,315
I'll go with you.

514
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:39,168
It's okay.

515
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:42,315
Go on.

516
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,985
My mother is such a nice person.

517
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,905
Why her?

518
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,425
Why is it her?

519
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:59,625
Why her of all people?

520
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:05,045
<i>I've known Sunian for 17 years.</i>

521
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:07,575
<i>I've never seen him cry.</i>

522
00:38:07,575 --> 00:38:09,585
<i>He never liked fighting,</i>

523
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:11,785
<i>nor is he easily frustrated.</i>

524
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:15,695
<i>The teachers have always taught him</i>

525
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:18,335
<i>that everything will have a bright side.</i>

526
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:23,045
<i>Those who don't know him well will think he is a cold person.</i>

527
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:27,995
<i>But in my heart, he's always so strong and capable.</i>

528
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:32,375
<i>He is Sunian who is capable of anything.</i>

529
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,775
<i>But he is having a breakdown in front of me.</i>

530
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:41,015
<i>His breakdowns are silent and unnoticeable.</i>

531
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:46,115
<i>I've never felt so sorry for him.</i>

532
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,485
<i>I wish I could become stronger right now</i>

533
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:52,935
<i>and become a shoulder he can rely on</i>

534
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:55,405
<i>so that when he's afraid,</i>

535
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:57,415
<i>I can give him strength.</i>

536
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,000
<i>[Textile Division]</i>

Dongge?

538
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,605
Check this for me. Is it good enough?

539
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:42,688
Dongge?

540
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:45,098
Dongge?

541
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:47,535
You have silk wrapped around your hand.

542
00:39:52,895 --> 00:39:54,945
Is something bothering you?

543
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:59,875
Is it about Jin Ning?

544
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,005
Yes.

545
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,255
I can't help myself.

546
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:12,195
How did it...

547
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:17,155
Has her condition improved?

548
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:23,455
She looks frailer with every passing day.

549
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,735
She is slowly...

550
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:28,565
losing her hair.

551
00:40:30,485 --> 00:40:32,565
I made a hat for her.

552
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:36,575
I even added the embroidery of a lily on it.

553
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:40,405
But I'm not sure if she will wear it.

554
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,575
She certainly will.

555
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:44,795
Your craftsmanship is remarkable.

556
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:51,875
Not even the most beautiful hat is good enough for her.

557
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:57,875
After all, she had beautiful hair.

558
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:13,420
- Mr. Zheng! Mr. Zheng!
- This one must be reworked.

559
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:17,165
Mr. Shao, where is Mr. Zheng?

560
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:20,155
He's not here. What is it?

561
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:22,455
A British pocket watch for the exhibition has some issues.

562
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:24,735
The staff there only recognizes Mr. Zheng's craftsmanship.

563
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:28,055
They want him there to examine it.

564
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:29,975
Mr. Zheng is not available.

565
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:32,670
<i>[Case file]</i>
Will Mr. Shao do?

566
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,736
You are a master craftsman. Of course, you can do it.

567
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:38,185
But where is Mr. Zheng anyway?

568
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:40,525
There are so many watch exhibitions coming our way.

569
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:42,355
We need every worker we have.

570
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:46,635
If there is anything that needs Mr. Zheng, let me handle them instead.

571
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:48,625
That's too much work for you.

572
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:50,525
We'll do it one at a time.

573
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:55,205
Mr. Lu Xun once said this, "Time is like water in a sponge.

574
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:57,485
You can always get some by squeezing hard enough."

575
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:00,985
When is Mr. Zheng coming back?

576
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,735
His wife is sick.

577
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:06,155
Is his wife...

578
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:07,598
Let's go.

579
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:19,225
A modal verb with the present perfect continuous of a verb

580
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:21,895
indicates a guess about the past.

581
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:23,295
Take this sentence as an example.

582
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:30,325
"Your mother must have been looking for you."

583
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:34,498
Shao Xue,

584
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,805
please give an example.

585
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,515
Xue. Xue!

586
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,118
Shao Xue!

587
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:45,965
Give us a sentence with past tenses.

588
00:42:47,185 --> 00:42:50,245
She was healthy.

589
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:52,605
Use the sentence on the blackboard.

590
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:54,405
Change it into past tense.

591
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,875
What were you doing just now?

592
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:58,165
You will be in your senior year soon.

593
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:00,685
You should pay more attention to your studies.

594
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:02,195
The same goes for the rest of you.

595
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:05,575
Pay attention during the classes.

596
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:10,188
Class dismissed.

597
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:19,125
I should have reminded you, but I didn't understand it either.

598
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,265
Sorry.

599
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,785
I should have paid more attention.

600
00:43:21,785 --> 00:43:23,685
This isn't your fault.
