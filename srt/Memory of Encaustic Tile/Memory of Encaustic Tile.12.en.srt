Thanks. Bye.

Had the sound not been turned off,

49
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,600
we all would have heard your classic line.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,200
What a shame.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400

You are my everything.

53
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,300
Your voice made me believe

54
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,400
that all suffering will come to an end.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,300
The look in your eyes made me believe

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,600
that all the goodness is eternal.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,500
I'm not one to seek any dispute,

58
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,000
but if anyone wants to take you from me,

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
I will put everything I have on the line

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,600
and fight to the very end.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,100
What was that for?

62
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,400
You are clearly good at acting,

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
why couldn't you recite it just as well back then?

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,900
I don't like acting.

65
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,300
Why are you acting now?

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,300
I don't mind trying it with you.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't do that again.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,600

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600

75

Yes.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
These are the places I want to visit someday.

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,000
When we are older, I'll take you there.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
Okay.

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
It's so dark in here.

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,900
Silly boy.

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,800

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
Nothing.

86
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,799
The blue one with white patterns?

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,500
Yes. What's wrong?

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,400
I gave it to Ms. Jin Ning.

89
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,200
If you were so fond of it, why did you give it away?

90
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,000
Listen.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Sometimes, you must fight for it.

92
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,800
But there are times you must learn to let go.

93
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
What do you have in mind? I'll get it for you.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,500
Nothing.

95
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000

Why the sudden interest in learning English?

147
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,600
Mr. Sun.

148
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,900
I wanted to give you the "English Dictionary of Chinese Pottery"

149
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,800
and you scolded me for it.

150
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
You said, "I've lived a long life,

151
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,100
death is already waving its hand at me,

152

why would I bother learning English? No way!"

153
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,500
It's true, he did...

154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,800
That is not helpful at all.

00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Embroidery.

168
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,400
E-M-B...

169
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,200
E-M-B-R-O-I-D...

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,299
That's too long! It's much longer than the word "silk."

171
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,839
This is too tough.

172
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,789
When the foreign tourists are here,

173
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,000
are you only going to tell them about the silk?

174
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
Forget it. Enough with the quiz.

175
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,800
You should let me take the time to learn it.

176
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,200
I get it now.

177
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Xue got third place in her grade

178
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,700
on the English test, it couldn't have been easy.

179
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,200
See? Are you showing off now?

180
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm not showing off.

181
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,900
English won't do her any good

182
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,800
if she does so badly in math.

183
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
She's still below average even with the two subjects combined.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,200
How did it go with the program of studying abroad?

185
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,100
Any updates?

186
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,900
I was told the math in foreign countries is not as hard.

187
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,700
Maybe Xue might become a top student when she is there.

188
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,200
It's best if there are no updates.

189
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,100
If there is, we will be fighting again.

190
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,600
Don't you want her to go outside?

191
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,500
It's best to keep her where I can see her.

192
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,100
Haven't you watched the international news?

193
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,400
There is trouble almost every day.

194
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm worried.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
There are peaceful places.

196
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
I think it's best for her to stay at home.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,400
If anything comes up, the friends and families can still help her out.

198
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,100
If she is out there alone, she has no friends.

199
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,800
It'll be so hard for her if she needs help.

200
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
You have a point.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,600
Who could it be?

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
Mr. Liu?

203
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,600
Hold this.

204
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,599
What's wrong with her?

205
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Does she not like holidays?

206
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,300
She messed up during the exam.

207
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,400
Only five people flunked math.

208
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,500
She is one of them.

209
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,629
She messed up?

210
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,910
I thought she worked really hard for it.

211
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,669
She worked hard, but she still couldn't do well in math.

212
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,479
It really did a number on her.

213
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,360
She didn't complain.

214
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,380
How do you know?

215
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,629
Ms. Yu came to my home last night and said

216
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,630
she wanted a different child.

217
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,599
I could be her son.

218
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
I can hear it.

219
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,869
Sir, I'll have 20 mutton skewers.

220
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,789
Okay.

221
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,959
She is in a really bad mood, but her appetite is good.

222
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,930
Get lost.

223
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,199
<i>[The world is so big that I want to see it]</i>
Have a look at this.

224
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,839
Is this program still ongoing?

225
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,599
We spent almost three years to execute this.

226
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,710
We can't give up before we find any success.

227
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,810
Indeed.

228
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,700
Shao Xue passed the preliminary selection.

229
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,269
Next, the foreign high school will send a group of teachers here to conduct an interview.

230
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,709
The interview result and IELTS result must meet the standard for her to secure the opportunity.

231
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,239
Don't worry about it.

232
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,679
Shao Xue has the greatest prospect among all the other students.

233
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,020
She scored 8.5 in the IELTS exam.

234
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,870
Welcome...

235
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,550
to Beijing.

236
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,359
Why are you sighing?

237
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,580
You barely have any breath left, stop sighing.

238
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,800
I'm worried.

239
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,839
You don't seem worried at all.

240
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,100
That makes me even more worried.

241
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,400
She is also your daughter.

242
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,119
What is there to worry about?

243
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,889
There are over 1,000 candidates, and they only pick a dozen.

244
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,079
If our daughter makes it, that will be great.

245
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,410
Are you letting her go?

246
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,999
She is not leaving yet.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,439
We can get prepared.

248
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,599
It's called "one step at a time."

249
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,319
One step at a time?

250
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,119
Mom, Dad, I'm home.

251
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,199
- Welcome home.
- Where were you?

252
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,999
I went out with Sunian and Zhang Qi.

253
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,959
Look at your math result.

254
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,599
Do you think you have the luxury to go out and have fun?

255
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,989
I was in the top three in the English test, you didn't praise me for that.

256
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,810
Stop mumbling.

257
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,280
Come here, sit down.

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,819
Your teacher called me earlier today and wanted to see me.

259
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,320
Why?

260
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,520
For the Two Plus One program,

261
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,869
you passed the preliminary selection.

262
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,999
Really?

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,199
But there is an interview.

264
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,359
I'm ready for that.

265
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,909
Are there any files or documents?

266
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,060
Information about the school?

267
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,079
They gave us the files.

268
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,749
But I think you shouldn't go.

269
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,439
Wait, hear me out.

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
Your father agrees with me.

271
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,790
Ask him.

272
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,909
There is room for negotiation.

273
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,669
He says there is room for negotiation.

274
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,610
Let's talk it out.

275
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,269
Is that necessary?

276
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,089
There are plenty of local universities for you to choose from.

277
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,119
But I want to give it a shot.

278
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,509
No one was against it.

279
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,199
Why are you against it now?

280
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,789
This is my dream.

281
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,239
This is a daydream.

282
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,559
If you can't do well in a local school, you won't do better in a foreign school.

283
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,959
What if you run into trouble?

284
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,719
There will be no one to help you.

285
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,839
You won't even give me a chance!

286
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,149
Why are you denying my talent?

287
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,979
I insist on going abroad. I'll prove to you that I can do it.

288
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,239
You insist?

289
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,119
You can't just walk away as you please.

290
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,669
Studying abroad is not easy.

291
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,599
We don't want to and we can't afford to.

292
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,479
Be good and study in a local school.

293
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,909
You are acting like those selfish parents!

294
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,409
You only want to control me and never care about how I feel and what I want.

295
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,199
Did you just call me selfish?

296
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,239
Fine.

297
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,760
We'll have a chat with your teacher tomorrow!

298
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,479
If you tell my teacher,

299
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,479
I'm never talking to you again!

300
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,359
<i>Whatever!</i>

301
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,909
Dad, look at her!

302
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,389
Look at her!

303
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,549
This is too much!

304
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,629
Why isn't dinner ready yet?

305
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,670
I'll go on a hunger strike unless you let me go!

306
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,509
Are you here for Xue?

307
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,160
Why are you here?

308
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,780
She had a fight with Ms. Yu.

309
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,269
How do you know?

310
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,650
Bad sound isolation, so I overheard.

311
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,289
- Let's go and cheer her up.
- I'll take a pass.

312
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,149
She'll be more upset if I go.

313
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,840
You have a point.

314
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,550
Hey!

315
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,079
If there is anything, let me know.

316
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,520
Sure.

317
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,450
Sunian, make sure she finishes the food.

318
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,450
She can starve all she wants.

319
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,270
Wait.

320
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,919
All of this is vegetables.

321
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,480
Get her some meat.

322
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,050
More.

323
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,550
Okay.

324
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,069
<i>Who is it?</i>

325
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,880
Xue, it's me.

326
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,589
If you don't open the door,

327
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,650
I'll keep standing here.

328
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,879
Put the food down, then you can come in.

329
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,169
Fine, don't eat the food. I don't care!

330
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,199
Fine, stop making it worse.

331
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,540
I'm not eating anything!

332
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,960
I have a plan.

333
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,399
He went inside.

334
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,999
It seems you weren't starving.

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,919
When I get mad, I could bite my tongue if I didn't chew on something.

336
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,719
You're really angry.

337
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,129
You would be if you were me. She is unreasonable!

338
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:55,789
She doesn't care about how I feel.

339
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,439
She said it was for my own good,

340
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,720
but I really doubt it!

341
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,349
That is not fair for your mother.

342
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,510
If you are here to defend her, you can go out now.

343
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,679
I didn't want you to leave.

344
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,239
I want you to stay somewhere I can reach you.

345
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,880
I had hoped you could realize your dream.

346
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,650
But until I could understand it,

347
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,790
I thought it was best that you stayed here.

348
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,459
But later, I understood. I'll support you.

349
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:35,129
But what about your mother? Does she understand?

350
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,769
She will think of this as the decision you made on a whim.

351
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:41,109
But this decision caused great distress and uncertainties.

352
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,719
If you were her, what would you do?

353
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,749
But I didn't make this decision on a whim.

354
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,659
I've been preparing for so long, I've been looking forward to this day.

355
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,510
I can show you.

356
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,410
This is the exercise you gave me. I finished them all.

357
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,300
I even bought a few more and finished them as well.

358
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,679
<i>[IELTS Reading, IELTS Writing]</i>
And this!I wrote a note about plans when I study abroad.

359
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,469
- I even have plans into my 30s. I've never -been so serious before.
- I know.

360
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,679
- See?
- I know.

361
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,589
But what we must do now is to let your mother know.

362
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,860
I don't think she even wants to know.

363
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,469
Whenever I want to do something on my own, she never says yes.

364
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,109
She is not like you.

365
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,749
You always understand my thoughts so quickly.

366
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,100
This is pretty common among parents.

367
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,479
But like I said, I have a plan.

368
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,860
Finish your food first.

369
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,620
Eat up.

370
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,910
I won't eat until you tell me.

371
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,519
I guess I'll have to finish this delicious drumstick on my own.

372
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,640
I... I'll finish it, okay? I'll eat.

373
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,380
So, what is your plan?

374
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,679
To deal with a stubborn parent,

375
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,210
you need help from someone at her age.

376
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,580
What do you mean?

377
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,310
My mom.

378
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,309
Yes, Ms. Jin Ning!

379
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,260
Impressive, Sunian.

380
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,160
That's a good idea.

381
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,689
- Slow down.
- Delicious.

382
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,999
Are you working?

383
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,249
Shiyin? Why are you here?

384
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,239
How is your leg?

385
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,900
Much better now.

386
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,109
Do you need anything?

387
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,829
Do you need chocolate? I'll get it for you.

388
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,820
Never mind.

389
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,070
The play was quite a success.

390
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,390
That's because Xue was a good director.

391
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,250
The other day, what happened in the dance room...

392
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,589
- Thanks...
- Wu Huan.

393
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,100
Everything is sorted out there, just...

394
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,300
Why are you here?

395
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,590
I work here.

396
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,350
I need to go now.

397
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,699
- Shiyin, I can see you off.
- Never mind.

398
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,590
Stay safe on the way.

399
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,589
Is Shiyin mad at me?

400
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,349
No. That's just who she is.

401
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,349
So, can I ask you something?

402
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,410
Ask away.

403
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,530
Who is Lin Shiyin to you?

404
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,800
She is my most precious friend.

405
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,250
<i>Hello, may I know where the yogurt is?</i>

406
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,150
Coming!

407
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,269
Ms. Jin Ning.

408
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,509
Welcome, Xue.

409
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,540
Come, sit down.

410
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,679
Ms. Jin Ning,

411
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,510
the chocolate cake must be really delicious.

412
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,639
I know you love chocolate cakes, Xue.

413
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,020
Try it out.

414
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,109
I shall help myself with it.

415
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,690
The cakes from this shop are superb.

416
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,029
Ms. Jin Ning, what are you doing here?

417
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,509
All of these are the records of my youth.

418
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,749
I brought these novels and cassettes from abroad.

419
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,479
Ms. Jin Ning, you had a wonderful life.

420
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,479
Unlike my mom, she had nothing.

421
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,829
Do not look down on your own parents.

422
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,250
Everyone has a wonderful time at some point.

423
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,789
Is Sunian home?

424
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,709
He said I made too much noise sorting out the old stuff and went out to do some sketching.

425
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,109
He thought you were noisy?

426
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,860
He should see how noisy my family can be.

427
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,919
Did you have a fight with your mother?

428
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,069
Let's not talk about it. My mom is just too stubborn.

429
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:35,510
She wouldn't listen to reason.

430
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,519
But you need to understand her perspective in the matter.

431
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,959
Parents are always worried when the children are away.

432
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,349
She cares about you

433
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,279
and doesn't want you to have a bad time alone in a foreign country.

434
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,829
However, you can count on me to settle it for you.

435
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,729
I'll talk to your mom later on. Don't worry.

436
00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:55,110
That's great. I knew I could count on you.

437
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,999
See you later.

438
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,279
Xue, stay here and finish the cake.

439
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,109
I have something to show you.

440
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,970
Wait here.

441
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,440
Good afternoon.

442
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,700
Good afternoon.

443
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,460
Good afternoon.

444
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,380
Luo.

445
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,780
Good afternoon.

446
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,250
How are you today?

447
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,440
How are you today?

448
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,550
Showing off your English with me?

449
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,679
Hey there, Sunian.

450
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,340
Mr. Luo.

451
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,410
How did I do with the English line?

452
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,049
Are you drawing? Can I have a look?

453
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,669
Don't get so tense when you see me. Drawing is a pastime.

454
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:13,440
Okay?

455
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,010
Your drawing has improved, but remember,

456
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,639
whatever you draw, it needs emotions.

457
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,439
Infuse the objects with emotions.

458
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,200
Emotions...

459
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,710
For a young man such as you,

460
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,509
learning is important, but you must

461
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,589
make time to read some classic poetry,

462
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,250
especially the love poems.

463
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,029
I don't have use of them even if I memorize them.

464
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,640
How can you be sure?

465
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,069
In daily life, there are many nuances

466
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,959
such as emotions and feelings

467
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,750
that can only be understood in poems.

468
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,739
When I was six years old, you wanted me to memorize Classic of Poetry.

469
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:00,450
Yes.

470
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,410
Which line do you remember the most?

471
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,999
"A fair lady is in the carriage with me, and her beauty matches that of a flower."

472
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,269
As for the rest, you wanted me to feel them.

473
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,349
But you explained this line very thoroughly.

474
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:16,399
In many poems, women are depicted as the weak and gentle kind.

475
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:17,719
But this one is different.

476
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,069
The lady was in the same carriage as a man.

477
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,039
In the past, a woman couldn't be in the same carriage as a man.

478
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,639
She is not weak at all.

479
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,820
So, what is she?

480
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,479
She is like hibiscus, not extraordinary,

481
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,199
but full of spirit.

482
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,410
She is resilient.

483
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,799
I think an honest guy like you should marry a woman like that.

484
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,109
Fine, thank you.

485
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,730
And you?

486
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,520
What did he just say?

487
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,350
He asked if you were fine.

488
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,050
I doubt it.

489
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,240
Hibiscus?

490
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,199
Is it pretty?

491
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,159
This is gorgeous.

492
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,139
This cheongsam was made by a highly-skilled tailor in Shanghai.

493
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,959
The craftsmanship is top-notched.

494
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,389
I've wanted to give it to you, but I forgot when I got a little busy.

495
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:36,309
I can hand it to you now.

496
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,879
I can't accept something so precious.

497
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,109
Just take it.

498
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,989
If you're not wearing it, should I ask Sunian to put it on instead?

499
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,029
Put it on.

500
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,509
Okay, then.

501
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,399
I'll return it if it doesn't fit.

502
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,919
If it fits, I have two more for you.

503
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,880
Go try it out.

504
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,309
Mom.

505
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,349
Welcome home.

506
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,439
Was Xue here?

507
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,410
She is in my bedroom.

508
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,639
Don't go there.

509
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,569
Wait here. I have a surprise for you.

510
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,410
A surprise?

511
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,199
Ms. Jin Ning, how do I look?

512
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,719
Nice!

513
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,420
Xue, you look beautiful!

514
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,980
<i>[Sketchbook]</i>

515
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,869
Sunian! How do I look?

516
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,450
It's okay.

517
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,949
Don't listen to him. This isn't just "okay."

518
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,069
You look amazing.

519
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,309
But it's a little loose.

520
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,820
- I'll ask your mom to adjust it.
- No.

521
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,210
My mom will scold me for it.

522
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,510
It's National Day, we can pay Ms. Kang a visit during the holiday.

523
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:35,749
I have two more.

524
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,879
I know they will look good on you.

525
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,419
- Come, let's try them out.
- It's okay, Ms. Jin Ning.

526
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,390
Come on!

527
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,900
<i>[Follow Your Heart]</i>

528
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,730
Ms. Kang. Ms. Kang.

529
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,609
- Xue?
- Ms. Kang.

530
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:12,999
What brings you here?

531
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,509
I have a favor to ask of you.

532
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,520
Come inside.

533
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,069
Ms. Kang, did you make this embroidery?

534
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,999
It's beautiful.

535
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,340
Xue, have some water.

536
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,479
Thanks.

537
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,730
How can I help you?

538
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,210
Yes! The cheongsam is a little big on me.

539
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,399
I need you to make some adjustments.

540
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,399
Where did you get this?

541
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,589
Ms. Jin Ning gave it to me.

542
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,610
No wonder.

543
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,690
The fabric and tailoring are top-grade.

544
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,040
I'll need your measurements.

545
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,630
Okay.

546
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,919
Okay.

547
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,779
Take a seat. This will only take a while.

548
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,300
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Kang.

549
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,409
Xue, I still need to take the measurement of your shoulders.

550
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,880
Xue?

551
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,199
I need your shoulder width.

552
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,730
Sure.

553
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,010
Ms. Kang, is the man in the picture your husband?

554
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,719
No.

555
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,870
But he must mean a lot to you.

556
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,340
Why do you ask this?

557
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,199
Your smile looks different.

558
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,919
I've never seen you smile so sweetly.

559
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,860
So, I think the man must mean a lot to you.

560
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,720
Some people were precious at some point,

561
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,450
but the pain can last forever.

562
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,900
I wish we had never known each other.

563
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,919
I was just rambling.

564
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,329
Sit down. It'll be done in a moment.

565
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,529
- Okay.
- Go on.

566
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,029
Jin Ning.

567
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,960
- Jin Ning, is Xue at your place?
- Dongge?

568
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,589
I can't find her anywhere.

569
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,029
She just left.

570
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,759
She left? I should go home, then.

571
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:12,669
Stay here.

572
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,109
Have a little chat with me. Come.

573
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,000
Take a seat.

574
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,959
Let's talk for a little.

575
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,789
Wait here. I have something to show you.

576
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,319
I found this dessert shop,

577
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,759
the taste is very authentic.

578
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,780
Pick one.

579
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,530
I don't like cakes.

580
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,799
Join me.

581
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,549
I'm the only one in this family who likes cakes.

582
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,109
Don't be wasteful. Pick one.

583
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:48,589
Well... Well... I'll have this.

584
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,149
Chocolate flavor.

585
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,479
Xue likes chocolate cakes, too.

586
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,149
I don't usually like desserts.

587
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,869
But Xue always leaves a small chunk behind whenever she has a cake.

588
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:01,439
I don't want to be wasteful...

589
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,149
And over time, I got used to it.

590
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:06,229
You care so much about Xue.

591
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,629
Why are you two always fighting?

592
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,980
Did she come to you to complain about me?

593
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,860
It's not complaining,

594
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,069
but it's more like the lack of understanding.

595
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,910
What's not understood?

596
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,679
She doesn't understand why I won't let her go abroad?

597
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,930
This kid is too insensible.

598
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,399
As you know, I've prepared everything for her

599
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,189
ever since she was a little girl.

600
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,839
I even get the rice ready for her in a bowl.

601
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,380
She got used to it.

602
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,349
So, if she is out there alone, she doesn't know anyone,

603
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:52,010
and she doesn't have any idea how hard her life will be.

604
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:55,029
She is allergic to things.

605
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,959
What if she can't acclimate herself to the place?

606
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,919
She can't even come home if she wants.

607
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,569
The study here must be different from the schools abroad.

608
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:03,999
Will she fall behind?

609
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,660
When I bring this up, she gets upset.

610
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,740
If only she can be as obedient as Sunian,

611
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,170
I wouldn't ask more of it.

612
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,669
I was hoping Sunian could be more like Xue.

613
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,629
I don't mind if he is more like Zhang Qi.

614
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,319
He is cheerful and lively.

615
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,979
I don't mind him making some mistakes so I can boss over him.

616
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:31,709
At least let me experience the fun of being a parent.

617
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,399
Be grateful for what you have.

618
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,589
Fine.

619
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,399
You can have my crazy daughter.

620
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,279
Talk some sense into her.

621
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,090
Do you mean it?

622
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,399
I wish you would.

623
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,919
We like the same things.

624
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,879
We like traveling, reading novels, desserts,

625
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,709
and cracking jokes.

626
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,629
Unlike my son and husband,

627
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,030
they never spend any time with me.

628
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,669
Dongge, as a mother myself,

629
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,629
I understand your concern and worry.

630
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,109
Honestly, I'll miss Xue too.

631
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,879
I'll be worried about her

632
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,490
when she is so far away from home.

633
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,399
But Xue is very talented

634
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,589
when it comes to language.

635
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,549
She got an 8.5 on the IELTS exam.

636
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,229
That is no small feat.

637
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,359
Not even Sunian can do it.

638
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,759
The best way to learn a language

639
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,420
is to live there and practice it in real life.

640
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,419
Xue has made a lot of effort so she can study abroad.

641
00:37:38,419 --> 00:37:40,799
We all know how hard she worked.

642
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,020
It will be such a shame if she gives up now.

643
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,920
She might regret it in the future.

644
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,220
She is back.

645
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,229
Where are you going? We're waiting for you.

646
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,280
Come, have your dinner.

647
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,709
Hurry up.

648
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,970
Come on, sit down and eat.

649
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,740
Eat up.

650
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,610
Mom, I still want to go.

651
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,629
I won't change my mind easily.

652
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,229
However, if you explain nicely to her,

653
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,360
she might hear you out.

654
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,550
What did you bring home?

655
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,260
The cheongsam Ms. Jin Ning gave me.

656
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,279
This is expensive stuff, how could you accept it?

657
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,329
I didn't ask for it, Ms. Jin Ning insisted on giving it to me.

658
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,109
She said she couldn't wear it anymore and it was wasteful to just leave it there.

659
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:26,589
How many times have I told you?

660
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,079
No matter how close you are, you must never owe anyone any favor.

661
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,399
But what did you do?

662
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,149
You go to every house and accept things from everyone.

663
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:34,629
This thing is valuable.

664
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,599
Now that we accepted her kindness, we'll have to repay it!

665
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,669
Fine.

666
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,930
I'll never take anything again no matter what.

667
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,439
What's wrong with you?

668
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,959
How can you fit into Ms. Jin Ning's cheongsam?

669
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,860
It was a little loose at the shoulders and hips.

670
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:56,340
I asked someone to make adjustments.

671
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,700
You made adjustments to something so valuable?

672
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,110
What if you ruined it?

673
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,080
The tailor is really good with the needlework.

674
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,660
I can't even tell it's been adjusted.

675
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,240
Who did it?

676
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,589
Ms. Kang.

677
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,340
Who?

678
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,820
Ms. Kang.

679
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,109
How dare you ask Ms. Kang to do it?

680
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,940
I...

681
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,729
Ms. Kang is the heir of intangible cultural heritage.

682
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:47,959
She is here because our office invited her there.

683
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,110
We invited her to work here, okay?

684
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,519
I... I was worried you might scold me if I asked you instead.

685
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,029
Do you think I wouldn't scold you if you asked her?

686
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,549
You never cease to cause me trouble.

687
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,959
Keep it down a little.

688
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,319
I'll treat Ms. Kang to something delicious.

689
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,800
She is not you.

690
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,320
Not everything can be settled with food.

691
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,800
Now that she's made the adjustments,

692
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,879
this cheongsam is even more valuable.

693
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,429
Mom, so you weren't as good as Mrs. Kang.

694
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,279
What was that for?

695
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,479
She is right.

696
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,399
We are not on the same level.

697
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,439
She is a master in this craft.

698
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,479
I have plenty of things to learn from her.

699
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,970
You're a grand master in my eyes.

700
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,599
Not bad. You're always full of flattering words.

701
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,840
Stop fawning over me.

702
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,180
Listen.

703
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,159
When you go to the mall next time, make sure you buy a nice-looking hairpin.

704
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:57,259
When you wear a cheongsam like this, you need to make a hair bun and show your neck.

705
00:41:57,259 --> 00:41:59,400
You'll look much better.

706
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,149
Why are you asking me for money?

707
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,669
You're the head of this house.

708
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,380
But...

709
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,549
Thank you, head of the house.

710
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,659
See you. I'm shopping with my friends.

711
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,669
Don't go on a shopping spree!

712
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,900
What about dinner?

713
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,509
What?

714
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,439
Where did you get so much money?

715
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,610
Leftovers from last month.

716
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,149
I knew you were hiding money from me.

717
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,659
Trying to trick me now? How petty of you.

718
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:38,919
<i>Zhang Qi!</i>

719
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,280
Zhang Qi! Zhang Qi!

720
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,399
What do you need?

721
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,999
Look!

722
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,359
You got a counterfeit?

723
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,109
Say something nicer.

724
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,839
I got it from my mom.

725
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,559
- We'll go shopping together tomorrow.
- Just you and me?

726
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,319
Sunian is coming with us.

727
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,439
But I haven't told him yet.

728
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,000
- But you came to me first?
- Yeah.

729
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,549
Sure, see you tomorrow.

730
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,509
See you tomorrow. Bye.

731
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,320
See you!

732
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,030
She came to me first.

733
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,530
Yeah.

734
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,440
She came to me first.

735
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,940
Wait.

736
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,479
Ling'er, maybe the good stuff comes later?

737
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,109
No.

738
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,380
She thought of me first, so she came to me.

739
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,010
Yes.

740
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,499
