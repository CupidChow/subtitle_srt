I can relax now.

161
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,869
Let's hang out together.

162
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,749
Okay.

163
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,720
Let's take a look at the thread.

164
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,029
What's wrong with you?

165
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,710
Do you feel unwell?

166
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,319
Maybe I didn't eat well this morning.

167
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,399
Just acid reflux.

168
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,049
I'm okay. Let's take a look.

169
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,249
Maybe you can discuss it with the teacher.

170
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,749
It won't work.

171
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,039
If Demon Liu finds out about it, she'll only be regarded as a bad example.

172
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,059
Each class in every grade will know about it.

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,890
My vacation is gone.

174
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,319
My red packet is gone.

175
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,670
Everything's gone.

176
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,579
Let's watch the movie.

177
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,079
No, I'm not in the mood for that.

178
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
You can watch it yourself.

179
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,799
I'm not watching it either. I'm going back home.

180
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,149
I have to prepare the meal for my mom.

181
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,700
You haven't finished watching it.

182
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,460
I'll watch it next time.

183
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,009
Well. I'm going shopping with my mom.

184
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:03,910
I'll get going as well.

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,349
All right. Don't worry.

186
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,909
Let's grab some food.

187
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,380
Pizza?

188
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,509
Lamb skewers?

189
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,789
Fried chicken?

190
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,149
Roasted duck?

191
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,149
No.

192
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,869
Unless you can make the test paper appear.

193
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,599
It's impossible.

194
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,840
But it's possible to steal it.

195
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,269
That sounds like a plan.

196
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,669
- It won't work, will it?
- Of course not.

197
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:49,719
It's a little indirect to steal it.

198
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,170
Why don't we sneak in and amend it?

199
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,719
I agree.

200
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,750
I disagree.

201
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,719
It's too risky and against too many rules.

202
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,439
As long as we don't get caught.

203
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,669
What if we get caught?

204
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,019
- With me there, how would we get caught?
- With you there, we'll surely get caught.

205
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,269
Forget it.

206
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,039
I wasn't serious.

207
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,870
Let's not steal it.

208
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,749
It's time. We have to study. Sunian, you can head home now.

209
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:25,099
Yes. It's time to study. Hurry up and go back.

What's wrong with it?

215
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,319
We also want to improve.

Yes. Go back to study. Or we'll catch up with you.

How can you explain the questions to us later?

218

Go back and study, quick.

219
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,789
- Yes, hurry up.
- Move.

220

How has your sister-in-law been lately?

230
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,239
She's badly ill.

231
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,819
She used to be healthy.

232
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,099
Stomach cancer is a severe disease. Didn't she realize it?

233
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,409
At first, there was common nausea and dizziness.

234
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:13,629
Who would have thought that?

235
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,039
We thought it was a common disease. But then, it was too late.

236
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,630
It's important to be healthy.

237
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,839
The plan is divided into four steps.

238
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,339
The first step is to go to our school.

239
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,609
The second step is to find the test paper.

240
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:33,669
The third step is to amend the paper.

241
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,900
The fourth step is to sneak back.

242
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,970
How simple.

243
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,369
The more the steps, the more the loopholes.

244
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,629
But there are many people in school.

245
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,389
How can we sneak in?

246
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,290
Tomorrow is the weekend.

247
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,809
All right. Hurry up and go back.

248
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,119
Let's set out early tomorrow morning.

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,619
Okay. I'm leaving.

Sunian, you're here.

252
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,820
My dad made some ribs.

253
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,340
It looks good.

Xue.

255

You usually can't wait to eat the ribs that Mr. Zheng made.

256
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,249
What's wrong with you today? Dig in.

Try it.

258

Well, I'm full.

259
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,359
I'm going to study.

Hey.

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,159
Mr. Shao. Ms. Yu. I'm going back.

263

No, thanks, Mr. Shao.

264
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,609
Well, do you remember Qi from the mounting division?

265
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:16,149
He has dimples and canine teeth.

266
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,379
Look how amazing heredity is.

267
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:22,269
His dad came today.

268
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,289
As we looked at them, they were exactly alike.

269
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:27,829
It's like Russian dolls.

270

No, nothing.

Cancer is not hereditary.

275
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,320
Don't think about it.

276
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,140
It's not up to you whether it's hereditary.

There's one thing you've inherited from Mom.

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,399
What are you doing here?

326
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,269
I left my English dictionary in the classroom.

327
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,109
Could you please help me get it?

328
00:19:57,109 --> 00:19:59,840
Why do you need the dictionary during the weekend?

329
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,919
I have the habit of reciting words every day.

330
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,449
I'm afraid I'll get left behind.

331
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,260
What a good student.

332
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,970
Wait a minute.

333
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,240
<i>Follow me.</i>

334
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,159
This is too risky.

335
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,250
We can't make it.

336
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,439
Zhang Qi.

337
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,960
Let's go.

338
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,510
Zhang Qi.

339
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,039
Will there be a security camera in our school?

340
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,310
What if we were snapped?

341
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,439
What's wrong with you?

342
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,879
Nothing.

343
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,959
Why have you gone all quiet then?

344
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,789
Are you too frightened?

345
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,889
I'm home now. I'm going back. Bye.

346
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:22,870
Keep it a secret. Don't tell anyone.

347
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,300
Sunian.

348
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,270
How was it?

349
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,410
What do you mean?

350
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,660
Your scheme with Zhang Qi.

351
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,870
We didn't do anything.

352
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,679
It was too risky.

353
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,459
Plus, I don't think

354
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,589
it's a good idea.

355
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,589
So we did nothing.

356
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,020
I'll get the points I deserve.

357
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,419
Sunian, don't tell the teacher.

358
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:12,720
I'm going back.

359
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,690
Keep it a secret for me.

360
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
<i>Zhang Qi.</i>

361
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,490
<i>Zhang Qi. Zhang Qi.</i>

362
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,349
<i>Zhang Qi.</i>

363
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,789
<i>Zhang Qi. Zhang Qi.</i>

364
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,010
<i>Zhang Qi.</i>

365
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,250
<i>Zhang Qi.</i>

366
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,100
<i>Zhang Qi...</i>

367
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,300
What's going on?

368
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,589
Moshui, I took over an antique two days ago.

369
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,509
There's embroidery on it.

370
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,349
The craft is a little complicated.

371
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:43,750
Take a look at it for me.

372
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,719
Actually, I'm only good at Suzhou embroidery.

373
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:49,949
I'm not sure I can help you with the rest.

374
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:54,440
Don't say that. You're an expert in this field.

375
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,169
What's the matter, Dongge?

376
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:00,410
Do you feel ill?

377
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,789
No. I feel dizzy all of a sudden.

378
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:07,350
Shall I ask Mr. Shao to take you back?

379
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,509
No need. He's busy now.

380
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,679
Look. I'm getting better.

381
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,160
I'll get some water.

382
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,580
Let me take the thermos. Are you really okay?

383
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,270
I'm okay.

384
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,029
Sunian, what's the matter?

385
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,650
Sit down.

386
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,169
Isn't this our test paper?

387
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:46,070
Yes.

388
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,350
Why are you giving this to me?

389
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,709
Answer the last four questions for me to see.

390
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,760
Do it.

391
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,549
How much time was left when you finished

392
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:08,519
the rest of the questions in the exam?

393
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,650
Forty minutes.

394
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,309
I spent ten minutes checking it.

395
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:15,860
I'll give you 30 minutes.

396
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,699
Be serious. As if you're taking the exam.

397
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:20,000
Is it necessary?

398
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,640
Start.

399
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,510
Twenty-nine minutes left.

400
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,049
<i>Did they find out that I tried to amend the paper?</i>

401
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,740
<i>Is...</i>

402
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,830
<i>Is it a farewell dinner?</i>

403
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,870
Let's eat.

404
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,989
Mom, was this all made by you?

405
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:08,250
I ordered it from the restaurant.

406
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,680
It must have cost a lot.

407
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,780
I know.

408
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,109
I'm not good at cooking.

409
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,050
It must have been hard for you both all these years.

410
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,590
- Not at all.
- Not at all.

411
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:33,559
Dongge, did something good happen to us?

412
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,510
Mom...

413
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:49,139
Did you find out anything bad?

414
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,690
Let's eat.

415
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,640
Xue, don't you like sweet and sour ribs most?

416
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,699
Come on. You can't reach it. Grab some.

417
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,110
Thank you, Mom.

418
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,819
Don't you like to eat fish most?

419
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:16,649
The flesh near the gill is the most tender.

420
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:19,269
Come on. Take it.

421
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,380
Thank you, Dongge.

422
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,270
Go ahead.

423
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,410
Xue.

424
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll help myself, Mom.

425
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,999
Mom.

426
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,590
Just read it.

427
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,150
When will you know the results?

428
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,020
Within...

429
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,680
Within these two days.

430
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,440
Scores don't mean anything.

431
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,000
Don't care too much about it.

432
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,539
No matter what scores you get, you'll remain my precious daughter.

433
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,900
Go to bed early.

434
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,620
Goodnight.

435
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,210
Goodnight, Mom.

436
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,620
Does Mom know about it?

437
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,820
How does she know?

438
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,910
My wife, Dongge.

439
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,240
I'm ready.

440
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,870
Shao Hua.

441
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,440
Shao Hua,

442
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,940
I can't accompany you till we're old.

443
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,039
What's wrong with you?

444
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,599
My mom died due to gastric cancer.

445
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,160
I'm afraid...

446
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,160
I'm afraid I'll end up the same.

447
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,679
What's the matter? Make it clear.

448
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,399
I've been feeling unwell lately.

449
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:41,860
I didn't tell you.

450
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,120
I always have a pain

451
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,650
in my stomach.

452
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,340
And I have no appetite.

453
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,999
I suspect...

454
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,449
I suspect that it must be...

455
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:57,109
Why didn't you tell me?

456
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,370
When did this happen?

457
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,320
Did you go to the hospital?

458
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,920
I didn't go to the hospital.

459
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,509
The fortune-teller at the door said it has spread.

460
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,349
That's a liar.

461
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,759
He knows nothing. Only you trust him. He can't be trusted.

462
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,029
I'm afraid that the doctor at the hospital would say so as well.

463
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:19,459
Doesn't that mean I'm sentenced to death?

464
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,210
Silly girl.

465
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,649
Let's go to the hospital, okay?

466
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,719
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

467
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,689
Let's not jump to conclusions.

468
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:30,299
Shao Hua, I'm afraid...

469
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,740
What if I'm also...

470
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,779
Touch wood. Don't say stuff like that! That's impossible.

471
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:37,999
I mean.

472
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,930
I mean, just in case.

473
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,750
What should I do if it's true?

474
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,400
That won't happen. That won't happen.

475
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,450
You were far apart from me back then.

476
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,999
But I got you back in the end.

477
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,269
Even if you went to the king of Hell, I'd still bring you back.

478
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,540
You're my wife.

479
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,239
Don't be afraid.

480
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,549
But I'm scared.

481
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,740
I'm really scared.

482
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,870
I don't want to die.

483
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:10,749
Don't be scared. Let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

484
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,930
Don't be scared.

485
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,719
I don't want to leave you.

486
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,399
I really don't want to leave you both.

487
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,610
I don't want to leave.

488
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,799
I don't want to leave you both.

489
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,340
I don't want to leave.

490
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,720

660
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:41,300
♫ <i>My memory does all the hard work for me</i> ♫

00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:12,289
♫ <i>They had accompanied me through everything</i> ♫

667
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:20,059

♫ <i>Until I saw the bustling city</i> ♫

671
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:58,829
♫ <i>Until I realized that it was once within my reach</i> ♫

672
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:06,600
♫ <i>I was this sober once but I still did the same thing</i> ♫

673
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,440
♫ <i>As days go by, I wish to forget</i> ♫
