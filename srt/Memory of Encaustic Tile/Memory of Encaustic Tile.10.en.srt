But I don't wish to.

60

Anyway, Sunian is in the Prince Ranking.

61
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,413
What?

62
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:54,430
Prince Ranking. The ranking for school hunks.

You're not in.

64

Sunian has been in the top ten.

What nonsense is this?

66

It does exist though. There's a Princess Ranking as well.

67

Lin Shiyin. Top one of this month.

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,490
Unfortunately, I'm too popular. I'm preoccupied.

72
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,193
Not her. It's Tang Ya.

Who is it?

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,820
My new deskmate.

75
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,390
She's a bit nervous.

76
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,160
But it's fine. I'll handle it.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,800
I've got other plans so I'll leave now.

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,980
- I'll walk you there.
- No need.

79
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,380
Just leave her alone.

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,530
Well. Let's designate the characters now.

81
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,360
You play as the protagonist. You'll be the antagonist.

82
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,930
Then... I want to play as a good person.

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,650
You don't fit it.

For example,

87
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,240
Granny Rong in My Fair Princess.

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,460

89
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,660
Her performance was impeccable.

90
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,890
All right now. Let's discuss the screenplay.

91
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,750
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess.

92
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,940
She was seriously ill.

93
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,490
There were two warriors who admired the princess which is you and you.

94
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,463
Mr. Luo.

95

You're here.

96
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,490
There's a color that we can't restore.

97
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,400
Could you please take a look?

98
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,770
Sure. I'll do it now.

99
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,090
Well. I have something on and I can't go now.

100
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,540
Can you help him, Jin Ning?

101
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,343
Me?

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,080
You don't want to do me the favor?

103
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,800
That's not what I meant.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,920
Perhaps you can do your work first.

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,480
There's no rush. It's fine to do it later.

106

That's right.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,720

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,970
Madam Jin, please take a look at it.

112
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,830
We simply couldn't get this color right.

113
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,080
Let me try it.

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,020
It's about the shine.

115
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,100
Can you get the color by just mixing them?

116
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,970
That's about right, isn't it?

117
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,270
I guess so. Let me compare the colors.

118
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,903
Yes.

119
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,090
It works.

120
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,750
The ratio wasn't right.

121
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,120
But you can get the color eventually.

122
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,360
It's all about trial and error.

123
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,510
You're indeed a professional.

124
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,380

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,390
I'll add a solo for you.

164
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,650
Please don't.

165
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,880
I can't sing in front of people.

166
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,403
It's embarrassing.

167
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,620
We'll be by your side.

168
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,120
But I don't think I can do it.

169
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,453
Although it's something I long for, I do feel

170
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,950
quite intimidated.

171
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,820
If there's something that you wish to do, you should go for it.

172

Not everyone has this opportunity.

173

Then...

174
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,820
I'll try.

Yes.

Can't you feel the misery of death

Did you feel them?

190

Then, how could you dance so badly?

191
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,870

Sorry. I'm too strict.

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,353
I think it's because of your temperament.

196

You don't fit this dance.

I'll take the responsibility, okay?

201
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,430

Mom, why did you lie through your teeth?

Why do you always stop her from saying the truth?

Next in line.

221

Ms. Yu, it'll be a waste to make a costume for me.

Maybe you can just leave mine out.

223

Mom, you're so cooperative this time.

225
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,530
Is it because you've realized my talent?

Dream on.

227
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,210
When I was young, I participated in a play, too.

228
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,340
However, I couldn't make it as something cropped up.

Brat, I'm just saying that every one of you has your own strengths.

Why did you have to embarrass yourself?

Mind your own business.

244

She went to the Restoration Department.

249
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,060
Why did she go there on the weekend?

250

Well, we need to do our best regardless of the result.

324

Are you admitting defeat before the show starts?

325
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:48,805
Do you want to get kicked out of the show?

326
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:52,006
I'm just worried that it will be too much trouble for Ms. Jin Ning.

00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:54,135
I have no choice though.

328
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,175
Since I have received the cake as payment,

329
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,575
I should do my job well.

330
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:03,725
Who bought this cake?

331
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:06,475
This person knows my taste well.

332
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,768
I guess it's Xue, right?

333
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:19,665
No way. She can do nothing apart from eating.

334
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,445
- Not me.
- It's Sunian. He especially...
- Let's go play with the cat.

335
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:27,465
My mom prefers a quiet environment.

336
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:29,365
I don't.

337
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,965
I'm different from you and your dad.

338
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:38,955
Well. Go out and play.

339
00:20:38,955 --> 00:20:40,375
I'll call you when it's done.

340
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,425
Thank you so much, Ms. Jin Ning.

341
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:43,855
You're most welcome.

342
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:46,475
Let's go. Sure.

343
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:49,305
Mom, don't eat too much sweet food.

344
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,448
Okay.

345
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,095
Mr. Luo.

346
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,405
What are you doing?

347
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:06,275
Something's wrong with the watering can.

348
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,325
The water doesn't come out.

349
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,675
Let me take a look at it.

350
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:11,475
You can't handle it.

351
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,920
Zhang Qi.

352
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:16,685
- What's wrong?
- Fix this.

353
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:17,905
He can't do it either.

354
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:19,655
I'll give it a try.

355
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,895
Why did you guys come here this Sunday

356
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:25,925
instead of hanging out elsewhere?

357
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,985
We are going to prepare for a stage play.

358
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:30,265
So, we are here to ask for some help from Ms. Jin Ning.

359
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:32,525
What is it about?

360
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,095
For now, I only have the framework for the screenplay.

361
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:35,615
Anyway, it's a costume play.

362
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:38,745
I want to add some fantasy elements to the concept of martial heroes

363
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:41,455
and comedy elements to the fantasy concept.

364
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:42,845
I can't understand at all.

365
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:43,905
How's it going?

366
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:45,045
Not only you, Mr. Luo.

367
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:46,585
- We don't get it either.
- All fixed.

368
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,575
I wanted to make it clear.

369
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,055
However, everyone voices their opinions.

370
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:51,425
And I'm confused about how I am going to fix it.

371
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,185
Someone said it lacks depth.

372
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:54,805
While the other one said it's not passionate enough.

373
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:57,815
And when I'm done amending the script, Ms. Jin Ning said

374
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,965
it isn't romantic enough.

375
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,815
She... She... She's right.

376
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:06,495
I reckon a stage play must be romantic.

377
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:10,275
Mr. Luo, but I have no idea what romance is about?

378
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,025
Maybe you can tell us a romantic story?

379
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,675
We can learn from it.

380
00:22:14,675 --> 00:22:17,015
I don't know how to tell stories.

381
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:19,365
Did you forget that you used to tell me stories while carrying me when I was young?

382
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:21,195
When did I do that?

383
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:22,535
You did. I've heard it before.

384
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:24,368
Me too.

385
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:29,686
Well. Then I'll tell you one today, all right?

386
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:31,665
Sunian, give me a stool.

387
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,238
Got it.

388
00:22:44,265 --> 00:22:48,225
The story I'm telling happened at this place.

389
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:49,935
Promise me first.

390
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,095
The characters in this story might be real or fictional.

391
00:22:54,095 --> 00:22:57,006
Don't let your imagination run wild. Okay?

392
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:01,518
Got it.

393
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:06,595
This story happened a long time ago.

394
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:11,605
Back then, at this place, there were two people.

395
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,425
<i>Go away.</i>

396
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:28,535
<i>Don't just eat whatever you see. Go now.</i>

397
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:29,885
<i>You are eating random stuff again.</i>

398
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,805
<i>I've told you so many times. Be careful with what you eat.</i>

399
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:34,465
<i>You... Why did you drive it away?</i>

400
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:36,375
<i>It's just eating something as it's hungry.</i>

401
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,905
<i>You're so heartless.</i>

402
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:40,055
<i>So indifferent.</i>

403
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:43,575
<i>Sorry.</i>

404
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:48,745
<i>Madam Jin, you've misunderstood Mr. Zheng.</i>

405
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:50,135
<i>Recently, there have been a lot of rats here.</i>

406
00:23:50,135 --> 00:23:53,515
<i>There is rodenticide there, he's afraid that the kitty might get poisoned.</i>

407
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:05,165
<i>Kitty, you're injured.</i>

408
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:08,125
<i>Let me help you treat the wounds. Stay still.</i>

409
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:13,655
<i>Hey, you're the gentleman from the Watchmaker Division.</i>

410
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:16,375
<i>Could you please help me?</i>

411
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,925
<i>It's injured.</i>

412
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:21,025
<i>Could you hold its paws?</i>

413
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,805
<i>I'm going to apply some medicine to it.</i>

414
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:25,638
<i>But it's a wild cat.</i>

415
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,705
<i>It likes to scratch on people.</i>

416
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:31,535
<i>But it'll get infected if we don't treat the wounds now.</i>

417
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,325
<i>Thank you.</i>

418
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:37,325
<i>- Well, I...
- Turn it over.</i>

419
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,325
<i>Sure, no problem.</i>

420
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,505
<i>Thank you.</i>

421
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:44,505
<i>- Kitty, it might be hurt a little.
-Turn over.</i>

422
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:46,465
<i>Bear with me.</i>

423
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:48,865
<i>- Yes.
- Like this?</i>

424
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,568
<i>This...</i>

425
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:54,565
<i>- It's fine.
- You're hurt.</i>

426
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,435
<i>- It's fine.
- It's my fault.</i>

427
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:57,915
<i>Sorry.</i>

428
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:59,805
<i>Let me bring you to the hospital for a jab.</i>

429
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:02,575
<i>This kitty has scratched us before. I'm fine.</i>

430
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:05,775
<i>No way. It's my fault. I should take responsibility.</i>

431
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:08,975
<i>- No need. I... I mean it.
- Let's go.</i>

432
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,885
<i>Honestly, I can go home myself.</i>

433
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:16,405
<i>I'm fine.</i>

434
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:19,625
<i>No way. I must send you home.</i>

435
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:24,005
<i>Just sit quietly.</i>

436
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:30,945
Since then, these two people have become acquainted.

437
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:34,975
- Mr. Luo, is it...
- I've told you not to make random guesses.

438
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:36,535
I see no romance though.

439
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,955
Let him continue.

440
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,945
Once they became acquainted...

441
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,375
<i>Mr. Zheng.</i>

442
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,908
<i>Yes?</i>

443
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,245
<i>Y-Y-You...</i>

444
00:25:58,245 --> 00:25:59,998
<i>You're here.</i>

445
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:05,105
<i>Thank you for helping me with the cat.</i>

446
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,945
<i>You're welcome.</i>

447
00:26:10,655 --> 00:26:14,535
<i>How's your hand? Has it recovered?</i>

448
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,858
<i>It's fine.</i>

449
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,455
<i>Are you off work now?</i>

450
00:26:25,135 --> 00:26:26,935
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

451
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:29,085
<i>My music box is broken.</i>

452
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:30,615
<i>Could you please help me?</i>

453
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:32,905
<i>Sure, no problem.</i>

454
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:54,675
<i>This... This isn't something I come across daily.</i>

455
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:56,565
<i>It's not a local product, right?</i>

456
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:59,255
<i>It's from overseas.</i>

457
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:05,625
<i>Actually, I saw you dancing along with the music the other day.</i>

458
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,408
<i>Over...</i>

459
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,705
<i>Over there.</i>

460
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,195
<i>I saw you looking at me.</i>

461
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:19,605
<i>I heard that you were abroad previously.</i>

462
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:20,665
<i>Yes.</i>

463
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:23,675
<i>I studied at an overseas university.</i>

464
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:28,225
<i>Next year, I'm going to work at an overseas museum.</i>

465
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,340
<i>It's not easy to repair, is it?</i>

466
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,815
<i>No, it's easy.</i>

467
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,418
<i>It's done.</i>

468
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,675
<i>It's done?</i>

469
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,776
<i>Mr. Zheng, you're amazing.</i>

470
00:28:05,405 --> 00:28:06,235
<i>Thank you.</i>

471
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:08,368
<i>Jin Ning.</i>

472
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:11,135
<i>You... Do you have to leave?</i>

473
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:12,325
<i>No, I'm not leaving.</i>

474
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:14,576
<i>Later, let's have lunch together.</i>

475
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:16,235
<i>Let me put this back first.</i>

476
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:18,385
<i>Please wait for me.</i>

477
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,335
<i>Is it confirmed?</i>

478
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:27,985
<i>You're leaving so soon?</i>

479
00:28:27,985 --> 00:28:29,195
<i>Yes.</i>

480
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:33,655
<i>The job at the overseas museum has already been arranged.</i>

481
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:38,025
<i>I wonder when I will see you again after you leave.</i>

482
00:28:38,025 --> 00:28:41,355
<i>Yeah. We've been working together for a long time,</i>

483
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,045
<i>yet you're leaving all of a sudden.</i>

484
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,815
<i>I'll miss you very much.</i>

485
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:47,885
<i>I will miss you all as well.</i>

486
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:51,675
<i>When will you be back?</i>

487
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,455
<i>Look at you.</i>

00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:55,025
<i>She's leaving soon.</i>

489

<i>You don't even ask her to stay.</i>

490
00:28:56,775 --> 00:28:58,308
<i>Stupid.</i>

<i>Zhang Jin.</i>

492

<i>Tomorrow, I'll leave the Restoration Department.</i>

493
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,800
<i>I thought about it for a long time yet I couldn't decide what I should give you as a gift.</i>

494
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,295
<i>I'll give you this music box...</i>

<i>as a souvenir.</i>

496

<i>Thank you, Jin Ning.</i>

497

<i>Can you come and see me off tomorrow?</i>

498
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,638
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

<i>I can't see you off tomorrow.</i>

<i>Zheng, can I borrow your pliers?</i>

504
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,455
<i>Zheng. Zheng!</i>

505
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,625
<i>Can I borrow your pliers?</i>

506
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:56,815
<i>Stop drinking.</i>

<i>[Stir Fry Egg Whites, Quick-fried Tripe]</i>

<i>You work so hard during the day and drink so much during the night.</i>

509
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,325
<i>Do you care about your health at all?</i>

510
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:06,095
<i>Come. I'll drink with you.</i>

511
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,395
<i>Why haven't you had your meal yet?</i>

512
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,528
<i>Mr. Luo, I haven't finished my work.</i>

513
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:21,598
<i>I'll eat later.</i>

514
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:24,565
<i>I have a drawing that I just hung on the wall.</i>

515
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:27,855
<i>Could you help me keep an eye on it? I'm going to eat now.</i>

516
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:30,495
<i>No, Mr. Luo. Can I do it?</i>

517
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:33,735
<i>If the paint is dried, I have no idea how to whisk water on it.</i>

<i>You don't have to do that. Just keep an eye on it for me.</i>

00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:38,275
<i>I couldn't find anyone else to do it.</i>

520

<i>My master doesn't allow us...</i>

521
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:41,645
<i>Just tell me. Can you do it or not?</i>

522
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:43,278
<i>I can.</i>

523
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,895
<i>Listen... This is the drawing.</i>

524
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:51,435
<i>Sit on my chair and guard it well.</i>

525
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:53,375
<i>No, Mr. Luo. I'll just stand here.</i>

526
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,365
<i>- Just sit down.
- Wait.</i>

527
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:57,465
<i>- I'm worried...
- Nothing to worry about.</i>

00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:58,805
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

<i>Don't leave until I'm back.</i>

<i>Mr. Luo, you must be annoyed as I've written you so many letters.</i>

531

<i>However, I'm truly curious about what has happened in the Restoration Department.

<i>I'm truly curious about how's he doing recently.</i>

533
00:32:56,945 --> 00:33:00,578
<i>Zheng Jin. How is he recently?</i>

534
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,975
<i>You'd say I was foolish every time I asked this question.</i>

535
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:09,315
<i>You asked me that since I care for him so much, why did I leave?</i>

536
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:13,088
<i>Mr. Luo, I've thought about it for a long time</i>

537
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:15,655
<i>and I've regretted it as well.</i>

538
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:18,225
<i>Why should I wait for him to confess</i>

539
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:21,155
<i>and come to look for me?</i>

540
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:24,775
<i>I should take the initiative and tell him</i>

541
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:27,715
<i>that I want to stay by his side.</i>

542
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:32,848
<i>However, I was angry at him back then.</i>

543
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:36,815
<i>I was angry that why he didn't ask me to stay or look for me.</i>

544
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:42,715
<i>I think that perhaps I'm not important to him.</i>

545
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:47,375
<i>That was the reason why I was upset and decided to leave.</i>

546
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:52,915
<i>What's the point of me regretting it here all alone?</i>

547
00:33:53,585 --> 00:33:55,355
<i>We've now...</i>

548
00:33:57,465 --> 00:34:00,465
<i>drifted apart from each other.</i>

549
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:05,465
<i>I have no courage to rekindle our relationship now.</i>

550
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:19,085
<i>Hey, the meals in the canteen today are pretty good.</i>

551
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:21,455
<i>I got you some as well.</i>

552
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,835
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

553
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:37,095
<i>Mr. Luo, do you know</i>

554
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:41,265
<i>the overseas address of Jin Ning's workplace?</i>

555
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:44,635
<i>I want to see her.</i>

556
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:49,705
<i>I've been waiting for this for a year.</i>

<i>[Jing Ning's address]</i>

558
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:01,005
All right then.

00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:04,925
That's the end of my story.

560
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:06,675
But I think that's just half of the story.

561
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:08,485
It's less than a half to me.

562
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:10,355
Why did one leave while the other one let it happen?

563
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:14,355
Did they finally become a couple after the guy went to look for the lady?

564
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:18,245
This kid is too good at math and lacks imagination.

565
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:20,188
Am I right?

566
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:25,755
Why are you here?

567
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:31,235
Isn't the story about us?

568
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:34,225
Who told you that? Cheeky.

569
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:41,785
Back then, when I brought you back,

570
00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:46,975
I promised to treat you well forever.

571
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:55,555
Did I make it?

572
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:58,458
You did.

573
00:35:59,195 --> 00:36:03,525
You did better than what you promised.

574
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:17,165
I'm sorry.

575
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:28,435
Mom, I'm leaving now!

576
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:31,905
Hold on! Why are you in such a rush?

577
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,775
You haven't had the porridge.

578
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,605
I want to rehearse with Zhang Qi. I'm worried that he will run away.

579
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:38,436
Sunian, hurry up! We're leaving.

580
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:39,975
Sunian!

581
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:42,205
It's not ladylike at all when you act like that.

582
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:43,105
Hurry up!

583
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,285
Sunian. Take the eggs.

584
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:46,955
I wonder from whom did she inherit that attitude.

585
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,255
I don't like eggs.

586
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:49,975
It's all right that you didn't take them in the past.

587
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,645
But I cooked them today.

588

- Faster, Sunian.
- See you, Ms. Jin Ning.

590
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:57,175
- Careful.
- No need to rush.

591
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,808
Bye-bye.

592
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:04,635
This boy is such a fussy eater.

593
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:07,255
But he's so tall despite being a fussy eater.

594
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:10,155
He has better food.

595
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:13,175
Xue can't grow any taller.

596
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:15,515
What's that supposed to mean?

597
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:16,965
She's right.

598
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:20,165
In my eyes, Xue is just perfect.

599
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:25,315
In Zheng's eyes, you're perfect as well.

600
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:26,996
Come on. We're talking about the children.

601
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,385
I've cleaned the bike. Let's go.

602
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:31,245
I'll raise the rear part. Be careful.

603
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:33,138
We're leaving.

604
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:38,288
Look at them. Look at this couple.

605
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:42,955
We're a pretty nice couple as well.

606
00:37:42,955 --> 00:37:44,895
- Go away.
- Okay.

607

612
00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:01,855
I made her this prop.

613
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:05,185
She's been working hard on the stage play lately. We should support her.

614

Don't they look pretty?

615
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:10,755

00:39:33,775 --> 00:39:36,895
Shao Xue, it's your turn.

645
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:39,165
Although we haven't had a proper rehearsal,

646
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:42,515
I believe that our show will amaze everyone in the hall.

647
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,165
Do you have the confidence?

648
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:45,698
- Yes!
- Yes!

649
00:39:45,698 --> 00:39:47,238
Let's go.

650
00:39:57,225 --> 00:39:59,058
One more time.

651
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:08,978
Again.

652
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:22,608
Again.

653
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,558
Again.

654
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:30,288
One more time.

655
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:35,998
Again.

656
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:37,868
Again!

657
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:48,738
Stand up.

658
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,858
Again.

659
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:04,665
Mr. Nai, I'm exhausted.

660
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:07,915
How dare you feel tired when your dance is awful?

661
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:11,285
I can't dance well as I'm too tired.

662
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:15,865
I think there are some problems with your teaching.

663
00:41:23,195 --> 00:41:26,375
Is it my problem or yours?

664
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:29,385
Everyone is waiting for you. Are you aware of that?

665
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:32,145
Do you want to keep dancing

666
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:35,845
or let everyone's effort go to waste?

667
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:37,788
Say something.

668
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:45,455
I'll dance.

669
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:47,288
Good.

670
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:50,025
Come on. Continue.

671
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:52,325
You can do it, Shiyin.

672
00:41:57,735 --> 00:41:59,368
Go.

673
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:03,035
<i>[Mr. Chen, Ms. Miao, Ms. Zhao]</i>
It's Shao Xue's show.

674
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:04,655
Is this the name of the play?

675
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,685
I'm Shao Xue.

676
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:07,435
I couldn't come up with a proper name for the play.

677
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:10,135
But now I've got one. The name is "Princess Jasmine."

678
00:42:10,135 --> 00:42:11,865
Please start your show.

679
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,500
