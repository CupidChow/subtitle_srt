(Adapted from the novel "Glazed Tiles of the Past")

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,669
(by Bei Feng San Bai Li)

3
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,000
(Episode 23, Days related to the College Entrance Exam)

4
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,770
It's probably because...

5
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,080
I said something at the class meeting.

6
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,080
What did you say?

7
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,110
I said...

8
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,680
I didn't like women.

9
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,550
What?

10
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,919
A girl kept pestering me at the time.

11
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,490
It was a slip of the tongue.

12
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,289
I see.

13
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,430
No wonder...

14
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,430
some guys have been asking about you.

15
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,840
Back then,

16
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,710
I thought you offended their girlfriends.

17
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,210
From now on, just cover for me.

18
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,879
Just tell them...

19
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,650
that I'm already taken.

20
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,849
Don't be silly.

21
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,389
You shouldn't joke around like this.

22
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:06,719
I'm telling you.

23
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,159
I'm a straight guy.

24
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,599
I'm not interested in you.

25
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,729
Don't forget about Yun Sheng.

26
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,699
It's a relief to know that.

27
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,039
Su Nian, you are back.

28
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,580
You talk so much to him,

29
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,280
but you hardly talk to me.

30
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,050
Yun Sheng.

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,620
It's my treat today.

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,550
Let's go for Mongolian hot pot.

33
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,520
Why am I eating instant noodles?

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,020
Let's go for Mongolian hot pot.

35
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,960
You guys can go ahead.

36
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,189
I'll pass.

37
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,530
If you don't go, the consequences will be serious.

38
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,330
Yes.

39
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,599
What consequences?

40
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,069
Tell him.

41
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,280
When you talk to your girlfriend on the phone,

42
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,449
I will sit next to you...

43
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,949
and call your name in a feminine voice.

44
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,780
"Hello, Bai Bai."

45
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,889
"Who are you calling?"

46
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,719
"Why are you ignoring me?"

47
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,460
"You are so annoying."

48
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,629
(Liuli Restaurant)

49
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:19,430
Yun Sheng.

50
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,670
Here.

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,170
- Here. - Here.

52
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,009
Don't just drink.

53
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,040
Say something.

54
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,610
About what?

55
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,250
What's with you and Ms. Kang?

56
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,660
What did she tell you?

57
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,199
She said...

58
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,199
that she felt bad for you.

59
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,370
She wanted to see you again...

60
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,209
and talk to you.

61
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,839
What's there to talk about?

62
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,279
I understand.

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,579
I shouldn't hate her given the circumstances.

64
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,920
But if it weren't for her,

65
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,649
my family wouldn't have become like this.

66
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,759
My hometown...

67
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,089
is a small place.

68
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,990
Everyone knows about my dad's affair.

69
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,829
He ruined my family.

70
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,170
He was addicted to gambling.

71
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,100
He angered his dad and wife to death.

72
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm here at the Art Institute to study design...

73
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,180
to rebuild my family's jewelry store.

74
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,680
I want to redeem our ancestral house...

75
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,149
so that my mom can rest in peace.

76
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,959
Every family has problems.

77
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,990
Your family is indeed having a hard time.

78
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,459
My family is on easy mode.

79
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,769
Your family is on harder than hard mode.

80
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,269
Things are not easy for my family either.

81
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,410
What happened to your family?

82
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,879
My mom...

83
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,290
My mom passed away earlier this year.

84
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,600
Things are really tough...

85
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,829
for both of you.

86
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,439
Everyone in this world...

87
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,269
has a scar.

88
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,480
If we are held back by the past,

89
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,310
how do we give a bright future...

90
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,550
to those we care about?

91
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,220
That's right.

92
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,449
Come on.

93
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,259
Let's...

94
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,990
drink...

95
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,629
to our unhappy past.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,230
- Cheers. - Cheers.

97
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,329
If you're doing this...

98
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,069
for the past,

99
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,569
I really can't do it.

100
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,110
Here.

101
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,879
Let's drink...

102
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,480
to our beautiful future.

103
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,079
- Bottoms up. - Yes.

104
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,079
To our beautiful future.

105
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:26,420
- Bottoms up. - Cheers.

106
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,389
Su Nian.

107
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:38,399
Pei Shu.

108
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,600
From now on,

109
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,470
I really see you two as friends.

110
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,509
Was it all an act before?

111
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,339
Were we the supporting roles?

112
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,649
It's a dangerous world.

113
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,720
I had to be defensive.

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,750
Today,

115
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,089
I'll show you...

116
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,790
how dangerous the world is.

117
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,230
Six more beers, please.

118
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:09,529
Sure.

119
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:10,490
Cheers.

120
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,800
Cheers.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,730
Cheers.

122
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,529
Su Nian.

123
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,370
I want to see her.

124
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,939
It's time...

125
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:22,910
to settle the matter.

126
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,750
Okay.

127
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,549
Ms. Kang.

128
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:08,919
How long has it been since you've been home?

129
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,190
It has been over a decade.

130
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,490
Don't you want to go home?

131
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:20,429
I do.

132
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,669
But I don't dare to think about it.

133
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,940
Home is so familiar to me,

134
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,909
yet it feels unfamiliar at the same time.

135
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,509
I guess you have missed home,

136
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,879
but you have held grudges against it too.

137
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,610
I...

138
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,950
How could I hold grudges?

139
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,659
You are the one who has the right to hold grudges.

140
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,230
Yun Sheng.

141
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:01,669
I just want to tell you...

142
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,440
that I'm sorry.

143
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,240
If you have any grudges...

144
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:07,409
or resentment,

145
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,409
just curse all you want.

146
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,620
I'm listening.

147
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,250
I hate a lot of people,

148
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,220
but I don't hate you the most.

149
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,720
It was my dad.

150
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,100
He ruined my life.

151
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,029
He ruined yours too.

152
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,830
He was a middle-aged man...

153
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,629
who lived a shameful life.

154
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,740
Then he killed himself.

155
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,340
Is he not worth resenting?

156
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,480
It wasn't all his fault.

157
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,279
You still can't forget him.

158
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,350
I thought I had forgotten him,

159
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,179
but not completely.

160
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,549
I realized...

161
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:51,860
that man...

162
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,360
and the past...

163
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,929
have always been stuck in my heart.

164
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,730
It turns out you're the one who was hurt the most.

165
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,029
Ms. Kang.

166
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,100
Time really does heal everything.

167
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,840
As time goes by,

168
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
everyone would smile when they recall the past.

169
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,909
Even if they meet again,

170
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:15,210
they could greet each other as if nothing had happened.

171
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,820
Just like us.

172
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,820
Go visit them when you are free.

173
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,690
Everyone should live for themselves.

174
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,139
Xiao Xue.

175
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:47,779
Xiao Xue.

176
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,850
Xiao Xue.

177
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,019
Be quiet.

178
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,519
One more bite.

179
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,120
One more bite and I'm done.

180
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:04,929
Xiao Xue.

181
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,129
Xiao Xue.

182
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,169
Su Nian.

183
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:11,669
Are you still sleeping?

184
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,570
Hold on.

185
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,679
Su Nian, hold on.

186
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,509
Okay.

187
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:27,850
I'm coming.

188
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,200
Su Nian, why are you looking for me?

189
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,000
What is it, Su Nian?

190
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:47,909
What are you mimicking?

191
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,139
Are you a pork burrito?

192
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,679
You're the pork.

193
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:53,940
I have something for you.

194
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:54,750
Come to my place.

195
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,779
Sure.

196
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,210
Wait for me there.

197
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,220
I'll be with you in a minute.

198
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,230
Su Nian, where did Mr. Zheng go?

199
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,299
He went to walk the cat.

200
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,399
Walk the cat?

201
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,230
It's the cat from the restoration house.

202
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,769
It's living in my house now.

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,240
My dad didn't want it to be bored.

204
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,639
So he took it out for a walk.

205
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,110
That's new.

206
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,470
I'll take a look at it sometime.

207
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:24,879
Where's the thing you want to give me?

208
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,250
Aren't these Ms. Jin Ning's belongings?

209
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,659
My mom said to give them to you,

210
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,190
but I forgot about it.

211
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,289
I just got it done two days ago.

212
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,129
Su Nian, look.

213
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,929
This cat bookmark is so cute.

214
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,940
She had always loved cats.

215
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,539
The cat that she drew is adorable.

216
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,909
Su Nian.

217
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,379
You've been studying art for so long,

218
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,519
but I've never seen any of your drawings.

219
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,549
Show me.

220
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,250
All my drawings are at the campus.

221
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,519
I'll show you some other time.

222
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:12,820
All right.

223
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,830
There's one right here.

224
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,129
This is...

225
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,100
what I used to practice for the entrance exam.

226
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,200
The drawings are terrible.

227
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,830
No matter how terrible the drawings are,

228
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,629
they are still better than mine.

229
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,899
Let me see it.

230
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,200
The drawings are really awful.

231
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,370
I want to see it.

232
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,769
I'll show you something else.

233
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,110
I want to see this.

234
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,440
Give it to me.

235
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,179
I want to see it.

236
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,409
Let me see it.

237
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,549
I want to see it.

238
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:41,850
Just let me see it.

239
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,809
Su Nian.

240
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,549
Why did you draw so many portraits of me?

241
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,120
I...

242
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,620
The portraits were not drawn well.

243
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,460
So I kept practicing.

244
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,990
Why didn't you give me one then?

245
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,360
Next time,

246
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,799
I'll draw one for you.

247
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,029
Write me an IOU then.

248
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,139
Write this down.

249
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,879
Just write...

250
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,610
that you owe me a drawing.

251
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,450
Okay.

252
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:30,789
(I owe Xiao Xue a drawing)

253
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,659
Is it enough?

254
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:36,629
Pinky swear.

255
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,769
It's not necessary.

256
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,100
It's for security purposes.

257
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,139
- Pinky swear. - Pinky swear.

258
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,710
- Promise for a hundred years. - Promise for a hundred years.

259
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:46,980
Stamp it.

260
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,599
"Autumn in Peiping"...

261
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,130
by Yu Dafu.

262
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,670
"Autumn,"

263
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,339
"wherever it is,"

264
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,039
"is always good."

265
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,470
"However,"

266
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,279
"in North China,"

267
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,809
"it is particularly limpid,"

268
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,509
"serene,"

269
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,279
"and melancholy."

270
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,720
"To enjoy its atmosphere to the fullest in the onetime capital,"

271
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:29,250
"I have, therefore, traveled a long distance..."

272
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,789
"from Hangzhou to Qingdao,"

273
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,759
"and thence to Peiping."

274
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,049
Zhang Qi, do you have the dorm key?

275
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,480
- Yes. - Lend it to me.

276
00:17:58,849 --> 00:17:59,980
Thank you. I'll get going now.

277
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,029
Hello, teachers.

278
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,329
I'm Lin Shi Yin.

279
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,170
Today, I'm going to recite...

280
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,640
"To the Oak Tree".

281
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,579
"If I love you,"

282
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,480
"I will never be a clinging trumpet creeper."

283
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:32,019
"Using your high boughs to show off my heights."

284
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,490
I'm sorry. We don't need anyone right now.

285
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,400
Please reconsider.

286
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,099
You should look for another place.

287
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,970
Newlyweds, please look in front.

288
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,140
Smile.

289
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,140
Three, two...

290
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:00,910
Hold on.

291
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,089
Keep smiling.

292
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,390
Three, two, one.

293
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,700
(Jifangting)

294
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,990
(Don't waste your youth, Countdown to the exam)

295
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,099
Su Nian.

296
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:54,329
Were you looking for me?

297
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,599
What is this?

298
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,940
(Xiao Xue will succeed in the college entrance exam!)

299
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,140
Good luck tomorrow.

300
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,680
(Admission card)

301
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,410
The time went by so fast.

302
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,980
My senior year felt like...

303
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,519
it was being fast-forwarded.

304
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,549
(All the best for the exam)

305
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:16,720
I was busy studying without a clear mind...

306
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,359
just the day before.

307
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:19,490
And the next thing I knew,

308
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,259
I was already in the exam hall in June.

309
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:40,480
Xiao Xue.

310
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,849
Su Nian, I'm finally free.

311
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,019
Let's go.

312
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,319
My mom is too much.

313
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,619
How could she ask you to pick me up?

314
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,390
I was the one who volunteered.

315
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,029
This school is close to my campus.

316
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,390
Su Nian.

317
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,859
Let's have a feast tonight.

318
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,759
It's on me.

319
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,970
You were busy with the exam for the past two days.

320
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:02,829
That's why I didn't tell you this.

321
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,230
Zhang Qi came back yesterday.

322
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,299
He said that after your exams,

323
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,109
he would abduct you to a restaurant so we can get together.

324
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,369
That's great.

325
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,210
Let's invite Shi Yin and Wu Huan.

326
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
I have invited them.

327
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:15,650
Great university life,

328
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,349
I'm coming!

329
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,319
Here.

330
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,049
It's to celebrate the end of your college entrance exam.

331
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,980
You are finally free from your nightmares.

332
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:21,750
Cheers.

333
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,319
- Cheers! - Cheers!

334
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,660
Let's dig in.

335
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:32,500
Zhang Qi, I'm amazed.

336
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,000
Your bangs are curled now.

337
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,200
I guess life in the fancy college is going well.

338
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,400
You have no idea.

339
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,769
Half of my classmates were enrolled by recommendation.

340
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,269
They are always busy playing games and dating,

341
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,369
yet they do well in exams.

342
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,140
I burn the midnight oil to study every day,

343
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,150
but my grades are barely average.

344
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,109
Now, I know...

345
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,920
the feeling of being crushed by smarty-pants.

346
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,950
You're the pride of our alley.

347
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:55,890
Don't give up.

348
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,920
I think you should give it a thought.

349
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,420
Why can they date all the time,

350
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,460
but you can't?

351
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,890
You'll know when you go to university.

352
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,700
Girls are not enough to go round for guys.

353
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,130
People would even compete...

354
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,400
for girls like you.

355
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,599
What's wrong with me?

356
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,369
Cherish the person in front of you.

357
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:19,509
Dig in. The food is ready.

358
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:20,380
Dig in.

359
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,309
You need to change too.

360
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,450
You are eating too much.

361
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,480
No one can afford to support you in the future.

362
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,150
I'm sure someone will want Xiao Xue.

363
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,619
That's right.

364
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:38,799
Pay attention to me.

365
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,029
I have something to tell you.

366
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,329
What?

367
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:45,240
I'm going abroad.

368
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,140
You're going abroad?

369
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:48,309
Where are you going?

370
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,910
Didn't you just go to university?

371
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,269
I'm going to the University of Cambridge.

372
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,480
Many students in my university choose to go there.

373
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,109
I've been preparing for this for a long time.

374
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,279
What's wrong?

375
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,349
All of you are stunned. Aren't you happy for me?

376
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,460
So you gathered us here not to meet up,

377
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,559
but it's to say goodbye.

378
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,799
It's a gathering before I leave.

379
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,269
I made up my mind two months ago.

380
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,240
I'll fly in early August.

381
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,609
I need to get used to the environment first.

382
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,910
You are leaving in August and you are only telling us now?

383
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,009
I had to wait until your exam was over.

384
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,210
I didn't want you to miss me too much.

385
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,519
You would blame me if you fail.

386
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,579
Good job.

387
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,819
You are leaving abroad before me.

388
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:37,349
Forget it.

389
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:39,490
At least, you are the pride of the alley.

390
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,019
Here's to you.

391
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:41,990
Count me in.

392
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,059
Don't forget to shop on my behalf.

393
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,160
Zhang Qi is always impressive.

394
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,099
Cheers.

395
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,660
Since I'm leaving, we can't just have normal drinks.

396
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,000
Mr. Mei, bring me a carton of beer.

397
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,740
- Cheers! - Cheers!

398
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,269
Don't drink too much.

399
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,539
Xiao Xue.

400
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,109
I miss our childhood.

401
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,910
I just had to go out and shout.

402
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,480
Then all of you would come out.

403
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:04,150
I really miss Ms. Deng's steamed buns.

404
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,319
But now, I have to go so far just to get a steamed bun.

405
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,789
After the first bite,

406
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:09,819
all the meat is gone.

407
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,319
If I take another bite,

408
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,759
I would bite my own hand.

409
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,789
After I leave,

410
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,799
I won't be able to come back even during the festive seasons.

411
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,730
We're going to be so far apart.

412
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,500
I wonder...

413
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,700
if we can meet up again.

414
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:28,940
Of course we can.

415
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,470
Wherever you go from now on,

416
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,079
be it the North or the South,

417
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
I'll go to you.

418
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:35,579
I knew it.

419
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,779
You just want to travel.

420
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,920
- I just want to travel. - Cheers!

421
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,990
Where are we going?

422
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,289
This way.

423
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,519
Slowly. This way.

424
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:49,289
- I'll take you home. - Hold on tight.

425
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,690
- I don't want to go home. - Otherwise,

426
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,029
I will lose the Little Li Flying Dagger.

427
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,029
I'm holding tight.

428
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,500
- Go home now. - Slowly.

429
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:56,329
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

430
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,839
Cheers. It's so painful.

431
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,339
Xiao Xue.

432
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:03,910
I have something to tell you.

433
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:04,940
Go ahead.

434
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:09,509
Look me in the eye.

435
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:12,349
Let me see.

436
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,250
Take care...

437
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,359
Take care of my buddy.

438
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,329
Buddy. Okay, good buddy.

439
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,299
Su Nian.

440
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,599
- Take care of... - Su Nian.

441
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:32,099
Take it easy.

442
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,670
Take care of Xiao Xue.

443
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:37,369
Don't worry.

444
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,809
I'll take good care of her.

445
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:42,150
I don't want to leave you guys.

446
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:43,609
Take it easy.

447
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,819
I don't want to leave you guys.

448
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,789
- I don't want to leave you. - Slow down.

449
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,049
I don't want you to leave either.

450
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,789
I'll take you home first.

451
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:52,789
- Come on. - Let's drink.

452
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,660
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

453
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,460
Let's drink.

454
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:56,990
- Your house is this way. - Let's drink.

455
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,460
I can walk.

456
00:25:58,529 --> 00:25:59,599
I can walk.

457
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,829
Wait for me to come home.

458
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,539
Cheers.

459
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,369
- He left. - Let's go.

460
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,839
Let's go, Xiao Xue. I'll take you home.

461
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,710
I don't need a ride.

462
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,210
I'll do it, Shi Yin.

463
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,150
Wu Huan, send her home.

464
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:17,910
Okay.

465
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,750
Zhang Qi, let's drink.

466
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,490
Shi Yin!

467
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,160
I'm leaving.

468
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,059
Bye.

469
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,430
Let's go, Su Nian.

470
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,329
Let's go.

471
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:45,839
Hey.

472
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,880
Are you leaving?

473
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:52,920
Why don't I...

474
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,920
drop you off?

475
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,420
My house is so close. What's the point?

476
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,990
How did you do in the exam?

477
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:04,829
I did well.

478
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,900
I'm in a good mood too.

479
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:08,599
Congratulations.

480
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:11,970
What about you?

481
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,869
Have you found a job?

482
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,309
Not yet.

483
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,369
What's wrong?

484
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,079
Nothing.

485
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,640
Do whatever you want.

486
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,680
I don't care.

487
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,549
Shi Yin.

488
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,119
What now?

489
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,019
That day at my house,

490
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,490
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

491
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,089
I'm sorry.

492
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,130
Actually,

493
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,099
I was a bit impulsive that day.

494
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,329
Next time,

495
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,140
I'll go and apologize to your mom.

496
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,910
It's okay.

497
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:52,940
We're not friends anymore moving forward.

498
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,779
What do you mean?

499
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,019
We graduated today.

500
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:03,019
You don't have to avoid me anymore.

501
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,420
Who's avoiding you?

502
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,589
When I wanted to quit school,

503
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,829
you said you needed me.

504
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,329
That was why I stayed.

505
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,099
But now, I can feel...

506
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,769
that I'm not needed anymore.

507
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:21,869
In the past,

508
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,309
I saw you as a beam of light.

509
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,509
I enjoyed chasing that light.

510
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,880
In the past?

511
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:31,750
But now,

512
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,319
I got burnt by that beam of light.

513
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,059
But of course...

514
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,019
it has nothing to do with you.

515
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,930
You never cared about what my life is like.

516
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,700
I could only appear in your life when you needed me.

517
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:56,769
Thank you for coming that day.

518
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,710
I was very happy.

519
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,480
That was by far...

520
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,980
the most precious birthday I had.

521
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,420
Don't cry.

522
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,220
You should be happy.

523
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:15,660
From now on,

524
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,190
I won't cling to you anymore.

525
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,599
I won't be there...

526
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,000
in your world anymore.

527
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:33,240
Wu Huan.

528
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,450
Do you really have to go?

529
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,230
I won't let you go.

530
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,400
Who says I don't need you anymore?

531
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,539
You fool.

532
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,970
I need you.

533
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,039
Your master is losing the game.

534
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,309
Those old men have been playing chess their whole lives,

535
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,809
yet no one is winning.

536
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,210
There's no rush.

537
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,450
When they retire,

538
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,349
you can continue the game with Mr. Zheng.

539
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,619
You're learning to talk like Qiao Mu.

540
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,119
You are so eloquent now.

541
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,289
I had to learn from her.

542
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,690
Otherwise, I would lose to her in a fight.

543
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,160
I would never win.

544
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,289
You want to win in a fight with your wife?

545
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,390
Dream on.

546
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,329
I'm telling you.

547
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,400
If you win, the consequences will be worse.

548
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,099
You must have gotten beaten up a lot at home.

549
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:10,740
When is your baby due?

550
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:12,339
It's around National Day.

551
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,509
That is fast.

552
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,950
Yes.

553
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,119
Has Xiao Xue received...

554
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,380
the admission notice?

555
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,420
Don't get me started.

556
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:26,890
I'm troubled.

557
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,289
If she is not chosen,

558
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,930
what should we do?

559
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,529
Don't worry.

560
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,230
Just wait for two more days.

561
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,099
The admission notice...

562
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,670
are posted in batches.

563
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,670
But Shi Yin...

564
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,670
received hers two weeks ago.

565
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,680
The last batch will be here in the next two days.

566
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,380
If she still doesn't receive it...

567
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,250
When she was guessing her scores,

568
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,549
we already felt strange.

569
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,690
She barely passed the benchmark.

570
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,789
If she made one or two more mistakes...

571
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,390
Didn't she fill out a few choices at once?

572
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,700
Even if she didn't get this one,

573
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,000
I think there's another option.

574
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,130
I didn't apply for a second option.

575
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,470
What?

576
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,240
You didn't apply for a second option?

577
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,910
I'm not saying you're not going to make it.

578
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,009
But you should've at least applied for a second choice.

579
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,250
No.

580
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,579
I wasn't thinking.

581
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:31,119
I felt like I had to take foreign studies no matter what.

582
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:33,190
You're ambitious.

583
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,690
That's easy.

584
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,359
It's either you don't get the offer...

585
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,829
or you will enroll into the Institute of Foreign Studies.

586
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,400
You will receive the letter soon.

587
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,630
My roommate knows a lecturer from the Institute of Foreign Studies.

588
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,329
He told me that the last batch of admission notices...

589
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,529
was posted a while ago.

590
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:46,670
Logically,

591
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,240
I live in Beijing...

592
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:50,740
and I should be the first person to receive the letter.

593
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,670
I joined a QQ group chat...

594
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,210
for new students of the Institute of Foreign Studies.

595
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:55,140
Except for me,

596
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,750
everyone else had received the letter.

597
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,650
The last two people who received the letter...

598
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,049
live in Tibet...

599
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,380
and Hainan.

600
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,819
If I don't get it by tomorrow,

601
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:08,019
I'll be too embarrassed to stay in the group chat.

602
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,000
Let's eat something delicious.

603
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:15,329
Don't think about this nonsense.

604
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,230
I'm not going.

605
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,700
By the way,

606
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,269
haven't you always wanted to see animals?

607
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,039
Let's go to the zoo.

608
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,640
I'm not going.

609
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,539
Why don't we go shopping at Xidan?

610
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:26,910
This year's summer outfit is amazing.

611
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,579
Go ahead without me. I'm not worthy.

612
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,119
I'm going back to read "Harry Potter".

613
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,619
You've seen it hundreds of times.

614
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,690
Why are you still reading it?

615
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,619
I'm willing to be in that world.

616
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:42,930
At least...

617
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,430
Dumbledore would send me an acceptance letter.

618
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,200
It's not that bad.

619
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,599
She will just have to repeat another year at worst.

620
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:58,910
What should we do now?

621
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,009
I'm at my wits' end.

622
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,750
And I'm worried.

623
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,950
If Xiao Xue really doesn't pass, what should we do?

624
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:06,920
I can hear you.

625
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,650
Growing up,

626
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,019
this is the first time we share the same thought.

627
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,789
By estimation,

628
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,599
no doubt that she barely passed.

629
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,300
But there were a few questions...

630
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,630
that she couldn't remember the answer.

631
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,070
If she gets them all correct,

632
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:25,199
it should be fine.

633
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:26,469
What if it's all wrong?

634
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,769
What if her essay was off-topic?

635
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,469
What if she missed out on four questions in the math paper?

636
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:30,940
Your biggest strength...

637
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,010
used to be optimism.

638
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,409
I have so many good qualities now.

639
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,309
It's fine to lose one or two.

640
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,409
I can't listen to this.

641
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,079
Find a way.

642
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,849
I'll do anything for Xiao Xue's sake.

643
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,320
Go and keep her company.

644
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,019
Don't you know Xiao Xue?

645
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,050
The moment she revisits "Harry Potter",

646
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,519
she will enter her own world.

647
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,420
We'll just be the annoying muggles.

648
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,889
I'll get going.

649
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,360
Where are you going?

650
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,530
Are you going to see Wu Huan?

651
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,099
It's none of your business.

652
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,829
We applaud you.

653
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,900
We are happy for you.

654
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,269
I feel bad for Wu Huan though.

655
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:03,469
You don't deserve him.

656
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,309
You're just jealous.

657
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,809
I'll get going.

658
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,739
Call me if anything comes up.

659
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,619
Little Nian Nian.

660
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,659
Help me.

661
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,260
I forgot my key again.

662
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,260
The dorm manager is not around since it's semester break.

663
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,389
Is Yun Sheng there?

664
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,199
I don't know.

665
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,130
I tried knocking, but no one answered.

666
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,199
Okay, I'll be right there.

667
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,670
What's wrong?

668
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,670
My roommate forgot his key.

669
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,710
Are you abandoning me?

670
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:38,239
I'm leaving the country soon.

671
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,110
Keep in touch.

672
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,079
This is called "fond of the new, tired of the old".

673
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,579
Your Mandarin has improved.

674
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,579
One more.

675
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,949
"See you never."

676
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:55,960
(Jetfast Delivery)

677
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,159
It's all urgent.

678
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,659
Deliver it to them immediately.

679
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,400
Okay.

680
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,730
Hurry up.

681
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,130
Okay.

682
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:16,909
What is this?

683
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,980
You must be Mr. Ji.

684
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,550
I received your message...

685
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:21,980
informing that I got the job.

686
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
You are Wu Huan, right?

687
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,360
Yes.

688
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:28,090
Thank you so much.

689
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,190
Before this,

690
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,559
I didn't dare to dream big.

691
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,260
Even the small logistic companies wouldn't accept me.

692
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:33,300
Thank you for taking me in.

693
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,530
I'm so excited.

694
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,900
Shi Yin is right.

695
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,429
You are indeed an honest person.

696
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,539
Here, let me show you around the logistic station.

697
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,539
Come this way.

698
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,780
Shi Yin asked me to arrange an administrative job for you.

699
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,280
All of us are doing it.

700
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,849
What's worse is that it's a hassle to take care of.

701
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,849
How are you related to Shi Yin?

702
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,750
I'm her uncle.

703
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,159
Didn't she tell you?

704
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:02,389
No.

705
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,059
Goodness.

706
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,559
She came here...

707
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,000
and wouldn't stop bugging me for two days.

708
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,269
I thought she told you everything.

709
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,469
I guess she wanted to surprise me.

710
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:12,900
It's okay.

711
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,639
Since you're already here,

712
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,940
it's your job to fulfill your duty.

713
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,380
Good luck, young man.

714
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:22,039
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

715
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,349
Come on. I'll show you around.

716
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:31,219
Why is it reek of alcohol?

717
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,190
He's in the room.

718
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,690
He must have entertained his clients again.

719
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:39,860
I know, right?

720
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,260
It has been one week in a row.

721
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,639
It's so hard to be a designer.

722
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,639
Not only does he have to be good at drawing,

723
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,070
but he also has to be a good drinker.

724
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
The other designers are not doing that.

725
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,110
Little Bai Bai is ambitious.

726
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,750
He wants to make his own brand.

727
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,179
That's why he has to pave the way for himself.

728
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:03,719
Those investors know nothing about design.

729
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,949
All they know is just drinking.

730
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,960
Let's wake him up...

731
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,190
so he can eat something.

732
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:11,760
Forget it.

733
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:12,829
Let him sleep for a while.

734
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,130
I think he'll have to drink again in the evening.

735
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:35,219
Xiao Xue.

736
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,889
Here.

737
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,820
I'm full, Mom.

738
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,590
Enjoy your meal.

739
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,829
But you haven't eaten...

740
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,110
She is troubled.

741
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,210
I'm troubled too.

742
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,809
When I see her being like this,

743
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,409
I don't even dare to say anything.

744
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,949
It's suffocating.

745
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:07,219
Hold it in.

746
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,750
If you open your mouth, both of you will surely fight.

747
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,519
I don't have the guts to fight with her.

748
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,460
It is what it is.

749
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,590
It's best if she got chosen.

750
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,130
If she fails,

751
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,460
we will find another way.

752
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,659
Look at our child.

753
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,469
If she doesn't get into a university,

754
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,429
what should we do?

755
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,440
Should we let her repeat her senior year?

756
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,369
I'm afraid she won't be able to take it.

757
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,110
But it's still up to her.

758
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,110
I thought...

759
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,050
you would force her to repeat.

760
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,480
Can you accept her not going to university?

761
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,150
I have to accept it anyway.

762
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:43,250
What's the big deal?

763
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,019
I'm afraid our daughter won't be able to take it.

764
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,090
During her senior year,

765
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,590
she was exhausted...

766
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:50,030
that she became so skinny.

767
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:52,090
If she repeats one more year,

768
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,659
wouldn't you feel bad for her?

769
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,670
But she still needs to get into a university no matter what.

770
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,079
Let's withdraw all the money.

771
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,409
Hasn't she always wanted to study abroad?

772
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,610
Let's find a way...

773
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,150
to send her abroad.

774
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,650
My wife, you're amazing.

775
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,989
You would do anything for our daughter's sake.

776
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,349
No.

777
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,989
I'll take a look now...

778
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:21,289
how much money we have.

779
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:22,960
Wait...

780
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,550
When is my owl coming?

781
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,599
Su Nian.

782
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,000
Stop hiding.

783
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:08,539
I already saw you.

784
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,710
This is for you.

785
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,550
A magic wand?

786
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,849
Where did you get this?

787
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,349
From a toy store.

788
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:24,750
It's all just a lie.

789
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,659
There's no magic in this world.

790
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,360
Why don't you make a wish?

791
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,530
Maybe it will come true.

792
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,269
I hope...

793
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,280
I won't disappoint my parents again.
