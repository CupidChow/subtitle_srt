You drew Xue here, didn't you?

Are you two an item now?

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Am I the first one to know about this?

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, I haven't had the chance to tell everyone.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Fine, I won't tell anyone.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,700
Oh, the young people nowadays.

41
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,200
You have to keep your relationship a secret

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
to make it extra romantic, don't you?

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't worry.

44
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,300
Your secret is safe with me.

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,100
Thanks, Master.

46
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,600
I've been meaning to ask you this.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,500
Do you truly want to stay in this small yard forever?

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,400
My body might stay in this square but my heart travels beyond its boundary.

49
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,000
Dad is the best.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Save your compliments.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Only compliment me when you bring your boyfriend back.

52
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,500
Dad.

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,000
There is something I have to tell you.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
Go ahead.

55
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,400
Well, I am already...

56
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm back!

57
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Where were you?

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Pour me a glass of water, please.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
I was mediating a dispute.

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Whose?

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,000
The Lins'.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,400
Because of Shiyin again.

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,100
What did she do?

64
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,000
She was holding hands with Wu Huan

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,100
and her mom saw it.

66
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,400
What's there to argue about?

67
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,800
Judging from your reply,

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
you already knew about it?

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,100
See? Our daughter hid it from us.

70
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
- In the future, she...
- Mom! Enough about me.

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,000
Why were they arguing?

72
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,500
Obviously, Ms. Ji Lan isn't too happy about it.

73
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,600
You know Wu Huan's background, don't you?

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,100
And when you consider his mom's health...

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, anyone would be worried.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,700
But Wu Huan is an honest and hardworking man.

77
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,100
They will make it work.

78
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,300
Exactly, he's a fine young man.

79
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,400
I know he is,

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,800
but I understand why Ji Lan is worried.

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,600
Forget about Wu Huan's family background.

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
In my opinion,

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,800
if two families are close to one another,

84
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
their children shouldn't get together.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Think about this.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,800
If the children make it work, then all is well.

87
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,700
But if they can't,

88
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,400
it just makes everything awkward for the two families.

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
Is it that serious?

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
Of course, it is.

91
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,000
I had two colleagues in the Restoration Division.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Their children got together but then broke up.

93
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,400
And now, both of them have to avoid each other.

94
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
It's so awkward.

95
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
Exactly.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,200
What were you saying just now?

97
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,200
Nothing.

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Chestnuts will make you feel feverish.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,400
Don't eat them.

100
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000
Why are you eating them, then?

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,400
Fine.

102
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,400
You're here to console me.

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,500
Why aren't you saying anything?

104
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,800
There, there.

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,400
Since your family knows about it already,

106
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,000
you might as well make it official.

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
I don't want to.

108
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
My parents have already given me enough headaches.

109
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,700
If everyone knows about it, it will be even more troublesome.

110
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,000
If you were together with Sunian,

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
would you tell everyone?

112
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,200
<i>Xue? Xue?</i>

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,300
Sunian! Sunian!

114
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
You...

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,200
Something has changed...

116
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,400
between you two!

117
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,300
When did it start? Come clean now.

118
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,500
When I looked for her in Guangxi.

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,200
Oh, my!

120
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
You two were completely exhausted that day

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,400
and you still had the energy to start a relationship?

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,200
Wait.

123
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,300
That night,

124
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,200
both of you shared the same room. Right?

125
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Zheng Sunian, you are quite something!

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,500
Give her innocence back!

127
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,000
Stop yelling. I started it first.

128
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,900
I taught you all these years for nothing.

129
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,100
By the way, since we're together already,

130
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,400
don't pull any more tricks.

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,000
You two ingrates.

132
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
You want me to leave?

133
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
No way.

134
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
I will call Zhang Qi.

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Sure! I haven't heard from him for so long.

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,100
Hi, Zhang Qi.

137
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,300
<i>What a rare occurrence.</i>

138
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,200
Why did you call me all of a sudden?

139
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I have great news for you.

140
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
What? Wu Huan dumped you?

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
Go to hell.

142
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,000
Two lovebirds finally got together!

143
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
<i>Come talk to them.</i>

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,300
Hi, Zhang Qi.

145
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,000
<i>Why haven't you called us?</i>

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
<i>We miss you.</i>

147
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,600
I didn't want to disturb your romantic time.

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,100
Go find a girlfriend too then.

149
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,600
Or else, Ms. Zhang Ling will grow impatient.

150
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
<i>[Zhang Qi. Line 1. Connected]
I have many admirers.</i>

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>I don't have the time to go through all of them.</i>

152
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,000
Stop bragging.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,900
When I'm back, all of you owe me a big meal.

154
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,800
Sure, no problem.

155
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,000
<i>I have a class to attend. See you.</i>

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

157
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,300
<i>[To the silliest person in the world, Zhang Qi. Don't lose your dorm key again!]</i>

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,300
I should go now, too.

159
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,600
Bye then!

160
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Lovers before friends.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sunian, can I tell you something?

162
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,300
Go ahead.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,600
Perhaps we should keep our relationship a secret?

164
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,600

and it's a great working experience, so

330
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,300
I want to give it a try.

331
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,500
But it's the end of the month now.

332
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,400
Yes. So...

333
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,000
I will leave in a few days.

334
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,800
Why are you telling me now?

335
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,100
I only got this opportunity recently.

336
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,500
<i>Xue!</i>

337
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,800
Let's have dinner first.

338
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Come and eat.

339
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
Are we not waiting for my dad?

340
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,200
No need. I'll save some for him.

341
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Have a seat.

342
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,024
Sunian.

343
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,294
I have a question for you.

344
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,000
Xue wants to go abroad to help her school.

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,700
Does that count as work experience?

346
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Of course, Ms. Yu.

347
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
One should work more when he or she is still in university

348
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
and after graduation, one will have a stable job.

349
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
I trust you then. Come, dig in.

350
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,700
Ms. Yu.

351
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,200
Wu Huan?

352
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Wu Huan.

353
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:16,774
What's with all of these?

354
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,294
I'm here to pay you a visit.

355
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,400
My mom asked me to bring these to you.

356
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,300
Your mom is so polite.

357
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,200
Place them here.

358
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
Bring them back later, okay?

359
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,100
Since you're here and we are having dinner,

360
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,600
why not join us?

361
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,500
I won't be polite.

362
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,800
Thanks, Ms. Yu.

363
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,000
No need to thank me.

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,700
You don't come here often.

365
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,000
Make yourself at home.

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,300
I'll bring you chopsticks and a bowl.

367
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,800
- Thanks, Ms. Yu.
- No problem.

368
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,000
Wu Huan, don't be shy. Just eat.

369
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,300
You two are so lucky.

370
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
You live near each other.

371
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,400
You can see each other every day.

372
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
Don't you hang out with Shiyin every day, too?

373
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Quite regularly.

374
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Xue, have you been hanging out with Shiyin lately?

375
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,500
Yes. Just two days ago, we went shopping together.

376
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,400
Oh, didn't she say she would be back tonight?

377
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Go find her later.

378
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,900
I will.

379
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,800
Here, Wu Huan.

380
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
This is your bowl of rice.

381
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Thanks, Ms. Yu.

382
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,300
- If it's not enough, I'll bring you some more.
- Okay.

383
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,600
What's the matter?

384
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Are my dishes not delicious?

385
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,700
Why aren't you eating?

386
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
- Not at all.
- It's not that, Ms. Yu.

387
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,500
Here.

388
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,600
Thanks, Ms. Yu.

389
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,100
Xue, get some food for Sunian.

390
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,900
- Try this.
- Thanks, Ms. Yu.

391
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
Sunian.

392
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,100
You ate so little.

393
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm not hungry.

394
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Are you upset?

395
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,500
Because I'm going abroad?

396
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,400
No.

397
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,200
It's just too... sudden.

398
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,400
Then... I'll stay.

399
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
You'll resent me.

400
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,900
I won't.

401
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,800
I will resent myself.

402
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,855
Xue.

403
00:23:02,985 --> 00:23:05,225
I don't want to tie you down.

404
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:08,755
But now, I...

405
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:11,645
I just can't help myself.

406
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:14,615
I want you to stay by my side.

407
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:21,664
Sunian, have you been watching more romantic dramas?

408
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:28,855
If you can't help it, so be it.

409
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:37,135
This is for you.

Does it hurt?

415

Try it if you don't trust me.

416

Six months.

00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:30,575
Xue's room is still dark.

496
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:34,434
That daughter of mine.

497
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:37,075
She left the house and forgot to close the door.

498
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:39,665
She's just like her mom.

499
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:44,365
I should have recorded it and played it to my mom.

500
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:49,245
You're so mean.

501
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,615
Come closer. I'll tell you something.

502
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,305
I am mean.

503
00:28:56,845 --> 00:28:57,944
<i>Zheng.</i>

504
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:01,215
Sunian has started working.

505
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:04,814
It's time for him to find a girlfriend.

506
00:29:04,815 --> 00:29:06,735
It's too early.

507
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:09,055
He won't listen to me anyway.

508
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:12,774
Right. He has always been an opinionated kid.

509
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,924
We don't know what his type is either.

510
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,985
I'm his type.

511
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:22,745
Does Xue have a boyfriend now?

512
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,814
She hasn't mentioned anything.

513
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:28,294
However, she keeps mentioning a senior.

514
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:30,795
<i>I think she's into him.</i>

515
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:32,135
Have you seen him?

516
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:33,465
How is he?

517
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:35,615
<i>I have never met him.</i>

518
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:37,424
<i>But I was thinking,</i>

519
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:38,844
<i>they are both in linguistics anyway.</i>

520
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,924
If Xue doesn't want to work here,

521
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:43,475
at least, he can travel with her.

522
00:29:46,405 --> 00:29:49,155
<i>This wine pot looks good.</i>

523
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:52,615
<i>Since Dongge is not here, should we...?</i>

524
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:55,745
Let's go out then.

525
00:29:58,615 --> 00:30:00,755
<i>I'm starving after shopping for the whole day.</i>

526
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:10,544
- The things we found today were not too shabby.
- I agree.

527
00:30:10,544 --> 00:30:13,205
I think the three items I have are good.

528
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:15,815
<i>That wine pot is quite authentic, too.</i>

529
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,405
We don't have to hide, actually.

530
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,515
I often come here to hang out with you anyway.

531
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:26,534
We have been together for two years already.

532
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,875
It's time to tell everyone.

533
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,765
But I heard Dad is usually hostile

534
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:34,835
against his future son-in-law.

535
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:39,634
If my dad doesn't like you anymore, what should we do?

536
00:30:39,685 --> 00:30:40,924
I'm confident in myself.

537
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,465
Perhaps I can tell them now?

538
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:49,665
Let's wait until I come back from overseas.

539
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,690
<i>[Customer First]</i>

540
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:07,175
Xue!

541
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:13,924
Shiyin, you're just meeting a friend.

542
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:16,675
Do you have to get all dolled up?

543
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,914
I have to let everyone in your school know who your best friend is.

544
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:22,604
I look like a nanny next to you now.

545
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:25,024
Anyway, let's go shopping later.

546
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:27,535
I'll pick you something that looks nice on you.

547
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:28,744
No, thanks.

548
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,565
The plane ticket costs a fortune.

549
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:32,525
I'm penniless now.

550
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:34,164
Where are you going this time?

551
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:35,574
It's an interview.

552
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:37,105
An interview?

553
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,985
For which company?

554
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:41,094
Huanyu Investment Corporation.

555
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:42,264
Huanyu?

556
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:43,574
Not bad.

557
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:46,634
My senior hosted their annual meeting. It's a grand event.

558
00:31:46,665 --> 00:31:48,334
Isn't Huanyu in Beijing?

559
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:49,854
That's their China branch.

560
00:31:49,855 --> 00:31:52,364
My interview is with their headquarters.

561
00:31:52,364 --> 00:31:53,844
That's amazing!

562
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,754
A huge company overseas.

563
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:58,375
Your dream is about to come true.

564
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,655
It's a wonderful opportunity.

565
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,725
Why are you sulking?

566
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:12,905
Because I haven't told Sunian and my parents about this.

567
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:14,905
Why?

568
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:17,275
If I'm chosen,

569
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:20,295
I have to work overseas.

570
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:21,474
Isn't it great?

571
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:24,435
You have always wanted to see the world outside. You can explore to your heart's content.

572
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:27,805
But I'll be separated from Sunian.

573
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:31,305
Then... ask him to come with you.

574
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:35,095
Sunian has worked for the Restoration Department for a long time.

575
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:37,075
It's a stable job now.

576
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:40,425
I don't want him to change his job because of me.

577
00:32:42,985 --> 00:32:45,184
Xue, this is an amazing opportunity.

578
00:32:45,184 --> 00:32:46,904
It'll be a shame if you miss it.

579
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:49,705
Think for yourself.

580
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:52,425
Don't squander it away for a man.

581
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:53,795
What happened?

582
00:32:53,795 --> 00:32:56,305
Did you squander your chance away for Wu Huan?

583
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,995
A quarrel?

584
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,094
That jerk.

585
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,054
He used to treat me like a princess.

586
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,965
And now, he throws a tantrum at me.

587
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:18,525
Shiyin, sometimes, I think you're...

588
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:20,504
Enough. Let's not talk about it.

589
00:33:20,505 --> 00:33:22,575
Let's go shopping.

590
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:28,995
What do you think? Is it good?

591
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:32,024
This place has the best lighting

592
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:34,665
and the best design in this area.

593
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:41,664
All right. I'll take it.

594
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:43,734
Sunian, I don't get you.

595
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,124
You're from Beijing.

596
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,275
Why don't you live with your parents?

597
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:50,474
Renting your own place

598
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:52,855
is the first step towards independence.

599
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:54,175
Indeed.

600
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:58,445
In other words, it's also a love nest.

601
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,724
Either way, I'm glad to see you move into the same area as me.

602
00:34:03,724 --> 00:34:06,565
When I'm bored, we can drink together.

603
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:09,845
When Yunjin moves here, you won't have time for me.

604
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:12,415
She won't move here anymore.

605
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,954
Haven't you been planning for it?

606
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,324
She can't let go of her cheongsam boutique.

607
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:21,784
I'm busy too so I won't have time for her when she's here.

608
00:34:27,785 --> 00:34:32,505
Is it because she would find out about it?

609
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,784
About what?

610
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:38,905
You have been getting real close with Xue Ning.

611
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:43,025
No one can compare to Yunjin.

612
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:45,605
Let's go. We should shop.

613
00:34:57,985 --> 00:34:59,355
You haven't even moved in,

614
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:02,095
yet you're planning to buy the daily necessities already.

615
00:35:02,865 --> 00:35:04,565
Just in case.

616
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:07,635
Fine.

617
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:10,665
Tell me. Is this your final decision?

618
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:11,904
What is?

619
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:14,845
You'll only marry her?

620
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:19,525
Yes.

621
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:22,885
I envy you.

622
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:26,635
You can marry your first love.

623
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:29,855
You can too, if you want to.

624
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:34,665
You need to act fast then.

625
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:39,095
When she graduates and enters the workforce,

626
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:41,675
she might change.

627
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,805
Sunian. Come.

628
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,625
Yes, Mr. Shao?

629
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,304
Come have dinner with us.

630
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:57,914
My wife has marinated the beef.

Your dad is waiting here already.

632
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,744
Maybe I'll come with Xue?

633
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,184
Xue won't be here.

634
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:07,275
She said the Chinese Olympic Committee needed a translator.

635
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:10,984
She filled in ad hoc. Oh, also!

636
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:14,144
She also bought you a shirt. It's in her room.

637
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:16,455
Okay. I'll put my thing down first.

638
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:18,605
Okay. Be quick then.

Didn't we agree that we would eat together tonight?

660
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:03,684
- I'm looking for Wu Huan
- Wu Huan?

661
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:05,695
You must be his girlfriend.

662
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:07,784
He's inside there. Go ahead.

663
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,275
Thanks.

664
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,185
Shiyin.

665
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:32,245
Why are you here?

666
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:36,855
- If I don't come to you, you won't come to me, is that it?
- No.

667
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:38,834
You won't coddle me when I'm mad?

668
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:43,434
That's not it. It's just I'm really overwhelmed with work here.

669
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,785
Using work as an excuse again.

670
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:54,645
Shinyin, this is not just a job.

671
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,355
It's my career.

672
00:38:57,355 --> 00:38:59,175
Your career?

673
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:04,085
This is not a career.

674
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,295
I found you this job anyway.

675
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:08,865
I'll find something better for you next time.

676
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:34,055
Then... we'll watch a movie once you're done?

677
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:41,195
I have to finish the tasks today.

678
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:52,055
All right. Work then.

679
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:59,955
<i>Is the Red Riding Hood home?</i>

680
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:03,744
Why are the windows closed?

681
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:06,934
The Red Riding Hood shouldn't open her windows for the Big Bad Wolf.

682
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,624
Fine.

683
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,825
The Big Bad Wolf will leave then.

684
00:41:12,515 --> 00:41:15,034
Sunian, give me a moment.

685
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:17,025
I'll get changed and come with you.

686
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,795
Ms. Yu.

687
00:41:36,185 --> 00:41:37,815
Why did you do that?

688
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:41,085
Do you like it?

689
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:44,155
Do you like it?

690
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,865
I love your drawings.

691
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:51,485
Do you still remember this?

692
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:54,714
Of course. I drew it for your birthday.

693
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:59,375
You said you would bring me to these places.

694
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:03,304
I drew many places.

695
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:05,605
Where do you want to go most?

696
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,295
Once you graduate, we'll go there together.

697
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:11,505
There are too many places I want to visit.

698
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:13,704
But every time I ask myself that question,

699
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,475
I get different answers.

700
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:28,374
Sunian, remember when you gave me this as a present,

701
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:30,705
I was preparing for the Two Plus One program?

702
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:33,475
Yes.

703
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:38,165
I can recall how determined you were

704
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:40,085
but you didn't pass the interview.

705
00:42:40,085 --> 00:42:44,985
What if I passed it?

706
00:42:46,555 --> 00:42:48,865
Would you want me to leave?

707
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:51,705
Back then, I would.

708
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,955
Now, I don't.

709
00:43:09,415 --> 00:43:10,905
What's the matter?

710
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:13,805
Nothing.

711
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:17,675
I was just curious.

712
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:23,295
It's late now. I have to pack my luggage.

713
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:26,355
Let's go back home. Go back home.

714
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,650
