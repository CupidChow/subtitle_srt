34
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,330
Mom.

35
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,490
Where did you put my Zhao Ling'er keychain?

36
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,280
Mom.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,980
Dad.

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,360
We will be moving out soon.

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,380
That house is big and luxurious.

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,099
If you're still around, you would have scolded me and said I was a spendthrift.

41
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,400
I won't listen to you this time.

Do you see?

44
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,650
Our son is very promising now.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,460
If you were still around, you would be very proud.

46
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,890
Son, salute your father.

47
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,580
Do you still remember how he taught you?

48
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,910
Dad, are you not willing to move because of Mom?

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
Even if we moved to a new place,

50
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,500
Mom's possessions and photos are still there. Isn't it the same?

51
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,360
How can it be the same?

52
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,589
The old house is no more.

53
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,959
What else can I keep in my memories?

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,359
All of you won't be coming back.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,869
The old house is no more.

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,630
What else can I keep in my memories?

57
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,700
Dad.

58
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,180
I wanted to tell you this later.

59
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,629
I've decided to come back and work here.

60
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,679
I've found a house in Beijing.

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,259
I'm just waiting for you to move there and stay with us.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,890
I hope you won't find us too annoying.

63
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,720
Are you telling the truth?

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,040
Will your son lie to you?

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,920
In the future, no matter where you are, I'll be there with you.

66
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,999
Don't touch that.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,159
Remove it after watching Shiyin's show at night.

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,960
Come on.

69
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,749
She was the one who opposed our daughter learning this.

70
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:23,890
Now, she is the one who wants to watch the show.

71
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,509
Didn't you oppose it as well?

72
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,030
You can just complain about me.

73
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,199
Mom, I'm going out for a while.

74
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,799
Why don't you leave after watching the show?

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,119
This is a rerun.

76
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,330
You have to watch it even if it's a rerun.

77
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,140
<i>[Demolish]</i>

78
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,580
Shiyin?

79
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,860
How's the progress?

80
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,950
I've packed most of everything.

81
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,800
Why are you here?

82
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,110
I was just passing by.

83
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,180
Where's your mother?

84
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,140
She is tidying up the new house.

85
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,310
How's it going between you and Tang Ya?

86
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,410
It's fine.

87
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,790
When's the wedding ceremony?

88
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,749
We won't be having a ceremony.

89
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,679
Just a simple banquet will do.

90
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,359
You need to treat her well.

91
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,500
Don't be so stingy.

92
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,060
What about you? Are you not going to find someone to take care of you?

93
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,429
There's no need.

94
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,189
I'm very independent now.

95
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,380
I can take care of myself.

96
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,500
That's great. That's great.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,220
I've been staying here for 20 years.

98
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,410
I suddenly feel reluctant...

99
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,940
to move away from this place.

100
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,610
Although your old house is gone,

101
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,730
your friends will still remain.

102
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,050
<i>[This place will be demolished soon. Dine here as soon as possible!]</i>

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,610
It's just the two of you today?

104
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,040
Shiyin moved.

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,420
Zhang Qi went abroad, too.

106
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,509
Madam, are our dishes ready?

107
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,649
They'll be served soon. See what you'd like to eat.

108
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,860
Go and do your things.

109
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,859
Sunian, this place will be demolished soon.

110
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,470
Why do they still have so many customers?

111
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,019
I should call my mother here and let her experience this bustling atmosphere.

112
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,309
My mother has been touching walls in the house every day.

113
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,620
It's so scary.

114
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,149
There's not much change with my father.

115
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,900
He is just spacing out for a longer time.

116
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:22,099
If this goes on, I won't be in the mood to get married anymore.

117
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:23,500
No way.

118
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,590
They are two different things.

119
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,250
Look how scared you are.

120
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,480
Have you ordered?

121
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,509
Mr. Qian? Why are you helping here?

122
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:36,340
Are you surprised? This is my restaurant.

123
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,530
Your restaurant?

124
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,380
I've joined forces with Ms. Mei.

125
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,440
Where's your hair?

126
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
I have love now so I no longer wear a wig.

127
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,069
I actually started getting bald when I was 17 years old.

128
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:56,089
Enough talk about me. When will you two get married?

129
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,269
We haven't decided yet.

130
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,869
Aren't we preparing for the relocation?

131
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,530
Don't hesitate.

132
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,479
You can hold your wedding reception here.

133
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,319
<i>Qian, hurry up!</i>

134
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm coming, Dear!

135
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,039
I'll give you a plate of lamb kidneys for free later.

136
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,550
Your wine.

137
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,140
Sunian,

138
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,029
why don't we organize our wedding at the alley?

139
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,089
We can even make our parents happy and let them keep some nice memories.

140
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,160
What do you think?

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,920
Sure. Anything you say.

142
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,009
In that case, we have to call and inform Shiyin and Zhang Qi.

143
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,430
Yes.

144
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,149
Zhang Qi.

145
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,900
Shiyin.

146
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,190
- We are getting married.
- We are getting married.

147
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,450
How is it?

148
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,720
Pretty, right?

149
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,580
Dear, your craftsmanship is incredible.

150
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,239
With this material and craftsmanship,

151
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,240
if it were being sold on the market,

152
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,619
it would be a six-figure price.

153
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,160
That's a must.

154
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,380
Unlike my wedding

155
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,629
where I only got a simple red uniform.

156
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,119
Since my daughter is getting married,

157
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
she must be pretty.

158
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,789
What do you mean by a simple uniform?

159
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,100
I wanted you to make a new dress but you wouldn't.

160
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,479
How expensive would that be?

161
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,599
Didn't we have to live our lives?

162
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:34,910
Fine. You are right. It's my fault again.

163
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,390
It's all my fault.

164
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,880
Don't touch it. You might scratch it.

165
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,999
Did you tell Xue about this dress?

166
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,950
No.

167
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,999
I want to give her a surprise.

168
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,649
You're keeping a secret?

169
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,109
Dad! Mom! I'm back.

170
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,019
- You're back?
- Mr. Shao. Ms. Yu.

171
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,789
Even the star is here.

172
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,529
Don't make fun of me.

173
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:58,619
I'm not making fun of you.

174
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,409
Both of us are watching that show of yours every day.

175
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:03,270
"Happiness First."

176
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,079
Shiyin, why are you free to come today?

177
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,280
I came here today to pick a wedding dress for Xue.

178
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,390
Pick a wedding dress?

179
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,759
Look.

180
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,139
This is a very amazing designer.

181
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:19,010
I'm close with him.

182
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,550
Can I even afford this?

183
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,869
There's no need to pay with my connections.

184
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,779
Don't worry. I'll deal with everything.

185
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,839
Think of it as your wedding gift.

186
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,900
That's very nice of you.

187
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,039
Mom, sit here. Let's pick one together.

188
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,669
I'm looking at it. I can see it from here.

189
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,550
Sure.

190
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,210
So pretty.

191
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,269
They are all Western dresses.

192
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,410
Western dresses are not as nice as Chinese dresses.

193
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,859
Aunt, Western dresses are better.

194
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,239
They are fashionable.

195
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,029
Chinese wedding dresses are so old-fashioned.

196
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,319
I don't like Chinese dresses, either.

197
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,009
It's better to wear Western dresses. Right?

198
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,030
Yes.

199
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,479
You can wear this.

200
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,119
I'll match a set of accessories for you.

201
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,029
Perfect.

202
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,959
Sunian will fall in love with you all over again.

203
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,440
There's no need. He loves me more than enough now.

204
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Are you trying to provoke me?

205
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,630
Xue, your mother made you...

206
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,359
What did she make?

207
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,140
Mantou.
[*Chinese steamed bun without any filling]

208
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,549
I made some dough today and steamed a few mantou.

209
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,019
It was a successful attempt.

210
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,079
Just go out and buy them if you want to eat them.

211
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,629
It's tiring to make it yourself.

212
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,259
How can you compare the ones outside

213
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,269
with the ones your mother made?

214
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,879
Yes. They are different. My mother's food is the best.

215
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,269
Let's listen to Xue.

216
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,750
We'll buy the ones from outside.

217
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,730
We'll buy them.

218
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,669
- This is prettier.
- Yes.

219
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,629
Indeed. This is pretty.

220
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,959
Yes. This is pretty.

221
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,290
This is pretty, too.

222
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,789
They are all pretty.

223
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,380
Let's go to the shop and try it on in the afternoon.

224
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,050
Sure.

225
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,780
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,030
Hello.

227
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,950
Bi Lan. Zhang Qi's ex-girlfriend.

228
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,250
Ex-girlfriend?

229
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,710
Let's take a seat first.

230
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,379
Both of you are...

231
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:25,740
- Both of us are...
- Let me say it.

232
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,909
Although we were in a contractual relationship,

233
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,509
I got serious after that.

234
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,880
Zhang Qi broke up with me on the plane.

235
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,410
Also, he hid in the toilet after he broke up with me.

236
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,869
He refused to consult me.

237
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,040
The word "consult" is a bit...

238
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,329
Mr. Zheng, have you experienced

239
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,520
being laughed at by everyone on the plane?

240
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,439
No.

241
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,669
I hope you won't ever experience it in your life

242
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,659
because it will make you regret ever being born in this world.

243
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,869
Don't worry.

244
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,240
Both of us are friends now.

245
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,769
I've also realized that even though I have

246
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:10,050
a double doctorate in psychology and sociology,

247
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,059
I still can't avoid the fact that I'm being played by a jerk.

248
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:15,500
The word "jerk" is...

249
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,770
To show that I'm generous, I even flew here

250
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,259
and pretended to be his girlfriend.

251
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,869
Don't you have a seminar here?

252
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,549
Let me remind you.

253
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,149
I might regret my decision anytime.

254
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,060
You better be obedient.

255
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,389
Forgive me for bringing this up when we've just met.

256
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,789
Zhang Qi mentioned you to me.

257
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,574
I have a good impression of you.

258
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:42,274
In the future, if you have any psychological problems,

259
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,464
you can come to me anytime.

260
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:46,065
Are you purposely cursing him?

261
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:54,385
Why don't we make an order first?

262
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:59,694
Can I visit the kitchen?

263
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,264
I'm a bit of a clean freak.

264
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:03,755
I want to see if this place is hygienic.

265
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,555
Be my guest.

266
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:15,305
Where are you going?

267
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:19,654
Now you know how hard it's been for me, right?

268
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:22,674
Since you broke up with her, why did you bring her back?

269
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,144
How dare you say that?

270
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:26,034
You are getting married but I don't even have a partner.

271
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:28,525
My mother will nag me.

272
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,694
I'm going to the kitchen. I hope she doesn't argue with the chef.

273
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:32,445
You can order first.

274
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,655
It's been so long since I last visited you.

275
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:45,985
I'm sure you missed me.

276
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,364
<i>[Ms. Jin Ning's Grave]</i>

277
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:56,194
I bought you flowers.

278
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:57,884
Your favorite.

279
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,445
Do they smell nice?

280
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:02,565
I came here today

281
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:05,215
to say something important to you.

282
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:07,455
I'm sure you won't be happy

283
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:10,525
about the first thing.

284
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,925
We will be relocated soon.

285
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:15,075
We are moving to a new house.

286
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:19,694
Dongge and Shao are still living across from our house.

287
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:22,864
Tianbao and Zhang Ling aren't far away from us either.

288
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:26,125
We can visit them whenever we like.

289
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,475
As for the second thing,

290
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:32,545
you will be very happy to hear it.

291
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,264
Sunian is getting married.

292
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,995
Can you guess who the bride is?

293
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:39,424
It's Xue. Yes.

294
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,824
You guessed correctly. It's Xue.

295
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,225
Didn't you like Xue the most?

296
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:47,955
Both of them...

297
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:51,545
will get married tomorrow.

298
00:17:52,665 --> 00:17:55,804
I saw both of them getting busy the last two days.

299
00:17:55,804 --> 00:18:00,125
I thought of you especially when I saw Xue.

300
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,715
How nice would it be if you were around?

301
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,614
I've told myself.

302
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:11,904
I've been telling myself on the way

303
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,714
that today is a happy day and I can't cry.

304
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:16,665
I have to tell you something happy.

305
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,095
Don't cry.

306
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:24,535
I should be happy.

307
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,775
Our son is getting married.

308
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:36,165
When they have children in the future,

309
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:39,375
what names should we give them?

310
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,965
You are well-educated.

311
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,464
If you have a name in mind,

312
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:46,085
just tell me in my dream.

313
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,805
I brought this for you.

314
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,464
Wait for a while longer.

315
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:21,504
When I've seen our grandchildren,

316
00:19:21,504 --> 00:19:24,165
I will go and accompany you.

317
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,565
I know you are lonely over there.

318
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:32,480
You are used to being taken care of.

319
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,350
♫ <i>Carved into the days long gone</i> ♫

320
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:44,400

321

♫ <i>Those songs in the past</i> ♫

322
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:49,054
No. It's too slanted.

323
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,504
More towards this side.

324
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:51,814
It's covering the sides.

325
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,885
- Look at you.
- No.

326
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:53,704
Lin.

327
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:55,774
Come and take a look. Help me to take a look. Is it slanted?

328
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:56,534
- Sure.
- How is it?

329
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:58,094
Okay. That's good.

330
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:58,704
Just right.

331
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:00,275
Just right?

332
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,655
Seriously.

333
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:04,054
Put the lights over there.

334
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:05,744
Adjust the flowers over there.

335
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,575
Okay.

336
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:10,274
Siyuan, go back.

337
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:11,424
Your son is still young.

338
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:13,374
Qiaomu is there, don't worry.

339
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,564
Qiaomu specifically told me

340
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,705
to come and give you all a hand.

341
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,934
Have you decided on your son's name?

342
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:23,294
Yes. His name is Dou Yanxi.

343
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:25,495
My master named him.

344
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:29,565
Great name. Yanxi.

345
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:32,534
"True talents always shine through."
<i>(From the Records of the Grand Historian)</i>

346
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:33,975
Yes. That's it.

347
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,464
What a nice name.

348
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,054
Mr. Shao! Where do I put this flower?

349
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:39,424
Put it... Let me do it.

350
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:40,504
Go. Leave this place to me.

351
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,574
Sure.

352
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,065
Coming.

353
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:45,855
Come. Let's get to work, everyone.

354
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:49,935
I'm getting married.

355
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,795
I'm really getting married.

356
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:06,415
Dad, you're still awake?

357
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:10,615
My daughter is getting married tomorrow.

358
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,805
I'm here to see her.

359
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:17,224
What's wrong? Is something on your mind?

360
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:24,625
Suddenly, I feel afraid.

361
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:29,305
What's there to be afraid of?

362
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:32,995
I'm afraid both of us

363
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:34,685
will change after getting married.

364
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:37,535
Sunian might change.

365
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:40,294
I heard many people loved each other a lot

366
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:41,854
before they got married.

367
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:45,414
After that, they will argue every day and feel annoyed.

368
00:21:45,414 --> 00:21:47,555
There will definitely be changes.

369
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:50,044
You will change. He will also change.

370
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:54,544
Both of you will go from lovers to family members.

371
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:57,455
It won't be as romantic as before.

372
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:02,075
However, both of you will face these changes calmly.

373
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:04,294
What about you and Mom?

374
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:07,424
What are the changes before and after you got married?

375
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:12,645
Your mother and I loved each other a lot before we got married.

376
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,755
After we got married,

377
00:22:15,805 --> 00:22:17,415
it got more exciting.

378
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:18,995
How is it exciting?

379
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:20,464
She hits and scolds you every day.

380
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,535
Is that exciting to you?

381
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:27,344
Many things will happen when you're in a relationship.

382
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,804
My relationship with your mother is considered complicated.

383
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:32,065
Tell me.

384
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:35,095
Will Sunian and I become like you two

385
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,054
after I marry him?

386
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,664
Quarreling every day.

387
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:40,854
Will he find me annoying

388
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:43,645
just like how you feel annoyed by Mom?

389
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,505
I don't feel annoyed by your mother.

390
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:47,534
We might argue

391
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,025
but it won't do if I don't get to see her.

392
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:56,294
They say marriage is like a shelter.

393
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:57,374
I don't think so.

394
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,534
I think it's like a safety belt in a car.

395
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,704
Once you get in the car, it will tie you up.

396
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:07,424
But you'll realize if this person is reliable,

397
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:09,904
you'll feel safer when he ties you up tightly.

398
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:13,565
In the future, when all kinds of trouble hit you,

399
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:16,374
you will realize it's quite nice

400
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,405
to have this person with you.

401
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:24,565
I'm content if both of us

402
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:25,994
can be like you and my mom.

403
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:27,625
Don't even think about it.

404
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,625
Our relationship is one of a kind.

405
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,325
Look at that smug face of yours.

406
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,595
Is Mom asleep?

407
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:37,424
She's been busy all day. I asked her to rest early.

408
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,415
Xue.

409
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,385
Let me show you something.

410
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:46,955
What is it? Why are you being so mysterious?

411
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,430
<i>[Bless]</i>

412
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,425
Xue! Today is your wedding day!

413
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:13,615
Why aren't you up yet?

414
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:18,275
Mom, it's only 6:00 a.m.

415
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:20,255
Your wedding dress isn't here yet.

416
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:24,115
Call Shiyin and ask her what's going on.

417
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,145
Why should I call Shiyin?

418
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,864
I canceled the dress.

419
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,854
You canceled it? Are you not getting married?

420
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:33,225
What will you be wearing?

421
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:35,714
Why do you have to act on your whim?

422
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,005
Are you trying to make me anxious?

423
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:39,034
Mom, it's fine.

424
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:40,665
It's not like I don't have one already.

425
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:43,655
What are you wearing then?

426
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:45,735
I'm wearing this.

427
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:55,045
Thanks to Dad, I get to wear this dress made by the imperial weaver.

428
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:56,344
In the past,

429
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:57,824
this could only be worn by princesses.

430
00:24:57,825 --> 00:24:59,184
Exactly.

431
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:02,914
Which designer has better craftsmanship than your mother?

432
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:05,275
No.

433
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,835
I think my dress

434
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:10,855
is not as pretty as the western dress.

435
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:12,624
Where's your confidence?

436
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,135
You're not acting like my wife.

437
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:18,964
Mom, you know which dress suits your daughter best.

438
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:22,984
Who else in this world understands me more than you?

439
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:25,555
I am wearing this dress.

440
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,055
You brat.

441
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:35,554
Here. Here, have some sweets.

442
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:37,835
Drink some water.

443
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:40,345
Thank you.

444
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:43,314
- Congratulations.
- Ms. Li. Ms. Liu.

445
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:47,114
- Congratulations.
- Sit down.

446
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:48,864
This is an auspicious event for all of us.

447
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:50,554
Indeed.

448
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:51,824
Do you need any more help?

449
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,074
No. There are so many people here.

450
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:54,384
Mr. Shao. Ms. Yu.

451
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:55,904
Shiyin, you're here.

452
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:56,864
Where's Xue?

453
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:57,664
She's in her room.

454
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:58,514
- Okay.
- Go.

455
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,134
- Hurry up. This way.
- Please come in.

456
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:03,234
Makeup artists.

457
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:05,034
Xue!

458
00:26:05,035 --> 00:26:06,184
You're here?

459
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:07,474
It looks nice, right?

460
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:09,234
Today, I've invited

461
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,624
my personal makeup artist team.

462
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,314
What a big team.

463
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:14,424
My buddy is getting married. This is no joke.

464
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:16,424
You and Sunian will be tying the knot.

465
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,384
This is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

466
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:18,904
You need to be as pretty as an angel.

467
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,274
I'm just getting married

468
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:21,904
and not hosting a live broadcast.

469
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:23,994
You're making me so nervous.

470
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:25,184
What's there to be nervous about?

471
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,274
Later, there will also be a special guest.

472
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,314
Who is it?

473
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:30,954
A host from my channel will be your emcee.

474
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:32,664
What programs does he host?

475
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:33,794
Law programs.

476
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:36,714
Can a law program host be an emcee for the wedding?

477
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:38,085
Enough talk.

478
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,985
Come. Dress her up.

479
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:46,424
Where are you going? Your hair's not done yet. It's time to put on hair spray.

480
00:26:46,424 --> 00:26:47,835
No. It's too greasy.

481
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
I'm telling you. Only others will make it greasy.

482
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,864
I'm not bluffing about my skills.

483
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:53,474
If I didn't study for a Ph.D. but hairdressing instead,

484
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:55,384
my net worth would be in the millions.

485
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:57,424
I advise you to change your career then.

486
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:58,584
Don't humiliate the academic world.

487
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:00,344
Enough. Just be content.

488
00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:02,565
You may look better than me for just this day only.

489
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:04,505
Come. Lower your head.

490
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:14,184
Xue, this is perfect.

491
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:16,314
If I were a man, I'd marry you.

492
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:17,615
Xue.

493
00:27:17,615 --> 00:27:18,514
Tang Ya.

494
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:20,315
- Shiyin.
- Tang Ya.
- Long time no see.

495
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:22,285
It's been a while.

496
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:25,284
Xue, you look so pretty today.

497
00:27:25,284 --> 00:27:26,595
Thank you.

498
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:27,835
Where's Wu Huan?

499
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:30,325
He is helping Mr. Shao greet the guests.

500
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:39,825
I heard you two got married.

501
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,325
But we haven't had a ceremony yet.

502
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:43,074
Congratulations.

503
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,465
Thank you.

504
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:46,554
I'm going out to help first.

505
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:48,074
I'll wait for your amazing appearance later.

506
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:50,254
Sure. See you later.

507
00:27:52,115 --> 00:27:54,424
I thought both of you would start a fight.

508
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:56,045
It scared me.

509
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,274
Why should we fight?

510
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,485
I'm sincerely giving them my blessing.

511
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:01,554
Sit down. Don't think about nonsense.

512
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:04,564
I'm going to guard the door so they won't sneak in.

513
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:09,225
What's with the rush?

514
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:11,114
You'll be seeing her every day for the rest of your life.

515
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:12,945
It's fine not to see her now.

516
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:19,085
I have yet to see her in a wedding dress.

517
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:37,904
Groom.

518
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:39,274
- The groom is here.
- Thank you.

519
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:40,775
The groom.

520
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:51,145
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

521
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:53,275
Wait for a while.

522
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,075
It's not that simple.

523
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:58,785
Open the door, I'm from the bride's family.

524
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,664
Say something nice first.

525
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:07,144
For example, who is this world's most beautiful woman?

526
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:10,015
Xue.

527
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,725
Not opening.

528
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:17,875
Of course, it's the world's most beautiful,

529
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:21,054
cutest, prettiest, and most generous Lin Shiyin's...

530
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,754
That's more like it.

531
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:24,825
Best friend, Shao Xue.

532
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:27,774
- Zhang Qi!
- Zhang Qi!

533
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:29,904
What are you doing?

534
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:33,094
Sunian, I saw the bride earlier than you.

535
00:29:33,094 --> 00:29:34,285
Are you angry?

536
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:35,830
Zhang Qi, open the door.

537
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,000
<i>Zhang Qi, open the door.</i>

538
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:39,485
What are you doing?

539
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:41,944
- Getting my revenge.
- What revenge?

540
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:44,375
Zheng Sunian stole my first love.

541
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,325
Do you think I should get my revenge?

542
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,285
Zhang Qi, just wait.

543
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:52,384
Sunian, I have something to say to Xue.

544
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:54,514
If you agree, knock once.

545
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,425
If you don't, knock twice.

546
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,255
Xue.

547
00:30:15,715 --> 00:30:17,315
I liked you.

548
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,935
My affection for you was no less than Sunian's.

549
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:22,085
If I didn't give up in the past,

550
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:24,415
you might even be marrying me now.

551
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,115
But I want to ask you.

552
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:30,745
Have you ever...

553
00:30:31,975 --> 00:30:34,045
fancied me...

554
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:37,555
even just a little?

555
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,944
Zhang Qi, I'm useless in this sense.

556
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:58,085
I've only fancied Sunian ever since I was little.

557
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,945
You are my best friend.

558
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:02,075
Our relationship is so firm.

559
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:05,785
I can't even imagine us not being buddies.

560
00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:08,895
You are very important to me.

561
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:12,144
You are so important that I will rescue you first

562
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:15,355
if both you and Sunian fall into the water.

563
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:18,595
Sunian.

564
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,505
<i>You hear that, Sunian?</i>

565
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:23,624
Because Sunian can swim but you can't.

566
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,734
I'm good at swimming now. I don't need you to save me.

567
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:29,774
Come. Let me hug you.

568
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:33,595
Promise me. You need to be happy.

569
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:53,765
Where's Lin Shiyin?

570
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:54,935
She went to look for an ax.

571
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:56,424
Is she chopping the door or me?

572
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:59,274
She's chopping the door. I'm chopping you.

573
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,805
Treat her well.

574
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:03,615
Go in.

575
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,255
You don't say.

576
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:20,405

Clients?

Is this emcee reliable?

604
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:55,384
- It's been hidden for years.
- He is Shiyin's friend.

605
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:57,474
He waited patiently to protect his love.

606
00:33:57,475 --> 00:34:00,485
He searched everywhere but the person he searched for was unexpectedly...

607
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:02,424
Is this emcee at the wrong place?

608
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:03,994
- After more than 20 years...
- What do you mean?

What is he talking about?

It's not bad. It's quite funny.

Xue.

629
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:31,185
A long time ago,

630
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:35,095
Master told me...

631
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,805
to find a girl like a hibiscus flower.

632
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,835
I didn't understand at first.

633
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,325
Until I first saw you...

634
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:55,065
wearing a cheongsam and walking towards me...

635
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:58,655
<i>Sunian.</i>

636
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:04,965
I suddenly understood.

637
00:37:09,985 --> 00:37:13,405
You are like the hibiscus that blooms in my life.

638
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:19,365
I always thought you needed my protection

639
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:21,935
so I worked hard to grow up.

640
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:25,905
But actually,

641
00:37:27,155 --> 00:37:29,745
you have always been in front of me...

642
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,695
while guiding me forward.

643
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:35,974
<i>The first step of growth is to reap what you sow.</i>

644
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:38,104
<i>No. I mean being independent.</i>

645
00:37:38,104 --> 00:37:40,624
<i>Think about it. Doing it yourself. How exciting is it?</i>

646
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,785
<i>You've violated the three big taboos at once.</i>

647
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:46,625
You are the person who brought me out of sadness

648
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,305
>when I was at my saddest and most helpless moment.

649
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:55,974
<i>Don't keep your sadness inside.</i>

650
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,315
<i>Just let it all out.</i>

00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:00,715
<i>I'll lend you my shoulder.</i>

652
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:04,705
<i>I also want to leave something to the world.</i>

653
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:08,175
<i>I hope what I left behind</i>

<i>can be seen by the people of the world after a hundred years.</i>

<i>No matter what you choose,</i>

00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:16,335
<i>I will also be by your side and accompany you.</i>

657
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,175
You were the one...

658
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:20,945
who gave me the courage...

659
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,355
to become my ideal self.

660
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:27,985
You accompanied me when I was growing up in the past.

661
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:29,695
Now, let me...

662
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:33,415
grow old with you for the rest of our lives.

663
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:35,985
All right?

664
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:48,225
Sunian.

665
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:51,924
Actually, I was quite scared

666
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:54,605
during the days before the wedding.

667
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:56,475
I was afraid...

668
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,385
that we would change after we got married.

669
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:04,745
I was afraid that you would change.

670
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,675
But when we were

671
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:12,075
holding our hands and walking toward here,

672
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:15,165
I suddenly didn't feel afraid anymore.

673
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:17,845
I know we will change.

674
00:39:18,795 --> 00:39:21,935
We will only talk about our daily lives,

675
00:39:21,935 --> 00:39:24,875
we will nitpick,

676
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:30,555
we will argue because of something minor.

677
00:39:30,555 --> 00:39:33,735
We will get angry because of each other's changes.

678
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:38,775
But we will be together for such a long time.

679
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:41,185
I believe...

680
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:46,085
change will only bring our hearts closer.

681
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:48,755
In the past,

682
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:51,255
I didn't understand...

683
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:56,075
what was so nice about growing old hand in hand.

684
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:59,005
I always thought...

685
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,635
it would be so boring

686
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:07,045
to stay in one place with only one person

687
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:09,595
forever.

688
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:13,395
But I finally understand now.

689
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:18,895
Because even if I have the world's excitement,

690
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,905
it's not as good...

691
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:26,485
as you being by my side and accompanying me.

00:41:07,475 --> 00:41:10,105

Dou Yanxi. Zheng Anning.

708
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:46,635
Why did both of you run around again?

709
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:48,984
It's fine, Miss. My father is working inside.

710
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:51,104
My father is also working inside.

711
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:54,505
You still can't run around as you wish. What if you get lost?

712
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:58,284
I'm taking all of you to visit the Restoration Department. All right?

713
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:00,784
- All right!
- Come.

714
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,485
Slowly.

715
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:08,125
