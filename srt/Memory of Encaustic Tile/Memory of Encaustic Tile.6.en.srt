Sunian, do you want me to stay because you're afraid that I'll forget about you?

Maybe.

Why are you more confident than the doctors?

323
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,768
Because idiots are always lucky.

324
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,077
Sunian, I suddenly feel like being a doctor.

It's that hard to get into one?

Are there any cases where someone was accepted

329
00:21:01,078 --> 00:21:03,117
due to their innate talents?

330
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:05,007
What talent do you have?

331
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:08,268
I'm very talkative. I can comfort people well.

332
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,637
Patients need to rest in a quiet environment.

333
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,797
That's because all doctors don't like to talk.

It was so crowded. I had to queue for a long time.

It's several kilometers away from home.

Even so, I had no choice but to go.

You guys must wear face masks when you're going outside.

You must wash your hands when you come back.

You may not know about this. They're putting everyone who has a fever in the same room.

What if one of them is infected?

401
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:51,447
The virus can be transmitted through the air!

What if he's infected? What if...

403

Calm down for now. There are doctors in the hospital, right?

In this alley, we have the old and the weak.

when we entered and exited the hospital.

492

The virus has an incubation period.

Yeah. What should we do if everyone else is infected because of you?

My daughter is on the frontline! She's saving the weak and helping the injured!

I agree for Liu to go home and pack her things.

505

She's risking her life in the hospital. Do you think it's easy?

506
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:13,608
That's right. I agree that she should come home to stay.

507
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,117
We need to believe in science. The hospital has examined her.

00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,666
Okay, come in.

644
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,300
Mr. Sun, I'm sure your father must be so happy that you're back.

645
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:37,295
Will you stay here for a long time this time?

646
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:41,016
Yeah. But I'm not staying at home.

647
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:42,986
Where are you going?

648
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:45,425
I can only rest for two days.

649
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:48,596
I'll have to move to the science school two days from now to participate in virus research.

650
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:51,925
After that, I'll head to the frontline to treat critical patients.

651
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:53,425
Isn't that very dangerous?

652
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:56,335
Yeah. Can't you just do the research without heading to the frontline?

653
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:58,996
I can only make the correct judgment

654
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:00,825
after I obtain enough experience from the frontline.

655
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:04,325
Here you go. Try the coffee I brought back.

656
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:06,676
- Thank you, Mr. Sun.
- Thank you, Mr. Sun.

657
00:36:08,826 --> 00:36:10,946
It smells so nice!

658
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:14,626
Is it bitter?

659
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:20,025
A little, but after I drink it, I sense a faint fragrance.

660
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:24,295
Sunian, how about you?

661
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:27,286
Coffee... is not my thing.

662
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:30,196
Sunian loves Jasmine tea.

663
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,045
Why does he have the same preference as my father?

664
00:36:32,045 --> 00:36:33,545
Mr. Sun, was going abroad fun?

665
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:35,135
Are you going abroad?

666
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:37,465
There's a chance for me to study abroad.

667
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:40,316
But it's not determined yet.

668
00:36:40,316 --> 00:36:43,805
If you want to go abroad by yourself, you must be careful.

669
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:45,175
Be careful of what?

670
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:47,465
Different regions have different cultural habits.

671
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,835
You must do your research before you go there.

672
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:52,565
Will she face any danger if she goes abroad?

673
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:53,775
No.

674
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,465
After all, their society is governed by law.

675
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:57,815
Will there be any inconvenience regarding daily life?

676
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,025
Not really.

677
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:02,735
But regarding food, I'm still not used to the food out there.

678
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:05,305
- Aren't there any delicacies out there?
- You'll get tired of them if you have them every day.

679
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:07,875
That's why I've been cooking my own food all these years.

680
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:13,315
By the way, Xue, you must learn to cook before you go abroad.

681
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,935
I'm done for.

682
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:17,556
I don't even know how to make instant noodles.

683
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:32,235
Mr. Sun, you can resume your work.

684
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,126
We'll go home first.

685
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,985
Remember to take the food.

686
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:38,376
Okay.

687
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:41,005
Bye, Mr. Sun. Thank you, Mr. Sun.

688
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:42,925
- Bye.
- Bye.

689
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:45,025
See you, Mr. Sun.

690
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:46,766
Be careful!

691
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:58,275
Sunian, you should keep these snacks.

692
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,625
If I take them back, my mother will surely confiscate them.

693
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,545
She'll only let me have a little during festive occasions.

694
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:05,485
It's because you don't know how to control yourself.

695
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:06,925
You deserve it.

696
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:09,905
How dare you say that? You used to keep lollipops in your pocket.

697
00:38:09,905 --> 00:38:11,255
You don't do that anymore.

698
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,855
Two of your teeth have already decayed.

699
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,466
You should stop eating sweet food.

700
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,136
Stop eating them.

701
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:21,485
I'm only taking one.

702
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:23,606
No means no.

703
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:26,286
Why do you have so many cassette tapes here?

704
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:30,615
All of these belong to my mother.

705
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:33,805
She has too many things, that's why she keeps them here.

706
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:38,795
This cover looks pretty good.

707
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:41,716
This is From Afar.

708
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:45,405
Is this the song you asked the girl to sing during Ms. Jin Ning's birthday?

709
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:49,945
That's right. My mother said she'd listen to this song

710
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:52,746
whenever she missed my father.

711
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,996
So there's a story to it.

712
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:06,865
Did Ms. Jin Ning write this?

713
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,346
That's right. Have a seat.

714
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:25,710
What do the lyrics mean?

715
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,400
♫ <i>I stare at my hometown from a distance</i> ♫

716
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,009
♫ <i>Covered by thick fog</i> ♫

717
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:41,080
♫ <i>Whenever the wind blows</i> ♫

718
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,485
♫ <i>The malt...</i> ♫

719
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:44,065
Do you like it?

720
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:46,375
Yeah, it's nice.

721
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:49,155
I thought it was a great song when I first heard it.

722
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:52,565
The original version is even better.

723
00:39:52,565 --> 00:39:54,345
You don't listen to songs usually.

724
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:56,345
I didn't expect you to like such songs.

725
00:39:56,346 --> 00:39:57,505
♫ <i>Just beside the road by the hill</i> ♫

726
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:59,345
I usually listen to pop music.

727
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:01,195
This song is different.

728
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:03,899
It feels special.

729
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:08,129
♫ <i>I missed it very much</i> ♫

730
00:40:08,129 --> 00:40:09,465
It's melodious.

731
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:13,345
It's just like she's telling a story.

732
00:40:13,346 --> 00:40:16,490
♫ <i>From day till night</i> ♫

733
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:22,300
♫ <i>You longed</i> ♫

734
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,130
♫ <i>Longed for the letters</i> ♫

735
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,780
♫ <i>From your faraway friends</i> ♫

736
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,490
♫ <i>From day till night</i> ♫

737
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:45,310
♫ <i>You longed</i> ♫

738
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,406
♫ <i>Longed for the letters</i> ♫

739
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,495
<i>Everyone, we are at the designated hospital</i>

740
00:40:52,495 --> 00:40:54,726
<i>for SARS patients in Xiaotangshan.</i>

741
00:40:54,726 --> 00:40:57,095
<i>Now, it's 8:30 p.m.</i>

742
00:40:57,096 --> 00:41:01,975
<i>The second batch of patients has departed from 13 other hospitals.</i>

743
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:04,875
<i>Until 11:30 p.m. last night, as Beijing's military work together with the local government...</i>

744
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,465
Is Mr. Sun going to this hospital as well?

745
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,135
He has already gone there.

746
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,345
He'll be okay, right?

747
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:16,215
The doctors who are in that hospital are risking their lives.

748
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:18,385
But the doctors are exceptional.

749
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:21,596
I'm sure they can protect themselves.

750
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:23,795
They're too close to the virus.

751
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:25,135
That's right.

752
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:27,905
They have to wear a protective suit every day.

753
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:29,505
It's very inconvenient for them.

754
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:32,406
I just hope they won't fall sick.

755
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:37,795
Touchwood! Bad things don't happen when I say them.

756
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,385
Good things happen when I say them.

757
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:43,085
Besides, Baiqing is such a kind person, I'm sure he'll be fine.

758
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,255
I'm sure he'll be fine.

759
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:47,615
But I'm sure...

760
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:49,680
his father must be so worried about him.

761
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,345
I think we should care for Mr. Sun.

762
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,505
He may look calm, but I'm sure he's very anxious.

763
00:41:59,506 --> 00:42:02,555
That's for sure, but the old man is very stubborn.

764
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:06,015
He doesn't allow us to visit him. He even forbids us from talking about it.

765
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:08,905
Why don't I visit Mr. Sun?

766
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,175
He won't scold me.

767
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:11,865
Zhang Qi was just discharged from the hospital as well.

768
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:13,905
I'll call Zhang Qi and Sunian to join me.

769
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,276
We'll go and liven things up.

770
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,085
Good idea.

771
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:20,825
I'll make some braised beef with soy sauce for you.

772
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:22,726
You can bring it to him tomorrow.

773
00:42:27,576 --> 00:42:30,255
My daughter is all grown up now.

774
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,096
But of course.

775
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:33,825
<i>There were three death cases.</i>

776
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:37,156
<i>Eight new suspected cases.</i>

777
00:42:37,156 --> 00:42:39,865
<i>Shanxi has recorded 29 new cases,</i>

778
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,135
<i>including two medical personnel.</i>

779
00:42:41,136 --> 00:42:43,736
- Mr. Sun!
<i>- One of them has fully recovered.</i>

780
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:44,985
Mr. Sun!

781
00:42:44,986 --> 00:42:46,840
What did you have for lunch?

782
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,565
What did you have for lunch?

783
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,766
Don't tell me you haven't had lunch yet?

784
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,135
I'm not hungry.

785
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:55,865
Sir, don't go on a diet.

786
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,515
- It'll make you look older.
- I'm already old enough.

787
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:01,405
Mr. Sun, my mother made some braised beef with soy sauce for you.

788
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:03,425
Would you try some?

789
00:43:03,426 --> 00:43:04,865
He still needs to have rice, noodles, and stuff.

790
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:07,085
Mr. Sun, my father taught me how to cook.

791
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,545
Please let me cook for you if you trust me.

792
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:13,225
- Okay.
- Let's go then.

793
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:14,926
Mr. Sun, let's play chess.

794
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,616
Chess?

795
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:19,346
Sure.

796
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,246
Sure.

797
00:43:36,986 --> 00:43:41,036
Sunian, when did you learn this?

798
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,825
It's been some time.

799
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:44,715
You better watch closely.

800
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:46,865
You can cook it for yourself when it's necessary.

801
00:43:46,866 --> 00:43:49,355
Slow down then. Show me.

802
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,345
First, you need to boil the water.

803
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:56,195
After that, put in the noodles.

804
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:58,645
Wait for four to five minutes. The noodles will be ready.

805
00:43:58,645 --> 00:43:59,985
Take them out.

806
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:02,465
By the way, the cooking time is very important.

807
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:03,735
If you cook them for too long,

808
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:04,865
they'll become mushy.

809
00:44:04,866 --> 00:44:07,536
If you cook them for a short time, they'll be raw in the middle.

810
00:44:08,506 --> 00:44:10,056
Can you remember it?

811
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,810
Mr. Sun.

812
00:44:17,466 --> 00:44:19,395
Mr. Sun?

813
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,236
It's your turn.

814
00:44:21,236 --> 00:44:22,936
It's my turn?

815
00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:30,315
Mr. Sun.

816
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:33,865
Here, try the noodles Sunian made for you.

817
00:44:33,865 --> 00:44:37,256
Okay. Okay.

818
00:44:59,676 --> 00:45:01,465
Shall we...

819
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:04,495
Sir, please enjoy your meal. We'll go home first.

820
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:09,186
That will do.

821
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:11,055
- That will do.
- Let's go.

822
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:14,905
Mr. Sun, remember to have your noodles.

823
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:17,755
- Bye, Mr. Sun.
- Okay.

824
00:45:17,755 --> 00:45:19,095
Remember to eat them.

825
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:21,785
- Bye.
- Bye.

826
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:34,865
<i>Dad, forgive me for my inauspicious words.</i>

827
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:37,476
<i>If anything happens to me,</i>

828
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:41,290
<i>please take good care of yourself.</i>

829
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,690
