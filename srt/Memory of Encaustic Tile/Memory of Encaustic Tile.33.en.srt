34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,300
Sunian didn't want you to pass on another great opportunity because of him.

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,500
That's why he decided to break up with you.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,400
He was very upset, too.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,100
He only attended those blind dates

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,900
because he didn't want to upset his dad.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
Even though it was him

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
who proposed to break up,

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,800
it was I who decided to leave.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
We never talked to each other

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,600
even once when I was abroad.

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
I came back here of my own volition, too.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
Now that he's leading a stable life,

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,500
I don't want to intrude.

47
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Also, maybe he doesn't love me anymore.

48
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
That, you'll need to ask him yourself.

49
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,800
Don't worry about us.

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
All right. Take care of yourself

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,000
for the next few days then.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Where are you going?

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,400
I'll be on a business trip.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
I have to go now.

55
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,000
Think about what to do with Sunian.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
See you.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Bye, Xue.

58
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Hello?

59
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,500
- Hey, Sunian.
- I gave everything you sent to me to our neighbors already.

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,800
They all love it.

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Sunian, Xue is in a pickle now

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
but she won't let me tell you.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
What happened?

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>She's gone back to China already.</i>

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
What happened?

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
Mo Hai swindled money from the company and pushed Xue to be the scapegoat.

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
<i>Her visa application is now on hold</i>

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
<i>and her bank account is frozen now.</i>

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Has everything been resolved then?

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
<i>You don't know the worst yet.</i>

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
She fainted due to anxiety.

72
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,300
And when she was hospitalized, she found out she was sick.

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,000
<i>I was shocked when I saw her.</i>

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
<i>Her face was pale and her breathing was weak.</i>

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,300
<i>She's back in China for surgery.</i>

76
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,600
Give me the address.

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay. Will do.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
Hello?

79
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,700
What did you forget again?

80
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
Xue's voice?

81
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,300
Hello?

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
How are you?

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,100
What kind of surgery? What kind of sickness?

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,900
I'm fine.

85
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
You're still lying to me.

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,300
I'm not.

87
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,100
I'm fine. Go back.

88
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,600
If I go back now, who can take care of you?

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,100
I can take good care of myself. Just go.

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,800
You have been scammed and you're now very sick.

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,800
How is that taking good care of yourself?

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,200
I said I can.

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,800
Who are you to meddle in my business?

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,600
Because I'm your Sunian.

95
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Wasn't Sunian here just now?

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Xue is sick?

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,200
When did Xue come back?

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Ask them.

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Do your parents know you're back?

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,000
No.

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
You haven't been home for many years...

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,900
and yet you hid your return from them.

103
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,500
Have you considered their feelings?

104
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,600
My parents will just scold me...

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,700
if they see the way I am now.

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm scared of going back home.

107
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Let them scold you.

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,100
I will comfort you.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
Sunian.

110
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
How have you been...

111
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,000
all these years?

112
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,600
It's been great living alone abroad.

113
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,900
I cooked alone.

114
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
I watched movies alone.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I shopped alone.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,200
I went to the doctor alone.

117
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,500
I...

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,400
I won't let you be alone anymore.

119
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,500
Then why...

120
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,400
did you let me leave alone?

121
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,600
Because you wanted to explore the world.

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,200
Now that you have seen it,

123
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,100
listened to it, and experienced it,

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,700
I won't...

125
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
let go of you anymore.

126
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,500
Sunian.

127
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,100
I have missed you so much.

128
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,400
When I was alone abroad,

129
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I missed you every day.

130
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,000
I hoped that you would be by my side every day.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
When I was gone,

132
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,500
did you miss me?

133
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,000

331
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
We still need the money for our future.

332
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,600
Come.

333
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,200
Hurry up.

334
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,600
I...

335
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Aisin-Gioro Shaoxue is back again!

336
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,000
You're not making a wish this time?

337
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm not because my wish has come true.

338
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Sunian, make your wish.

339
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
What did you wish for?

340
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,400
If I tell you, it won't come true.

341
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,600
Tell me. If it doesn't come true,

342
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
I'll give you another wish.

343
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,900
I wish...

344
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,200
that I could hold your hand...

345
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,500
like this forever.

346
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,200
Is that all?

347
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Permission granted.

348
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,900
What do you mean?

349
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,100
If you want to hold my hand forever, then do it.

350
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,000
You won't leave anymore?

351
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,000
Sunian,

352
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,700
you became a dummy.

353
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,000
I made the decision to stay

354
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,200
when I came back here.

355
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
From now on, I'll stay by your side.

356
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
I won't go anywhere anymore.

357
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,000
You can never shoo me away now.

358
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,500
Put it down.

359
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,800
I'm not good enough for that.

360
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,800
What are you on about, Mom?

361
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,100
I would wash your feet if you asked me to,

362
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,600
let alone serving you tea.

363
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,400
How long has it been?

364
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,300
It's been a week...

365
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,400
since I learned about...

366
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,000
this affair.

367
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,400
No, five days.

368
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,300
And only one phone call in these five days.

369
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,300
And you refused to come back.

370
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,700
What now? Am I still your mother?

371
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,800
Mom, I had to prepare myself mentally for this.

372
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
Did you hear that?

373
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,500
She had to prepare herself mentally just to come home?

374
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,100
Mom, I just came back and I'm jobless.

375
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,200
If our neighbors know about this, you'll be embarrassed

376
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,600
So almost immediately, I found a decent job.

377
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
Insurance covered and good pay, too.

378
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,700
Only when everything is settled

379
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,800
can I come back to see you

380
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
and make you feel proud of me.

381
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,800
Don't you agree?

382
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,600
It sounds all fine and dandy.

383
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,700
Settled, you said?

384
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,200
Where?

385
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
You aren't even engaged to Sunian

386
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,600
and you're now living with him.

387
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
I already feel ashamed mentioning it.

388
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I'll move back here today.

389
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Ms. Yu, I think...

390
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
What are you trying to say?

391
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
I think...

392
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,800
Xue and I should get engaged first

393
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,100
and once that's done, we can move on to something else.

394
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,900
Sunian is right.

395
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,000
Look how resourceful Sunian is.

396
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,700
We need to talk to Old Zheng.

397
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,900
We need to pick a date for their wedding.

398
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,800
Right, the date.

399
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
We have to book the hotel, too. It's the hardest one to book. At least a six-month waiting period.

400
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,100
Not to mention the wedding dress and the wedding photos.

401
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,400
Also, the invitation.

402
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,700
Oh, you...

403
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,600
We have to start now. Zheng...

404
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,300
Old Zheng! Old Zheng!

405
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
<i>[Shao Xue's Itinerary]</i>
"Friendly reminder.

406
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,900
Have dinner at your parents' place at least six times per week.

407
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,400
Failure to do so will incur dire consequences."

408
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,800
My mother went overboard.

409
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,500
I'm an adult.

410
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,900
She can't tell me what to do as if I'm a kid.

411
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,400
That's because you didn't go back to see them

412
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,100
so Ms. Yu is now forcing you to spend more time with her.

413
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,500
And whose fault is that?

414
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Do what she wants now.

415
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,500
Once we're married, we can do whatever we want.

416
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,100
You're setting up a trap again

417
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,400
to force me to marry you.

418
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
You slept with me.

419
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,500
You're now responsible for me.

420
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,000
Zheng Sunian.

421
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,900
Stop acting like you're the damsel in distress.

422
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,400
Pack my luggage for me.

423
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,900
My mom wants me to move back tonight.

424
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,000
But don't you have to go to Suzhou for your training program?

425
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Tell your mother that you'll move back later.

426
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:32,500
I haven't told my mom about that yet.

427
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,800
It's a serious business and you haven't told her?

428
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,400
She'll explode when she knows about it.

429
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,000
I asked my dad to handle it.

430
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,800
Whether she'll explode or not will be his problem.

431
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,200
Come out now!

432
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,000
How can you just hide in someone else's home?

433
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
I won't come out.

434
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,500
Stop making a scene here.

435
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,900
A scene? How can I not make a scene?

436
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,000
You let my daughter leave when she just came back.

437
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Come out now!

438
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
I didn't ask her to leave.

439
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Her job needs her. Her job needs her.

440
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,900
I'm just the messenger.

441
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,600
Don't shoot the messenger, they say.

442
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,400
You could have told me earlier!

443
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,200
If you told me, I would figure out a way to make her stay.

444
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,100
Come out now! We'll settle this back home.

445
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,500
No.

446
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,400
I will stay with Old Zheng.

447
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,600
You should head back

448
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,100
and think why no one wants to stay with you.

449
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:21,984
Dongge. Dongge.

450
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,500
Say that again. Again!

451
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,400
You can't boss me around.

452
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,100
You don't want to stay with me, is that right?

453
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,400
Then don't come back.

454
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,600
Don't ever come back!

455
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,000
Stay with them!

456
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,900
Spend your life in there!

457
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,100
But... Be rational, please.

458
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,200
Don't you regret what you said.

459
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,700
From now on, I'll stay with Old Zheng.

460
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,400
Don't stop me.

461
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,000
If you didn't stop me, I would...

462
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Let me see you off.

463
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,800
No need. It's too troublesome.

464
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,900
I'll call you once I get to the hotel.

465
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Send me a message when you're in the cab.

466
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,100
Another one when you arrive, too.

467
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,400
Text me the car plate, too.

468
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,600
In case you get an unlicensed cab driver.

469
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,700
All right. I lived alone abroad for many years.

470
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,300
I can take care of myself.

471
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,900
Don't worry.

472
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,100
See you then.

473
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Why are you looking at me like this?

474
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,400
I'll just be gone for a few days.

475
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,200
I'll go now then.

476
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Hello?

477
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
Xue, you have to think about me.

478
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Every day.

479
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,000
Xue.

480
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,400
Ms. Kang.

481
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,800
Ms. Kang, it's been a while.

482
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Indeed.

483
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,500
I haven't seen you ever since you went abroad.

484
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,000
You're more beautiful now.

485
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,800
Have a seat.

486
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,300
Ms. Kang, how did you know that I was in Suzhou?

487
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,300
Your mother called me

488
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,800
and told me you were on a business trip to Suzhou.

489
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,400
She was worried so she asked me to come to see you.

490
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,500
Ms. Kang, have you gotten used to the work here?

491
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,000
Weren't you doing just fine in the Restoration Department?

492
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,400
After wandering for many years, home is still the best.

493
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,300
How are your parents? Are they doing well?

494
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,700
Yes, though they keep asking me to get married.

495
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,000
It's about time, too.

496
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,200
But my persuasion will never be effective

497
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,300
since I, myself, got married when I was almost 40.

498
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,800
Who is this lucky man? How is he?

499
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,900
He's a nice man.

500
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,600
We were introduced to each other by our mutual friend.

501
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,800
He's a history teacher.

502
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,600
When we're together,

503
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,000
I find out that he's a kind and gentle person.

504
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,300
That's why we decided to tie the knot.

505
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,600
It takes a fine gentleman to impress you, Ms. Kang.

506
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,700
Stop exaggerating.

507
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,500
Enough about me.

508
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,400
What about you? Have you found a companion?

509
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,344
Is he Sunian?

510
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:21,895
How do you know?

511
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,724
You are slow.

512
00:34:23,724 --> 00:34:26,555
I had seen it coming miles ahead.

513
00:34:26,555 --> 00:34:30,024
You have no idea the love Sunian has in his eyes

514
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,655
when he looks at you.

515
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:37,404
And did you notice that Sunian is very similar to his father?

516
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:41,054
Both of them are the quiet, inexpressive type.

517
00:34:41,055 --> 00:34:43,344
But they share something in common.

518
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:44,824
Their stubbornness.

519
00:34:44,825 --> 00:34:48,054
Being with someone like this is a blessing.

520
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:51,424
Their world is pure.

521
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,114
One life, one goal.

522
00:34:53,114 --> 00:34:55,515
One life, one partner.

523
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:58,455
When they find their true love, they are not giving her away.

524
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:03,955
Both of you will definitely be happy together.

525
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:07,854
Look how long-winded I am. Let's eat and catch up.

526
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:09,755
Try this fish.

527
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:30,355
Sunian, you don't have to pick me up anymore.

528
00:35:30,355 --> 00:35:32,185
It's quite tiresome.

529
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,585
I want to see you.

530
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:38,095
I don't want to wait one second longer.

531
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,094
Then whenever I'm on a business trip,

532
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:41,785
you'll come with me.

533
00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:43,135
Sure.

534
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:45,465
I'll go wherever you go.

535
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:47,875
I won't let you leave me.

536
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,635
You'll get bored of me eventually.

537
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:53,315

00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:29,650
♫ <i>All the memories are embedded deep within my heart</i> ♫

661
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,200
♫ <i>The past I've been hiding from year after year</i> ♫

662
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,920
♫ <i>Carved into the days long gone</i> ♫

663
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:45,170
♫ <i>Although simplicity is plain, its vibrancy has never faded</i> ♫

664
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,550
♫ <i>Those songs in the past</i> ♫

665
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,439
♫ <i>They had accompanied me through everything</i> ♫

666
00:43:52,439 --> 00:44:00,270
♫ <i>Singing about the stubbornness of our youth</i> ♫

667
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:08,000
♫ <i>Using this song to boost our courage as we sing</i> ♫

668
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,650
♫ <i>Please don't cry because you have me</i> ♫

669
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,360
♫ <i>Until I saw the bustling city</i> ♫

670
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,950
♫ <i>Until I realized that it was once within my reach</i> ♫

671
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:46,920
♫ <i>I was this sober once but I still did the same thing</i> ♫

672
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,650
♫ <i>As days go by, I wish to forget</i> ♫

673
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,450
♫ <i>But unknowingly, I remember them again</i> ♫

674
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,400
♫ <i>I remember the deep feelings that were long gone</i> ♫

675
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,450
♫ <i>Within those simple days</i> ♫

676
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:09,970
♫ <i>Those songs in the past, they had accompanied me</i> ♫

677
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:17,760
♫ <i>As I regretted our parting during our youth</i> ♫

678
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:25,470
♫ <i>Using this song, this song belongs to us</i> ♫

679
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,270
♫ <i>Please don't cry again</i> ♫

680
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:36,200
♫ <i>And don't ask when I'll return</i> ♫
