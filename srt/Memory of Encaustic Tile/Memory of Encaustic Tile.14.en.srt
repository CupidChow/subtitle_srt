34
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,359
Order whatever you like. It's my treat today.

35
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,930
I only have a few bowls of mutton soup left.

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,830
Mutton soup is fine. It's been so long since I had it.

37
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,750
The smell is so tantalizing.

38
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,009
Give us four bowls of mutton soup then. One for takeaway.

39
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,959
One bowl is enough for me. You don't need to do any takeaway.

40
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,359
You're thinking too highly of yourself. It's for Qiaomu.

41
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,579
Siyuan, how's your relationship with Qiaomu going?

42
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,199
It's pretty good.
<i> [Traditional taste, mutton soup,mixed mutton soup, clear soup, mutton]</i>

43
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,340
Seems like Siyuan did the right thing by choosing to stay.

44
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,609
Back then, Siyuan did hesitate.

45
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:45,410
Thank you.

46
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,370
Back then,

47
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,300
I did hesitate.

48
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,030
Thank you.

49
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,979
It's because my university coursemates

50
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:59,050
were doing so well out there.

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,210
All of them were at the top. They did very well.

52
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,529
Some of them were academicians. Some of them were researchers.

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,090
Some of them were businessmen. Some of them got their Ph.D.

54
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,619
When I looked at myself, I was only tinkering with junk.

55
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,369
I thought I would never be successful. Right?

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,960
But after that, when I changed my perspective,

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,120
people in our industry have to be like this.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,879
We have to be able to withstand loneliness and a poor life.

59
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,599
If not, you won't be able to get good at this trade.

60
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,700
Maybe I'm talking too much.

61
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
You guys might not be able to understand me.

62
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,089
But I'm sure you guys will understand me in the future.

63
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:49,859
Eat up. Finish it and go back to rest.

64
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,560
Here.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,690
Be careful, it's hot.

66
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,639
I didn't expect Siyuan's inner thoughts to be that deep.

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,020
Siyuan possesses the craftsman's spirit.

68
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,280
The craftsman's spirit?

69
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,449
A true craftsman is willing to exchange their current moment for eternity.

70
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,529
Just like Mr. Sun and Mr. Luo, the expert craftsmen.

71
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,329
They have never fretted about the amount of money they earn.

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,800
What they truly cared about was the things they had done.

73
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,680
I respect them.

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,530
I wish to be someone like them.

75
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,900
Just like how I idolize Ms. Jin Ning.

76
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,210
Isn't this the most handsome guy in the universe

77
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,730
and Zhao Ling'er's boyfriend, Li Xiaoyao?

78
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,650
Do you guys still treat me as a friend?

79
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,340
Why didn't you guys invite me when you guys went to visit Mr. Sun?

80
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,650
It's because Wang Haoran pissed us off this morning.

81
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,970
We'll surely invite you next time.

82
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,250
How many times have you said that?

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,170
Since you guys are so busy,

84
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,600
I guess there's no need for us to gather in the future.

85
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,270
Did you need to resort to that?

86
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,089
Would you be happy if the two of us went out as a pair?

87
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,580
Don't be angry.

88
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,060
At most... At most, we'll apologize to you.

89
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,050
Sorry, Zhang Qi!

90
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,460
Sorry.

91
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,629
Don't do this again.

92
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,790
I will forgive you guys since I'm magnanimous.

93
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,470
Xue! Don't you know what time it is?

94
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,239
Must I shout for you before you will come back?

95
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,950
I'll return home first.

96
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,949
- Hurry up.
- Coming!

97
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,270
Playing is the only thing you know.

98
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,450
You two should return home as well. It's getting late.

99
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,330
By the way, how's Wu Huan today?

100
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,850
I consoled him on our way home. I sent him back.

101
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,729
After that, I went to find you guys, but I couldn't find you guys.

102
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,920
But today, Lin Shiyin was too much.

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,210
Huan's love for her was in vain.

104
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,059
If I were Wu Huan, I would surely never talk to her again.

105
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:36,799
If you truly like someone, you wouldn't leave her no matter what she does.

106
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,410
If so...

107
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,190
If so,

108
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,460
do you have someone you like?

109
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,120
What about you?

110
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,829
You should come up with your own answer before you ask someone else a question.

111
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,430
Sleep early.

112
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,280
I heard that.

113
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,460
- Hello?
- Ms. Yu, it's me.

114
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,020
Shiyin?

115
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,380
Can you ask Xue to pick up the phone?

116
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,830
I'll call her for you.

117
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,820
Xue.

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,260
Xue, you have a call.

119
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,039
Hello?

120
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,860
<i>- Xue.</i>
- Give me a moment.

121
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,899
Mom. Dad. Why don't you two go to sleep first?

122
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,769
Give me some privacy.

123
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:10,489
I'm watching TV. I cannot hear anything.

124
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,510
Wait.

125
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,269
- What are you doing? The show isn't finished yet.
- Do you know what time it is? Time to sleep.

126
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,100
I haven't finished that episode.

127
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,779
Look at the time. Time to sleep.

128
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:23,429
Xue, you should sleep early as well.

129
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,029
- Remember to turn off the lights.
- Okay.

130
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,780
Let's go. Hurry.

131
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,410
Hello?

132
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,440
Xue.

133
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,430
Are you still angry at me?

134
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,269
I'm not angry. I was just disappointed.

135
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,220
Disappointed?

136
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,410
What do you mean by disappointed?

137
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,190
<i>Shiyin, I remember I told you</i>

138
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,710
not to hurt people who are truly kind to you.

139
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:04,620
It's hard for me to accept the fact that you treated Wu Huan like that.

140
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,169
Xue, you may not know,

141
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:11,320
ever since the dance incident, I've been doubting myself.

142
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,080
<i>And I finally met someone.</i>

143
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,829
<i>I finally met a group that could prove my superiority when I mingled with them.</i>

144
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:20,960
But they were looking down on Wu Huan. I was just saying that.

145
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,140
What if one day they look down on me?

146
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,099
Why would someone look down on you?

147
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,650
I don't know why they look down on Wu Huan.

148
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,310
But Wu Huan told me that

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
<i>on the first day you two became friends, everyone was laughing at him.</i>

150
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,579
<i>Only you... Only you were the only one who took his hand and finished the red carpet.</i>

151
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,140
I always thought that this was a wonderful thing.

152
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,860
I don't know why you ended up like this.

153
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,050
<i>I didn't change.</i>

154
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,320
I have never treated him as my friend.

155
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,800
<i>I took his hand back then because I wanted people to think that I was kind.</i>

156
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,239
You have Zhang Qi and Zheng Sunian by your side.

157
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,029
You will never know how I feel.

158
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,839
What if Wu Huan was the one following you all day?

159
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,669
Would you still be as happy?

160
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,599
I hope what you are saying is all of that out of spite.

161
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,900
Because I believe that my friend, Lin Shiyin,

162
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,140
is a girl that is truly kind.

163

<i>If you mean what you said just now,</i>

164
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,590
let's stop being friends.

165
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,320
Wang Haoran was right.

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,810
Mr. Sun, I'm sure you have learned your lesson. Right?

170
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,939
If you're hospitalized because of smoking again, I'll ignore you.

171
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,059
- Really?
- Really.

172
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,200
Don't scare me.

173
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,970
Mr. Sun, congratulations on being discharged.

174
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,460
- Mr. Luo.
- Hold this.

175
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,140
You are quite somebody.

176
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,929
You're only here when I'm being discharged?

177
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:09,000
You should consider yourself lucky that I'm here today.

178
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,139
When I was hospitalized,

179
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,409
I couldn't find someone to pick a fight with.

180
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,749
I do want to pick a fight with you.

181
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:19,989
But I'm afraid you'll die of anger if you lose to me.

182
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,860
We've been fighting for several decades.

183
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,389
- Have I ever lost to you?
- Fine.

184
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,290
Be honest with me.

185
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,500
Did you miss me when you were hospitalized?

186
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,310
Did you?

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,219
I'm asking you a question.

188
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:39,319
I'm asking you if you missed me.

189
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,149
- Did he miss me?
- He did. He missed you very much.

190
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,029
Wait up.

191
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,500
This Sun... You...

192
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,119
Listen up. Next time, you need to be careful when you smoke.

193
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,669
Did you hear me?

Why do you look so exhausted?

197
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,569
Did you stay up all night to do your revision?

198
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,739
Just forget it.

199
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:16,529
Now, I'm taking math tutoring on the one hand,

200
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,529
and practicing Spoken English on the other.

201
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,439
Both my physical and mental power have been depleted.

202
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,599
If this continues, I'll go crazy.

203
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,809
Why don't you discuss it with your mother?

204
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,569
Maybe you can skip the math tutoring for now.

205
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,909
I dare not do so.

206
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,659
It was hard for me to convince her to let me study overseas.

207
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,479
Now, I have to obey every instruction of her.

208
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,080
If so, is the path you take safe enough to travel back home?

209
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,959
Of course, it's safe.

210
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,389
You need to be more careful.

211
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,179
I heard that many students were mugged on their way home.

212
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,869
Why don't you find someone to pick you up?

213
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,319
What about Zhang Qi and Zheng Sunian?

214
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,969
One of them is in his senior year and the other one is in the competition class. Our schedules are different.

215
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:54,359
Besides, I'm a strong man.

216
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,890
No one dares to mug me.

217
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,669
Xue, you're truly the boldest girl

219
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,079
Bold?

220
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,509
Is that even a compliment?

221
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,440
Definitely.

222
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,960
If so, I'll protect you from now on.

Go ahead.

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,030
Mr. Tong.

227
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,769
Were you looking for me?

228
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,750
This bouquet is for you.

229
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,099
Don't misunderstand.

230
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,629
It's not from me.

231
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,959
There was a chap by the entrance. He told me to pass it to you.

232
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,029
Thank you.

233
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,980
Don't mention it.

234
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,550
Were you busy?

235
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,820

Ms. Yu. Moshui.

237
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:00,930
This bouquet is huge. It looks gorgeous.

238
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,629
Did your boyfriend give this to you?

239
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,379
No, he's not my boyfriend.

240
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,319
He's sending a bouquet like this when he's not your boyfriend?

241
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:08,789
You can have it if you like it.

242
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,119
I dare not accept this.

243
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,220
I'll make a move first.

244
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,829
Youngsters nowadays are really generous, huh?

245
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,439
It was a huge bouquet.

246
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,479
It must've been expensive.

247
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,749
Precisely. I'm sure it's not cheap.

248
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,099
That is a huge bouquet.

249
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,060
It's in the way.

250
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,119
I think it looks great.

251
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,529
What's so great about it?

252
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,620
They'll wilt when the weather gets cold.

253
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,379
Where are you going?

254
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:54,450
I'm going to water my flowers.

255
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,019
You want to water them with boiling water? They'll wilt even faster.

256
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,829
Look at how sour you look.

257
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,220
Even though you're so near to her,

258
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,540
you can't even win her heart.

259
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,389
Mr. Sun, it's not entirely my fault.

260
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,259
Look at that bouquet.

261
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,219
He's sending her a bouquet of roses without any reason.

262
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,719
I'm sure he's an indecent guy.

263
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,329
Who would do so without any reason? What are you saying?

264
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:24,440
You don't need a reason to make a girl happy.

265
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,060
- But...
- You're so dumb.

266
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,330
Mr. Sun, do you like roses as well?

267
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,570
Stop trying to be witty.

268
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,070
Get me the brush.

269
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,800
It's rare for you to be this hard-working.

270
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,560
So a student from the competition class has graced us with his presence. This is such an honor.

271
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,689
I guess so. Prepare a red carpet for me before I come next time.

272
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:03,859
What's the matter?

273
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,839
I'm here because I have a surprise for you.

274
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,959
What is it?

275
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,099
I won't spoil the surprise first.

276
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:10,569
Just look forward to it tonight.

277
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,199
Hurry up! If not, I'll dwell on it the entire day.

278
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,369
To put it precisely, my mother has a surprise for you.

279
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,909
She bought a new computer.

280
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,069
She's going to give you her old computer. Really?

281
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,909
Do you think I'm joking?

282
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,510
Zhang Qi, I love you so much!

283
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,770
What are you guys doing?

284
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,170
You were following me again.

285
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,669
This is the classroom.

286
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,439
I know you think he's not good enough for you.

287
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,919
But you should mind your behavior as well.

288
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,920
How could you say that?

289
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,259
I heard from your class teacher

290
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:46,930
that you've been on a roll lately.

291
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,790
You won several prizes in a row.

292
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,030
So you've heard about it?

293
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,899
You see, I guess I'm too exceptional.

294
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,190
I can't even keep a low profile even if I want to.

295
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,449
You should be more modest and prudent. Go back to your class.

296
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:03,859
Even though I've been working so hard,

297
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:05,859
I can't even get a smile from you.

298
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,579
This is heartbreaking.

299
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,110
Go back.

300
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,830
Xue, see you.

301
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,040
This brat...

302
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,720
Xue.

303
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,279
For last month's test,

304
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,579
the essay you wrote based on the theme of youth

305
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,960
was circulated within the Language Division.

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,119
- Really?
- Of course.

307
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,449
You used a great quote.

308
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:38,439
"Youth is the state

309
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,239
where we haven't achieved something we want.

310
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,159
It's the state of eagerness and longing.

311
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,820
It's the state which contains possibility."

312
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,509
Not many high school students have read the works of Yukio Mishima.

313
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,099
An amazing lady gave me the book.

314
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:55,479
She has plenty of them.

315
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,109
You have a unique view of youth.

316
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,449
I hope you can keep up the good work. Okay.

317
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:06,040
Go back now.

318
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,719
Dad? How come it's you?

319
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,510
What's wrong? Am I not welcomed?

320
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,179
<i>Come. I bought them.</i>

321
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,309
Xue.

322
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,300
Xue?

323
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,639
Why are you standing there?

324
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,789
Return to your room and finish your homework.

325
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,760
Just ignore me.

326
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,769
- Coming!
- Come and help us out!

327
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,729
- Hurry.
- Go and help my mother.

328
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,479
Ms. Zhang Lin, you're finally here.

329
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,569
This is a lot of metal junk.

330
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:03,879
This is so heavy.

331
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,299
What metal junk? This is the CPU.

332
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,439
Do you think I'm really outdated?

333
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,109
I surely know that this is a computer.

334
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,849
I used this to search for information when I was in the Restoration Department.

335
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,619
Really?

336
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:16,749
Dongge.

337
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,310
Dongge! Hurry!

338
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,799
- Zhang Ling, you're here?
- Ge.

339
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,479
This...

340
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,680
What's going on?

341
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,879
I bought a new computer.

342
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,639
I wasn't using this anyway.

343
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,069
That's why I thought of giving it to you.

344
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,059
But after I thought about it,

345
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:37,499
I'm sure you won't accept it if I tell you beforehand.

346
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,199
That's why I brought this here directly.

347
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:42,399
My dear, you mustn't sell it as junk.

348
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,700
It's a treasure. How could we sell it away? Ms. Zhang Ling.

349
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,559
I forgot to bring the mouse and keyboard. Let me go get it.

350
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,899
- Let me tag along.
- Okay.

351
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,829
Look at you.

352
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,099
You moved such a heavy thing all the way here.

353
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,239
Besides, this is very precious.

354
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,579
I can't accept this.

355
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,109
That's enough of you. I've been using it for quite some time.

356
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:00,509
It's not that valuable anymore.

357
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,309
It's not cheap either.

358
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,109
You should bring it to Zhongguancun.

359
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,309
Maybe you can sell this for 5,000 or 6,000 yuan.

360
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,029
You want me to bring this to Zhongguancun? It's too troublesome.

361
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:12,099
Just let your daughter use it for now.

362
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:16,049
You can buy a new one for her when she goes to university, all right?

363
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,399
Think about it.

364
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,499
Will she be able to get into a university when she has this?

365
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:23,340
She'll play with this every day. My goodness.

366
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,549
Listen up. This computer is quite old.

367
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,199
It's too slow for her to play games with it.

368
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,159
She can only use this to surf the Internet and search for information.

369
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,499
And many famous teachers have started to teach their students online.

370
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,820
In the future, online lessons will become more and more common.

371
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,959
This thing is actually capable of that?

372
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,549
Not bad. Not bad at all.

373
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,679
I was planning to register an account on QQ.

374
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,650
I wanted to chat with other people.

375
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,829
With whom?

376
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,739
What? Are you tired of chatting with me?

377
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:58,540
I... I was planning to create a QQ group.

378
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,780
You'll be the group leader.

379
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,059
<i>[Who's the cutest person in our family?]</i>

380
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,339
You're pretty fast.

381
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,139
Of course. I got a perfect score

382
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,199
for computer class when I was in junior high.

383
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,309
You're only good at learning nonsense like this.

384
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,589
What do you mean by nonsense?

385
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,959
You can give it a try if you think you're that good.

386
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,549
Fine.

387
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,299
- Get up.
- Come.

388
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,509
These are the hands of an expert embroiderer.

389
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,340
They're swift.

390
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,109
<i>[Shao]</i>

391
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,830
Seems she is typing with just one finger.

392
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,859
I'm just unfamiliar with the keyboard.

393
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,239
If I were familiar with it,

394
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,350
you won't be able to see them moving.

395
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,920
<i>[Shao Xue]</i>

396
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,700
<i>[Shao Xue is naughty]</i>

397
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,969
Morning.

398
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:34,200
- Morning.
- You're so early today.

399
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,310
It's from me.

400
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,140
I guessed so.

401
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,550
No one else would give me this kind of present.

402
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,410
I went to the flower market

403
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,410
and bought this especially for you.

404
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,549
The shop owner said this plant was easy to keep.

405
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,100
And it can live for a long time. Do you like it?

406
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:06,440
Be careful! It'll prick your fingers.

407
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,029
How about this? I'll find another spot for you.

408
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,420
Don't. I want to put it over here.

409
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,480
It can protect me.

410
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,070
- Morning.
- Morning

411
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,649
Qiaomu doesn't want this bouquet?

412
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:29,099
That's right. She said she'd leave it here.

413
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:30,649
This child.

414
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:33,930
She gave it away even though she just received it.

415
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,819
That means she's uninterested in that guy.

416
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,389
Honestly. I did see the guy.

417
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:42,749
He was waiting for Qiaomu in front of the entrance.

418
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:45,340
He looked pretty ordinary to me.

419
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,009
Yeah, I met him once.

420
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,959
He looked pretty awkward.

421
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,380
He was foppish.

422
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,740
Siyuan is better.

423
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,859
But Siyuan is not good at talking.

424
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:59,569
We need to give him a push when we have the chance.

425
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:02,339
If we let him do it alone, he'll surely ruin it.

426
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,820
What do you think?

427
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,490
Youngsters nowadays have their own ideas.

428
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,640
Our opinions don't matter to them.

429
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,010
You're right. It was different in our times.

430
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,189
We had to listen to our parents and the matchmaker.

431
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:19,459
The marriage was already over when we still had no idea about what had happened.

432
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,590
Pass that to me.

433
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,970
It's fine if other people talk about this.

434
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,900
But you? You don't have the right to say that.

435
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,839
Your legendary story is almost like the plot of a drama.

436
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,790
Why is it about me again?

437
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,159
In just a flash, he and I have been through so many years together.

438
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,300
It's pretty good.

439
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,540
What? Do you want him to buy you a bouquet as well?

440
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,209
He doesn't dare to do so.

441
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:52,780
He shouldn't waste our money like that.

442
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,200
Morning.

443
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,000
Dongge, I'll leave your breakfast here.

444
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,120
Whose bouquet is it?

445
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,060
Morning.

446
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,450
Dongge, your husband is really fortunate.

447
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm the fortunate one.

448
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
Who's there?

449
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,679
Su-Sunian!

450
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:15,780
What's the matter?

451
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,070
I think someone is following me!

452
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,450
I don't think there's anyone there.

453
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,620
Maybe it's because I was too nervous.

454
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,340
Let's go.

455
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,340
Did you hurt your leg?

456
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,210
I sprained my ankle when I ran just now.

457
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,590
Come, have a seat.

458
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,240
Slowly.

459
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,580
It hurts.

460
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,200
I think there's a sprain. Let me carry you on my back.

461
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,250
No.

462
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,620
Why not?

463
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,200
We used to do this all the time when we were young.

464
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,950
I just finished my checkup.

465
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,200
I've gained three kilograms of weight.

466
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,390
Come.

467
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,140
Maybe the scale in our school is faulty.

468
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,620
Come, let me measure your weight.

469
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,440
I...

470
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,480
I think we should forget it.

471
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,479
The scale is pretty accurate.

472
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:00,450
I hate you.

473
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,230
Sunian, why were you here?

474
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,220
My class ended early today. I went to your house.

475
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,490
Ms. Yu said you hadn't finished your tutoring yet.

476
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,969
That's why I thought of picking you up.

477
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,010
Why were you looking for me?

478
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,959
Can't I look for you without reason?

479
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,009
You're a senior-year student now. I don't dare to waste your time.

480
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:21,029
But luckily, you were there.

481
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,780
If not, I think I'd have been on tenterhooks all the way home.

482
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,399
Are you still scared?

483
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,000
I feel much safer with you around.

484
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,509
Sunian, I think studying is exhausting.

485
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:41,190
Why aren't you exhausted from all the studying?

486
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,399
I do get exhausted as well.

487
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,270
Really?

488
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,450
That's the reason I came to look for you.

489
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,260
- You don't feel exhausted when you look for me?
- Yeah.

490
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
But why?

491
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,650
Because you have an energetic voice.

492
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,490
I feel energized when I listen to your voice.

493

<i>[Residents Committee Activity Center]</i>
When do you go to tutoring again?

494
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,349
You won't need to be scared when I'm keeping you company.

495
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,790
Xue?

496
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,880
I was looking for you two.

497
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,540
She fell asleep.

498
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,780
I heard that someone has been following you after school.

499
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,399
Why don't I go to work later? I can send you home first.

500
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,330
No, thanks. I'm afraid of nothing.

501
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:52,779
Zhang Qi!

502
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,900
Huanhuan, you can head back first.

503
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,100
What's with that expression? The emperor is right in front of you.

504
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,170
- Why were you looking for me, my son?
- How dare you to take advantage of me?

505
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,179
I heard from Sunian that someone has been following you after school.

506
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,859
This item is very effective.

507
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:15,429
When you pull it, the entire village will hear you.

508
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:16,650
It's that amazing?

509
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,889
But of course. When I'm around, no perverts will be able to do as they please.

510
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:23,939
If so, can you chase away the pervert right in front of me?

511
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:26,170
Do you know how far away the competition class is?

512
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,149
I came all the way to give you this buzzer, but you're not grateful to me at all.

513
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,300
Thank you very much.

514
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,400
Why don't I reward you with a silk banner after I chase away the pervert?

515
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,789
What will you write on top of it?

516
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,290
The friend of all maidens?

517
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,400
Sunian!

518
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,210
Why do you look so happy when you see him?

519
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,620
You should take a good look at yourself then.

520
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,240
Sunian, why are you here?

521
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,579
Sunian, I didn't expect you to have this kind of hobby.

522
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:02,270
Sunian, are you too stressed out lately? Did you not rest well?

523
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,199
You have to rest more often.

524
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,579
My mother told me to make this.

525
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:08,550
Is it for me?

526
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,529
I think this is the most girlish item among all the items Shao Xue has.

527
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,799
You don't need to turn it on during the day.

528
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Okay. Thank you guys so much.

529
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,999
Tonight, I'll ready my blades.

530
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,440
I'll see who's daring enough to tail me.

531
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,010
I'll return to class first.

532
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,240
Thank you. Goodbye.

533
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,110
I'll go as well.

534
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,210
Today, let's talk about argumentative essays.

535
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,930
What are these?

536
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,049
These are the self-defense items given to me by Sunian and Zhang Qi.

537
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,759
What about this cat?

538
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,970
Zhang Qi said it was a buzzer.

539
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,210
How do you use this?

540
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,900
I don't know. Let me study it for a moment.

541
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,650
Shao Xue, what are you doing?

542
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,900
This!

543
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,270
What's going on?

544
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,200
This isn't mine!

545
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,890
Principal?

546
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,010
<i>[Good at Guiding, Virtuous, Renowned for One's Virtue]</i>

547
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,900

This is outrageous!

548
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,580
Principal, I didn't do it on purpose.

549
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,349
Principal, Shao Xue has always been an obedient child.

550
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:36,059
I can guarantee that this was purely an accident.

551
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,099
Where did you get the buzzer?

552
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:39,730
I bought it as a self-defense item.

553
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,350
Sorry, Principal. Principal, I know my fault now.

554
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,299
I was the one who gave her the buzzer. It has nothing to do with her.

555
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,860
Weren't you in the competition class?

556
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,780
Class is in session right now.

557
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,170
Your time is precious!

558
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,300
Why are you here to mess around?

559
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,059
What about her time then? Isn't her time precious?

560
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,930
I can't just let you wrong her.

561
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,210
What are you saying?

562
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,620
I'm speaking the truth.

563
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,790
I'm sorry, Principal. It's all my fault.

564
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,399
I will write a self-reflection report.

565
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,299
I will never commit the same mistake again.

566
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:06,959
Please forgive me this time.

567
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,410
Principal, this is her first offense.

568
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,670
Please forgive her.

569
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,680
Luckily, it didn't cause a huge mess.

570
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,270
Go back and write a self-reflection report.

571
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,479
Don't do this again.

572
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,779
Thank you, Principal. I will surely study hard to repay you and the school.

573
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:25,100
Thank you. Let's go.

574
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,479
It could've been resolved right after he told me off.

575
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:32,549
You almost made the situation worse.

576
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,939
I just wanted to defend you. Was I wrong?

577
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:37,579
I didn't say you were wrong.

578
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:40,410
But you need to change your temper somehow.

579
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,269
Lord Zhang Qi, it's all thanks to you. You tried to uphold justice for me.

580
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,889
If you didn't come in, I think he would've lectured me for another half an hour.

581
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:50,520
I think he'd lecture me for at least one hour.

582
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,490
Your buzzer was confiscated?

583
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,060
Forget it.

584
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,030
With an IQ like yours, I'm sure you didn't understand how to use it.

585
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,010
Yeah, you're the genius here.

586
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,200
You can return to the competition class then.

587
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,860
What will you do for tonight?

588
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,300
Do you dare to go back alone?

589
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,700
Do you need me to send you back?

590
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,879
No, thanks. I have the flashlight that Sunian had given to me.

591
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,410
What can you do with a flashlight?

592
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,799
Can you shine the pervert to death with it?

593
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,560
If I can't shine him to death, I'll whack him with the flashlight.

594
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,670
I'll make a move now. Don't worry.

595
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,780

<i>Call me your lovely mother.</i>

645
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,150
<i>My lovely mother.</i>

646
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,279
<i>Good boy. Wait for me. I'll bring it here.</i>

647
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,820
Where did you get it?

648
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,490
Since there are no crooks around,

649
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,010
you should throw it away.

650
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,930
It's mine now.

651
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,759
Don't worry. I'll repay you with another gift.

652
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,930
A gift?

653
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,050
I've already bought it online.

654
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,970
It was my first time shopping online. It means a lot to me.

655
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,220
What did you buy?

656
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,899
It's a secret. You'll know it by then.

You should stop playing.

I was just checking the shipment date for the things I had bought.

661
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,929
You bought something online?

662
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:20,259
I'll show you something new next time.

663
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:25,009
So you just need to click on the things and someone will deliver them to our house?

664
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:27,640
I'm sure this is a scam.

665
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,960
You're too outdated.

666
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,230
There's a thing calledparcel delivery right now.

667
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:35,249
If you make an order online, they'll send the items to your doorstep after a few days.

668
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,929
They'll send the items to our doorstep after a few days?

669
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:41,379
Youngsters nowadays are into nonsense like this.

670
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:44,889
What if they don't send the items to you after you transfer the money to them?

671
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,980
Isn't that a scam?

Enough. Stop nagging.

675

Xue, let me warn you.

676
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,010
You mustn't upload our home address

677
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,930
and your ID card number onto the internet.

678
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,330
This is very risky. If the scammers have our home address, they will...
- Mom.

679
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,260
- Our house will...
- Have a seat.

680

You loved Cantonese songs, right? Let me play one for you.

How did you know?

682
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:17,920
Your drawer was filled with cassette tapes.

683
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,700
You couldn't bear to play them when I wanted to listen to them.

684
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,670
What are you saying?

685
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:30,560
I just couldn't play them after winding them up.

What's so special about that song that she has to listen to it alone?

701
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,910
When your mother was young, she listened to this song

702
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,550
whenever she was facing hardships.

703
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,100
It had accompanied her then.

704

Mom had actually faced hardships before?

I heard that my grandfather was a cab driver in Beijing.

They were pretty well-off.

707
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,970
She met you after that, right?

708
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,730
What kind of hardships did she face?

709
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,740
So there's a story behind it?

710
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,620
Tell me about it.

711
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,260
All the other children know about the stories of their parents.
