We're going against three major rules.

Is she from our school? Is she a video game character?

320
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:57,060
Pathetic.

You don't need to resort to that.

If something did go wrong, how could we live in this neighborhood?

Wait, judging from your words,

361
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:32,264
are you saying that your relationship with our neighbors

362
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:34,555
is more important than our daughter's life?

363

Is that even the point?

Yes.

You see, children nowadays

373
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,294
don't even treat us as their parents.

374
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,565
They don't even show us respect.

375

So, you know that too?

376

Even though we're enraged, maybe they're having fun right now.

377

That's why I'm getting angrier.

378
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,200
That's right. If you get angry, you'll fall for their trick.

379

If that's the case, why don't we use another method?

Let's just ignore them and let them do whatever they want.

<i>Just treat me like an invisible person!</i>

How should I know? We ran out of vegetables again.

389
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:57,805
We'll have nothing to eat if I don't buy them.

390

Mr. Luo, why haven't you returned yet?

422
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:40,284

that three children would come here and create trouble for me.

- What business?
- Our country is next in place to hold the Olympics, right?

Our class will draw promotional drawings for the Olympics.

428

- I volunteered to do it.
- You can go and draw it then.

429
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,154
Why did you come here?

430
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:56,704
My mother won't allow me to do it because of my lousy grades.

431
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,564
That's why I'm seeking shelter here.

432
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,334
If so, you guys can draw on Ms. Jin Ning's table. Okay?

433
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:04,795
I'm going to get some water.

434
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,464

- Don't worry.

435

(A PC game)

480
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:45,004
Playing video games is the only thing you know.

481
00:28:45,004 --> 00:28:47,824
- I'll tell Ms. Zhang Ling when she returns.
- Try it if you dare.

482
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,944
<i>[Liuli Hutong]</i>

483
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:00,075
Every day,

484
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,954
I have to serve you and your daughter.

485
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:05,775
I cannot rest at ease at all.

486
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:07,335
You're right.

487
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,814
Xue is in high school now.

488
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:14,134
You should stop spoiling her and let her get into trouble.

489
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:17,804
She was a top student when she was in primary school.

490
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:20,564
She became a mediocre student when she was in junior high.

491
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:22,225
Now, she's in high school.

492
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:23,814
Everyone else is improving.

493
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:25,394
But her?

494
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:27,084
She's the last of her class.

495
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:29,135
You're right.

496
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:37,034
Tell me. Since young, I was the one in charge of supervising her homework

497
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:39,424
and attending the parents' meetings.

498
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:41,464
If I let you attend the parents' meeting for me,

499
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:43,874
I'm sure you don't even know which class she's in.

500
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:46,334
You should stop spoiling her.

501
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:48,375
She's treating you like her buddy, you know?

502
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,374
Did you become an idiot as you repaired too many watches??

503
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,224
You're right.

504
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,864
I'm right? You can skip dinner for tonight.

505
00:29:55,864 --> 00:29:57,605
That won't do.

506
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,874
Sunian, I'll return now.

507
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:04,435
Wait.

508
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,464
Ms. Yu is still furious.

509
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:09,264
Are you sure you want to return just like that?

510
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:10,980
She'll be appeased once she tells me off.

511
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,300
<i>[Good Fortune]</i>

512
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:21,504
Sunian, you're the best.

513
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:23,494
I'll make a move now. Goodbye.

514
00:30:28,255 --> 00:30:31,614
Mom, I'm back!

515
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,715
My daughter, you're back?

516
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:36,945
Mom.

517
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:38,324
I'm not your mother.

518
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:41,215
I don't have a daughter like you.

519
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,525
Mom!

520
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:50,375
Mom.

521
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:55,194
Mom, it's been one day since we met. I missed you.

522
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:58,165
I have prepared a tiny gift for you. Please accept it.

523
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,524
I won't fall for that.

524
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:04,864
You'd committed a huge mistake.

525
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,815
I won't let you off this time.

526
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:13,284
Mom, I already know my fault.

527
00:31:13,284 --> 00:31:16,264
You should stop being angry.

528
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:19,944
Don't be angry, okay?

529
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,505
Mom?

530
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,534
She's right. Please spare both of us.

531
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:27,444
- Mom.
- Honey.

532
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:30,344
- Mom.
- My love.

533
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:31,514
- Mom.
- My love.

534
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,814
That's enough.

535
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:36,515
Why can't you stop making me angry?

536
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,925
Mom.

537
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:50,714
- It does look great.
- Yeah, it looks great.

538
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:57,624
You should use the pocket money I gave you to buy food.

539
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,825
Don't buy random things like these.

540
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:04,775
All right, I'll cook dinner now.

541
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:07,714
Mom, you're the prettiest.

542
00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:09,714
Love you.

543
00:32:09,714 --> 00:32:12,035
Wash your hands and have dinner.

544
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:29,314
Mom. Time for dinner.

545
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:51,184
Zheng, the TV is faulty.

546
00:32:51,185 --> 00:32:54,565
Let's have dinner first. I'll fix it after dinner.

547
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:56,485
Eat up.

548
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:58,685
Dad's hands are used to fix cultural relics, not the TV.

549
00:33:02,955 --> 00:33:06,034
I drew on the blackboard for you when you were in primary school.

550
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:09,115
<i>You only did it once, but you've kept talking about it for a decade.</i>

551
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:13,234
So, whose idea was it?

552
00:33:13,234 --> 00:33:14,955
It was everyone's idea.

553
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:16,515
Oh.

554
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:20,264
It would be great if it were your idea.

555
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:24,764
You'll only look cute when you get into trouble like a normal kid.

556
00:33:24,764 --> 00:33:26,054
Mom.

557
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:27,995
You should stop watching those dramas.

558
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:33,195
Zheng, our son is criticizing me.

559
00:33:34,815 --> 00:33:38,974
Look. I made stir-fried pork with spicy cabbage.

560
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,174
It's so fragrant.

561
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:42,855
I just saw this dish on the TV.

562
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:53,495
Mom,

563
00:33:53,495 --> 00:33:55,324
I'm full.

564
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,954
I'll look for Zhang Qi and Sunian.

565
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,435
Why are you looking for them?

566
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:04,475
Sunian said he'd help us with our homework.

567
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,625
Stay at home.

568
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,124
You're a big girl now.

569
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:10,455
You should stop mingling with guys.

570
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:14,615
But I don't know how to answer some of the questions.

571
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:19,905
Homework questions and stomachache,

572
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:23,244
how long have you been using these two major excuses?

573
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,765
No one will trust you now.

574
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,274
But when it comes to a stomachache,

575
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,055
I think we should be cautious.

576
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,800
Mom,

577
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,600
I'll make a move now.

578
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,400
Come back early.

579
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Goodbye, Mom.

580
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It was better when she was still a little girl.

581
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
She was quiet when I held her in my arms.

582
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Now that she's all grown up,

583
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
she doesn't want to stay at home.

584
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,800
As the saying goes,

585
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,100
personality traits observed in childhood are a strong predictor of adult behavior.

586
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,900
She always made us worry even when she was little.

587
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,600
Do you still expect her to be an obedient girl right now?

588
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Say, did you think I was pregnant for 10 months

589
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,600
just so I could give birth to a naughty girl like her?

590
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,400
She was born after eight months.

591
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,600
Do you think eight months isn't enough?

592
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,800
It's more than enough.

593
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,700
What I meant was it's difficult to be a parent.

594
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,400
I'm doing everything I can

595
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,200
to raise this naughty girl, you know?

596
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You're right!

597
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,400
Zhang Qi!

598
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,020
- Zhang...
- <i>Don't hit me!</i>

599
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,700
<i> - Come over here!
- No!</i>

600
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
<i>I'm pissed off!</i>

601
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,400
<i>Look at the mess he caused.</i>

602
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,200
Seems like Ms. Zhang Ling has returned earlier than expected.

603
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,400
- <i>Come over here!</i>
- It doesn't bode well for Zhang Qi.

604
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,600
<i>Brat!</i>

605
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,200
<i>Why are you having a hotpot in our house?</i>

606
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,000
Do you wish to light our house on fire?

607
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm just being self-reliant!

608
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,500
Since when? Self-reliant?

609
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,600
I was only gone for a few days.

610
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,000
Were you trying to tear down the house?

611
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,100
You need to be reasonable!

612
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,700
<i>Did I tear down the house?</i>

613
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,600
Besides, what do you mean by a few days?

614
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
It's been two weeks!

615
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,900
When you opened the door, I thought it was another auntie.

616
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,800
You! I'll beat you up today!

617
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,600
Listen up!

618
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,300
I'll call you "Mom"...

619
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
if I don't teach you a lesson today!

620
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,400
Wait, you got the gender wrong.

621
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
You should call me Dad instead.

622
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
I!

623
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,800
You're the chief editor of a magazine firm!

624
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,600
Why are you so unreasonable?

625
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,800
If someone else saw this,

626
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,600
you'd be on the front page of your company's own magazine.

627
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,200
An able woman fell out with her family,

628
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,400
killing her own son with a feather duster!

629
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,100
Why did I give birth to a brat like you?

630
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,200
I!

631
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,400
<i>I'll beat the hell out of you!</i>

632
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,300
Help!

633
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,800
- Hello, Ms. Zhang Ling.
- Hello.

634
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Hello, Ms. Zhang Ling.

635
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Zhang Qi is so naughty.

636
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,000
I was only gone for a few days.

637
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,700
Zhang Qi is such a lazy brat.

638
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,600
He didn't even take out the trash.

639
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,600
There were cockroaches in the house.

640
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:23,384
It's been some time since I last saw you.

641
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,800
You became prettier.

642
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Mom, Sunian is going to help us out with our homework.

643
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,900
I'll leave first.

Sure.

I'll deal with him when he's back.

Sunian, I can rest at ease when you're around.

648

Go now.

Zhang Qi, can you stop making Ms. Zhang Ling angry?

653
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,100
She raised you herself, you know?

654
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,600
It's been tough on her.

655
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,500
Mom, why did you possess Shao Xue?

656
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,100
Go away!

657
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,400
That's how I get along with my mother.

658

We bicker to foster a closer relationship.

Didn't you guys realize something?

Her face glows whenever we finish arguing.

I think you meant she was fuming.

What are we doing tonight?

663

I can't return home anyway.

It's pretty late.

665

Why don't we go back home?

666

Don't.

667

Why don't we look for Wu Huan?

Sure.

They can train their skills while I can train my body.

It's beneficial for both.
