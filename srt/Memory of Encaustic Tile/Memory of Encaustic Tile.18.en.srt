00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,120
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

162
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,733
Sure.

163
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,460
I appreciate that.

164
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,340
I guess Zheng was here

165
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,800
to borrow money,

166
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,280
but he was too embarrassed to say it out loud.

167
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,900
I could tell.

168
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,720
It must be really hard for him.

169
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,270
Did you hear everything we said just now?

170
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,800
You must not tell anyone about this,

171
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,830
especially Sunian.

172
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,341
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

173
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:10,810
I feel very sorry for Mr. Zheng.

174
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,870
I feel sorry for Ms. Jin Ning

175
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,590
and Sunian, too.

176
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,780
It's okay. It's okay.

178
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,840
Last but not least, let me conclude

179
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,120
<i>["Retreating Figure" by Zhu Ziqing]</i>
the theme of this article.

180
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,240
The author used simple language to describe

181
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,360
the love a father had for his child.

182
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,650
It's full of emotion, and is delicate, genuine, and moving.

183
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,580
- From an everyday event, we were able to see a father's concern...
- Hurry up.

184
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,640
- Why are you in such a hurry?
- and care for his child.

185
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,840
They have extended the visiting hours for Ms. Jin Ning.

186
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,390
I need to be there as soon as possible.

187
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,330
All right. Class dismissed.

188
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,670
I hope you're as keen on learning.

189
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,740
- Mr. Zheng.
- Xue.

190
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,350
- Ms. Jin Ning.
- Xue.

191
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,030
You're here to visit Ms. Jin Ning, right?

192
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,270
You came at the right time.

193
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,670
You can have a chat with Ms. Jin Ning, I'm going to get some water.

<i>[Quiet]</i>

195
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,850
Ms. Jin Ning.

196
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,960
Xue, it's been a long time since I last saw you.

197
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,600
I visited you a couple of times before,

198
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,870
but you were sleeping every time I was here.

199
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,860
Sunian told me

200
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,020
you were always running errands every time you were here.

201
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,350
You were either fetching me medicine or buying takeouts,

202
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,870
and were always occupied.

203
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,670
Sunian is worn out.

204
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,420
Since I have nothing else to do, I only try to help as much as I can.

205
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,360
Yes.

206
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,950
They are worn out.

207
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,970
We finally meet.

208
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,150
There are many things

209
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,320
I want to give you.

210
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,560
Do you still remember

211
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,920
those boxes of mine?

212
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,900
Ms. Jin Ning, I want nothing from you.

213
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,470
I only wish for your recovery.

214
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,940
One day, I'll be gone forever.

215
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,680
I'm sure you'll like what I'm going to give you,

216
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,870
because... you're just like me.

217
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm reminded of my younger self

218
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,760
every time I see you.

219
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:27,435
That's why I... like you the most.

220
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,980
I like you the most too,

221
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,220
so, Ms. Jin Ning, you must hang in there.

222
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:36,595
You haven't taught me how to become someone like you.

223
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,795
Don't be someone like me.

224
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:44,585
You'll definitely be able to overtake me.

225
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:46,725
Ms. Jin Ning,

226
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,105
do you not want to talk to me anymore?

227
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:53,995
Did you say this because you're sick of me already?

228
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:57,265
I had a very smooth life...

229
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,315
before this.

230
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:08,365
I have Mr. Zheng, Sunian,

231
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:11,235
and all of you by my side.

232
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:14,985
God must be feeling jealous

233
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:18,705
and wants me to return to Him as soon as possible.

234
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,085
Ms. Jin Ning, you'll surely get better.

235
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:22,805
You have to get better.

236
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:29,185
Xue, can you do me a favor?

237
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:32,625
I'm at your service.

238
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:37,465
Take out the thing under my pillow.

239
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:49,245
This is a voice recorder I prepared for Sunian.

240
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:52,325
I told Sunian I missed you,

241
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:56,555
and he gave me this.

242
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:01,395
Make sure not to lose this.

243
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:06,985
It carries things I want to say to Sunian.

244
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:12,225
Ms. Jin Ning, whatever you want to tell Sunian,

245
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:16,065
you can tell him in person.

246
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:19,465
Every time I see you,

247
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,675
it feels as if...

248
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:26,635
joy has taken on human form.

249
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:31,645
One day, when I'm gone,

250
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:37,145
you have to share your joy with Sunian

251
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:41,935
and help him get over this.

252
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:47,575
Give me your words.

253
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:49,745
Please?

Ms. Jin Ning, what's wrong?

257
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:08,375
Ms. Jin Ning, are you all right?

Xue.

259

Can you buy me a piece?

263
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:31,765
Sure. I'll go buy you cake.

264
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,435
I'll be right back.

265
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,965
Sure.

266

Madam, do you have cakes?

270

The baker has gotten off work.

274

Is there something else you want?

275
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,575
I only need a cake.

276
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,775
I don't mind the flavors and the pattern.

277
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:25,735
It's a matter of great importance for me, I'm begging you.

278
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,405
All right. Give me a moment.

Did you buy this cake for Ms. Jin Ning?

286
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,785
What's wrong with her?

287
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:36,635
How could she make a kid buy her food?

Don't worry about it.

Xue, give it to me.

Xue has received so many cakes from Ms. Jin Ning since she was a kid.

291

Tell Jin Ning to live a long and healthy life.

292

Xue has to pay her back.

Do you think Ms. Jin Ning is still able to eat the cake?

Don't beat yourself up.

297

Ms. Jin Ning is just making a fuss.

298

In fact, she has completely lost her appetite.

You should go home now lest your mom worries about you.

I'll stay here tonight to keep Mr. Zheng company.

It's okay, Shao Hua.

303

Go home with Xue. It's late now.

- You don't have to worry about that.

305

I've already informed Dongge about this.

00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:53,055
- No, but...
- She won't worry about me.

- It's fine. We're all worried about you.

But... Zheng.

You're now the only responsible adult in the household.

Why do you...

339
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:29,805
look more ill than me?

340
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:33,135
That's not true.

341

We're doing very well.

342

Sunian, from now on,

343
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:46,455

345
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:54,685
I'll be happy when you achieve something.

00:27:55,755 --> 00:28:01,375
I'll laugh at you when you make a mistake.

00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:16,415
I wanted to take a look...

at your smiling face,

351
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:23,348
but I think...

352
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:27,065

You are good at everything,

except that you're an introvert.

358

Back then,

359
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:10,225
I was always the one

you have to do it yourself.

363
00:29:20,195 --> 00:29:22,475
I'll do it.

364
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:25,125
I can do everything by myself,

365

<i>You deserve that since you're such introverts.</i>

491
00:41:58,005 --> 00:42:02,285
<i>You never talk much to us girls.</i>

492

<i>This house used to be a haven for me.</i>
