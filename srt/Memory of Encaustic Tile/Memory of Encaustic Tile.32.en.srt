34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
So all these years, you two haven't been in touch?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,100
Did you never even try contacting her?

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
When we were in high school,

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,800
you had a crush on Xue. Right?

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,900
Yes.

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,800
I had a crush on her,

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
but when I saw her giving up the opportunity

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,100
to study abroad for you,

42
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,600
I knew then which guy was on her mind.

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Your turn to drink up now.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,100
Why did you break up?

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
If we didn't break up,

46
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,800
she would never have left this place.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Are you still waiting for her?

48
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,200
That makes two questions.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Let's drink. Cheers.

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Hey, Dad.

<i>my colleague wants to introduce you to a girl.</i>

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,100
I'm not going to any blind dates.

54
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,600
<i>Fine.</i>

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,400
I'll turn him down if you don't like it. Sure.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Mr. Zheng. It's Zhang Qi. He'll be there.

57
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,300
Don't worry. I'll make sure he goes.

58
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,900
If you're so interested in this, you should go.

59
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,100
It won't do you any harm.

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,400
Don't put Mr. Zheng in a difficult position.

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll come with you. Just for show.

62
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
Here.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
We've run out of beer. Can you go and get some?

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,800
Sure. I'll be right back.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Be quick.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hey, Ms. Anchor.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can you do me a favor tomorrow?

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,700
<i>Drink up.</i>

69
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,400
<i>That's enough, Sunian.</i>

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,000
You're going on a blind date tomorrow.

71
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,000
I never wanted to go there anyway.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,900
You have to go.

73
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,400
We all need love.

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,100
You should stop worrying about me.

75
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,000
What about yourself?

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
My love...

77
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,700
She's abroad.

78
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Let me ask you.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,900
How are things going

80
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,000
with the two of you?

81
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,700
What we have is called Platonic love.

82
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,800
We're different.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Your relationship progressed very quickly.

84
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,100
She took the initiative.

85
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,800
She took the initiative?

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,200
She took advantage of you?

87
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,400
I can't let this go.

88
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,000
I need to help you clear your name.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm not coming.

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
Why not?

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,300
I don't need that.

93
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,600
Don't you want to clear your name?

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
Zheng Sunian.

95
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,200
For me, you've always been a macho man.

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,700
Why are you acting like a coward now?

97
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,800
You are the coward.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Then, why are you afraid to come with me?

99
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm not afraid.

100
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,900
Let's go.

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,800
Let's go.

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm not coming.

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,000
You have to come.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm not coming.

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,100
Let's go.

106
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Let's go.

107
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,800
We went the wrong way.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,400
We went the wrong way.

109
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
This way.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
We've arrived. We've arrived.

111
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,600
Shao Xue. Shao Xue.

112
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Shao Xue, get out here.

113
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Stop yelling. She's asleep.

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
She's not.

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Shao Xue, get out here.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,800
I just found out that you took advantage of my brother.

117
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
You need to clear his name.

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Shout it out. Tell her to clear your name.

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
That's not going to be helpful.

120
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Those who will leave will leave.

121
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,600
It's my fault.

122
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,900
I shouldn't have egged you on.

123
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,400
I shouldn't have let the truth slip.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
It's not your fault.

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,000
It's mine.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,900
I let her go.

127
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,600
Why did you let her go? Go get her back.

128
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,900
Get her back?

129
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,400
If I see her, I'll definitely get her back.

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,200
Then, you should go get her back.

131
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,800
I wouldn't have broken up with her if I was planning to do that.

132
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
All I want is for her to leave me.

133
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
Zheng Sunian.

134
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,200
I never knew you could get so vulgar.

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,100
It's not an issue to make her stay.

136
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,200
It's easy to keep her in my arms.

137
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,200
But she has dreams...

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,100
and I don't want to hold her back.

139
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,200
She wants to see the world

140
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
and listen to new voices.

141
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,200
I have to stay here and wait for her return.

142
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,600
Until the day she's seen enough,

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,300
heard enough, had enough fun,

144
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,600
and decides to come home herself.

145
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,500
Sunian...

146
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,000
I feel so sorry for you.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Xue is too mean.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I feel so sorry for you.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's the middle of the night. What's with all this fuss?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Look at how drunk you both are.

151
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,300
What did she say?

152
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
- Go home now.
- Xue.

153
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,800
- Xue.
- Xue?

154
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,700
Xue.

155
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm Ms. Li.

156
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,100
You're not a human.

157
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,379
Xue.

158
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,000
Go home now.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,700
Quit fooling around.

160
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,800
Go home.

161
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,300
Be careful. Grab his arm.

162
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,200
Where are we going?

163
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,300
Look at these kids.

164
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,500
I don't want to sleep with you.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,700
Ms. Yu.

166
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
- Where's Xue?
- Shiyin.

167
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,800
She's not up yet.

168
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Sure. I'll go get her up.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,600
Xue, wake up.

170
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Shiyin, I haven't recovered from jet lag yet.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,900
Get up and pack your things. Dress up.

172
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,600
We're going to meet someone.

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Who's that?

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
An exceptionally good man.

175
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Why should I meet him?

176
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,500
Just to make friends.

177
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Perhaps, you'll click, then you can date him.

178
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,200
What?

179
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,500
That's great.

180
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,600
Where is he from? What is he like?

181
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Ms. Yu, he's from Beijing and is one year older than Xue.

182
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,000
He's great. There's nothing to worry about.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,700
I won't hurt Xue.

184
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,400
Xue! Hurry up and get dressed.

185
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Go and meet that guy.

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Mom, quit fooling around.

187
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm not fooling around.

188
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
Hurry up and finish your milk.

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,300
I'll go make you a sandwich.

190
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,600
You should get going after you finish your breakfast.

191
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
What are you trying to do?

192
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,100
I'm trying to help you.

193
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,800
How is this helping me?

194
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,400
Zheng Sunian is going on a blind date today. Have you heard about that yet?

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,700
How did you find out about this?

197
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
That's not the point.

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
The point is I made a reservation at the same place and at the same time.

199
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
You're going to have blind dates simultaneously.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm not coming.

201
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,000
Xue.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
He's going. And if you aren't, we'll be at a disadvantage.

203
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,800
Don't you want to see what that woman looks like?

204
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
If they end up interested in each other,

205
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,500
you'll at least be the first one to find out who snatches Sunian away from you.

206
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,379
Zhang Qi, where are you?

207
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
<i>I'm stuck on the 2nd Ring Road.</i>

208
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,000
<i>You should go on without me.</i>

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hurry up.

210
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,400
Let's find a place to sit.

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Mr. Zheng, have some tea.

212
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,600
Ms. Shao, do you want anything to drink?

213
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
A cup of coffee.

214
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,700
Do you like drinking coffee because you have been abroad for a long time?

215
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,400
Addressing you as Ms. Shao

216
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
seems to be a little too formal.

217
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Can I call you Xue?

218
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
It's better that you call me Shao.

219
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Waiter, please get us two cups of coffee.

220
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Can your colleague handle this?

221
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,600
Fret not. He works as a host.

222
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,700
He's seen all kinds of situations.

223
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,800
I heard you joined the Restoration Department right after you graduated.

224
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Yes.

225
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,600
I came across your paintings before.

226
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
They were great.

227
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,300
If it's convenient for you,

228
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,200
can you paint me one, too?

229
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,200
Shao, there's no need to be nervous.

230
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,400
It's my first time on a blind date, too.

231
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,800
I heard that you were still a student

232
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
when you were accepted by Huanyu Investment.

233
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,400
What a promising young woman.

234
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
What a coincidence. I'm going to study abroad, too.

235
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,700
Can I go and visit you?

236
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
Sure.

237
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
Your English is pretty good.

238
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,300
I'm sure it was easy for you to adapt to the lifestyle abroad, right?

239
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,400
Yes, it was easy,

240
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,500
but it's even easier to get over a breakup.

241
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,300
Actually, I've always wanted to learn how to paint,

242
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,400
but I also think it's a complex skill.

243
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,500
However complex the painting might be,

244
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,600
it's not as complex as human minds.

245
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,100
Is it that easy to get over a breakup?

246
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,200
It seems you've dumped quite a few men.

247
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
That's not true. I was the one who got dumped.

248
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,700
You're a great girl. How could anyone dump you?

249
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,500
I had no idea what was on his mind.

250
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,200
I went for an interview,

251
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,900
and he started making a fuss out of nowhere.

252
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,800
She had already found a job overseas,

253
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,300
and she still tried to hide it from me.

254
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,600
It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

255
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
I had to seize it nonetheless.

256
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,700
I had already decided not to go abroad.

257
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,600
It was easy for him, though.

258
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,300
He ended the relationship without much ado.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,700
Mr. Zheng,

260
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
why are you so quiet?

261
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
I think I've accidentally touched your wound.

262
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Let's talk about something else.

264
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,300
Let's not talk about that jerk anymore.

265
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,800
He's not exactly a jerk.

266
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, he is.

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
I've seen a lot of men like him.

268
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,700
I'm sure he was seeing another woman behind your back.

269
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,100
That's why he initiated the breakup

270
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,500
immediately when he had the chance.

271
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
That's probably it.

272
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm sure he has long erased me from his life,

273
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,400
and is attending a blind date now.

274
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Look who's talking.

275
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,400
What did I do?

276
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,800
You stayed abroad for the past two years,

277
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,400
and are attending a blind date once you get home.

278
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,800
Do you think I have to come home for a blind date?

279
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,000
There are many good men overseas.

280
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,300
Then, why did you come back?

281
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
Yes. Why did I bother to do that?

282
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,200
Shao, calm down.

283
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,500
Mr. Zhao, I've got something else to do. See you around.

284
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,100
Shao!

285
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,100
Mr. Zheng, what's going on?

286
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,700
Sorry, Ms. Bai.

287
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,200
Sorry.

288
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,100
You...

289
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I don't know what to do with these two anymore.

290
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,700
Me either.

291
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,200
They are obviously in love with each other, but none of them wants to talk to each other.

292
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
Why are they torturing themselves?

293
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Let's go. No point staying here anymore.

294
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,100
I'll get going.

295
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,800
Wait a minute.

296
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
What?

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm not going on a blind date with you.

298
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Go to hell.

299
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm about to ask you what's going on

300
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,300
with your contract girlfriend?

301
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,100
As long as I'm single,

302
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,200
there will be a big group of people worrying about me.

303
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I happen to know a female Ph.D. holder who's doing an experiment

304
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,000
about the psychology of love.

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
She was looking for a boyfriend, and I volunteered.

306
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,800
Are you crazy? Why did you agree to be a test subject?

307
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,200
What's wrong with that?

308
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,700
We meet up twice a week.

309
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,400
We're always updated with each other's lives.

310
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,800
That's way healthier than whatever relationships the rest of you are going through.

311
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,500
You're doing this so that you can approach Xue whenever you want. Right?

312
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,400
What kind of person do you think I am?

313
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Have you never thought of confessing your feelings?

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,100
Of course, I have...

315
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,300
but I'm afraid.

316
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,100
What are you afraid of?

317
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm afraid that I'll get stuck on this question.

318
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,600
What do you mean?

319
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
I like math

320
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,400
because there's an answer to every question.

321
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,300
However,

322
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I don't think I can solve a difficult question like Xue.

323
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,600
That's so moving.

There's no need for thanks.

You did me a great favor.

It's just part of my job.

378
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,000
Xue.

379
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Our company is expanding.

380
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Including you and me,

381
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,600
there were only five translators in our company.

382
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,000
Now, we have more than 20 translators.

383
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,200
We are always getting new projects.

384
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
You've certainly done me a great favor.

385
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I wonder...

386
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
if you would like to join me as a company partner.

387
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
A partner?

388
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,800
That's right.

389
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
Nothing will change regarding your job scope.

390
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,700
You will be doing what you've always done,

391
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,800
but instead of an employee, you're now the employer.

392
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
You'll be in charge of the projects.

393
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,500
You'll do the follow-up and sign the papers.

394
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,100
Of course, you'll have to help me

395
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,800
in overlooking other projects and sharing my burden.

396
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm still a newbie.

397
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
I don't think I'm a good fit.

398
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Trust me. You are.

399
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,900
That's how I can tie you up with the company.

400
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,600
Then, I won't have to worry about you leaving.

401
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Senior, I'm quite taken aback by this offer.

402
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,400
I need time to think it through.

403
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,600
Sure,

404
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,100
but this is a very rare opportunity.

405
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't keep me waiting.

406
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,200
The Chinese New Year is around the corner.

407
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,300
Do you want to take a few days off to spend the new year at home?

408
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,400
It's fine.

409
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,100
I will think about it after I finish my work.

410
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,800
You're such a workaholic.

411
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Take good care of yourself.

412
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,850
- <i>Come.
- Here.</i>

413
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,100
- Happy New Year!

414
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,600
It's not bad, right?

415
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,900
Yes, it's good.

416
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,100
Eat up.

417
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,800
I missed a dish.

418
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
Let me go get the rice cake.

419
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Let me do it, Ms. Yu.

420
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,700
You've worked all day.

421
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,800
What a good boy.

422
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Exactly.

423
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,400
Zheng, I'm so envious of you.

424
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Your kid stays with you all the time.

425
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,000
How nice.

426
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,200
Exactly.

427
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Look at Zhang Qi.

428
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,600
I feel like an abandoned old woman.

429
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,000
What are you talking about?

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We can take you in.

431
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,000
- Drink up.
- Here.
- Here.

432
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,500
Drink.

433
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,861
<i>Pang Xin. Senior. Why are you here?</i>

434
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,539
<i>We're here to pay you a visit.</i>

435
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,661
<i>Come on in.</i>

436
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,421
<i>This way.</i>

437
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:31,220
This way.

438
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,841
Have a seat.

439
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,220
Xue, it's the new year. Is that really all you're having?

440
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,059
I've gained some weight, so I'm trying to lose it.

441
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,140
You look so pale. You shouldn't be losing more weight.

442
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:46,880
It's a must to have dumplings during the new year.

443
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,499
Here. We thought that since you live alone,

444
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,320
we should pay you a visit.

445
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:54,821
Go get her chopsticks and vinegar.

446
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:57,980
- Sure. Let me go get you... some vinegar.
- It's made of pork and cabbage.

447
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:00,660
I just made them. They're still warm.

448
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,240
Let me know if there's any food you crave in the future.

449
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,020
I'll make it for you.

450
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,820
- Here.
- I've brought vinegar.

451
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,579
Try it.

452
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,601
She made it herself.

453
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:13,561
It's still warm.

454
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,819
Why are you not eating?

455
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,380
Eat up.

456
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,560
How does it taste?

457
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,221
It tastes great.

458
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:34,860
That's nice.

459
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,561
Eat more.

460
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,460
You don't have to walk us out.

461
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:54,739
You should go back now in case you catch a cold.

462
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,620
I'm fine.

463
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,221
The dumplings have kept me really warm.

464
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:00,380
All right. Get some good rest.

465
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:02,181
You should probably watch the Spring Festival Gala.

466
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:03,900
We'll get going.

467
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:06,240
Senior!

468
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,819
If the offer still stands,

469
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,000
I would like to be your partner.

470
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,739
I knew you'd come around.

471
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,700
Let's talk about the procedure

472
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,361
when we go back to the office in two days.

473
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:21,779
We've got to go.

474
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,421
- We'll get going.
- Take care.

475
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,361
Bye.

476
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,340
From now on, we are officially business partners.

477
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,999
- I look forward to working with you.
- Me, too.

478
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,380
<i>Where's your boss?</i>

479
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,901
<i>I've no idea.</i>

480
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,100
You're finally back.

481
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,460
What's going on?

482
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:41,019
While you were on your business trip,

483
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,339
Mo Hai ran away with his family.

484
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,361
They embezzled funds from the investors and misappropriated them for personal purposes.

485
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,019
Knowing that they couldn't recover the money,

486
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,460
they deceived many employees by offering them franchise opportunities.

487
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,881
I hope you aren't one of the victims.

488
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:01,921
- For example...
- I've no idea.

489
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,261
The police are waiting for you.

490
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,940
Are you Shao Xue?

491
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,900
Shao Xue, we've found your name on many illegal documents.

492
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,881
Please come with us.

493
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,920
<i>[From Mo Hai. I'm sorry.]</i>

494
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,701
You are...

495
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,019
I'm Lin, a public lawyer.

496
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,981
I'm in charge of your case.

497
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:58,561
My case?

498
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:00,020
What happened?

499
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,620
You are suspected of financial fraud

500
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:03,700
and are now under the police's investigation.

501
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,059
What should I do now?

502
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,480
I've no idea what they did.

503
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,739
The fraud Mo Hai committed involved a huge sum of money.

504
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,900
They couldn't retrieve some of the money.

505
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:14,299
Since you're his business partner, so...

506
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,020
Where is Mo Hai? Have you found him yet?

507
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,540
We haven't.

508
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,539
I need to go find him.

509
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,940
Ms. Shao.

510
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,060
You need to get some good rest.

511
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,000
According to the doctor,

512
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,521
there's something wrong with your uterus.

513
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:31,579
You have to undergo surgery as soon as possible.

514
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,700
Because of the case you are involved in,

515
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:35,941
it might be impossible to renew your work visa anymore.

516
00:30:35,941 --> 00:30:39,321
I'm afraid your medical insurance won't be able to cover this treatment.

517
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:41,380
On top of that,

518
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,480
your bank account has been temporarily frozen by the police.

519
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:55,460
Ms. Shao, you have to inform me

520
00:30:55,461 --> 00:30:58,480
about all the details regarding the documents you have signed.

<i>For the past few years,</i>

584

<i>I've visited many places</i>

00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:18,968
<i>I suddenly miss home a lot.</i>

<i>I miss the long and narrow alley.</i>

<i>I miss the encaustic tiles at the Restoration Department.</i>

They have arrested Mo Hai.

They're done with the investigation and concluded that it has nothing to do with you.

About your sickness, what are you planning to do with it?

608

I want to go home.

609
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:49,408
Sunian.

610
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:53,169
This is great.

611
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:58,067
After I retire, I'll have to visit the British Museum

612
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:00,589
to take a good look at their collections.

613
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:02,268
If that's what you want,

614
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:04,148
you can go there on Labor Day next year.

615
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:06,689
I can't go there just yet.

616
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:10,128
I haven't saved enough for your wedding yet.

617
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,269
I've had everything planned out.

618
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:16,508
I'll only do things after you get married.

619
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:20,689
Dad, I want you to make friends with the neighbors.

620
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:23,408
I didn't expect you to get influenced by them.

621
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,468
Influenced?

622
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:27,667
My son doesn't even have a girlfriend.

623
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:30,668
I'm too embarrassed to make friends with them.

624
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:37,668
Look.

625
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:40,049
Look at the small black fish.

626
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:42,748
Can you see it?

627
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:45,628
What's wrong with it?

628
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:50,128
Back then, this little black fish was all alone.

629
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:52,508
It always stayed in this corner motionlessly.

630
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:56,429
It didn't make friends with any other fish.

631
00:37:56,429 --> 00:37:59,828
Later, I noticed that it had become good friends

632
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:02,028
with this spotted fish.

633
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,828
Since they've become a couple,

634
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,667
they are now full of energy.

635
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,028

637
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:15,149
I always get disturbed at the wrong time.

638
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:18,989
Xue, time to wake up.

639
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:21,949
I just underwent surgery.

640
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:24,828
I need time to recuperate.

641
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:27,308
That's enough.

642
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:29,749
It's been over a month.

643
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:33,169
The doctor said you were as fit as a fiddle.

644
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:36,428
You're too cruel.

645
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:37,547
Me? Cruel?

646
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,588
I've even gotten the breakfast ready for you.

647
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,649
You're too nice.

648
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:45,908
Xue, after you have your breakfast,

649
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,267
why not go home?

650
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:48,849
It's been over a month.

651
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,709
Your parents must be worried about you.

652
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:53,568
Going home in this state

653
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:56,187
will only make my mom more worried.

654
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:58,988
I need to first find a good job.

655
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:03,209
Then, I can reassure my mom when I go home.

656
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,267
I'll get you a job.

657
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,288
Wash up.

658
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:10,528
Really?

659
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,429
Of course.

660
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:16,249
I've got a surprise for you today.

661
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:17,829
Sure.

662
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:19,288
Go.

663
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,468
Hurry up.

664
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:38,789
Hey!

665
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:41,369
I've gotten everything ready. How about you?

666
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,249
<i>I'll get to work right away.</i>

667
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:48,788
Are these all from Zhang Qi?

668
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:50,148
Yes.

669
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:51,667
They are health supplements.

670
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:54,448
He's now acting like a personal shopper.

671
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,308
Old Shao.

672
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:58,369
Old Shao, come take a look at this.

673
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:00,868
Look at what this kid sent us.

674
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:02,389
Look.

675
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:03,547
Old Shao.

676
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,868
- I have something to share with you.
- Zheng.

677
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:07,428
I have something to share with you.

678
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:08,707
This is great.

679
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:11,608
Look at this. I've spent half a day admiring this.

680
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:15,788
Not only is Zhang Qi a bright kid,

681
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,667
but he also cares for the elders.

682
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,827
Why have I not realized it sooner when he was a kid?

683
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:21,747
You all grew up together.

684
00:40:21,748 --> 00:40:24,627
Comparing Zhang Qi to our Xue,

685
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:27,708
the only thing she does is give us a call during festive seasons.

686
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,267
We don't even get to see her in person.

687
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:31,769
She's an adult now. It's time to let go.

688
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:35,067
I can let go if she's going to get married.

689
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:36,388
She's an adult now.

690
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:39,648
Zheng, every time I ask if she has a boyfriend,

691
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,088
she keeps quiet.

692
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:43,388
When I tell her to go on a blind date, she refuses it vehemently.

693
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:45,107
She really is ruffling my feathers.

694
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:46,308
Look at Sunian.

695
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:48,588
He's only two years older than Xue, and he's also not in a hurry.

696
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:51,047
- Just now...
- Dad.

697
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:54,428
You can't compare a boy to a girl.

698
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,547
Look at those folks from the Restoration Department.

699
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:59,247
- Look at Li and Yang. They are grandparents now.
- That's right.

700
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,707
Look at us.

701
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,409
I don't even know if I can get a son-in-law.

702
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:05,409
Let's not talk about this anymore.

703
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:08,329
What about Sunian? Is he seeing anyone?

704
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:11,329
Sunian, do you have a girlfriend?

705
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:14,048
There's another box by the door. It's meant for Mr. Sun.

706
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:16,448
Have fun chatting. I'll deliver that to him.

707
00:41:16,448 --> 00:41:17,989
Sunian!

708
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:20,988
These kids...

709
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:22,828
Whenever I pose a personal question,

710
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:25,629
they find an excuse to leave.

711
00:41:25,629 --> 00:41:26,889
Let's not talk about him anymore.

712
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:28,627
At least, you get to see him every day.

713
00:41:28,628 --> 00:41:32,008
Xue... Let me give her a call.

714
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:35,487
What if she's busy right now? How can you call her out of the blue?

715
00:41:35,487 --> 00:41:38,422
She'll call you when she's free.

716
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:40,203
Don't worry.

717
00:41:42,182 --> 00:41:44,701
Look at the craftsmanship.

718
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,643
You simply want me to stop disturbing you.

719
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:49,862
How does it taste?

720
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:52,243
It tastes great.

721
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,942
Shiyin, you're so nice to me.

722
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,382
Why not be my boyfriend?

723
00:41:58,063 --> 00:41:59,141
No.

724
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,302
Sunian will kill me if I become your boyfriend.

725
00:42:06,302 --> 00:42:07,742
Xue.

726
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:10,482
Have you not spoken to Sunian yet

727
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:12,883
since you got back?

728
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:20,102
Now that you've decided to stay,

729
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:25,321
why not consider getting back together with Sunian?

730
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:31,581
You were abroad for a long time,

731
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,502
and Sunian has been waiting for you.

732
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:36,623
Why is he waiting for me?

733
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:38,382
Isn't that obvious?

734
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:40,663
He's in love with you.

735
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:44,281
If he loved me, he wouldn't have broken up with me.

736
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,822
You can't blame Sunian for that.

737
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,382
It's my fault, then.

738
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:52,283
None of you are to blame.

739
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:54,582
The only person at fault is Zhang Qi.

740
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:56,483
What does it have to do with Zhang Qi?

741
00:42:57,223 --> 00:43:00,362
When you had a fight with Sunian,

742
00:43:00,362 --> 00:43:03,463
Zhang Qi wanted to give Sunian some advice.

743
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:06,682
However, he accidentally let slip

744
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:09,962
the reason you gave up the chance to study abroad when you were in high school.

745
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:16,961
Sunian didn't want you to turn down another good opportunity because of him.

746
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,261
That's why he decided to break up with you.

747
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:21,101
He was sad, too.

748
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:23,383
He only attended those blind dates

749
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:25,943
because he didn't want to upset his dad.
