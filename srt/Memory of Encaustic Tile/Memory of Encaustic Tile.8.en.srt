Oh, I forgot. You guys aren't qualified.

160

- I'll leave then if you're not going.
- Okay, bye.

161
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,319
I'm leaving, smart kid.

162
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,670
Bye-bye, smug kid.

<i>Sunian has a fever, and he's alone at home.</i>

166
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,559
<i>Go check on him.</i>

167
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,409
Sunian has a fever?

168
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,149
<i>Yes. Buy some food for him as well while you are at it.</i>

169
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:58,420
I have no money.

170
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,090
Mom.

171
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,490
What did you say about Sunian just now?

172
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,079
He has a fever.

173
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,919
That's probably because he got drenched in the rain.

174
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,899
I'll go and check on him while you buy some tonics.

175
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,129
- I have no money.
- Where did you spend your money?

176
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,129
I bought popsicles with it.

177
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,369
Just do as you see fit.

178
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,730
I'm going now.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,600
Sunian, are you okay?

180
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,500
Sunian, are you okay?

181
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000

185

How am I supposed to know?

186
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,100
Why don't you add indigo woad root into his instant noodles?

I'm being serious.

the more expensive it is, the better for the body.

190

Five minutes.

After that,

206
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,400
I'll cook these vegetables for another five minutes.

207

Cooking noodles. I've been waiting for a long time, but nothing happened.

212
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
You didn't turn the stove on. Do you expect the noodles to cook themselves?

213
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
I forgot about that.

214
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Sinian, eat something.

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
Here, try it. Open your mouth.

216
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,800

Mom, why did you take these out?

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,500
To show Xue.

261
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,600
Why are you showing her these?

262
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Because you looked adorable.

263
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,400
Besides, Xue is stressed out about her studies, isn't she?

264
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,600
I encouraged her by telling her

265
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
that studying makes people happy.

266
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Back then, Sunian wasn't good at his studies too.

267
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
At that time, he kept pulling a long face.

268
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,600
He looked so serious.

269
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
I didn't know what happened then.

270
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,800
After 5th Grade, his performance improved all of a sudden.

271
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,300
From then on,

272
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,000
he always smiles when taking pictures.

273
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
Mom, stop spreading my dark history.

274
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, I forgot to show Xue

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,700
the pictures of you in girls' clothing.

276
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll show her next time.

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,300
What's wrong with wearing girls' clothing?

278
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,000
It's not like I showed her the pictures of you in split crotch pants.

279
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
Mom,

280
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
I'm still sick.

281
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,600
I won't give it to you even if you're sick.

282
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600

Don't worry.

289
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Both families arranged your marriage since you were young.

290
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,800
I already took care of this matter a long time ago.

291
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,000
Xue can't escape.

292
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
But Zhang Qi's family did the same.

293
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Didn't you have a fight with Zhang Ling over this?

294
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,500
She kept saying her son is more compatible with Xue.

295
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,000
I said otherwise.

296
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,300
They both have different eyes. How is that compatible?

297
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,000
That's why she got upset.

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You can't bring up his flaws.

299
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,600
But he did look ugly when he was born.

300
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Jin Ning, you're back.

301

Sunian, entertain your friend.

304
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,700
I'm going to scoop the rice.

305
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,000
Why are you here?

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
What kind of attitude is this?

307
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,500
I came to freeload.

308
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,200
Zhang Qi, eat more.

309
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000

312
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,400
Should be enough, right?

313
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Zhang Qi, Mr. Zheng's cooking is very good.

314
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
Come here for a meal when you're free.

315
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,800
- Eat more.
- You have to pay for food, then.

316
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,000
We're all families here. There's no need to pay for food. Am I right?

317
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,900
Xue.

318
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,700
Sunian, is your fever gone?

319
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
I was about to see you.

320
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,300
Why?

321
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,300
To thank you.

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Sunian, tell you what.

323
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
I moved all my novels and tapes from my room

324
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,000
to my mom's room.

325
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,500
I need to get rid of distractions to study well.

326
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,800
If you really want to study well,

327
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,000
there's no need to do that.

328
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,900
You have a point.

329
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,000
After I moved them all there, I regretted it so much.

330
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,200
I want to move them back to my room secretly.

331
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,400
Why are you looking at me?

332
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,900
Nothing.

333
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,600
I just think you usually look quite gentle.

334
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,000
But why did you look so fierce in your pictures?

335
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Do I look that fierce in the pictures?

336
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,700
A grim face. Like someone that we shouldn't mess with.

337
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,000
That's true though.

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
By the way, Ms. Jin Ning said

339
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,800
your grades suddenly improved since 5th Grade.

340
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,700
She said you suffered a blow.

341
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
What was it? Tell me.

342
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,200
See if it can provoke me.

343
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I'd forgotten about it.

344
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
Boring.

345
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,900
<i>Xue, did you buy vinegar?</i>

346
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,200
Yes!

347
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
I have to go now.

348
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,400
Thank you for your chocolates.

349
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,900
<i>Zheng Sunian failed his test.</i>

350
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,700
<i>[Grade 5 Math Test Paper]
He actually failed?</i>

351
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,000
<i>The questions I got were different from yours.</i>

352
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
<i>That's embarrassing.</i>

353
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,700
<i>I won't call you Sunian from now on.</i>

354
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,900
<i>I'll call you "Flunked."</i>

355
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,500
<i>You can address me as "elder brother" from now on.</i>

356
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,200
<i>I'll never flunk my math' test.</i>

357
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
<i>No. I'm Xue's elder brother.</i>

358
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,500
<i>Only those with good grades can be my elder brother.</i>

359
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
<i>Xue, time to eat!</i>

360
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,600
<i>Flunked. Flunked. Flunked.</i>

361
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,800
<i>Flunked. Flunked!</i>

362
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,800
Mr. Zheng, the gears are so damaged.

363
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,400
Why don't you get a new one?

364
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
How can I change it without any reference?

365
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,200
Just find one that fits.

366
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Won't that work?

367
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,800
Mr. Shao, Mr. Zheng is ignoring me again.

368
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,000
Your idea and manners are wrong.

369
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
He couldn't answer you even if he wanted to.

370
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,600
Bring me the little brush.

371
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:22,094
We're doing cultural relics restoration here, not reconstruction work.

372
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:25,584
Every step of the restoration of cultural relics must have references.

373
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:29,414
If everyone thinks like you and changes the damaged parts all the time,

374
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,544
it won't be the emperor's clock, but yours after you fix it.

375
00:22:33,544 --> 00:22:36,755
But I think we still need to embellish it a little.

376
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,485
Just like when women put on makeup.

377
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:41,184
They cover flaws with makeup.

378
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,875
Even makeup has to follow the original outline.

379
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,724
If your girlfriend's makeup made her look completely different,

380
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:49,035
would you dare to admit you know her?

381
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,025
Mr. Sun, is this okay?

382
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:17,585
Not quite.

383
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:19,485
It lacks some yellow color.

384
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:25,894
Mr. Sun, look at mine.

385
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:27,615
I've been polishing this for four to five months.

386
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,855
Am I good at it now?

387
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,005
Look at what you did.

388
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:32,715
There are prints all over.

389
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,065
What's so funny?

390
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:39,375
Eat less spicy food in the morning from now on.

391
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,144
Your lips are all red.

392
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:43,915
It's not from spicy food. It's lipstick.

393
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:47,124
All the more reason for you to quit using it. It contains chemical substances.

394
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:51,525
You already look so pretty.

395
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,425
Why do you still...

396
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,785
So pretty.

397
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:00,905
Mr. Sun, we're out of the yellow color.

398
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:03,175
Borrow some from the Calligraphy Division.

399
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:08,934
Shiyin, we can't sit together anymore.

400
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:12,314
Xue, you must study hard, okay?

401
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:13,754
What should I do?

402
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:16,824
Study hard so we can sit together again. Right?

403
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:26,295
Please keep quiet.

404
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,944
Let me introduce you to these new students

405
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:31,834
who were recently assigned to our class.

406
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:34,524
Now then, please introduce yourself.

407
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:36,214
Hello, my name is Wu Nana.

408
00:24:36,214 --> 00:24:38,074
I used to be the commissary in charge of literature and art

409
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:39,624
in Class 3 and a member of the school's choir group.

410
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:41,794
I enjoy talking, laughing and singing.

411
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:45,045
I hope we'll be friends in the future.

412
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:51,054
Hello, everyone. My name is Yu Huai. My zodiac sign is Cancer.

413
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,985
I hope we can get along well.

414
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:59,214
Hello... Hello, everyone.

415
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,174
I'm Tang Ya.

416
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:03,105
I was from Class 10.

417
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:05,704
Louder! I can't hear you.

418
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,215
She said her name was Tang Ya.

419
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,954
All right. Get back to your seat.

420
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:12,895
You'll be in the same class from now on.

421
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:15,515
You must help each other out.

422
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:20,914
Hello, everyone. My name is Zhang Qi. I was in your class.

423
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,724
Why are you back here instead of joining the competition class?

424
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:25,124
I'm leaving soon.

425
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,944
I need to say goodbye to my friends.

426
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,345
All right. Go ahead.

427
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,494
From today on, I'll be joining the competition class.

428
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:35,664
We won't be able to see each other again.

429
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,415
Don't miss me.

430
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,824
Go back to your class now. No one will miss you.

431
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:44,685
In any case, you can't control me anymore.

432
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,805
Hi, I'm Shao Xue.

433
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,614
I'm Tang Ya.

434
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:56,004
Hello. Have a candy.

435
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:16,315
The competition class is too far.

436
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,070
<i>[Competition Class]</i>

437
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:33,985
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Qi.

438
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:37,655
I'm new here.

439
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,155
Close the door.

440
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,520
<i>[Keep Silent]</i>

441
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:50,834
I'm new here. Where do I sit?

442
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:54,534
Please go to your seat now. Don't disturb others.

443
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:24,584
When you're home, ponder the meaning of this paragraph.
<i>["How the Steel Was Tempered"]</i>

444
00:27:24,584 --> 00:27:26,405
Okay, class dismissed.

445
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:30,324
- Where are you going?
- The radio station.

446
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:34,985
Shao Xue, come here.

447
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:47,975
Yes, Mr. Liu.

448
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:51,575
You looked scared. It's good news.

449
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:54,664
You know that our school is linked with higher learning institutions overseas.

450
00:27:54,664 --> 00:27:58,044
Several representatives from these higher learning institutions will visit the school this time.

451
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:01,514
So we need a student interpreter to showcase the life of students in our school.

452
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,954
The teachers have discussed this and decided to give you this chance.

453
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:06,834
- Really?
- Yes.

454
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,795
First, the English teacher recommended you.

455
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:12,184
Second, photo and video taking are required during the visitation.

456
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:15,235
You are more photogenic.

457
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,360
I think so, too.

458
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:20,585
Do your best, okay? This can give you extra points.

459
00:28:20,585 --> 00:28:23,484
Okay. I won't let you down.

460
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,744
I look forward to it. Go back to your seat.

461
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:34,325
Xue, what was that about?

462
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,864
The foreign school's representatives are visiting us.

463
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:37,525
He recommended me to be the interpreter.

464
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:38,525
Not bad.

465
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,045
That's impressive.

466
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:42,625
I can only boast about my English.

467
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,344
My English is very poor.

468
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:46,424
I can't seem to improve it.

469
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,514
If you have any problems, you can ask me. I'll teach you.

470
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:51,434
Really? Thank you so much.

471
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:52,584
You're welcome.

472
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:56,014
<i>Hello, everyone. I'm your announcer for today, Lin Shiyin.</i>

473
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:59,074
<i>Next, I'll play a song which was requested</i>

474
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:01,225
<i>by a student who wished to remain anonymous.</i>

475
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:03,955
<i>This is for Wang Haoran from Class 2, Grade 11.</i>

476
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:05,995
<i>The song is called "The Little Li Flying Dagger".</i>

477
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:10,455
Why is it "The Little Li
Flying Dagger" again?

478
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:12,914
Have you noticed it too?
<i> [Chinese Language]</i>

479
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,894
This song plays once a week.

480
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:17,174
Do many people like this song?

481
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,074
It was requested by the same person.

482
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:21,555
But it's dedicated to different people, that's all.

483
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:24,415
Dedicate to different people?

484
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:28,484
Wang Haoran is the president of the Drama Club.

485
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:31,584
Is he good-looking?

486
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:34,774
I didn't know you were into gossip.

487
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,654
I never had any friends.

488
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:42,655
I thought others might ask me to join the conversation if I knew some gossip.

489
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:46,969
In the end, it's useless.

490
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:49,554
It's okay. I'll be your friend in the future.

491
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,354
If you have any problems, you can ask me.

492
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,174
Just ignore all that random stuff.

493
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:57,224
♫ <i>The knot of love can't be untied</i> ♫

494
00:29:57,224 --> 00:30:00,744
<i>It's already noon. Let's have lunch together later.</i>

495
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:01,895
<i>I'll have to pass.</i>

496
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:04,484
I'm going to the department store with Shao Hua later.

497
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:07,084
I'm here to deliver this pickled radish.

498
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:08,794
I'm addicted to it now.

499
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:11,525
I can't enjoy my meal without this now.

500
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:16,004
Is Mr. Shao buying you a present from the department store?

501
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,434
Not at all. He ran out of clam oil.

502
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:22,895
He insisted that I go with him.

503
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:24,715
I'll get going now.

504
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:27,704
Wait. You have to watch out.

505
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:29,085
Watch what?

506
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:30,985
Your image. Sit down.

507
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:32,804
Let me fix your hair.

508
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:33,975
What's wrong with my hair?

509
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:37,265
It's everywhere and messy.

510
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:39,894
Nobody's looking anyway.

511
00:30:39,894 --> 00:30:41,694
Mr. Shao will be looking.

512
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:43,495
Him?

513
00:30:43,495 --> 00:30:46,584
It's been so many years. He's already tired of it.

514
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:50,855
That's why you need to style it differently.

515
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:54,374
Secret weapon.

516
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:55,865
No, I'm not putting that on.

517
00:30:55,865 --> 00:30:59,325
Don't run. Sit down. Listen to me.

518
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:02,475
You'll look pretty after putting this on.

519
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:09,975
This color flatters the skin complexion.

520
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,695
Rub your lips together.

521
00:31:17,865 --> 00:31:22,344
I remember I wore it once on my wedding day.

522
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:24,525
It's been more than twenty years.

523
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:28,815
It's a little sticky.

524
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:32,454
See? You look 20 years younger after wearing it.

525
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:36,014
Really? It looks okay?

526
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:41,954
Every time I wore it, Zheng Jin would try to please me.

527
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:43,385
Cut it out.

528
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:46,494
Even if you don't wear it, he still treats you well.

529
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:49,585
He treats me even better if I wear it.

530
00:31:49,585 --> 00:31:53,285
Go and stun the Watchmaker Division.

531
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:57,255
Okay.

532
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:00,475
You look pretty.

533
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:14,315
Zheng, help me take a look at this.

534
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:19,954
What's wrong?

535
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:22,075
It's moving together.

536
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:25,324
Did you close up the gear?

537
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:27,885
I've already checked it.

538
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:32,074
Shao Hua, let's go.

539
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:34,115
Okay, soon.

540
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:36,975
Hey, what happened to your lips?

541
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:39,764
Nothing.

542
00:32:39,764 --> 00:32:42,294
Wait. Come and let me see it.

543
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,694
Fine, look all you want! What's there to look at?

544
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:46,140
Hurry up. I'll wait for you at the entrance.

545
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,930
Yes.

546
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:50,745
What's going on?

547
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:53,644
What's with that temper? She probably had too much heaty food.

548
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,805
I'll be there right away.

549
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:00,414
How did you know?

550
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:03,914
Didn't you see how red her lips are?

551
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:08,134
You see, Jin Ning's lip will turn red when she has internal heat.

552
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:10,725
I'd stew some pears for her.

553
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,124
We had chicken with Sichuan chili peppers yesterday.

554
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,034
She must have suffered from the spiciness.

555
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,324
The spiciness goes to the lips.

556
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,324
I'll buy her a couple of pears after getting off work.

557
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,994
I'll get going now. We'll continue this afternoon.

558
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:25,655
Hop on the bicycle.

559
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:28,714
Is your internal heat increasing because of Xue?

560
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:30,975
Who's got internal heat?

561
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,434
Don't worry.

562
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:36,514
Xue is working hard for the twinning program.

563
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,755
Relax for a bit, okay?

564
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:41,105
I'm precisely worried about her working hard on this.

565
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:44,304
She can still cause a lot of trouble even when she's studying here.

566
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:47,114
If she really goes overseas, can I still sleep at ease?

567
00:33:47,114 --> 00:33:50,045
I'd be worried sick all day.

568
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:51,194
I've already decided.

569
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:55,564
I need to talk to her about furthering her studies locally

570
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:57,145
and stop thinking about other options.

571
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:58,954
That will be hard.

572
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:02,034
You see, Xue liked looking at the map since she was young.

573
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:04,494
She always said she wanted to see the world since young.

574
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:07,864
Isn't there a saying that the further up you hold your chopsticks,

575
00:34:07,864 --> 00:34:09,444
the further you will go?

576
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:12,064
You already saw how high up she hold her chopsticks

577
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:16,994
Even if you suppress her thoughts now, she'll suffer mentally.

578
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:19,434
So are we going to let her do what she wants?

579
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:24,215
Can you be at ease to see your daughter travel so far?

580
00:34:24,215 --> 00:34:26,795
We can't force it anyway.

581
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:29,274
We'll try to talk her out of it without going straight to the point.

582
00:34:29,274 --> 00:34:33,465
Kids nowadays become even more rebellious if they're forced.

583
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:35,424
You spoiled her.

584
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:36,724
Are you still going?

585
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:39,154
- I'll go home if you're not.
- Yes, we're going.

586
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:40,970
Get on.

587
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,265
Let's go.

588
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,105
<i>Why are you so light?</i>

589
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:49,844
Go on.

590
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:53,255
<i>Please be careful before turning.</i>

591
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,504
Zhang Qi, tell you what.

592
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:57,845
I was the only one chosen among all the students at school.

593
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,254
You have to be careful then.

594
00:34:59,254 --> 00:35:02,824
I'm warning you. Your face will look huge on the screen.

595
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:04,585
Just go home!

596
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:09,954
Sunian, how can I make myself sound like a native speaker?

597
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:11,985
Watch foreign films and read novels.

598
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,135
The lines are more conversational.

599
00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:17,874
Ms. Jin Ning did give several foreign novels to me.

600
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:19,684
The generational gap is too big.

601
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,784
It's better to watch "Harry Potter."

602
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:22,804
You have a point.

603
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:24,134
Xue.

604
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:25,074
Ms. Liu.

605
00:35:25,074 --> 00:35:27,044
I heard you're showing foreigners around the school.

606
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:29,535
Even the TV station is shooting it. That's impressive.

607
00:35:29,535 --> 00:35:30,804
Not really.

608
00:35:30,804 --> 00:35:33,444
When you've become successful, don't forget me. Okay?

609
00:35:33,444 --> 00:35:34,684
I won't forget you.

610
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:35,885
Enjoy yourselves.

611
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:36,845
See you, Ms. Liu.

612
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,785
<i>See you.</i>

613
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:41,115
How did Ms. Liu know about this?

614
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:43,135
- Xue.
- Mr. Zhang.

615
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:44,844
All of you are here.

616
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:49,544
Xue, I heard a foreign TV station is going to interview you.

617
00:35:49,544 --> 00:35:52,275
That's impressive.

618
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,564
How did Mr. Zhang find out?

619
00:35:57,564 --> 00:35:58,944
- Xue!
- Ms. Li.

620
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:03,674
I heard you're representing Beijing for an interview.

621
00:36:03,674 --> 00:36:05,760
<i>[Beijing Qiming High School]</i>
That's awesome.

622
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,604
Keep a low profile.

623
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:10,435
Come on, it's a good thing.

624
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:13,394
I will help you publicize it.

625
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:14,535
Ling!

626
00:36:14,535 --> 00:36:16,655
- What is it?
- Listen, Xue is going

627
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:19,825
- to give a speech at the embassy.
- Really?

628
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:21,464
Yes!

629
00:36:21,464 --> 00:36:24,654
I think you'll be meeting the foreign head of state later.

630
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:25,574
Get lost.

631
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,684
I'm afraid the foreign head of state will have to receive her.

632
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,564
Enough already. Let's just go back.

633
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:31,015
Let's go.

634
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:35,315
You're home.

635
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:40,004
I've heard Xue is going to give a speech at the embassy.

636
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:43,785
No, she's going to take office at the embassy.

637
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,204
Don't listen to Ms. Li.

638
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,724
Then, what is it about?

639
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:52,384
A foreign institution is visiting the school.

640
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:55,205
So they asked Xue to be the interpreter.

641
00:36:56,475 --> 00:37:01,034
Does it involve the twinning program?

642
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,114
I don't think so.

643
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:05,385
The teachers want to let our kid show her skills.

644
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:07,024
It's a good thing.

645
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,865
That's great.

646
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:10,665
What is she doing?

647
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:12,985
Working hard.

648
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:17,155
Working hard?

649
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:26,524
I couldn't remember the new password to get inside.

650
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,114
Keep your voice down.

651
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:30,724
- Are you reading novels again?
- Never...

652
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:32,805
I'm practicing my speaking skills.

653
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:35,125
That's right. I'm the witness.

654
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,724
Her pronunciation is native-like.

655
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:38,304
It's a British accent.

656
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:41,175
How do you know if it's native-like?

657
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:44,364
Besides, you're up to something.

658
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:45,694
Why are you practicing speaking skills?

659
00:37:45,694 --> 00:37:47,524
This won't be tested in the National College Entrance Exam.

660
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:51,624
Mom, I'll be interpreting for the foreign teachers.

661
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:54,804
- If I don't speak well, won't they laugh at me?
- That's right.

662
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:57,544
- After they laugh at me, they'll laugh at our school.
- You're right.

663
00:37:57,544 --> 00:38:00,524
After laughing at our school, they'll laugh at Beijing and say,

664
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:03,345
"Is this the English level of the youngsters in Beijing?"

665
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:04,734
Do you understand?

666
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:06,885
Fine.

667
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,944
You always said I nag too much.

668
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:10,945
Compared to you, you're worse than me.

669
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:13,094
Enough. Don't disturb her.

670
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:15,025
Keep practicing.

671
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:17,605
What are you doing?

672
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:19,315
Drink this.

673
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,445
You made this pear soup?

674
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:26,084
What are you up to? Why did you make this?

675
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,994
Didn't you suffer from internal heat?

676
00:38:27,994 --> 00:38:29,864
Who says so?

677
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:32,924
Look at the color of your lips.

678
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:34,254
I had free time.
<i>(Same pronunciation as salty food)</i>

679
00:38:34,254 --> 00:38:35,834
All the more reason for you to drink this.

680
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,025
Too much salt is bad for the heart.

681
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:38,995
Jin Ning?

682
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:40,154
Shao Hua.

683
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,214
Dongge, look at this.

684
00:38:42,214 --> 00:38:44,644
This dress has a huge hole from being ripped at the corner of the table.

685
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:46,174
Do you think you can fix this?

686
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:47,734
What a huge hole.

687
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:49,654
Ms. Jin Ning, you're here.

688
00:38:49,654 --> 00:38:51,784
You are becoming more and more beautiful.

689
00:38:51,784 --> 00:38:55,315
What a sweet talker. I put on some makeup today.

690
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:58,954
Jin Ning went to receive some foreign guests today.

691
00:38:58,954 --> 00:39:00,594
That's impressive.

692
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:01,984
Not as impressive as you.

693
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:07,195
Sunian told me that Xue is promising.

694
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,244
By the way, do you have any proper clothing?

695
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:12,235
Why don't you pick a couple from my wardrobe? Let's go.

696
00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:15,464
It's okay. She can just wear her school uniform.

697
00:39:15,464 --> 00:39:17,195
You're right about that.

698
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:20,194
Ms. Jin Ning, do we need to pay attention to clothing, too?

699
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,984
After all, you're meeting foreigners.

700
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,024
You should take note of your appearance and apparel.

701
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:28,495
But the school uniform is pretty good.

702
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:33,435
Then do you think I need makeup?

703
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:35,654
Why are you getting carried away?

704
00:39:35,654 --> 00:39:37,954
Why do you want to wear makeup when you're only a student?

705
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,904
Carry on with your studies.

706
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:41,630
Go ahead.

707
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:47,064
Dongge, it's normal for a child Xue's age to want to look pretty.

708
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:50,045
Moreover, she's doing it for an official matter.

709
00:39:50,045 --> 00:39:53,994
I think she should focus on being a student now.

710
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:57,404
When she enters university, no one will control her anymore.

711
00:39:57,404 --> 00:39:59,554
- She can pay more attention to her appearance then.
- That's right.

712
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:02,895
Jin Ning, come. Try the peach soup I made.

713
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:05,304
I just had this at home.

714
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:06,994
Did you have internal heat, too?

715
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:10,654
- No.
- He made pear soup because of Zheng.

716
00:40:10,654 --> 00:40:12,934
- Trying to please.
- Come, sit down.

717
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:13,905
Try it out.

718
00:40:13,905 --> 00:40:17,234
<i>Why not then? I can try Mr. Shao's cooking.</i>

719
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:20,255
Of course, you need to wear makeup.

720
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:21,804
Foreign girls usually wear makeup.

721
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:25,285
You're the only one who wears makeup around me.

722
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:27,694
Tang Ya, do you usually wear makeup?

723
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:29,605
I...

724
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:32,244
It's against the school regulations.

725
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:35,134
You're receiving foreign guests. Wearing makeup is a form of etiquette.

726
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:37,134
Then, I should wear some makeup

727
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,874
to make our school proud. Am I right?

728
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,420
