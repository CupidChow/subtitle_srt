I went to the Restoration Department, but I couldn't find you.

I didn't want you to misunderstand me.

That's why I didn't tell you in advance.

But I've made up my mind now.

I saw your drawing of our apartment in your room earlier.

I really liked every piece of it.

No, thanks.

61
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,530
Why would he break up with me?

62
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,560
Perhaps,

63
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,930
Sunian is facing some problems too.

64
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,140

How could he break up with me just like that?

68
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,950
I wonder what these men are thinking about.

69
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,930
What would you do if Wu Huan wanted to break up

70

71
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,880
He already did.

72
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,250

73
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,710
That day when Sunian dressed as Harry Potter.

Both of us aren't compatible.

75

We had too many problems.

76

What's the difference then?

77
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,760
He also broke up with you just like that.

78
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,230
Why don't you talk to him again tomorrow?

79
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,970

People usually encourage union.

101
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,390
I broke up, too.

102
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,450
I'm not surprised.

103
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,090
But it is peculiar that you both broke up around the same time.

105

Yunjin initiated the breakup.

106
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,000
She left right after that and has vanished ever since.

107
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,400
All women are the same.

108
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,340
They're cold and ruthless.

109
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,660
How so?

110
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,900
You've turned into this. What else can she do?

111
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,360
What have I turned into?

112
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,960
Do you see her in your future?

113
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,450
What do you mean by that?

114
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,170
I work hard every day to make money. Who else if not for her?

115
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,100
You are clearly doing it for yourself.

For me?

117
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,690
Is it for me that I socialize and get drunk every day?

118
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,910
Is it for me that I bought a house that she likes?

119
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,880
Is it for me that I have to beg others to give her a job?

120
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,080
She doesn't understand me at all.

121
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,910
Exactly. And that's why she'd rather break up with you than be a burden on you.

122
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,510

I'm asking you a question.

222
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,000
Why did you break up with Xue?

223
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
I know you heard me.

224
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,100
Zheng Sunian!

225
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,800
Why did you break up with Xue?

226
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,200
Fine.

227
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,900
Breaking up is fine.

228
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,000
But why won't you see her?

229
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
How could you let her sit alone

230
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,800
at the door for so long in the middle of the night?

231
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
If I saw her,

232
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
we'd reconcile.

233
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,800
Just reconcile, then.

234
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,200
I told you to let her go, not break up with her.

235
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,000
Is there a difference?

236
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
There's a huge difference.

237
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
Breaking up is between two people.

238
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
Have you asked Xue about it? Have you considered her feelings?

239
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,500
You didn't tell her anything.

240
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,700
How selfish of you!

241
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000

246
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:21,055
Zheng Sunian. Zheng Sunian.

Zheng Sunian!

248
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,135
Why are you avoiding me?

249
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:35,335
I just don't see why we need to meet up again.

250
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,325
Why is there no reason for us to meet?

251
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:41,785
How could you break up with me just like that?

252
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,825
I object.

253
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:53,488
Okay.

254
00:21:53,488 --> 00:21:55,235
Even if you want us to break up,

255
00:21:55,235 --> 00:21:57,735
at least, you should give me a valid reason.

256
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,265
Must there be a reason?

257
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,138
Yes.

258
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:08,795
Shao Xue.

259
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:16,825
I don't love you anymore.

260

Zheng Sunian.

261
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:28,405
I know you're lying.

262
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,215
I don't believe you.

263
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:33,985
Since when have I lied to you?

264
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,705
I just don't love you anymore.

265
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:43,965
Let's not meet again.

266
00:23:42,615 --> 00:23:44,405
Xue.

267
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,278
Lass.

268
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,325
Have you made up your mind

269
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:56,705
about working abroad?

270
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:58,338
Xue.

271
00:24:01,995 --> 00:24:03,628
What's wrong?

272
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:06,125
Who bullied you?

273
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,325
No one?

274
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:11,925
Your eyes are swollen.

275
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:16,718
Xue. Xue!

276
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:18,095
Don't hide your feelings.

277
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:19,645
Tell me what happened.

278
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:22,025
Dad.

279
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:30,925
Why did he break up with me?

280
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:35,305
Why doesn't he love me anymore?

281
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:46,858
Cry it out.

282
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,225
Cry out if you're heartbroken.

Little Baibai.

00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,735
Look at you, still angry with each other.

287
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:26,545
We're brothers who had slept together before.

288
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:29,265
It was just a tiny argument.

289
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:32,335
Does it matter? Am I right?

290
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:35,785
Today is the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.

291
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:36,885
Here.

292
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:40,885
Let's make a toast on this lucky day.

293
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:43,465
May we be brothers forever!

294
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:44,998
Cheers!

295
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,615
Do me a favor.

296
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,415
Come, let's clink glasses.

297
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:54,078
Here.

298
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,405
Stop being so awkward.

299
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:07,105
You obviously love each other. Am I right?

300
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,225
Am I right?

301
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:11,305
If you guys don't start talking,

302
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:13,465

00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:20,815
This is more like it.

306
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:22,685
Come on, let's eat.

307
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,135
I heard you went to Suzhou.

308
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:36,405
I told him that.

309
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:38,818
Go on.

310
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,335
Did you find her?

311
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:47,435
Of course not.

312
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:48,905
I couldn't even find her.

313
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,805
Although Yunjin looks delicate,

314
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:52,745
she's actually very stubborn.

315
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,995
If she wants to avoid you,

316
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,795
you will never find her.

317
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,935
Try to win her over, if possible.

318
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:04,425
Okay. Stop talking about us.

319
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:07,615
What about you? Did you look for her?

320
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:25,025
Madam, your restaurant is less crowded today.

321
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,595
Everyone is watching the opening ceremony.

322
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:30,125
No wonder.

323
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,176
The alley is so full of people today.

324
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,265
Sunian, what are you doing here?

325
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:37,615
We were all looking for you.

326
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:41,148
Wu Huan, I'll meet you there.

00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,000
Mr. Luo told me that the art piece is ready for collection.

492
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,600
Congratulations.

493
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,400
Your apprenticeship has ended if you get to touch the antiques.

494
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,200
I still have a lot to learn.

495
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,600
Sunian.

496
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,800
If you are free this afternoon, shall we pick cherries together?

497
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,300
No, thanks.

498
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
This kid...

499
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,600
is getting quieter now.

500
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,700
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

501
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,400
This is our boss, Frank.

502
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,700
This is Mr. Smith.

503
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,600
Hi.

504
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,800
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

505
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,400
Mr. Smith and his team have been investing

506
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,100
in artificial intelligence in recent years.

507
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,800
Please.

508
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,300
Good morning.

509
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,000
Today, we will start the meeting about the sales for this year.

510
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,900
Good morning, Master.

511
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,800
Our group will organize a dinner banquet tonight.

512
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm expecting you to join.

513
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,000
I won't join, Master.

514
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,100
Why? You've been absent a few times.

515
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,800
I am busy.

516
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,600
What are you busy with?

517
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,400
Your tasks are all assigned by me.

518
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,700
After working day and night, you even finished next month's tasks.

519
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,100
Listen up.

520
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
The dinner banquet is tonight.

521
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,400
And we'll pick cherries in the afternoon.

522
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,800
From now on, you must attend all group activities.

523
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,200
Be obedient.

524
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,800
Yes, Master.

525
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,150
<i>[Zhang Qi: I changed my phone and I found this while exporting the photos.]</i>

526
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,800
<i>[Do you miss it?]</i>

527
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,000
You, wait.

528
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,000
Is there anything else?

529
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,800
Next time you come to work,

530
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,200
bring your shoes cleaned.

531
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,100
Okay.

♫ <i>They had accompanied me through everything</i> ♫
