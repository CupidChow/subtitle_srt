Once upon a time, a beautiful princess fell seriously ill.

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,700
Two warriors who love the princess embarked on a journey

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,800
to find a cure for the princess's illness.

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,100
They are going to find the legendary jasmine flower that can bring people back to life.

The outfit is a nice touch.
<i>[Mr. Chen, Ms. Miao, Ms. Zhao]</i>

40
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,200
They finally came to the place where the jasmine grew.

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,800
But they both wanted to be the princess's one and only.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,300
So they wanted to have a final showdown with each other.

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
You!

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,600
What?

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,800
You don't deserve her!

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,400
I...

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Why don't I deserve her?

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Because I said so!

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
The actors phoned in their performances.

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,900
What's with the actors? Just a bunch of amateurs.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,400
You can take over. I'm leaving.

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,500
Come back here!

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,200
You got the line wrong.

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,600
I forgot my next line. Just continue.

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,000
While the two princes were arguing, the dragon guarding the jasmine

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
came down from the sky

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,900
and spewed blazing flames.

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,200
The two princes buried the hatchet

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,100
and worked together to defeat the dragon.

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,400
They worked together to defeat the dragon!

61
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,000
But a warrior tragically died.

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
You shouldn't be dead. I'm the one who should die.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,700
- I thought I was the one who died?
- It's me.

64
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,600
Why are you both on the floor?

65
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
One of you has to get up.

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
One of you has to get up! Just one!

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The warrior returned with the jasmine flowers

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,400
and presented it to the princess.

69
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Princess? Princess?

70
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,000
What an ordinary-looking princess.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
She's totally not worth dying for.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Return home and present it to the princess.

74
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Princess.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,500
The princess was terribly saddened

76
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,800
when she heard that a warrior had died for her

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,000
as it suddenly dawned on her that the dead warrior

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
was the love of her life.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So the princess decided to revive the warrior with her singing.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
Sing.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
It's your turn.

82
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
Sing.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,900
One, two, three, go.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,500
Is this princess a mute? Why isn't she talking?

85
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:18,700
- Get off the stage!
<i>- Get off the stage!</i>

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
Why is she running away?

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
She left without saying a word.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,500
What kind of stage play is this?

89
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,300
Pull the curtains!

90
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,000
These kids aren't up for it.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,900
They should just focus on studying. This isn't for them.

92
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,700
Pull the curtains!

93
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,200
I haven't gotten inside yet!

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
Tang Ya.

95
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Are you all right?

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm fine.

97
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,700
Where are Xue and the others?

98
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,000
They went to talk to the teachers.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
It's all my fault.

100
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
I suffered from stage fright again.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,700
I've let you guys down.

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
You are still better than Zhang Qi and Sunian.

103
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,000
They didn't even remember their lines.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What's the point of me remembering the lines?

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
I couldn't even utter a word out.

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I watched you rehearse.

107
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,900
Just perform like you normally did, and you'd do great.

108
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,000
I was too nervous being on the stage.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I ruined it all for you guys.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,800
I know you don't want to hurt my feelings.

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,800
Maybe I should just quit?

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Don't say that.

113
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,300
Tang Ya, trust me. Give it another try.

114
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,500
We've got your back.

115
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,400
I'm afraid I might let you down.

116
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Tang Ya.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Actually, I myself am not a confident person.

118
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,700
But I'm trying to overcome it.

119
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,400
You're way better than me.

120
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,000
So don't doubt yourself. Okay?

121
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,800
All right. Enough crying.

122

Let's go.

126
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Ms. Miao, we didn't have time to rehearse properly.

127
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,700
Could you give us another chance to try it out?

128
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,400
Hear me out.

Zhang Qi. You're from the competition class, right?

131
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Both of you are doing great in your studies.

132
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
So just focus on your studies.

133
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't bother taking part in anything else.

134
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
Give us another chance.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,700
Just one more chance.

136
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,300
Coming up next is the drama troupe's performance.

137
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,600
Why don't we watch other stage plays first?

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,500
You can come back to me again after that.

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,800
Ms. Miao.

140

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,370
- What is it?
- Be obedient.

164
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,250
- But I...
- It upset me when you questioned me earlier.

165
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,250
You know what? I was the one who chose you from an ocean of crowds.

166
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,280
You should know that you don't have what it takes to be the main dancer.

167
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,910
I discovered you and guided you.

168
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,000
That's how you became the focus.

169
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
But you challenged me in public.

170
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,240
Was that right of you?

171
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,610
I'm sorry, sir.

172
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,640
I forgive you.

173
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,223
Here.

174
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,773
Right now, look at yourself.

175
00:11:59,773 --> 00:12:01,650
Keep dancing.

176
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,750
Dance until there are no more flaws.

177
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,283
All right?

178
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,060
I believe in you.

179
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,000
Seriously?

180
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,430
See? Xue doesn't buy that.

181
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,760
Juliet.

182
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,800
You're the beautiful sun, my soul mate, and my love.

183
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,970
Your eyes shine so brightly in space

184
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,900
that the birds sing their song as they mistakenly

185
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,200
think the night is over.

186
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,950
How wonderful your posture is?

187
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,330
How I wish I was a glove on your hand

188
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,730
so I could kiss your fragrant hand.

189
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,150
Why are you here?

190
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,950
I just happened to be passing by.

191
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,540
School's over. Stop practicing.

192
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,890
That teacher was wrong. Don't believe his words.

193
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,350
What do you know? He's an artist.

194
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,140
I think he is an incompetent guy.

195
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,750
He gets his sense of presence by hurting others.

196
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,200
Don't you say that!

197
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,840
Shiyin, don't trust him.

198
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,390
You're not what he said you were.

199
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,330
Well, I believe him.

200
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,940
Stay out of my business!

201
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,030
I admit that my performance was kind of exaggerated.

202
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,550
But that's my understanding of the character, Aotian.

203
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,250
I admit that I kind of forgot my lines.

204
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,660
But a good actor never has to stick to the screenplay.

205
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,323
Maybe I could go...

206
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,480
talk to Ms. Miao and tell her to give us another chance?

207
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,030
No need for that.

208
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,160
If that's the case,

209
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,070
let's eat something nice to cool down.

210
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,550
Unreliable.

211
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,300
Not only is Zhang Qi unreliable, but you as well, Sunian!

212
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,640
Why am I unreliable?

213
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,170
Just keep your mouth shut.

214
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,550
Had I known, I wouldn't have asked you to perform.

215
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,461
It would have been better if I'd spent 10 yuan to get the sundry shop's owner

216
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,690
- to perform instead of you two!
- Well, 10 yuan isn't enough.

217
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,470
I asked him to play my dad once. His acting was terrible.

218
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,670
I don't want to talk to you! Move!

219
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,860
It's just a cultural performance.

220
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,810
Does she have to be so mad?

221
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,590
Shao Xue.

222
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,220
Hi. I'm Wang Haoran.

223
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,800
The Little Li Flying Dagger?

224
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,010
What?

225
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,470
Nothing, I know who you are.

226
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,681
Sure enough. All the girls in this school know me.

227
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,510
I think it's a shame that your stage play didn't go as planned.

228
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,390
Right? I thought the same, too!

229
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,510
- The actors didn't put any effort into it.
- I thought the same, too!

230
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,621
- I'm thinking of giving you a chance.
- I thought...

231
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,103
What?

232
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,020
As the president of the Drama Club,

233
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,290
I'd like to invite you to join the club.

234
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,870
I don't think that's necessary.

235
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,240
Don't feel unworthy of it.

236
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,000
If I think you can, you can.

237
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,533
Xue.

238
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,600
Isn't this the warrior who wanted to die so badly?

239
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,480
Isn't this Romeo?

240
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,060
- Why are you here?
- Xue.

241
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,900
Pizza Hut just launched a new flavor. Let's try it out.

242
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,323
I'm not going.

243
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:45,720
Come on, Xue.

244
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,140
We can discuss the acting.

245
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,630
What's going on?

246
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,280
Just a lunatic.

247
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,560
Sorry, I'm late.

248
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,950
I just sent Shiyin home.

249
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,680
It's okay. There's not a lot of stock today.

250
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,340
It's fine. I'll take care of the rest. You can take a break.

251
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,620
It's all right.

252
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,050
I have nothing to do anyway.

253
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,323
Wu Huan!

254
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:19,140
Here. The packaging was damaged, and it fell out.

255
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,440
It looks just like you. You can have it.

256
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,180
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't mention it.

257
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,790
Do you like it? You can take it.

258
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,280
No. It's a gift for you.

259
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,680
Why would a guy want this?

260
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,113
You can have it.

261
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,420
Can't you see that you're unwanted here?

262
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,480
I don't think so.

263
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Who invited you here?

264
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,590
If I don't come, she's not going to come either.

265
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,640
Where does your confidence come from?

266
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,123
Anywhere.

267
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,810
Aren't you eating?

268
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,130
I'm trying to keep fit.

269
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,790
Why are you here then?

270
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,910
I've come to experience the taste of junk to know how healthy I am.

271
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,040
Junk.

272
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,350
But seeing how much you enjoyed it, I feel like taking a bite too.

273
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,340
Buy it yourself.

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,650
It's just one piece. Do you have to do this?

275
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,480
It's not too late for you to leave now.

276
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,070
But that's not what Xue wants.

277
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,440
Who are you to call her Xue?

278
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,480
I'm already feeling annoyed, and you won't give me a break.

279
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
Enjoy yourselves.

280
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,283
Sit down!

281
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,270
Your hostility towards me is pretty obvious.

282
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,900
No hostility. We just don't want to be friends with you.

283
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,110
But that's not what Shao Xue thinks.

284
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,150
You're overthinking it.

285
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,580
Interesting.

286
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,590
<i>Sunian, you wanted to see me?</i>

287
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,970
<i>Sunian!</i>

288
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,731
<i>Sunian, how did you find this place?</i>

289
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,440
<i>Sunian, I was afraid you'd make fun of me.</i>

290
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,170
<i>I got everything! Don't worry. Let's go home!</i>

291
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,270
<i>Sunian.</i>

292
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,110
<i>Sunian, you're so lame.</i>

293
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,310
<i>Sunian.</i>

294
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,670
<i>As expected of my lead actor.</i>

295
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,641
<i>Sunian can always think of some wonderful ideas.</i>

296
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:16,051
<i>You'll always be the Sunian that I know.</i>

297
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:18,050
<i>Sunian!</i>

298
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,750
- Dad.
- Your milk.

299
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,733
Dad.

300
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,110
Back then, how did you know?

301
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,840
Know what?

302
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,900
How do you know...

303
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,830
if you like women?

304
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,780
- I...
<i>- Zheng, come and help me out!</i>

305
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,760
Coming!

306
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,070
This woman.

307
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,210
This woman...

308
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,590
This woman is your mom.

309
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,073
She...

310
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,900
Right.

311
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,533
Yes.

312
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
I'm feeling a little sleepy.

313
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,270
Rest earlier, Dad.

314
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,310
I think if you like someone,

315
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,450
that feeling lasts for a lifetime.

316
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,350
<i>Zheng, what are you doing? Hurry up!</i>

317
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,830
<i>Ms. Miao. Zhang Qi has friends.</i>

318
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,860
<i>I'm his friend.</i>

319
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,060
<i>Failure is the mother of success. Don't you know that?</i>

320
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,750
<i>I'll buy you noodles. How about that?</i>

321
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,483
<i>How do I look?</i>

322
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,380
Why are you laughing?

323
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,920
Why are you here?

324
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,451
Nonsense! Can't I come back to my own house?

325
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:31,340
Didn't you say you were working overtime and wouldn't come home tonight?

It was my fault. I had stage fright.

Why don't I ask Ms. Miao to make you the lead actress and give us another chance to perform?

- Of course not.

It's Tang Ya's stage fright.

Let's make you the lead actress. That's way safer.

You dream to be a director.

That was the case at first.

Princess Jasmine finally found the most amazing jasmine flowers.

Director, I have some questions.

390
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,030
Ask away.

391
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:04,100

Sit down, all of you.

395
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,390
Actually, at first, I wanted him to be the lead actor. He will be the villain.

396
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,100
Both of them would fight for you and both would get severely injured.

397
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,780
But I thought it was too bloody.

398
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,440
So I added romance to the story so that both of them

399
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,140
would be madly in love with you.

400
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,070
The problem lies in this part of them being "madly in love".

What problem?

402
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,690
I can't even sense their love for the princess.

403
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,400
So I don't understand the reasoning behind the princess's sacrifice.

404
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,000
That's because they didn't get their lines right.

Done. It's your turn.

That's impossible. The princess is my everything. Her voice makes me believe that all difficulties shall pass.

Sunian, can you put some emotions into it?

412
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,680
We're acting, not reading in the morning.

00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,800
Your dad and I scrimped and saved

Your mom and I have restoration work to do at the Restoration Department.

- We have to go now.
- Hurry up.

512
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,600
What kind of birthday present is this?

513
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,000
I don't want this!

514
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,200
I'm standing right here. Didn't you see me?

515
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,500
What is it?

516
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Happy Birthday.

517
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Thank you.

518
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,400
It's your birthday.

519
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,700
Why do you look so gloomy?

520
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,000
My mom signed me up for a math tutoring class as a birthday present.

521
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,800
There are gifts from the others.

522
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,200
What if someone gives you something that you love?

523
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
You're right.

524
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,200
But it's not going to be you.

525
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,400
Why?

526
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,800
Because you've never given anyone a birthday present.

527
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,800
What if I have changed?

528
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,400

<i>[Qiming High School 10th Anniversary Cultural Performance]</i>

531
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Principal. Mr. Liu. You're here.

532
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,200
Here. Have a seat.

533
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,100
- Shiyin, how's your injury?
- Much better.

534
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,800
Right, Shiyin, how is your leg?

535
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm good now.

536
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,400
We're going backstage for rehearsal.

537
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,300
- We'll get on the stage now.
- Okay.

Come on, guys.

541
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,000
How's your leg?

If not, you can play a rock in our play.

Shiyin, are you all right?

545
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,400
It's the dance team's loss to not have you with them.

546
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,900
Just take a seat and rest. Cheer for us.

547
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,000
- We'll go on the stage now.

Take a seat over here.

552
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Wu Huan, we need to stand by now.

553

Okay.

Next, please enjoy the stage play of costume, martial arts,

romance, love, and comedy,

558
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,000
Princess Jasmine.

559
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,400
Once upon a time, a beautiful princess fell seriously ill.

560
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Two warriors who love the princess embarked on a journey

561
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,600
to find a cure for the princess's illness.

562
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,200
They are going to find the legendary jasmine flower

563
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
that can bring people back to life.

564
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,600
The outfit and props are so cool. Are those real swords?

565
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
That should cost a lot.

566
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,800
Our school's drama club is rich, isn't it?

567
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
This isn't a performance by the drama club.

568
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,800
They finally came to the place where the jasmine grew.

569
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,500
That guy in white is so handsome.

570
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,800
But they both wanted to be the princess's one and only.

571
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,200
I won't let you take this bunch of jasmine flowers.

572
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,400
Principal, these are the students from our class.

573
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,200
Not bad. Pretty good.

574
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,300
That depends on whether you have what it takes to stop me.

575
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,600
So they wanted to have a final showdown with each other.

576
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,100
While the two princes were arguing, the dragon guarding the jasmine

577
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,500
came down from the sky

578
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,600
and spewed blazing flames.

579
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,600
Take that!

580
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,600
The two princes buried the hatchet

581
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,600
and worked together to defeat the dragon.

582
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
This time, their performance is a lot better than the previous one.

583
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,400
- Right?
- Awesome.

584
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,300
The one in the purple outfit is also good-looking.

585
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300
They are both my best friends.

586
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,800
The warrior returned with the jasmine flowers

587
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,800
and presented them to the princess.

588
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,800
The princess was terribly saddened

589
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,600
when she heard that a warrior had died for her.

590
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,000
It suddenly dawned on her that the dead warrior

591
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,600
was the love of her life.

592
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:16,000
So the princess decided to revive the warrior with her singing.

593
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,900
What's wrong? Why is there no sound?

594
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,500
What's going on?

595
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
There seems to be a problem with the speakers.

596
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,600
It's taken care of.

597
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,400
You can treat the audience as boxes.

598
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,200
This is me.

599
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,300
