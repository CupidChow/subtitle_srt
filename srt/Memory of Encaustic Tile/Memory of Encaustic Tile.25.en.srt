34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,890
Speak up, Zheng Sunian!

35
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,649
Why are you calling me by my full name?

36
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:21,579
It's because the Sunian I knew wouldn't badmouth anyone behind their backs!

37
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:23,630
I know I shouldn't badmouth someone behind their backs.

38
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,799
But I just think that Mo Hai has an ulterior motive.

39
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:27,769
What do you mean by an ulterior motive?

40
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm sure he...

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,380
I'm sure he harbors ill thoughts towards you.

42
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,749
What are you thinking?

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,189
He just treats me as his junior.

44
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,799
And he already has someone he likes.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,310
He just hasn't confessed to her yet.

46
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,729
- Have you seen that girl before?
- No. She's not from my university.

47
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,979
What if he just made it up for you to let down your guard?

48
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:48,859
How could you think of him in such a despicable manner?

49
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,380
Because it's you.

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,100
That's why I'm worried.

51
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,149
So are you using that as an excuse to embarrass me?

52
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,700
I didn't wish to embarrass you.

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,630
I just...

54
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,470
I'm just afraid that you might grow distant from me.

55
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,350
Sunian, I'm an undergraduate now.

56
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,079
I'm on the student committee as well.

57
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,960
I have plenty of things to do every day.

58
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,650
Of course, I'll be busy.

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,060
I know you're busy.

60
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,040
But at least,

61
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,060
you should let me keep in touch with you.

62
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,260
Okay?

63
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,650
If so, I'll try to return to my dorm earlier

64
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,860
and say good night to you every night. Okay?

65
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,010
You better keep your words.

66
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,800
I will.

67
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,090
You should return early.

68
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,980
They're still waiting for you.

69
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,290
I'll make a move now.

70
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,610
Let's go.

71
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,260
<i>You may go now.</i>

72

<i>[Plustoken Coffee]</i>
Isn't this obvious enough? He's jealous.

73
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,620
Why is he jealous?

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,460
Silly girl, I think he likes you.

75
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,940
Hey, don't spout nonsense in broad daylight.

76
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,229
You can see the passion in his eyes when he looks at you.

77
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,700
You still think that I'm spouting nonsense?

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,069
Sunian just likes me as a little sister.

79
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,490
Do you like him?

80
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,209
Can you not talk about that when it's between me and him?

81
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,059
I knew you would say that.

82
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,479
As a love expert, I need to provide you with some love enlightenment.

83
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,379
I'll give you three questions.

84
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,440
Don't think about them, answer them with your instinct.

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,669
First, picture Zhang Qi in your mind.

86
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,649
Why must it be Zhang Qi?

87
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,890
You can only see the truth when you can compare.

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,170
Done.

89
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,460
First question. Will you be happy when you see him?

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,980
I guess? I feel more or less the same when I see you.

91
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,660
Second question.

92
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,599
Will you be upset when you can't see him?

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,139
- No, but I'll feel worried.
- Worried about what?

94
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,939
Worried that people might beat him up because of his potty mouth.

95
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,000
You do have a point.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,860
Third question. If another girl steals him away from you,

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,530
will you be furious at her?

98
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,559
I'll be impressed.

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,630
She'd be a heroine for ridding the world of a great evil.

100
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:13,770
All right. Now, picture Sunian in your mind.

101
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,360
Will you be happy when you see him?

102
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,480
Will you be upset if you can't see him?

103
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,519
If another girl steals him away from you,

104
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,559
will you...

105
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,949
What are you doing?

106
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,000
It hurts!

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,400
You still don't want to admit that you like him?

108
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,820
Is admitting my feelings for him that important?

109
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,210
Do you wish to be his girlfriend?

110
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,940
Girl...

111
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,459
It'll be too awkward.

112
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,819
What's there to be awkward about?

113
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,619
You two should be together when you fancy each other.

114
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,970
Think about this.

115
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,600
Will you say no to him

116
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,830
if he confesses to you?

117
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,289
It's impossible for him to confess to me.

118
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,750
Do you wish to make him confess to you?

119
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,720
No. I think this state is fine.

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,069
Initially, I had a way to make him confess.

121
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,669
I can confirm whether he likes you as a little sister

122
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,939
or as a woman.

123
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,940
Let's just forget it since you don't wish to know.

124
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,650
You can tell me about it.

125
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,970
This gift is so expensive.

126
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,390
Are you trying to confess to her?

127
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,730
Confess what?

128
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,940
I just want to make it easier for us to keep in touch.

129
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,170
Little Niannian, you see, even a blind Bai Yunsheng

130
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,559
can see your love for Shao Xue.

131
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:52,709
Listen. If you don't express your feelings, it'll never begin.

132
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,790
What will never begin?

133
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,060
Your relationship.

134
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,220
I was right, wasn't I? Am I right?

135
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,049
You should have told me that you wanted to get into a relationship. I could have taught you.

136
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,130
You're overthinking it.

137
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,070
Don't you want her to be your girlfriend?

138
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,490
Girlfriend?

139
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,730
This way, you can hold her tiny hands,

140
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,019
kiss her tiny lips, hold a tiny wedding,

141
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,140
- and consummate in a tiny room.
- Shut up.

142
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,380
Bride and groom, you may enter your bridal chamber.

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,359
Turn off the lights!

144
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,620
Such indecency.

145
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Plenty of people called me that before.

146
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,740
But you're the first man to do so.

147
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,529
Seriously, you'll surely regret it if you don't confess.

148
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:41,689
Think about it.

149
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,409
Back in high school, your parents were strict with you.

150
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,389
But now, we're in university.

151
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,690
You should set yourself free! Mo Hai

152
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,260
is just one of the wolves out there.

153
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,250
Judging by Shao Xue's cuteness, if she was in our university,

154
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,640
I would have...

155
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,360
You would have courted her with my help.

156
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,930
Xue and I are used to our current state.

157
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,450
I'm afraid she can't accept the sudden change.

158
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,810
I think we should let nature take its course.

159
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,289
You wish to contain your feelings and let her take the initiative?

160
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,869
You're an expert.

161
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,840
Your mindset might be different from mine.

162
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,719
Don't you wish to know if she likes you?

163
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,070
Don't you wish to know how much she likes you?

164
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,599
You don't wish to confess,

165
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,100
yet you want her to fall for you.

166
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,650
This all depends on your charm as a man.

167
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,050
My charm as a woman?

168
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,140
To put it simply, you need to seduce him.

169
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,770
Seduce him?

170
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,909
I just wish to know if he likes me.

171
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:46,389
Can't I just ask him about his feelings?

172
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,260
It's our loss if you do so.

173
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,550
You must seduce him and make him confess to you.

174
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,820
Be... more specific.

175
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,930
When it comes to seduction, first, we need to restrain and then we develop desire.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,600
We need to show him the cold shoulder.

177
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,000
And make him think that you're keeping him at an arm's length.

178
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,540
I need to be passionate?

179
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,120
You need to let her feel

180
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,710
the passion that's engulfing you.

181
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,680
After that, you need to stare into her eyes.

182
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,199
Let her understand how deep your feelings are.

183
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,250
After that, grab her hands,

184
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,899
let her feel the warmth of love.

185
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,019
Lastly, utter your pickup line

186
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,030
and deal critical damage to her heart.

187
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,420
After that?

188
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,940
At the moment when she has fallen for you,

189
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,840
withdraw yourself from the relationship.

190
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,210
And then, he will back off because of our coldness.

191
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,160
At this moment,

192
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,130
we need to start seducing him.

193
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,100
First...

194
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,620
tease him with your expressions.

195
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,790
After that...

196
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,240
be delicate and attractive.

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,870
Touch him... by accident.

198
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,270
Lastly, show him your willful side without any warning.

199
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,420
I don't understand.

200
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,259
Why must I withdraw from the relationship?

201
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,500
You need to let her understand that you're a man.

202
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,610
Isn't that obvious enough?

203
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,650
That's not what I meant.

204
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,199
You need to let her know that you, Zheng Sunian,

205
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,789
is a young man who's at the peak of his youth.

206
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,289
You need to show her that you can still maintain a sense of propriety and some distance from her

207
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:46,079
even though you love her passionately.

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,150
You're just like that guy. What's his name again?

209
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,670
Mr. Dongguo.

210
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,909
Mr. Dongguo had a wolf in his arms.

211
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,530
Who was the unperturbed man even though there was a woman on his lap?

212
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,369
- That's Liu Xiahui.
- That's right.

213
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,669
Is that even the main point?

214
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,450
You've disrupted my thoughts.

215
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,600
You just need to remember one thing.

216
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,029
If you desire her, that means you've fallen for her.

217
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,319
But if you can hold it in, that means you're serious about her.

218
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,300
So you need to show her your passion first and show her the cold shoulder after that.

219
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,020
What if...

220
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,520
I can't show her the cold shoulder?

221
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,390
Great question.

222
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,869
As for me,

223
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,670
I admit that I was always overly passionate.

224
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,600
So at this time, you need to chant the Enduring Mantra in silence.

225
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,950
The Enduring Mantra?

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,700
With a little forbearance, you will find calm and peace.

227
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,200
As a man, you have to be calm.

228
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,400
All right. Let me demonstrate it to you in person.

229
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,260
Waiter.

230
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,290
Can I help you?

231
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,310
Do you need me to say it out loud?

232
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,590
How can I know if you don't tell me?

233
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,040
Don't you know what a customer is thinking about?

234
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,470
Miss, you can find the pharmacy to the left of our shop.

235
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,900
Don't go!

236
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,640
Why can't you understand what I'm thinking?

237
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:36,435
I just want some tissue paper.

238
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:37,955
Why were you so fierce to me?

239
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:39,700
Tissue paper?

240
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,055
Of course.

241
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:45,105
Do you need more? I'll get them for you.

242
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:47,365
Okay, I'll call you if I need anything else.

243
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:48,905
Okay.

244
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,905
Understood?

245
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,755
You don't understand?

246
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:06,265
Look closely.

247
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,190
Hey!

248
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,100
it's such a coincidence to bump into you here. Are you reading?

249
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,100
We're drinking the same coffee.

250
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,265
Don't move.

251
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,845
- What are you doing?
- I'm counting the rings on your hand.

252
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,545
What rings?

253
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:34,440
The fingerprint rings.

254
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,920
Don't speak.

255
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:39,280
You have three while I have seven.

256
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,345
Seems like we're destined to be together.

257
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:43,835
What was that?

258
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:47,145
Only then, can we make it a 10 out of 10.

259
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:54,135
Sorry.

260
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:55,435
I shouldn't have said that.

261
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:58,075
I crossed my boundaries. Farewell.

262
00:14:58,075 --> 00:14:59,965
Wait!

263
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:05,665
This isn't the time yet.

264
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:08,365
One day, I will hold your hand again

265
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,435
and count the three fingerprint rings on your hand.

266
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:11,645
Hey!

267
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,555
What's your name?

268
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:15,255
Wait up.

269
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,764
Ever since Xue moved into the university, I don't

270
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,325
even have the mood to cook.

271
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:37,025
When I told him that we were having dinner here,

272
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:39,165
he was elated. He dragged me here.

273
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:41,215
He told me to hurry up.

274
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,565
We can finally have some good food.

275
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:46,555
That's how a man behaves.

276
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,315
They think food from other families is the best.

277
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,955
Nonsense!

278
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:53,675
Where's Zheng?

279
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:56,365
Zheng went to another state to give out lectures.

280
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,205
He's very busy.

281
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:01,245
I heard that he's doing very well in his field.

282
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:03,104
Isn't that great?

283
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:05,245
Do you know that Qiaomu has given birth?

284
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:06,264
Yeah, I heard!

285
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,565
I was planning to visit her.

286
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,694
- How was it?
- I have already visited her.

287
00:16:09,695 --> 00:16:12,164
It was a plump boy. He's very likable.

288
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:13,224
Is that so?

289
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:15,174
Siyuan was so nice to Qiaomu.

290
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,504
He was serving her all the way.

291
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:18,984
She was spoiled by him.

292
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,744
Everyone else was envious of her.

293
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:21,774
That's great.

294
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,005
They're nothing like him. Good grief.

295
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:25,864
Just forget about them.

296
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:27,384
As time passes by,

297
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:28,654
they start to dislike us for our aging looks.

298
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,365
They think we look ugly now.

299
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,760
Not at all.

300
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,995
It's great!

301
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,545
- Did you hear that?
- He was referring to you.

302
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:37,835
He was referring to you!

303
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:41,405
Shiyin is in university now.

304
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:43,485
Say, she's such a beauty.

305
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,814
I'm sure a lot of guys are courting her.

306
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:47,075
She doesn't dare to do so.

307
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:48,645
I've made a pact with her.

308
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,525
She's not allowed to date anyone during her university years.

309
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:51,670
If she does so,

310
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,945
I'll break her legs!

311
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,115
<i>Sunian!</i>

312
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:59,945
Sunian!

313
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,975
Why were you looking for me?

314
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,895
Try them. I made them myself.

315
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,120
Wow!

316
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,755
Did you make all of them yourself?

317
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:12,235
This is...

318
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:14,275
<i>You need to show him the cold shoulder.</i>

319
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,705
This is so ordinary.

320
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:27,265
Which dish looks ordinary to you?

321
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:31,155
Tell me. I'll remake it for you.

322
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,745
I guess they're okay.

323
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,445
Wait!

324
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,795
Don't move.

325
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:12,825
What do you wish to eat?

326
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:15,125
I'll serve you.

327
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:20,084
No, thanks. I can do it myself.

328
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:27,175
Why are you grabbing my hand?

329
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:54,675
I'm counting the rings on your hand.

330
00:18:56,675 --> 00:19:00,790
The rings on my hand?

331
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:26,575
There are no fingerprint rings on your hand.

332
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:29,574
There are only loops on my hand. There are no rings.

333
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,755
<i>Utter a pickup line</i>

334
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:39,820
<i>and deal critical damage to her heart.</i>

335
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,605
That's fine.

336
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:47,675
My rings will be yours in the future.

337
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:56,135
You should keep them for yourself.

338
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:09,755
<i>He will back off because of our coldness.</i>

339
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,785
<i>At this time,</i>

340
00:20:13,475 --> 00:20:16,025
<i>we need to seduce him.</i>

341
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:26,025
Sunian.

342
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:30,335
What do you wish to eat?

343
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:32,875
<i>Tease him with your expression.</i>

344
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,500
<i>With a little forbearance, you will find calm and peace.</i>

345
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,435
Get them yourself.

346
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:48,905
Sunian, what do you wish to eat?

347
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:50,885
I'll serve you.

348
00:20:58,025 --> 00:21:00,264
Why are you sitting so close to me?

349
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:02,565
<i>Pretend to be pitiful.</i>

350
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,085
You're sitting so far away from me.

351
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:10,625
I can't see you clearly.

352
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,790
<i>As a man,</i>

353
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,605
<i>you must be calm.</i>

354
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,195
Why must you see me clearly?

355
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:19,535
<i>Touch him by accident.</i>

356
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:23,030
Because you are handsome.

357
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,935
You're so dashing.

358
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,575
Your lips look good.

359
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:29,785
Your nose looks good, too.

360
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:32,664
So are your eyes and eyebrows...

361
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:33,854
<i>At this moment,</i>

362
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:37,065
<i>you need to chant the Enduring Mantra in silence.</i>

363
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:50,025
What?

364
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:52,405
This isn't the time yet.

365
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:54,565
What do you mean?

366
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:59,175
One day, I will hold your hand again

367
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:01,475
and count the rings on your fingers.

368
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:05,265
<i>Show him your willful side without any notice.</i>

369
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:08,175
I don't have any rings on my hand.

370
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:10,755
<i>At the moment when she has fallen for you,</i>

371
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:12,595
<i>withdraw from the relationship.</i>

372
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:17,115
If so, we can talk about it when the rings have been formed.

373
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:20,405
Now, dig in.

374
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:28,870
<i>I'm done for.</i>

375
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,920
<i>Sunian treats me like a little girl.</i>

376
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:36,765
<i>Now, you know how serious I am.</i>

377
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:43,335
You've succeeded.

378
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:51,755
You're done for.

379
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,664
You didn't act rashly even though she behaved like that.

380
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,374
She definitely knows that you're serious.

381
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,645
He's unfazed even after all you had done?

382
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:02,995
Don't tell me he's sick in the head?

383
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:04,504
I told you I should have asked him directly.

384
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:05,925
You just had to tell me to seduce him.

385
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:09,165
How can I face Sunian in the future?

386
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:11,854
Calm down.

387
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:14,955
I think Sunian was just frightened.

388
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,094
He's very intelligent. Maybe he'll understand it

389
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,774
once he goes back and thinks about it.

390
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,134
Let's cope with it by sticking to our principles.

391
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:22,675
We shouldn't do anything.

392
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:25,645
Don't think about anything else. You should follow it with hot pursuit.

393
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:27,505
How?

394
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:31,195
My ultimate technique,

395
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:34,704
War and Love.

396
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:37,605
You mean War and Peace?

397
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:39,654
Peace and Love. It's the same thing.

398
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,399
<i>[Hunter]</i>

399
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,319
All these years of training have been finally put into good use.

400
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,950
Our Sunian will face the turning point of his life today.

401
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,449
If he does a good job, he'll win the fair maiden's heart.

402
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,020
If he ruins it, he'll regret it for life.

403
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,870
Say, Instructor Pei,

404
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,350
why do we have different uniforms?

405
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,209
I'm sure you don't understand why.

406
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,850
The male and female lead will be in one team.

407
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,910
The rest of us will be in one team.

408
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,740
Sunian, we only have one mission today.

409
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,260
We'll feed your team.

410
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,590
What do you mean?

411
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,150
When you raise your gun, we'll fall to the ground.

412
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,540
My comrades, let's set off to the battlefield.

413
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,350
Even under a tense atmosphere,

414
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,399
we need to highlight Sunian's valor. Understood?

415
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:26,319
- Understood.
- Understood.

416
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,119
Louder!

417
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,390
- Understood!
- Understood!

418
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,810
Let's go!

419
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,350
Didn't you say the male and female lead would be in one team?

420
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,530
I miscalculated.

421
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,729
Why is that scoundrel here?

422
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,350
Didn't you tell Xue to bring more reinforcements?

423
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,570
I told Xue to bring more girls with her.

424
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,359
What should we do now?

425
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,160
Let me chase him away.

426
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,360
You don't need to do that. It's great that he's here.

427
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,350
Are we fighting 9 against 1?

428
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,150
Fahai, who told you to come?

429
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,560
I'm here to protect my juniors. I don't want them to get hurt.

430
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,540
They don't need your protection.

431
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,689
This round doesn't count.

432
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,430
Let's reallocate the members.

433
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,190
Sunian and Xue will be in one team. Go.

434
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,780
I think it's better if we follow our own faculty.

435
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,599
After all, the experience might be better

436
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,159
if you're together with someone familiar.

437
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,430
Fahai, say one more word and

438
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,980
I'll bury you under Leifeng Pagoda.

439
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,350
I think that's a great idea.

440
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,630
If we follow our own faculty, we'll have a collective sense of honor.

441
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,190
Are you from the CUC as well?

442
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,009
Which batch are you from?

443
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,860
Enough. It's decided then.

444
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,610
Let me change my uniform.

445
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,200
See you on the battlefield.

446
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,804
Check your equipment. They're fine, right?

447
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:58,264
This is the safety trigger. You can unlock it by pushing it.

448
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:03,904
Why can't I be on the same team as Sunian?

449
00:26:03,905 --> 00:26:04,975
You don't understand.

450
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:06,515
If you wish to test a man's true feelings,

451
00:26:06,515 --> 00:26:08,375
you need to be on the opposite side.

452
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,555
If he truly likes you, winning or losing doesn't matter.

453
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:12,735
He just wants to make you happy.

454
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,485
Shao Xue, later, you should stay here as bait.

455
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:18,425
We'll hide and ambush them, okay?

456
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,295
Get ready.

457
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:28,045
Since Plan A has failed, let's initiate Plan B.

458
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,945
Okay.

459
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:32,035
What's Plan B?

460
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:33,985
Damsels are always in love with heroes.

461
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:36,765
The winner is king, the loser is the bandit.

462
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:40,975
My comrades, today, we must win this battle.

463
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:44,285
We need to bring our A-game then.

464
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:46,714
We'll show them no mercy.

465
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,255
That's right. Come.

466
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:52,424
You'll be the second one. Put yours on top.

467
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,474
You're the second one. Both of you, swap positions.

468
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:56,555
I'm on top.

469
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,175
We can do it!

470
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:21,215
Since I'm the bait, don't you think I should do something?

471
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:31,325
I'm over here!

472
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:33,635
Come on!

473
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,315
Go, go, go!

474
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:39,135
Wait!

475
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:53,825
Go from the back and flank them.

476
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:55,275
Let's go.

477
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,655
Surprise!

478
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:23,045
How dare you try to ambush us?

479
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:29,835
I surrender.

480
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:31,385
I don't accept your surrender.

481
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:34,175
Let's see if you still dare to turn up next time. Squat down!

482
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,935
Stay put!

483
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:41,665
1 to 100, pick a number.

484
00:28:41,665 --> 00:28:43,385
What do you mean?

485
00:28:43,385 --> 00:28:45,595
It's the number of shots we'll fire.

486
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:49,115
This close? It hurts, you know?

487
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:50,885
That's our goal.

488
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:56,845
If you don't pick one, I'll pick one for you.

489
00:28:58,075 --> 00:28:59,474
Why isn't there any activity?

490
00:28:59,475 --> 00:29:01,474
I don't know. I'll go and take a look.

491
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,325
Be careful.

492
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,875
Three,

493
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:07,075
two,

494
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:09,555
one.

495
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:25,085
I'll go and check it out.

496
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,655
Be careful.

497
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:39,015
Does it hurt? Speak up.

498
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:41,255
Let's go.

499
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:45,575
You better know your own place in the future.

500
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,465
We're done for!

501
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:56,875
Mo Hai has been sacrificed!

502
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,584
We can't just sit here and wait for our demise.

503
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:02,175
Let's go. Charge!

504
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,695
Come out!

505
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:17,035
You guys have been surrounded!

506
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:19,514
Stop your meaningless struggle!

507
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:22,395
We've already dealt with Fahai!

508
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:24,954
What should we do?

509
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,584
We'll give you guys one last chance.

510
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:29,624
If you don't come out, we'll charge inside!

511
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,895
Later, I'll draw their fire.

512
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:37,045
Find the right timing and kill all of them!

513
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,225
I'll count to three!

514
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:42,035
Three!

515
00:30:55,995 --> 00:31:00,185
You can't hit us.

516
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:02,045
Raise your arms!

517
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,390
♫ <i>Missing you</i> ♫

518
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,040
♫ <i>No better place to go, Amour</i> ♫

519
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,680
♫ <i>I even want to hear the birds say, "Miss me."</i> ♫

520

524
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:00,635
That's enough.

525
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:10,855
Seems like Plan B is working.

526
00:32:10,855 --> 00:32:12,765
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

527
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:16,135
I thought you had a Plan C?

528
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,835
Plan C?

529
00:32:24,955 --> 00:32:27,035
So I think that's all for today.

530
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:29,075
Next, we should enjoy a hot spring bath.

531
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:30,655
Let's go!

532
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,420
<i>[Jingfugong Hot Spring]</i>

533
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,390
Yunsheng, you're thirsty. Right?

534
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,819
That's right. I'm thirsty.

535
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,160
Let's go.

536
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,930
Hey, emcee of CUC.

537
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,140
Treat us to a drink.

538
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,750
What do you guys wish to drink?

539
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,549
- I want to go too!
- No! You aren't thirsty.

540
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:14,799
- Let's go!
- You aren't thirsty.

541
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,340
Let's go!

542
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,019
Our Little Niannian was hurt.

543
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,960
I'm here to apply some ointment for him.

544
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,999
My hand is cramping up! Hurry! Take this!

545
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,880
Hurry and apply the ointment for him.

546
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,239
My hand is cramping up. I'll go and take a look.

547
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,710
Sunian, were you hurt?

548
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,369
It's nothing.

549
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,579
Let me apply the ointment for you then.

550
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,410
Turn around.

551
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,800
Hurry.

552
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,150
Where did you get hurt?

553
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,620
Over here.

554
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,889
- Does it hurt?
- No.

555
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,890
Tell me if it hurts. Okay?

556
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,660
Why don't...

557
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,230
you tie your hair up?

558
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,830
What's the matter?

559
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,710
I'm feeling a little ticklish.

560
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,080
So you're afraid of being tickled?

561
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,960
I think it's fine now.

562
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm not done yet.

563
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,110
I said it's fine.

564
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,730
Sunian, you're afraid of being tickled, huh?

565
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,030
I knew it!

566
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,249
I remember now. You're afraid of being tickled!

567
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,790
Do you still want to mess around?

568
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,440
No.

569
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,360
I'll stop.

570
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,660
Are you finished?

571
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,970
I think I'm still thirsty. I'll head to the washroom.

572
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,150
Please continue.

573
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,770
Me too.

574
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,530
What happened?

575
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,340
Why were you so flustered?

576
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,000
What happened between you two?

577
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,840
Be honest with me.

578
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,980
You're done already?

579
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,050
You're overthinking it.

580
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,039
I was referring to the ointment. Did she finish applying it already?

581
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,230
Why are you suddenly so free?

582
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,000
You actually have the time to join us for games

583
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,800
and a hot spring bath.

584
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,340
My last design had earned me quite a lot of money.

585
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,010
I can relax for a while.

586
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,920
How do you plan to relax?

587
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,900
After a few days, I plan to bring Yunjin here

588
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,590
and show her around Beijing.

589
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,800
Your eyes smile whenever you mention Yunjin.

590
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,740
I have no choice.

591
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,090
You see, when someone has a person in their heart,

592
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,760
they won't be able to hide it.

593
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,130
By the way,

594
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,170
how did you get to know each other?

595
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,230
You mean us?

596
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,020
We were childhood friends.

597
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,560
So how did you know that you had fallen for her back then?

598
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,660
Regarding that, at first, I didn't know about it.

599
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,200
Boys are usually a bit slow on matters like this.

600
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:44,740
But one day, she came to me in a red cheongsam.

601
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,900
At that moment, I decided that she was the only woman I'd marry.

602
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,590
I'm so envious of you two.

603
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,180
Enough. Stop talking about us.

604
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,730
What about you two?

605
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,510
Finally, my effort wasn't in vain.

606
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,279
How did Sunian turn into someone like that all of a sudden?

607
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,550
He didn't change.

608
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,120
It's just that you two have finally been enlightened.

609
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,840
But now, there's another problem.

610
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,610
What problem?

611
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,400
Since you have confirmed that he likes you,

612
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
what about you?

613
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,930
Do you like him?

614
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,080
Do you wish to be together with him?

615
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,800
I'm pretty curious about something.

616
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,379
Say, since both of you like each other,

617
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,360
why don't you two be together?

618
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,470
I've thought about it before.

619
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,860
But I'm really afraid that everything might change...

620
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,769
once I take that step.

621
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,480
You're overthinking it.

622
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,800
The one thing you should think about

623
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,300
is can you live without her?

624
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,959
If you can't live without her, there's nothing for you to fear.

625
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:14,339
Anyway, no matter what the result will be, you're already relying on her.

626
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,890
Don't speak first.

627
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,610
We can determine a man's true feelings

628
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,280
by his willingness to marry his partner.

629
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,800
Close your eyes.

630
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,970
Close your eyes for now.

631
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,850
Imagine the wedding between you two.

632
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,150
<i>Do I like Sunian?</i>

633
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,800
<i>If we're together,</i>

634
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,000
<i>will everything change?</i>

635
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,270
Xue.

636
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,250
Xue?

637
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,930
Sunian.

638
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,740
What is this?

639
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,390
It's for you.

640
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,110
A mobile phone?

641
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,740
It's better if you have a mobile phone.

642
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,890
You can contact me anytime with it.

643
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,689
I'll bring you to register a new number tomorrow.

644
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,260
When it's done,

645
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,190
you must save my numberas your first contact person.

646
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,910
I want to be your first contact person, too.

647
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,560
Thank you, Sunian.

♫ <i>Although simplicity is plain, its vibrancy has never faded</i> ♫

655
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,090

656
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,910
♫ <i>They had accompanied me through everything</i> ♫

657
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:35,770

662
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:22,550
♫ <i>I was this sober once but I still did the same thing</i> ♫

663
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:26,060
♫ <i>As days go by, I wish to forget</i> ♫

664

♫ <i>But unknowingly, I remember them again</i> ♫

665
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,910
♫ <i>I remember the deep feelings that were long gone</i> ♫
