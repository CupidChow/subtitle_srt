How about this? For now, we should focus on our respective jobs.

<i>The signal's quite weak.</i>

- Let's go see a movie.
- Sure.

98
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,919
It's a great movie.

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,180
Let's go. I want popcorn.

100
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,159
Xue, it's the weekend tomorrow.

101
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,410

Yes.

107

Yunjin is a young and promising designer.

108
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,249
Working with her does more good than harm to your brand.

109
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,540
Trust me.

110
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,170
You will definitely not regret your decision.

111
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,600
Hello?

112
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,720
Mr. Bai.

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,360
You're so busy.

114
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,890
This client is too fussy.

115
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,780
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,019
Look what I'm doing. I asked you out for a drink

117
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:21,269
and I spent all that time on the phone.

118
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,109
I'll drink this one up. I'll drink this up.

119
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,140
Drink up.

120
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,509
You should drink with me.

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,800
- Here.
- Sunian. Let's drink.

122
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,720
Here.

123
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,610
What's wrong? Why do you look distracted?

124
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:39,379
"It has been eight hours since my dearest Xue last replied to my text."

125
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,430
"I miss her so much."

126
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,050
Sunian, did something happen between the two of you?

127
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,270
It seems like you hardly talk to each other lately.

128
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,190
I...

129
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,140
took a leap of faith.

130
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,300
I reckon I made the wrong decision.

131
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,210
You're trying to confess your feelings,

132
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,950
but she's running away from you.

133
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,390
That's not exactly true.

134
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,150
Hey.

135
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,120
Mr. Bai, are you off work already?

136
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,660
I'll get back to him tomorrow.

137
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,150
I'm here for my friends today.

138
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,520
Here.

139
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,900
Do you still remember the first time we had our meal here?

140
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,860
Of course, I do.

141
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,869
He drank only this much

142
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,059
when he made us his blood brothers. Right?

143
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,199
For me, being able to share a dormitory with you both

144
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,789
is one of the very few lucky things

145
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,509
that have ever happened to me.

146
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,610
Why are you being sentimental all of a sudden?

147
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,640
I'm going to move out soon.

148
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm sad to leave you behind.

149
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,890
Then, you should continue staying with us.

150
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,980
What's wrong with living in the dorm?

151
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,339
I always come home late at night and disturb your sleep.

152
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,880
That's why I think I should move out.

153
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,870
I'm going on exchange,

154
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,870
you're an intern, and he's starting a business.

155
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,019
It feels as if the three of us have already graduated.

156
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,670
Yes. I have to handle so much politics over meals, every day.

157
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,560
I forgot that I was still a student.

158
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm envious of Little Niannian.

159
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,310
All right.

160
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,900
Let's not talk about work and relationships today.

No. What's wrong?

Shao Xue is on a volunteer teaching program.

She departed yesterday.

I can, but it's going to be a very bumpy ride.

My friend volunteered as a teacher there. I can't get in touch with her.

- When did you last call her?
- Last night.

258
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,054
The rain was at its heaviest last night.

259
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,114
It's very likely that she's now trapped in the mountains.

260
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,654
Is she alone?

261

I think she has company.

00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,094
How about this?

265

Shao Xue!

300

Hey. Anyone there?

301
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,785

302
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:51,704
Anyone there?

303
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:54,194
- What's going on? Are you getting any signal on your phone?
- I'm not.

304
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:56,274
Xue! Xue! Are you getting any signal on your phone?

305
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:58,455
No. I still can't get through.

306
00:18:58,455 --> 00:19:01,494
Mo Hai, what should we do now?

307
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:04,434
Do you think I have an answer to that? How would I know that we would run into a mudslide?

308
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,364
If we fail to find a roof soon, we'll freeze to death right here.

309
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:10,315
Keep trying.

310

Try calling again.

311
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:14,724
If we continue to stay here, we'll either freeze to death or starve to death.

312
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:17,085
This is all your fault.

Let's not talk about anything else.

Who will bear the responsibility if any of you get hurt?

324
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:13,435
Who will be responsible for that?

325
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,125
I will.

326
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,715
You will?

327
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,735
Can you really bear the consequences?

328
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:22,094
Let's not talk about the others.

329
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,605
Can you even be responsible for yourself?

Sunian.

331
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,645
You came here recklessly.

332
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:46,175
Other than causing trouble, you are a good-for-nothing.

333
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:50,375
Then... what should we do now?

334
00:20:55,095 --> 00:20:59,895
Sir, I found them. I'm going to bring them over now.

335
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:03,655
<i>- Are they all right?</i>
- They're fine. Don't worry. Thanks for your hard work.

Hurry up. Be careful. Don't trip.

<i>Are you trying to put an end to my life?</i>

339

Your father and I can't live without you.

340
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,755
We can't live without you.

341
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:42,185
Mom, it's my fault.

342
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:46,534
I stood in the rain for a very long time, and I have now lost my voice.

343
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:49,534
Will you please let it go for now?

344
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:52,094
You're always heedless of the consequences of your actions.

345

You do whatever you want.

346

That's enough. Pass the phone to me.

<i>Xue, your mom is just worried about you.</i>

348
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:04,264
You should have given us a heads up before going anywhere.

349
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:06,505
Pass your phone to Sunian.

350

Sunian, thank you for going out there to find Xue.

353
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:27,595
- You must bring her back in one piece.
- Yes.

354
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,245
I will appreciate it a lot.

355
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:31,275
Don't worry, Mr. Shao.

356
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:34,515
I'll send her home in one piece.

357
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:39,794
Why did you hang up the phone? I haven't finished yet.

358
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:43,274
You have to give her a lecture. What's wrong with this kid?

359
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,855
Why can't she focus on her studies? Why can't she stay where she is?

360
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,624
That's enough.

Nothing else matters now that we've found her.

362

What did my dad say to you?

363
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,470
Don't talk to me.

364
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:03,435
I'm trying to control my emotions.

365

I don't want to end up scolding you, too.

The nearest hotel is about five or six kilometers away.

It's normal for couples to fight.

Don't fight anymore. Stay here tonight. Don't fight.

Yes. I made a mistake, but I'm still sad.

You had no idea how scared I was.

488
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,355
How can you not take responsibility for your actions?

489
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:10,025
Anyway, get out of bed now. Be a good girl.

490
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:13,065
Why should I listen to you?

491
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:16,875
I'll reward you later.

492
00:37:21,835 --> 00:37:23,504
You can start teaching today.

493
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:25,585
The school will send a car to pick us up later.

494
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:29,255
Sunian, you're amazing.

495
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:33,404
I've been working when a certain someone was sleeping like a log.

496
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:36,655
At most, you were up 30 minutes before me.

497
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,965
How did you get everything done so quickly?

498
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:43,484
I spent 20 minutes talking to the public servant in charge and the school's principal.

499
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:45,305
Then...

500
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:49,845
I spent another 10 minutes kissing you.

501
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:04,535
I got you this.

502
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,914
Zheng is here to join us for dinner.

503
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,334
Why can't you stop sighing?

504
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:14,805
I'm sighing because I'm still mad.

505
00:38:14,805 --> 00:38:17,484
Why is that rascal not home yet?

506
00:38:17,484 --> 00:38:20,134
I'll make sure to break her legs when she comes home.

507
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:22,504
Sure. She'll lose her legs when she gets home.

508
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:24,234
No one dares come home anymore.

509
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:27,194
Moreover, it's not your place to complain.

510
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:28,944
Zheng hasn't said anything about it yet.

511
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:30,524
His son is now trapped in the mountains

512
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:32,714
because of your daughter.

513
00:38:32,714 --> 00:38:34,064
What did you say?

514
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:36,634
My daughter? Is she not yours?

515
00:38:36,634 --> 00:38:38,754
He's not exactly trapped in the mountains.

516
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:40,604
They are there to teach. They are doing quite well.

517
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:42,624
He even sent me a few photos.

518
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:43,834
He sent photos to me too,

519
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,834
but why can't I see the photos?

520
00:38:45,835 --> 00:38:47,995
You can't see the photos? Let me take a look.

521
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:50,945
See.

522
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,475
You need internet before you can see the photos.

523
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:59,944
Do mobile phones need to be connected to the internet now?

524
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:02,204
Where do I plug in the cable?

525
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:04,394
To use this, you need to pay the mobile business hall a visit

526
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:05,744
to get it connected to the internet.

527
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:08,165
Do I have to go to the mobile business hall?

528
00:39:08,855 --> 00:39:09,934
Zheng.

529
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:12,124
Don't waste your time teaching him. He won't know how to do it.

530
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:14,545
You should teach me instead.

531
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:16,854
What photos were you talking about?

532
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,174
- Can you show me?
- Here.

533
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,904
- Here.
- Move.

534
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,974
- You won't know how to do it if I don't.
- That's enough.

535
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:29,074
This.

536
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:31,225
You can zoom in, too.

537
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:36,774
I never knew how photogenic Xue is.

538
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,334
There are quite a few photos.

539
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,104
Look.

540
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:41,875
Another photo.

541
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,624
Look.

542
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,235
Another one.

543
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:47,175
This is a good one.

544
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:51,125
Another one. You can zoom in.

545
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,875
Look.

546
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,044
Xue looks like a boy.

547
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:04,774
This rascal.

548
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:08,694
Why is she always sticking with Sunian? This boy...

549
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,434
Sunian is not being sensitive enough.

550
00:40:10,435 --> 00:40:13,535
I'll remind him when he gets back.

551
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:15,294
They are no longer kids.

552
00:40:15,294 --> 00:40:16,164
Zheng, eat up.

553
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,435
Let's eat.

554
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:21,684
Zheng, teach me how to set up the internet

555
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,715
when you're free.

556
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,144
I should be the one getting the internet.

557
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:26,984
I need it to read the news to know what's going on in the country.

558
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:28,294
Only one of us needs the internet.

559
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:30,385
It'd be a waste of money for both of us to get the internet together.

560
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:36,355
Eat up.

561
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,650
<i>[Liuli Hutong]</i>

562
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:12,545
Don't worry.

563
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:15,025
They are all at work.

564
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:21,975
Sunian, where are you going later?

565
00:41:21,975 --> 00:41:23,484
I'm going to the Restoration Department.

566
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:25,904
I'm going to submit the drawings I did in the past few days.

567
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:29,255
Are you leaving so soon?

568
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:33,535
Are you not going to send your girlfriend home?

569
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,585
Of course, I am. Let's go.

570
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:56,355
Your drawings...

571
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:02,045
are getting better and better,

572
00:42:03,485 --> 00:42:08,084
but can you explain why added a person here in this drawing?

573
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:11,465
Did I ruin the structure of the drawing?

574
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:16,274
This drawing has mountains, water, grass, and trees.

575
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:19,085
It's no different from what you always draw.

576
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:21,734
The only difference is the person right here.

577
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:26,005
It has brought the drawing to life.

578
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:30,695
She is Xue, right?
