00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:18,628
I worry that if I get a younger sibling,

35
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:23,876
everyone's love for me will be halved.

36

You promised not to laugh.

37

I'm really worried.

38
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,040
Like what they always say,

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,939
"The second child is the cutest, and the eldest child is the least favorite."

40
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,799
My mom has never really liked me, and I'm not a smart kid.

41
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:42,229
If a second-born comes and grabs everyone's attention,

42
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,929
where do I stand in the family?

43
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,439
How can your mom not like you?

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,209
Ms. Yu only has eyes for you.

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,669
For now, yes.

46
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,760
Who knows what will happen in the future?

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,479
What if...

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,719
What if each of you prefers the baby over me?

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,770
What should I do?

50
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,999
If I have a younger brother

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,139
who is not only smarter than me,

52
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,989
but also looks better than me, will you stop talking to me?

53
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,599
Of course not.

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,410
Sunian will always be Sunian.

55
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,070
It's the same for me, and everyone else.

56
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,319
We'll still love you as always.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,850
Not only that, you'll get even more love.

58
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,389
How so?

59
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,109
The love coming from your younger sibling.

60
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,970
They will love you as we all do.

61
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,719
The baby will be very adorable and follow you everywhere.

62
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,039
You can play with the baby when you're bored,

63
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,180
and rant at the baby when you're upset.

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,489
You'll be the baby's role model and the baby's idol.

65
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,609
You'll be an amazing big sister for the baby.

66
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,710
You'll strive to do better...

67
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,030
for the baby.

68
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,439
Let's go home now.

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,010
I need to talk to the baby immediately.

70
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,329
I have to show the baby who the boss is.

71
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,209
Hurry up.

72
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,320
Mom, I'm home!

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,330
I heard that I'm going to be a big sister.

74
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,509
What's wrong?

75
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,410
Xue, your mom is getting up in years.

76
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,220
The results of her physical examination

77
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,900
don't seem good.

78
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,859
Chances are you won't get to be a big sister anymore.

79
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,560
Mom.

80
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm all right.

81
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,909
Mom, don't be sad.

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,020
I will love you even more from now on.

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,839
Not only that, but I will also love you on behalf of my younger sister.

84
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,169
I'll give you a double amount of love.

85
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:01,870
How do you know the baby is a girl?

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,830
Because I prefer a younger sister.

87
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,820
If I get a younger brother like Zhang Qi,

88
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,630
I'd be driven up the wall.

89
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,000
Mom.

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,700
I think I'm really blessed...

91
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,709
to be born into this world,

92
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,700
and to be able to know you,

93
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,690

94
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,530
and everyone else.

95
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,800
I truly think that I'm blessed.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,650
The blessings are mine.

97
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,970
Have you passed all levels of Chinese Paladin?

98
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,820
I stopped playing a while ago.

99
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,840
Don't you like Zhao Ling'er anymore?

100
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,290
Sunian, do you think there are any signs

101
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,500
if you're interested in a person?

102
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,500
I guess...

103
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,120
you'd always want to see her.

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,490

105
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,520

<i>Nope.</i>

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,520
You want her...

108
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,199
to only have eyes for you.

109
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,589
<i>Not at all.</i>

110
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,119
Indeed. I'm not interested in her.

Who are you talking about?

112

I am not interested in Ran Mori.

113

I have always preferred Ai Haibara.

He's just like an angel.

Of course, she can.

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
Mr. Luo, I want this, too.

322
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,500
Can I have this too, please?

323
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,800
<i>[Celebrating a New Year, let the festive spring last forever.]</i>

324
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,600
Do you know what these words mean?

325
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,800
I only picked these because I don't know what they mean.

326
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,600
Sunian, explain it to her.

327
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,800
This is the first set of New Year scrolls in human history.

328
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,200
It's from Meng Chang, the ruler of the Later Shu.

329
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,200
Pick a horizontal scroll.

330
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,000
Mr. Luo, can you write me another one?

331
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
None of these are good for you, huh?

332
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,400
I want something that's simple enough for me to understand.

333
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,700
What should I write?

334
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
"An auspicious New Year."

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
Why don't you just say "Happy New Year"?

336
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,600
There's nothing wrong with "An auspicious New Year."

337
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,500
Here. Let me write it for you.

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,300
Hey, Mom.

339
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,000
<i>Are you done with the New Year shopping?</i>

340
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Yes, I am.

341
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
<i>Come home now.</i>

342
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,400
<i>I need your help to send out the items.</i>

343
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,600
Sure. I'll go home right away.

344
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,600
<i>[An Auspicious New Year]</i>

345
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,900
Mr. Luo, can I have these, please?

346
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,000
Get a horizontal scroll, too.

347
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,300
Thank you, Mr. Luo. You're so nice.

348
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's go home now. We're running late.

349
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,100
- Mr. Luo, we shall get going now.
- Sure.

350
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,100
- Bye, Mr. Luo.
- Bye, Mr. Luo. Happy New Year!

351
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,500
Happy New Year.

352
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Happy New Year. Don't stay out too late.

353
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,800
Are all New Year scrolls these days of such a high quality?

354
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,600
Yeah. They are so well written.

355
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,100
- Where did you get these?
- Mr. Luo wrote these.

356
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,300
Aren't you proud of me?

357
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,000
Now I know why.

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,400
My daughter. If you can get a painting from Mr. Luo,

359
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,800
we'll have our future all worked out.

360
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
What are you talking about?

361
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,200
How can you say that to your kid?

362
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,700
I was just kidding.

363
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,300
<i>Dongge!</i>

364
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,500
- Ms. Li.
- Ms. Li.

365
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm here to send you my greetings.

366
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
Thanks. Happy New Year.

367
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,000
- Happy New Year.
- Have a seat.

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Come on in.

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,900
Sure.

370
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm here today to bring you good news.

371
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,000
However, this is still confidential as of now. You have to keep it to yourself.

372
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,200
Sure. Go ahead.

373
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,300
My daughter works as a clerk at the school's outreach office, right?

374
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,600
Her colleague told her

375
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
that Xue's school will be doing a two-plus-one program

376
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
starting next year.

377
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,100
A two-plus-one program?

378
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,300
Yes.

379
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Oh, thanks.

380
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,900
They will be working together with foreign high schools.

381
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,600
They will first spend two years in the local school,

382
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,800
before they get sent abroad to complete their senior year.

383
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,500
In that case, it'll be way easier for them

384
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,000
to get enrolled in famous schools overseas.

385
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,300
The spots are so limited,

386
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,500
and I don't think Xue is good enough to get chosen.

387
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,000
Why am I here if she's not good enough for that?

388
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,000
I asked my daughter if anyone from our neighborhood got chosen.

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
Initially, she refused to tell me.

390
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
But you know how good I am at inquiring.

391
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,700
I got the information without much effort.

392
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,500
Xue has been shortlisted.

393
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,100
- Really?
- Yes.

394
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,300
Ms. Li, is the source trustworthy?

395
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,100
Of course, it is.

396
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,900
Although Xue is just an average student, she's good at English.

397
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,600
You only have to work a little harder. I'm here to make sure everything goes well.

398
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,900
That's great, Ms. Li. Have some candies.

399
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,200
- Sure.
- Have some more.

400
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,500
Thank you in advance.

401
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,700
Thanks.

402
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Ms. Li, do you think she has to stay there if she gets to study abroad?

403
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,200
Of course.

404
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
Not everyone gets this opportunity.

405
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
Have some more.

406
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,900
I have yet to finish this.

407
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,200
Xue, there's still a long way to go.

408
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,700
Don't let this matter slip.

409
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,200
Mom, I'm going to deliver the goods.

410
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Bye, Ms. Li. Have some more.

411
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,700
Sure. Bye!

412
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
She's full of zest.

413
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,400
What a great kid.

414
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,900
Have some drinks.

Mr. Lin! I'm here to deliver the goods.

Mr. Yang, it's Sunian. Happy New Year.

Bye.

433
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,000
How are you doing?

434
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,900
I have yet to visit Mr. Sun's place.

435
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,500
I only have Mr. Sun's place left, too.

436
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,300
- Me too.
- Let's go.

437
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,400
What did you say last year?

438
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Have you forgotten it?

439
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,600
Leave the past in the past, Mr. Sun.

440
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
- Mr. Sun!
- Mr. Sun!

441
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,100
- Siyuan, you are here too.
- Siyuan.

442
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,400
- Mr. Sun.
- Siyuan.

443
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,200
You're all here.

444
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I was just talking to him before you came by.

445
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,500
Didn't I tell you not to bring any gifts?

446
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,000
The gifts are just an excuse for us to visit you.

447
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,300
We worry that you have no one to play chess with.

448
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,700
These two clever kids have silver tongues.

449
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,400
Siyuan.

450
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,150
This is a digital camera, right?

451
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
What?

452
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
A digital camera.

453
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,800
- Let's go and take a look.
- Let's go.

454
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,000
- A digital camera?
- Yes.

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,600
Look at this. It's yours.

456
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,000
Is this any good compared to the Kodak I have?

457
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's no match for this one.

458
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
With this thing, you don't even have to process the film.

459
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,800
You can simply connect this to your computer.

460
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,100
You can make the photos however big you want them to be.

461
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,700
Besides, you don't have to worry about the colors fading.

462
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
This must be expensive.

463
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,600
It wasn't that expensive. I've got myself a side job

464
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
and made some extra money.

465
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,400
You've got yourself a side job, huh?

466
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
Have you found your next job?

467
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Not yet.

468
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,400
I haven't got things figured out yet.

469
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
It's time for you to give it some thought.

470
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
Don't let the opportunity pass you by.

471
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,200
Siyuan, are you planning to leave the Restoration Department?

472
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
How should I put this?

473
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,200
For them, I'm a foreigner.

474
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
The salary I get from working at the Restoration Department

475
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,900
is only enough for me to pay my rent and buy food.

476
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,800
I can hardly save money every month.

477
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,000
That's why I thought that since I'm a polytechnic graduate,

478
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm planning to get myself a technical job.

479
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,900
In that case, I'll be able to earn more.

480
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,000
However, after I mulled over it, I figured that it might not be a completely good idea.

481
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,900
What do you mean?

482
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,600
Perhaps, deep down, I still love doing restoration a lot.

483
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,400
Siyuan, you look extra handsome

484
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
when you are doing restoration.

485
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,000
I see you have learned how to compliment others.

486
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,200
This... What is this?

487
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,400
Mr. Sun, let me teach you how to do it.

488
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,300
There are portrait mode and landscape mode. You can record a video and check out the photos.

489
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,800
I'll give you an example.

490
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,500
Let's say if we're taking a photo.

491
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,000
Press this button to zoom.

492
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Mr. Sun, Happy New Year.

493
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Qiaomu, you are here.

494
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,100
Let me introduce her.

495
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,700
Fu Qiaomu. A graduate student from the art school.

496
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,200
She'll be joining us after the Spring Festival.

497
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Qiaomu, he is your senior.

498
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,400
Soon, she'll be your junior.

499
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,000
Senior.

500
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,300
Ju-Junior.

501
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,100
Hi, Qiaomu. I'm Shao Xue.

502
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,800
You can call me Xue.

503
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,400
- Have a seat.
- Hi, Xue.

504
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Hello, everyone.

505
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,300
Have some candies.

506
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,100
What are you looking at?

507
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,600
Go and make some tea.

508
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,500
Sunian, ma-make tea.

509
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,900
Mr. Sun, I'll go and make tea for everyone.

510
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,200
Fine. I'll go.

511
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
I'll go.

512
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,800
Little brat.

513
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,100
Senior, how long have you been working at the Restoration Department?

514
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,400
A little more than a year.

515
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,600
Does it mean that you're done with your practical training?

516
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Are you planning to stay here?

517
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,800
Are you planning to stay here?

518
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,800
I heard that Mr. Sun is really strict.

519
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,200
If you're planning to stay on,

520
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I can learn the work from you.

521
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,400
Where's the papertowels?

522
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,100
I-I'll go to get them.

523
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,000
Is there a cloth I can use?

524
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
Mr. Sun.

525
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,700
Isn't your son, Mr. Sun, coming home?

526
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
He has to make a long journey to come home

527
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,400
and he is busy with his research.

528
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,200
That's why I told him to stay there.

529
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
You can go and visit him abroad instead.

530
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,800
Why do I have to go abroad during the Spring Festival?

531
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,200
I don't understand their language,

532
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,000
and there's no delicious food.

533
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm not going there.

534
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,800
I will only cause trouble to others if I go there. I'm not going.

535
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,500
The tea is ready.

536
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Siyuan, how do you use this?

537
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
Let me show you how.

538
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
This is fully automatic.

539
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,500
Portrait, landscape, and video.

540
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,900
Let me demonstrate it to you.

541
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,400
This is to zoom. Zoom.

542
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,900
Siyuan, you're only focusing on Qiaomu.

543
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,800
Why don't you take photos of us, too?

544
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,600
I'm just demonstrating it to them.

545
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,700
Let me take a photo of Mr. Sun. Here.

546
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,800
Why are you taking a photo of me? I'm in my pajamas.

547
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,100
Give it...

548
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,200
Bring them out to take a picture of the winter landscape. The yard is covered in snow.

549
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
What for? It's freezing.

550
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,400
Let's go. Hurry up.

551
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,500
Let's take a photo of the winter landscape.

552
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's go.

553
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,700
Hurry up.

554
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,500
Hurry up!

555
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Where should we go?

556
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,700
Right here. Isn't this spot nice?

557
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,500
Here.

558
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,400
Strike a pose. I'll count to three.

559
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
One, two...

560
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,300
Wait a minute.

561
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,900
Make yourselves shorter.

562
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,300
Lower yourselves. Hurry up.

563
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,100
All right.

564
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,400
Three, two, one.

565
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
Wait a minute. That...

566
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,700
Take another shot. I sneezed.

567
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,900
It ran out of battery and it has shut down on its own.

568
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,600
It ran out of battery.

569
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,800
It shut down on its own.

570
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,700
- Delete the photo once you recharge the battery.
- Sure.

571
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,400
- Siyuan, send the photo to me later.
- Sure.

572
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
You can't send the photo to him.

573
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
<i>Xue, come home for dinner!</i>

574
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,600
Let's go. It's dinner time.

575
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,000
Mr. Sun, we've got to go. Bye!

576
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
All right.

577
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,300
Bye, Siyuan. Bye!

578
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,600
They are here to pay you a visit.

579
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,700
Let's take a photo of the two of us.

580
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,200
What if someday you're leaving,

581
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,800
and there's no photo of both of us.

582
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,200
- I'll take the photo for you.
- It's okay. It ran out of battery.

583
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
We can do it any other time. It's not necessary to take a photo today.

584
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
What if you're leaving soon?

585
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,500
How are we going to take a photo together?

586
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm not leaving.

587
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,400
Didn't you just say that you haven't made your decision?

588
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,000
I've just made up my mind.

589
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,200
It's nice that you're not leaving.

590
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Here. Have some candies.

591
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,200
Have some more.

592
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,100
It's nice that you're not leaving.

593
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,800
<i>[Liuli Hutong]</i>

594
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,500
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Be careful.

595
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,700
Be careful. It's hot.

596
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,900
Did you burn yourself?

597
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,200
Are you all right?

598
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
I knew it would happen. Be careful.

599
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,700
We're busy preparing for the Lunar New Year, but look at Ji Lan...

600
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,400
It's Lunar New Year and she went to Hainan.

601
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
How boring.

602
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
All she wants to do is bring Shiyin's grandma on a vacation.

603
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,300
The old lady has never gone on a vacation before.

604
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,700
Don't you know that the old lady initially refused to go?

605
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,000
She said that she didn't want her son to spend unnecessarily.

606
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
Tianbao almost got on his knees

607
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,000
before she finally agreed to go on the vacation.

608
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,300
I can understand how the old lady feels.

609
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,400
It's Lunar New Year and everyone wants to stay at home.

610
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,200
You can only feel the festive atmosphere when you spend Lunar New Year at home.

611
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,400
Speaking of festive atmosphere,

612
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,800
as long as you're rich enough,

613
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
you can get it no matter where you are.

614
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,600
If you have sufficient money and your family is around,

615
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,000
you can get the festive atmosphere no matter where you go.

616
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Look at the newspaper office.

617
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,800
They aggressively promoted spending before Lunar New Year.

618
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Trust me. In the coming few years,

619
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,400
all traditional festivals will turn into dates

620
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,200
that force you to spend more money.

621
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,400
You can't always buy traditions with money.

622
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,000
These festivals originated thousands of years ago.

623
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,200
Sometimes, they are like relics.

624
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,700
They are something the modern arts and technologies cannot replicate.

625
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,000
You've got a point.

626
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,200
Back then, we were all students of the Restoration Department.

627
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,400
Now, both of you are still restoring relics.

628
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,800
I, on the other hand, started selling magazines.

629
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,700
One day, when my boy grows up and is financially independent,

630
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,400
I'll return to the Restoration Department if they still find me useful.

631
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,800
That's all they could wish for.

632
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,000
You have no idea about this, but when you were leaving,

633
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,400
the dean was depressed for many days.

634
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,600
He was sad to see you go.

635
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,100
Exactly.

636
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,600
Yes.

637
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,200
I was sad to leave as well.

638
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,000
It wasn't my choice that his dad left us when he was still young.

639
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,400
There's a boy at home.

640
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
I need to earn money

641
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,400
and put food on the table for him. Right?

642
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,000
What are you talking about?

643
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
Don't overthink it.

644
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,600
What's with earning money to put food on the table?

645
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,700
Our Editor Zhang's salary is more than enough

646
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,800
to keep the stomachs of all Liuli Hutong's residents filled for months.

647
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
It's true.

648
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Look at you.

649
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,000
You need to snack less. We're going to have dinner soon.

650
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
None of your business.

651
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,000
Let me share something big with you.

652
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,100
What is it about?

653
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,600
From now on, cherish every moment

654
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,600
and every Lunar New Year you get to spend with me.

655
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,000
You might not be able to see me again in the future.

656
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,500
Why?

657
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,100
I have been shortlisted as one of the candidates of the two-plus-one program.

658
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,400
The study-abroad program?

659
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,200
Your grades are terrible. Why did they even pick you?

660
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,400
I'm good at English.

661
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
How long will you be away?

662
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
If I do well enough, I can attend university abroad.

663
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,000
If you do well at university, you'll get to work there as well.

664
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,900
That's right. Here, Sunian.

665
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,800
Where's mine?

666
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,700
Don't you feel sad about leaving this place?

667
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,900
Of course not.

668
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,800
Isn't it boring to stay at the same place forever?

669
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,400
I agree with her.

670
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,100
Isn't that the case for our parents?

671
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,800
That's not the case for Ms. Jin Ning.

672
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Ms. Jin Ning has been to many different places.

673
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,300
She came home eventually.

674
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,000
Doesn't it prove that this place is the best?

675
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,900
At least, she has seen the world.

676
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
Even if she's back, she has kept the world in her heart.

677
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,300
Anyhow, I have to go out there to broaden my horizons.

678
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,100
That's the only way I can live with no regrets.

679
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,000
You're so ambitious. I've got your back.

680
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,400
Thanks, dude.

681
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,600
Pick it up.

682
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,400
Kids, dinner time!

683
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
- Hurry up, kids!
- We're coming.

684
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Let's go to eat, Sunian.

687
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,100
<i>Sunian, come and join us.</i>

688
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Bring the wine over.

689
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,400
Here.

690
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,800

692
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,500

693

Mom.

696
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,900
Did you forget something?

697
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,300
Yes, I did.

698
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,000
I forgot to tell you

699
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
that we're not giving out red envelopes this year.

700
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,800
However, I'll keep the money for you.

701
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,000
When you enroll in university, I'll reward you with a big one.

702
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,420
Dad!

703
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,050
Zheng.

704
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:08,029
Mom, am I not going to get any red envelopes, either?

705
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,640
Good boy. Let's dig in.

706
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,079
Zhang Qi, have some prawns.

707
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,049
You should learn from Sunian.

708
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,889
- He's such a good boy.
- Precisely.

709
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,020
Sunian, have some more.

710
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,730
Mom, leave the dishes to me.

711
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,230
This is for you.

712
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,220
You should keep it, Mom.

713
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,240
It's Lunar New Year and this is a symbol of good luck.

714

716

I wish you good health in the new year.

717
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,369
You should go get some rest, I can handle this.

718
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,780
Don't overwork yourself, either.

<i>Three million!</i>

00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,579
If I were given this amount of money, I would never want to take the chance.

722
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,229
Dream on. Get me an apple.

723
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,110
- Can't you get it yourself?
- Hurry up.

724
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,529
Get it yourself.

725
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,140
Sunian, pass me an apple.

726
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,300
Sunian is much nicer than you.

727
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,930
Xue,

728
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,810
if you pass the final interview, will you go abroad?

729
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,149
Of course.

730
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,590
Of course, she has to go. I wouldn't hesitate either if I were her.

731
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,380
I'll do my best.

732
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,970
Anyway, Sunian, you write better than me.

733
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,980
Can you tutor me when you're free?

734
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,070
Are you sleepy already?

735
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,780
I bet you won't be able to stay up tonight either.

736
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,419
That's not true. I'll certainly be able to stay awake until midnight.

737
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:35,229
- Sunian, make sure I stay awake.
- It doesn't count if you need someone else to keep you awake.

738
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:36,470
Want a bet?

739
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,629
Sure. What are we betting on?

740
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,130
If you lose,

741
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,640
you'll have to buy me the latest set of Detective Conan.

742
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,270
If you lose, you'll buy me 20 meals from Pizza Hut.

743
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,479
- Won't you get stuffed to death?
- I dare you.

744
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:52,140
- Sure. Sunian will be the judge.
- Okay.

745
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,480
Sunian is the best.

746
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,740
Xue, don't eat too much.

747
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,030
You have been eating the entire evening.

748
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,279
- Got it.
- Two dots.

749
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:10,149
If we win the lottery and earn millions, you don't have to keep it from me.

750
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:11,860
I can take it.

751
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,850
You can take it, but I can't.

752
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,819
I'm running out of tiles. Give me something. Quick.

753
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,220
- Five bamboos.
- I win.

754
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,219
- I win.
- We've won, too.

755
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:27,839
We won this together. There are two winners.

756
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,200
How are you so good at this?

757
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,880
Sunian, what are you doing?

758
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,980
Are you thinking...

759
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,770
of painting my face?

760
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,599
- I won the lottery!
- Give me back my red envelope!

761
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,539
- You fell asleep.
- I didn't.

You promised to buy us meals.

765
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:06,319
- I did not.
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.

00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:13,020
♫ <i>All the memories are embedded deep within my heart</i> ♫

804
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,500
♫ <i>The past I've been hiding from year after year</i> ♫

805
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,290
♫ <i>Carved into the days long gone</i> ♫

806
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:28,240
♫ <i>Although simplicity is plain, its vibrancy has never faded</i> ♫

807
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,890
♫ <i>Those songs in the past</i> ♫

808
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,580
♫ <i>They had accompanied me through everything</i> ♫

809
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:43,520
♫ <i>Singing about the stubbornness of our youth</i> ♫

810
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:51,210
♫ <i>Using this song to boost our courage as we sing</i> ♫

811
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:58,329
♫ <i>Please don't cry because you have me</i> ♫

812
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,670
♫ <i>Until I saw the bustling city</i> ♫

813
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,350
♫ <i>Until I realized that it was once within my reach</i> ♫

814
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:30,750
♫ <i>I was this sober once but I still did the same thing</i> ♫

815
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,960
♫ <i>As days go by, I wish to forget</i> ♫

816
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,750
♫ <i>But unknowingly, I remember them again</i> ♫

817
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:41,670
♫ <i>I remember the deep feelings that were long gone</i> ♫

818
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,490
♫ <i>Within those simple days</i> ♫

819
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:53,210
♫ <i>Those songs in the past, they had accompanied me</i> ♫

820
00:44:53,210 --> 00:45:00,880
♫ <i>As I regretted our parting during our youth</i> ♫

821
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,800
♫ <i>Using this song, this song belongs to us</i> ♫

822
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,570
♫ <i>Please don't cry again</i> ♫

823
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:18,900
♫ <i>And don't ask when I'll return</i> ♫
