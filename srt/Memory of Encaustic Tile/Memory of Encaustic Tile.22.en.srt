00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,170
I haven't made up my mind yet.

164
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,630
I'm pretty bad at everything.

165
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,169
I'm in a dilemma as well.

166
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,260
Initially, I thought of asking my parents about it.

167
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,700
But I think they have no idea as well.

168
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,570
Tomorrow is the weekend, right? I think I'll go and ask Sunian about it.

169
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,740
I'm so envious of you.

170
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,639
You have so many friends that can assist you in making life decisions.

171
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,170
Wu Huan, what about you? Which course did you pick?

172
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,910
I don't plan on getting into any university.

173
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,359
I'm already attending interviews.

174
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,140
- Interviews?
- Interviews?

175
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,569
I'm not cut out for studying. I plan to work.

176
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,619
- What kind of work?
- Logistics.

177
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,619
What's that?

178
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,220
Online shopping is the current trend, right?

179
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,749
Logistics involves sending and packing the goods.

180
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,959
I think it has a lot of potential.

181
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,450
You're right. Now, more and more people are buying into the idea of online shopping. You have great foresight.

182
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,629
I don't dare to brag about anything else,

183
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,050
but you guys will get free delivery when you buy things online in the future.

184
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,690
I'll remember that. I'll make a move first.

185
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,840
You guys can enjoy your chat. Goodbye.

186
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,280
Goodbye.

187
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,019
Wu Huan,

188
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,260
are... are you free tomorrow?

189
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,500
What's the matter?

190
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,900
I...

191
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,860
I wish to treat you to a meal.

192
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,579
I want to thank you for finding me a job at the supermarket.

193
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,620
I should be the one thanking you instead.

194
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,140
The supervisor told me that you begged him to give me your wage

195
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,720
and told him to lie to me that I got a raise.

196
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,629
How could he do this?

197
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,340
He promised me that he'd keep it a secret.

198
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,820
He shouldn't keep that a secret.

199
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,670
You must never do this again in the future.

200
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,600
Thank you. I'll make a move first.

201
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,810
Wu Huan!

202
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,020
Thank you for treating me as a friend.

203
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,870
See you.

204
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,320
Take a guess at whose gift this is.

205
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,549
You have no idea, right?

206
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,050
Listen up.

207
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,610
This is...

208
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,320
for you.

209
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,479
- Who gave it to me?
- Xue Ning, the beauty of the design course.

210
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:27,930
My goodness. She's fair, rich, and beautiful.

211
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,129
If you still care about that little girlfriend of yours,

212
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:34,320
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for your sake.

213
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,260
You may go ahead.

214
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,510
As the saying goes, "You should not covet

215
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,070
your friend's wife." Here, take it.

216
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,720
Hey, don't you think it's strange?

217
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,680
Why isn't anyone trying to court Little Niannian?

218
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,850
Look at his amazing figure and marvelous looks.

219
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,240
Even a guy like me would fall for you.

220
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,290
Thank you for nothing, I guess.

221
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,370
Let's get straight into business. What kind of girl do you like?

222
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,380
I can introduce someone to you.

223
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,770
I have no interest in relationships.

224
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,380
So you've never been in a relationship before, am I right?

225
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,810
I can tell at first glance. You have no experience at all!

226
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,339
If so, you've found the right person.

227
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm truly an expert when it comes to relationships.

228
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,340
Listen, in the past, I was chased by an endless number of girls.

229
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,960
They were lining up in order to court me.

230
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,870
What do you mean by that? You don't believe me?

231
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,139
I never boast.

232
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,480
I can swear to the heavens.

Sunian.

239
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:46,884
Shouldn't you introduce her to us?

240
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,625
So who is she?

241
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,435
She's my neighbor.

244
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:05,465
Little Niannian?

245
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,705
Let's go.

246
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:09,954
We're leaving already?

247
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:13,375
What? Do you still wish to see him naked?

248
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:18,225
No thanks. Let's go.

249
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,325
Visit us when you're free, okay?

250
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,945
Remember to visit us.

251
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:32,405
Do you believe that he's only treating her as his neighbor?

252
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:34,705
That's none of your business.

253
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:39,534
Sunian, your dorm mate looks pretty flippant.

254
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:40,995
You shouldn't let him influence you too much.

255
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:44,125
Pei Shu is the only problematic one. Yunsheng is fine.

256
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:48,325
I think he doesn't like to speak.

257
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:51,834
Maybe it's because he's having a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend.

258
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:55,474
Do you think a long-distance relationship is reliable?

259
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,325
I saw many girls trying to court him.

260
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:00,635
But he has no interest in them. He's pretty loyal.

261
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:05,244
That's pretty great. You should hang out with him more often and avoid Pei Shu.

262
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:07,745
Let's go. I'll bring you around.

265
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:24,125
Sunian, since when did you like to drink coffee?

266
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:26,825
I'm just trying something new occasionally.

267
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,704
It's very fragrant.

268
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:32,084
By the way, why were you looking for me?

269
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:34,885
Our teacher asked us about the major we wanted to choose.

270
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:38,065
I feel a bit lost. What do you think I should pick?

271
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,084
What did your parents say?

272
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:42,615
Of course, my mother wants me to get into Tsinghua or Peking University.

273
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:43,995
But my father is more realistic.

274
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,990
He told me to let nature take its course.

00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,925
What is it?

279
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:02,405
A girl from our batch wanted to major in minority languages.

280
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:04,274
But I'm not really clear about that.

281
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,865
I only know that you must have a good command of English before you can major in that course.

282
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:08,955
What's the use of learning that?

283
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,174
It depends on you.

284
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:12,695
Worst case scenario, you can be a translator.

285
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:15,704
What's wrong with being a translator? A translator is good enough.

286
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,885
That's right. It's viable even if it's the worst-case scenario.

287
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:21,224
And this course is mainly in English. You don't need to worry at all.

You're right. I'm very talented with languages.

I didn't notice that. Instead, I think that you have pretty hands.

Of course. Shiyin's dream is to become a host. Of course, she's eloquent.

323
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:47,545
You must be Wu Huan's classmate as well.

324
00:21:47,545 --> 00:21:49,135
- Hello, Madam.
- Come and have a seat.

325
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,564
It's fine. You guys can continue. I'll make a move first.

326
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:53,075
Thank you, Madam.

327
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:56,275
Don't leave. It's Wu Huan's birthday. The more the merrier.

328
00:21:56,275 --> 00:22:00,835
Come. You should have a seat since you're here already.

329
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:05,994
You guys can have a chat.

330
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:08,665
I'll cook a few more dishes.

331
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:25,755
I didn't know what to buy for you.

332
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:29,455
You can wear this shirt when you go to work.

333
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:32,965
Take a look and see if you like it.

334
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,575
This shirt looks great.

335
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:57,964
Happy birthday. I'll make a move first.

336
00:22:57,964 --> 00:23:01,024
Shiyin. Shiyin?

337
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:03,894
- Shiyin!
- What?

338
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,555
Aren't you joining us for dinner?

339
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:10,175
Someone else is here to celebrate your birthday for you.

340
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:12,434
I truly didn't know that she was coming.

341
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,674
It's fine. You guys can celebrate it together.

342
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:17,564
She's just here to give me my birthday present out of kind intentions.

343
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,085
Can you please not be furious?

344
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,885
I'm not furious.

345
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:24,514
Can you not be hostile towards her?

346
00:23:24,514 --> 00:23:26,325
Can you try to be friends with her?

347
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,855
I don't want to be friends with her.

348
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:32,845
Can you stop being willful?

349
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,785
I'm willful?

350
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:37,605
Would I be here to celebrate your birthday for you if I were willful?

351
00:23:40,995 --> 00:23:44,315
Fine then. I won't force you to come in the future.

352
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,295
What did you say?

353
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,135
I'm too tired to argue with you.

354
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:13,174
Eat up. The food will get cold if you wait any longer.

355
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:18,204
Look at that crazy girl. She's not home even though it's dinner time.

356
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:20,824
Dad! Mom! I'm back!

357
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:22,434
We're waiting for you. Hurry up.

358
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,924
No, thanks. I already had dinner. You guys can enjoy your meal!

359
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:35,165
Minority languages.

360
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:40,025
Minority languages.

361
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:45,965
Minority languages.

362
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:19,844
"It takes a great deal of courage

363
00:25:19,844 --> 00:25:22,024
to stand up to your enemies,

364
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:27,374
but a great deal more to stand up to your friends."

365
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:30,925
Guess what it means?

366
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:38,034
"It takes a great deal of courage

367
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:40,635
to stand up to your enemies,

368
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,900
but a great deal more to stand up to your friends."

369
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,345
It's fine as long you don't stand up to us.

370
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:56,614
Don't you guys think that I'm cool as a translator?

371
00:25:56,614 --> 00:26:00,315
Yeah. Of course.

372
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:12,605
Hello, Sunian?

373
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,474
I've decided. I'll study minority languages.

374
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:17,474
Good. I support your decision.

375
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:18,844
Do you need me to do anything for you?

376
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,664
Your support is good enough! That's all I wanted to say to you.

377
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:25,105
I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight if I didn't tell you.

378
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:27,594
<i>You can go to sleep now. Good night.</i>

379
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:28,605
<i>Good night.</i>

380
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,865
<i>Bye-bye!</i>

381
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:33,965
"Good night, Sunian."

382
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:37,864
I realized that this neighbor of yours is pretty clingy.

383
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:39,965
Just play your video game.

384
00:26:40,535 --> 00:26:43,375
Our Little Niannian is actually shy?

385
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:47,305
I'm sure it's not mine.

386
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:52,294
Hello, Yunjin?

387
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:54,674
<i>How was the military training? Was it tiring?</i>

388
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:58,174
Not at all. It's not tiring as long as you call him.

389
00:26:58,174 --> 00:27:00,325
<i>Who was speaking just now?</i>

390
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:03,585
It was my dorm mate. He was just joking.

391
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:07,234
<i>So are there any beautiful girls out there who are trying to court you?</i>

392
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,174
Of course not.

393
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,745
None of them are as beautiful as you.

394
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:17,424
<i>You should go out more often.</i>

395
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:18,845
<i>Many places are worth visiting in Beijing.</i>

396
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,814
Don't worry. I'll show him around!

397
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,994
Yunjin, it's getting late.

398
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,875
- You should rest early.
<i>- Okay.</i>

399
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:34,025
That dorm mate of mine is sick.

400
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:35,945
You're sick.

401
00:27:43,405 --> 00:27:46,535
Sunian, come and have a seat.

402
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,034
What's the matter?

403
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,404
Sunian, since you're from Beijing, can you show me around?

404
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,174
Sure. Where do you wish to go?

405
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,404
I wish to find a high-class silk shop.

406
00:27:57,404 --> 00:28:01,074
You're a man, you know? What's with you trying to visit a silk shop?

407
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:04,145
I'm finding it for my girlfriend.

408
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:06,325
She specializes in making cheongsam.

409
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:11,375
The cheongsam lady of Jiangnan and a handsome man?

410
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,644
Seems like an interesting story.

411
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:14,855
Tell me about it.

412
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:21,225
Nope.

413
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,505
Do you think I wish to hear your story?

414
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:26,994
Silk cloth?

415
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:29,545
I can ask Xue's mother about it.

416
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:31,545
She does textile restoration.

417
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,735
Textile restoration?

418
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:34,924
Where?

419
00:28:34,924 --> 00:28:36,775
At the Restoration Department.

420
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:48,605
I wish to check out that place.

421
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:50,275
Sure.

422
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,085
Me too.

423
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:54,275
You can go there yourself.

424
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:57,065
Sunian.

425
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:02,575
Sunian, just bring me along!

426
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,605
It's decided then.

427
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,655
I haven't been here before.

428
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:24,884
It's great to work in a place like this.

429
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:27,275
It's quiet.

430
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:31,595
By the way, have they encountered anything strange

431
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:34,505
when they were working?

432
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,675
Believe in science.

433
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,755
- You're so dull.
- Sunian!

434
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:45,965
Isn't this your neighbor?

435
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:50,005
Isn't this the guy who was half-naked last time?

436
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,795
Why aren't you in school?

437
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:54,704
There's no school today as they need to use our school as a venue for the adults' self-study exam.

438
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:56,545
I'm sending lunch to my mother. What about you guys?

439
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,714
We?

440
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,404
I'm bringing my sons out to check out the place.

441
00:30:00,404 --> 00:30:02,124
Uncle, you look young.

442
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:03,435
I'm sure you're not even 50 years old.

443
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,065
You win.

444
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:06,955
They wish to check out the Restoration Department.

445
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:10,244
Let's go then. Come on, Uncle. I'll bring you around.

446
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,745
Let's go, Uncle.

447
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:22,564
Uncle, let's go.

448
00:30:22,564 --> 00:30:24,465
Stop calling me that.

449
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:36,944
Mom! Ms. Kang.

450
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,235
- Ms. Kang.

451
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:39,754
- Sunian, you're here?
- Hello, Madam.

452
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,074
- Ms. Yu.
- Let me take a look.

453
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,215
It's been more than a month since I last saw you.

454
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:45,605
You've gotten slimmer.

455
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:48,274
Mom, did you forget about your daughter?

456
00:30:48,274 --> 00:30:49,884
Do you think I'm blind?

457
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:51,735
There's nothing special about you.

458
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:53,585
I see you every day.

459
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:58,444
By the way, Madam, these are my dorm mates. This is Pei Shu.

460
00:30:58,444 --> 00:31:00,685
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello.

461
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:03,705
This is Bai Yunsheng.

462
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:08,025
Ms. Kang.

463
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:13,925
It's been a while.

464
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:22,415
When I was on my way here,

465
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:25,325
I thought about the things I wanted to tell you.

466
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:28,095
But since you're doing pretty well right now,

467
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:31,415
I guess there's nothing I need to say.

468
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:33,885
Goodbye.

469
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:39,175
What's going on?

470
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:42,895
Bai Yunsheng! Bai Yunsheng!

471
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:51,365
Ms. Kang.

472
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:55,125
Do you guys know each other?

473
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:58,335
I guess you can say that.

474
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:02,234
Both Ms. Kang and Yunsheng are from Suzhou.

475
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:04,164
So how do you guys know each other?

476
00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:07,405
Xue, stop asking random questions.

477
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,415
You'd sent me lunch, right?

478
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:11,205
You should hurry and return home.

479
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:15,894
It's fine. This incident happened way too long ago.

480
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:18,225
It was going to corrode my stomach.

481
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:20,225
I wish to tell you guys what happened.

482
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:28,735
Xue, do you still remember the person in that photo?

483
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:34,755
He's Bai Yunsheng's father.

484
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,815
I fell for him when I was young.

485
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:50,515
But I didn't know that he was already married.

486
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,954
Sunian, tell me.

487
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:59,194
Who's in the wrong when it comes to Ms. Kang's incident?

488
00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:01,435
It feels confusing.

489
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:04,554
No one is right or wrong when it comes to a relationship.

490
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:07,800
Maybe, they don't know for sure as well.

491
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:10,605
Why does it seem like you're an expert in this?

492
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:13,774
Do you talk to beautiful girls about relationships every day?

493
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:17,074
Currently, I have never spoken more than three sentences to every girl I see.

494
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:19,274
But your dorm mates don't seem that way to me.

495
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:21,465
They're them.

496
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:23,795
Birds of a feather flock together.

497
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:29,055
Xue!

498
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:30,775
What?

499
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:37,194
Have you gained some weight lately?

500
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:38,945
No, I haven't.

501
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:45,475
Hop on. Let me put it to the test.

502
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:47,245
Fine.

503
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:53,234
Seems like you've gained a lot of weight.

504
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:55,135
I haven't!

505
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,504
- You have.
- I haven't!

506
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,794
- You have.
- I haven't!

507
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:07,014
I won't steal your food. Take your time.

508
00:34:07,014 --> 00:34:09,545
Take your time.

509
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:13,435
Take your time. Take your time.

510
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:15,694
Take your time.

511
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:17,345
Dad.

512
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:20,635
- Why didn't you turn on the lights?
- You're back?

513
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:22,164
Don't move! Don't run!

514
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:23,845
Mimi, come back!

515
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,445
Why is it here?

516
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:27,185
On your first day of college,

517
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:31,545
it came into our house right after you left.

518
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:33,635
After that, it didn't leave.

519
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:35,804
Maybe it's because it's getting old

520
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:37,855
and it doesn't feel like wandering anymore.

521
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,755
Why did you come back suddenly today?

522
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:43,824
I showed my friends around the Restoration Department today.

523
00:34:43,824 --> 00:34:45,785
I came back on the way.

524
00:34:45,785 --> 00:34:48,054
- Have you eaten then?
- Not yet.

525
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:51,284
Great. I haven't eaten either. I'll make dinner.

526
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:54,915
Noodles with black bean sauce.

527
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:18,115
Dad, why didn't you tear off the calendar?

528
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,075
It's September now.

529
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:25,995
- Leaf through what?
- The calendar.

530
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:29,905
I forgot about it.

531
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,095
You forgot about it for an entire month?

532
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:03,265
What's the matter?

533
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:06,655
Nothing.

534
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:16,445
I...

535
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:18,745
I know. I burned the sauce.

536
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:23,185
This... It's been too long since I last cooked.

537
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:25,264
I forgot how to cook.

538
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:27,805
Sunian, don't eat this. I'll make a new bowl of noodles for you.

539
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:29,225
No need for that, Dad.

540
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:32,204
I'll eat this. It's pretty good.

541
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:37,135
I don't know what's wrong with me.

542
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:55,415
Dad.

543
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,524
Shiyin, explain this question to me.

544
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,615
I don't know how to solve it.

545
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:43,305
This one.

546
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,455
Wu Huan, why are you only here now?

547
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:53,834
I went for the job interview.

548
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:56,135
How was it?

549
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:58,195
I don't think it's going to end well.

550
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:00,614
Don't give up. I'm sure you'll succeed next time.

551
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:02,435
You can do it!

552
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:05,575
How do I solve this?

553
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:24,225
Wu Huan, I've searched for logistics companies near your house.

554
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:27,554
Although they're small, it'll be convenient for you to take care of your mom.

555
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:30,204
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

556
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:33,434
I realized that there are many logistics companies around here after I searched for them.

557
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:37,795
I'm sure you'll find a job.

558
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:40,285
Xue, accompany me to refill my bottle.

559
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,645
Didn't you just drink some water?

560
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:46,515
Shiyin! Shiyin!

561
00:38:46,515 --> 00:38:48,275
Lin Shiyin!

562
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:50,365
Why are you furious?

563
00:38:50,365 --> 00:38:51,985
I hate Tang Ya.

564
00:38:51,985 --> 00:38:53,234
Why?

565
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:54,485
She always steals my things.

566
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:57,114
First, she stole you from me. Now, she's stealing...

567
00:38:57,114 --> 00:39:00,145
I don't understand what you mean.

568
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:02,695
Anyway, she always goes against me.

569
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:06,164
But to me, it seems like you're going against her.

570
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:08,834
How is that possible? Who are you siding with?

571
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:12,454
Anyway, we're here to refill your bottle. Where's your bottle?

572
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:17,505
Give me some of it after you've refilled yours.

573
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:20,414
I guess art students like you are hard to read.

574
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:22,424
Sunian is an art student as well.

575
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:23,874
He's different from you.

576
00:39:23,874 --> 00:39:27,084
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

577
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:29,164
Which one shall I pick?

578
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:30,715
It is you then.

579
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,245
You're finally back.

580
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:37,634
Hurry!

581
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:40,534
You don't know how excruciating it was for me for the past few days.

582
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,155
Hurry and have a seat.

583
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:45,315
I was just gone for one day, you know?

584
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:47,115
It felt like a year to me.

585
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:50,754
Even when Little Baibai came back, he didn't speak to me at all.

586
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:53,424
No matter how hard I tried to cheer him up, he'd only utter words like:

587
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,435
"Hmm, ah, oh."

588
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:00,685
Where is he?

589
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:03,374
He went to class. He's not back yet.

590
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:09,365
We should let him cool down for some time.

591
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,145
It will be good for him.

592
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:15,005
To me, I can only feel his coldness.

593
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:19,535
By the way, you know Xue Ning. Right?

594
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:20,855
I don't.

595
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:22,974
You don't even know the beauty of the design course?

596
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:25,605
It's the girl who's been trying to court Little Baibai ever since the military training started.

597
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:29,385
Listen up. I've witnessed something new today.

598
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:33,064
Little Baibai was putting on a stern face so that no one would approach him.

599
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,144
But that girl is something else. She wasn't afraid at all.

600
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:36,645
Instead, she tried to cling on to him.

601
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:40,294
She followed him from here all the way to the self-study room.

602
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:43,235
Many girls were following you as well.

603
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,675
You're right about that.

604
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:49,875
But they aren't as beautiful as her.

605
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:53,875
I'm perplexed.

606
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:56,504
You and Little Baibai are on an equal footing.

607
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:59,635
When school was in session, many girls were trying to know you.

608
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:01,905
Now, all of them are gone.

609
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:08,405
Maybe it's because of

610
00:41:08,405 --> 00:41:10,544
what I said in class.

611
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:12,385
What did you say?

612
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,520
