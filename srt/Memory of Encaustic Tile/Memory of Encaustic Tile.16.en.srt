Why?

There's an inconsistency between the image and the actual product.

169

It's cheating the consumers. We can sue you.

We used to be the same as here before.

There's no refund, anyway.

I ran as I saw you all running away.

199

I won't step inside the room again today.

It needs further examination.

How will you examine it?

212
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,220
Undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) first.

213
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,240
Then we can diagnose based on the results.

214
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,090
It only hurts once in a while.

215

It shouldn't be.

216

But only if we diagnose it as soon as possible can we treat it in time.

Mom, don't drag me. The clothes will get wrinkled.

331
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:29,405
Don't you know your priorities yet?

332
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,675
I was upset. I wanted to relax.

333
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:33,404
You really pissed me off.

334
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,325
- Take the suitcase.
- Get off.

335
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:36,695

Stop there, you brat.

338
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:44,434
What a big mess you have made!

339
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,185
What's wrong?

340
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:49,755
I just didn't want to celebrate my birthday in the house alone.

341
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:52,565
Talk well. Don't hit him.

342
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:54,985
You can tell me your thoughts.

343
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:57,475
Can I even find you?

344
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:59,055
Didn't you say three days?

345
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:01,025
Why did you come back today?

346
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:02,805
It was to celebrate your birthday.

347
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:04,674
But you made a mess.

348
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:06,704
- Let's go.
- I'm not going back.

349
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:08,985
- Come on.
- No!

350
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,875
- I'll write a self-criticism.
- I'm not going back.

351
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,335
Try not to lie in the future, okay?

352
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,844
Okay.

353
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:20,035
All right then. Come on. Give it to me.

354
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:22,415
Why didn't anyone scold him?

355
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:24,615
You're indeed a busybody.

356
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:28,665
Sunian never did anything bad. It was you who made him do something bad.

357
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:30,235
- Let's go back.
- I was blamed for everything.

358
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:31,836
- I don't want to.
- Madam.

359
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:35,765
Well. I want to say something to Zhang Qi.

360
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:36,754
Okay.

361
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,735
Come back early. Do you hear me?

362
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:41,324
- Go home early.
- Yes, Madam.

363
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,185
She's not home every day.

364
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,945
Yet she quarrels with me once she comes back.

365
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:55,265
Your mom is worried about you.

366
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:57,165
What can she worry about?

367
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:03,405
Oh, right. What do you want to tell me?

368
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:11,165
Zhang Qi.

369
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:15,235
I wrote the question.

370
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:17,505
I know what was written inside.

371
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:35,035
Aren't you going to tell her?

372
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:39,475
I want to.

373
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:41,324
But I don't know what to say.

374
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:43,425
If I don't say it,

375
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:46,235
I feel everything's hidden inside.

376
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:48,565
I don't know what to do either.

377
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:51,074
- Shall I help you tell her?
- No.

378
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:57,545
I'm afraid if I say it,

379
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:00,585
many things may change.

380
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:07,515
Huanhuan, keep the secret for me first.

381
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,015
Okay?

382
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:11,844
You may go back.

383
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:14,335
Okay, I'll get going.

384
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:17,435
By the way, happy birthday.

385
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:19,205
I'm going back. Goodbye.

00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:13,975
What is Sunian doing?

390
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:15,785
He's studying.

391
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:21,335
He hides it quite deeply.

392
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:29,065
Zheng.

393
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:32,765
I'll go out of town next week

394
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,205
to visit a distant relative.

395
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:37,445
I'll stay there for a few days.

396
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,234
Why is it so sudden?

397
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,175
What happened?

398
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:47,645
Nothing.

399
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,475
We just got in touch.

400
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:53,065
I want to take this chance to go out and relax.

401
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,895
Have you been upset lately?

402
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:01,265
No.

403
00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:04,374
I just want to travel. Can't I?

404
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:06,685
No, you can.

405
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:09,325
That's right. We haven't been out for a long time.

406
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:11,754
After I'm done with the exhibition,

407
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:13,375
let's take annual leave.

408
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,355
We can go out and have fun for a few days.

409
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:17,364
What are you thinking about?

410
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:19,335
Sunian is now in Grade 12.

411
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:21,805
Take care of him at home.

412
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:27,815
Well. It's tough to be the parents of a 12th Grade kid.

413
00:26:27,815 --> 00:26:30,005
Go to bed early. You have to get up early tomorrow.

414
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,755
Drink the milk.

415
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,835
Sunian.

416
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,405
Sunian.

417
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:08,925
Are you acting here?

418
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:11,085
I've been grounded by my mom.

419
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,665
I must go home on time after school

420
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,565
for the next month.

421
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:17,464
One yuan of my pocket money will be deducted for every minute late.

422
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,615
I can't go anywhere else for the rest of the time.

423
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:21,514
I can't even go to Zhang Qi's place.

424
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,215
How about my place?

425
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:27,505
She didn't mention it. But I guess I can't.

426
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:31,275
It seems your mom is for real this time.

427
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,055
If I knew it'd pay a high price to go out,

428
00:27:34,055 --> 00:27:36,795
I'd instead go to Xidan to have KFC.

429
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:39,164
She'll cool down soon.

430
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:40,575
It's hard this time.

431
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,235
Take a look. My mom made

432
00:27:43,235 --> 00:27:45,465
this schedule the whole of last night.

433
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:47,235
The time is tight and there are so many tasks.

434
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,954
Obviously, it's to get rid of my freedom.

435
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:52,665
I can't get a break until some days later.

436
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:56,855
Then I'll plead for you.

437
00:27:57,715 --> 00:27:59,655
Forget it.

438
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:02,965
Here you go.

439
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:09,995
Did you buy it online for me?

440
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:11,425
This is quite useful.

441
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:13,955
You can record all the notes that you can't do in class.

442
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:15,714
You can hear it anytime. It's very convenient.

443
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:18,706
The point is to press the button next to it.

You used to say you'll get energetic when you hear my voice.

446
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,776
That's why I recorded my voice.

447
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:36,785
Do you feel energetic?

448
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:41,085
I won't be tired after hearing it.

449
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,185
Luckily I bought it early.

450
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:46,935
Even the CPU has been confiscated.

451
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:51,815
We said to leave some fond memories for our youth.

452
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:55,135
Now there are only memories of me being grounded.

453
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,924
You still have many years of youth.

454
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,655
There are many chances.

455
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:02,005
What if we go our separate ways in the future

456
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,994
like what Zhang Qi said? What should we do?

457
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:09,234
I finally understand why my mom

458
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,565
doesn't want me to go abroad.

459
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I think if you go somewhere someday where I can't find you,

460
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,315
I'll be very sad for sure.

461
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:24,005
- I won't.
- Just in case.

462
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:27,055
For me, it won't happen.

463
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:31,155
I swear I'll always stay somewhere you can find.

464
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:48,615
- Put it down gently.
- Okay.

465
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:56,625
After work, ask Sunian to go to my place for dinner.

466
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,855
Jin Ning isn't around, after all.

467
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,034
We can have some drinks.

468
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:00,035
Okay.

469
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,125
When will Jin Ning come back?

470
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,715
She went to her relative's house for several days.

471
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:08,035
I think she'll be back soon.

472
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:10,364
Why do I think it's not riveted?

473
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:12,134
- Let's take a look.
- Take it slow.

474
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:13,625
Here we go.

475
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:57,215
You're back.

476
00:30:57,215 --> 00:31:00,675
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I could have picked you up.

477
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,225
I didn't go to my relative's house.

478
00:31:03,885 --> 00:31:07,985
I just went to the hospital for an examination.

479
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:11,585
- For...
- Zheng.

480
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:14,605
I have cancer.

481
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:17,315
It's terminal.

Didn't I ask you to go home and rest?

485
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:54,915
I feel uneasy at home alone.

486

Dad.

487
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:11,735
Mom will get well.

488
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:14,165

<i>He has become more silent.</i>

495
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,195
<i>So has Mr. Zheng.</i>

496
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:14,105
<i>Just facing Ms. Jin Ning's illness</i>

497
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:17,115
<i>has drained them too much.</i>

498
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:21,055
<i>What makes me hate myself is</i>

499
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:24,345
<i>that I find I'm afraid to see them</i>

500
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:27,575
<i>and even more afraid to see Ms. Jin Ning.</i>

501
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:32,385
<i>I'm afraid to see everything wonderful in the past</i>

502
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:34,965
<i>suddenly collapse.</i>

503
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:52,375
Xue.

504
00:34:56,165 --> 00:35:00,164
Didn't you go to join the Olympiad Mathematics training camp?

505
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,564
Tomorrow will be a holiday.

506
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:03,405
I'll go the day after tomorrow.

507
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:09,675
Let's visit Ms. Jin Ning tomorrow.

508
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,395
Okay.

509
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:21,135
Haven't they come back yet?

510
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,885
Since Ms. Jin Ning has been hospitalized,

511
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:32,705
Mr. Zheng and Sunian seldom come home.

512
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:34,605
They rented a bed at the hospital

513
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:38,445
and take turns accompanying Ms. Jin Ning.

514
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:14,025
Why do you get up so early?

515
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:26,215
I'm making soup.

516
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,025
I'm afraid it'll overflow. I have to watch over it.

517
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:40,485
Do you think Jin Ning can drink it?

518
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:45,775
Drink as much as she can.

519
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:50,485
Zheng and Sunian need nutrition.

520
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:56,265
Even they have no appetite.

521
00:36:56,265 --> 00:37:00,415
They only finished half of the meal you gave them.

522
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:03,974
Why are you always being sarcastic here?

523
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,644
If they don't eat, should I just let them be?

524
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:10,584
If they don't eat something good, all of them will be sick.

525
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:28,825
Why is God so unfair?

526
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,565
Don't scold God.

527
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:34,795
Beg him.

528
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:44,505
Xue told me last night...

529
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:48,615
that she thinks she's terrible.

530
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:53,255
She's not around them at this time.

531
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,775
Instead, she's afraid to see them.

532
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,255
I didn't dare to tell her.

533
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,005
Do you know that?

534
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:09,905
I'm afraid, too.

535
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,575
I'm afraid when I see Jin Ning.

536
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:20,405
Well. She used to be decent and good-looking.

537
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:23,415
Now she's too skinny.

538
00:38:23,415 --> 00:38:26,735
Who even dares to see that?

539
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:32,644
The father and son are good at hiding their feelings.

540
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,604
They only keep it to themselves.

541
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,975
All of us want to help them.

542
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:39,355
But they don't say it. They bear it themselves.

543
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:40,975
Well...

544
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:45,735
They're also suffering.

545
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:51,995
They can't and don't want to express themselves

546
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,215
at their worst times.

547
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:02,665
I...

548
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:04,934
I'll get changed.

549
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:07,095
I'll send them the food.

550
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:20,624
- Shao.
- Lin.

551
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,815
There are so many things.

552
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:27,705
You're going to visit Jin Ning, aren't you?

553
00:39:27,705 --> 00:39:29,385
We are going the same way.

554
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,325
Isn't Dongge with you?

555
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,294
She'll cry the whole night once she goes.

556
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:36,564
I can't bear it.

557
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:38,275
Same as Ji Ian.

558
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,495
She told me,

559
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:43,185
"Lin. Lin, I'm scared."

560
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:44,734
Let alone them.

561
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:47,355
I almost didn't hold it twice.

562
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:51,065
There were tears in my eyes.

563
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:53,655
Luckily I held it back.

564
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,585
Or Zheng would have to comfort me with a smile.

565
00:39:55,585 --> 00:39:58,205
This can't be appropriate.

566
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:01,214
You've been in the same office as Zheng for almost 20 years.

567
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:03,055
It's tough for you.

568
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,605
Let's go.

569
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:40,294
Today is the weekend. Why did you come?

570
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:43,285
You came here. Why can't I come?

571
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:51,335
Shall we drink together?

572
00:40:56,685 --> 00:40:58,164
What's wrong with you?

573
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,515
She's still alive.

574
00:41:00,515 --> 00:41:02,355
Pull yourself together.

575
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:10,930
Why are both of my disciples so unlucky?

576
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:15,015
Was it because of me?

577
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:20,895
I'll get going.

578
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,705
You're getting senile.

579
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,615
I can't talk to you.

580
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:31,485
Yes, I'm getting old.

581
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,410
<i>[Peking Union Medical College Hospital]</i>

582
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:03,625
Don't worry. You'll get well soon.

583
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:06,684
I don't want to die.

584
00:42:06,685 --> 00:42:08,695
Let's find someone to cure you.

585
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,355
Cancer is incurable.

586
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:14,484
I don't want to die.

587
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:15,774
Don't worry.

588
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,604
The couple has a good relationship.

589
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:18,734
Their son is also well-raised.

590
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:20,475
He's filial and sensible.

591
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:21,604
Life is too hard for her.

592
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,925
She used to look young.

593
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:29,195
Be happy. Don't look upset.

594
00:42:29,195 --> 00:42:30,734
It's been depressed enough here.

595
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:33,545
How can I be happy here?

596
00:42:33,545 --> 00:42:34,814
Smile.

597
00:42:34,815 --> 00:42:37,285
Ms. Jin Ning likes to see you smile.

598
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:42,655
Let's go.

599
00:42:49,415 --> 00:42:51,585
One last bite, okay?

600
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:55,484
- Mr. Zheng. Mr. Jin.
- Xue.

601
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:57,855
Your dad just left.

602
00:42:57,855 --> 00:43:00,024
- Do you find me annoying?
- No.

603
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:01,824
You even bought something. Thank you.

604
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:03,994
- Xue. Zhang Qi.
- Ms. Jin Ning.

605
00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:06,454
I won't dislike seeing you at all.

606
00:43:06,455 --> 00:43:08,164
I love seeing you.

607
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:09,644
Then I'll come here every day.

608
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:11,084
No way.

609
00:43:11,085 --> 00:43:12,894
You still have to study.

610
00:43:12,895 --> 00:43:16,214
Your mom will blame me when your study falls behind.

611
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:18,855
I'll come after school. I'll do my homework next to you.

612
00:43:18,855 --> 00:43:21,536
It's more comfortable than staying beside my mom.

613
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:25,825
You can't let Dongge hear that.

614
00:43:25,825 --> 00:43:27,515
Or else, I...
