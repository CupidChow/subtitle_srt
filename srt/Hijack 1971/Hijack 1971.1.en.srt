2
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,026
Flight leader,

3
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:04,118
we have left the mission area.

4
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:14,747
We should head back, sir.

5
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,955
Having a tough time?

6
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,560
Not at all, it's a piece of cake.

7
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:24,942
Yeah? Immelmann turn!

8
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:34,225
Immelmann turn!

9
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:46,996
Descend!

10
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,645
Inverted flight!

11
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:19,603
How's this? Not bad, right?

12
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,483
It's unbearable, sir.

13
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:24,046
Look up, man.

14
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:47,000
Dong-cheol, how do you like
this scenery?

15
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,625
Cap.

16
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,300
It's breathtaking!

17
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,324
Simply breathtaking!

18
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,583
This is Bravo-Delta! Tango 1, respond!

19
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,260
Abort mission, abort mission!

20
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,251
Target coordinates,
Area 3-1, 10,000 ft!

21
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,767
This is not a drill!

22
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,659
Kosung Airspace, Gangwon Province

23
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,330
Hotel-Lima 5208!

24
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,934
North Korean border up
ahead, turn the aircraft around!

25
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:34,148
5208, respond, respond!

26
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:37,380
No response, I'll check the cockpit.

27
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:58,513
Captain seat is empty,
First Officer is in control.

28
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:03,538
Min-su?

29
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:06,699
First Officer ID confirmed.

30
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:08,969
Reservist Air Force Col. Seo Min-su!

31
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:11,225
Min-su, it's me!

32
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:14,211
You're heading for North
Korea, turn plane around!

33
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:21,836
Based on its flight course, the
co-pilot is attempting to defect!

34
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,207
Tango 1, fire warning shots!

35
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:25,505
Roger!

36
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:39,889
Guns on!

37
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,241
Target in sight!

38
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,263
If you all want to die,

39
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:44,655
turn it around.

40
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:49,033
No shots! Something is off!

41
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,435
10 miles to the border.

42
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,950
Tango 1, requesting SITREP of 5208!

43
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:01,008
Still heading North! Someone
may be in the cockpit!

44
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,866
Tango 1! Fire at the right
engine and force it to land!

45
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,374
Negative!

46
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,023
It's a passenger aircraft.

47
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:08,514
Squad Leader here!

48
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,566
Twin engine aircraft can land
with just one engine! Fire!

49
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,151
30 seconds to the border!

50
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:16,237
If the fuel catches fire,
everyone will die!

51
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,610
You must fire it now for
it to land in our territory!

52
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,265
It's an order, fire at once!

53
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,535
Tae-in, come on! Just shoot!

54
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:26,635
Crossing the border in 10 seconds!

55
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,742
What the hell are you doing?!
Fire, now!

56
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:33,832
Move aside, I'll shoot!

57
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,870
5 seconds!

58
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,419
4, 3, 2!

59
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:39,444
Negative.

60
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:59,319
HIJACK 1971

61
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,880
Who do you think I
hung up on right now?

62
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:09,521
I'm not sure...

63
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:15,531
I said no interruption!

64
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,444
I'm sorry, sir!

65
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,868
The Presidential Office said
the call keeps getting dropped...

66
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:22,568
Keep them on the line for 2 minutes.

67
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,921
Pardon? Okay...

68
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,499
Because of you, 51 of our people
are taken to North Korea.

69
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:37,039
Was it that difficult to shoot
an engine of a cruising aircraft?!

70
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:41,637
I couldn't risk what the
hijacker would do to the pilot...

71
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,312
There was no hijacking signal!

72
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,225
Min-su was acting strange.

73
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:49,348
You know him, he'd never
willingly defect to North Korea!

74
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,667
Look.

75
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:54,628
Does the President care
what kind of a man he is?!

76
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:00,830
1 minute left, come up
with a convincing excuse.

77
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:05,641
They're all still alive.

78
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,965
Once the government
initiates negotiation...

79
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,755
Negotiating with the commies?!

80
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:18,077
Go with the gun malfunction story.

81
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,233
You disobedient bastard!

82
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,512
Dong-cheol, you're suspended
from flying for a month.

83
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:34,443
Tae-in, submit your discharge papers.

84
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,049
Dismissed.

85
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:46,688
Tae-in.

86
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,536
How big is your extended family?

87
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,415
About 20, sir.

88
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,540
What's 20 times 51?

89
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,610
Just over 1,000, sir.

90
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,951
Remember,

91
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,052
all those people will suffer because
of your petty humanist decision.

92
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:26,244
The repatriation of YS-11 aircraft crew
and passengers has been decided.

93
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:30,195
It'll take place at DMZ tomorrow,
and they'll be greeted by families

94
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,040
Kim Yong-dae, released.

95
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,403
and journalists from both domestic
and international media.

96
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:40,394
The repatriates will be detained and
undergo thorough investigations,

97
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,276
before returning to their homes.

98
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,934
The current list of passengers
confirmed to be returning is as follows:

99
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,832
Captain Yoo Joon-seok...

100
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,829
The snow was shoveled already?

101
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:54,979
What's that?

102
00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:59,157
Don't people even watch the news?

103
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,022
It's been ages since
Min-su's name was cleared.

104
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,343
[Communist! Spy!]
Wipe it off, will you?

105
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:05,374
[Communist! Spy!]
I'll go get some paint.

106
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,439
I'll take that.

107
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:07,464
Young-sook!

108
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:10,285
This way please.

109
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:29,212
The food smells incredible.

110
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:29,731
Yeah?

111
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:30,460
All done?

112
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:31,486
- Yup, it's all done.
- Great.

113
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,307
It looks like a new door.

114
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,348
Good work.

115
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:37,135
Joon-woo, you'll wrinkle that jacket.

116
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,396
Let him be.

117
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,171
Imagine his excitement
to have his dad back.

118
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,912
Even we are excited too.

119
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:46,465
You and I should go
to the hair salon tomorrow.

120
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,925
Do I look bad?

121
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,738
I never bothered to look in the mirror.

122
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:56,264
Young-sook,

123
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:59,423
I wish my wife's cooking
is half as good as yours.

124
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:01,444
Desperate to starve from tomorrow?

125
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:01,994
Whoa.

126
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:03,742
Have some while they're hot.

127
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:07,293
Joon-woo, want a bite?

128
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:09,089
- Nope.
- No?

129
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,138
- Aunty.
- Yeah?

130
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:11,856
- Glass noodle.
- Of course.

131
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,237
You eat so well.

132
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:16,649
I'll give you some more.

133
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,050
It's really great.

134
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:20,360
Yeah?

135
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,977
Thank you.

136
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:29,631
For what?

137
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,425
For taking care of us, I'll
pay you back in my lifetime.

138
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:40,193
Don't ever mention it,
it was the obvious thing.

139
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,559
Return of YS-11 passengers

140
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:54,827
North Korea Demilitarized Zone

141
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:00,717
Do not come in contact
with the repatriates!

142
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:03,297
They'll be allowed to go home
after the investigation,

143
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,903
so, do not approach them!

144
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,747
- Do you see him?
- Hold on.

145
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:11,557
Board the repatriates on the bus.

146
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,826
Stop their families
from getting in the way.

147
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,460
Why isn't my husband coming?

148
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,010
Is that everyone?

149
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:26,789
Sir, all 39 repatriates have boarded.

150
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,232
Start the bus.

151
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:29,421
Captain!

152
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,874
Where are the rest?

153
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:33,084
Attention please!

154
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,662
There are a total of
39 repatriators today!

155
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,981
The 7 remaining passengers,
2 flight crews, 2 pilots

156
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:44,100
are not on today's list,
so please return home!

157
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:44,814
Wait a minute!

158
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,727
Shouldn't you explain why
they aren't on the list?

159
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:48,776
Wrap it up!

160
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:50,629
Start the bus!

161
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,766
Sir, what'll happen to
those who aren't on the list?

162
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,234
Repatriation was rejected.

163
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,600
The commies didn't send them.

164
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:26,226
Remember,

165
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,041
all those people will suffer because
of your petty humanist decision.

166
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:40,679
39 KAL Passengers Repatriated

167
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:45,263
39 out of 50 abductees
have returned to freedom

168
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:47,671
while 11 remain detained
by North Korea.

169
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:54,390
The returnees testified that 11
individuals were isolated and taken away

170
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:58,023
due to their specialized skills.

171
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:03,616
Meanwhile, North Korea claims to have offered
$2 million to the hijacker Cho Chang-hee,

172
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,871
allegedly encouraging
terrorist acts against the South.

173
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:10,238
The government is implementing measures
such as deploying armed air marshal...

174
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,406
1 year later

175
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:16,789
Sokcho Airport

176
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:22,292
We're sold out!

177
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:24,435
Sold out! Sold out!

178
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:34,997
It's an airplane!

179
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,781
10.

180
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,402
Touchdown.

181
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:54,008
Parking brake set.

182
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,223
Check.

183
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:56,374
Parking brake set.

184
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:58,211
Check.

185
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,529
Thank you, have a good day.

186
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:07,554
Thank you, see you again.

187
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:11,387
Good work.

188
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:16,968
North Korea Must Immediately Repatriate
Abducted South Korean Citizens

189
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:20,763
Min-su... I just hope he is safe
and sound in North Korea.

190
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:30,237
Have you done a solo landing?

191
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:31,675
Not yet, Captain.

192
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,723
It's been a year, other
captains didn't let you?

193
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:38,506
Are you saying you'll give me a shot?

194
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,497
Another time, you'll get your shot.

195
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:43,217
I'm off.

196
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:45,885
Sure.

197
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:49,416
Thank you, Captain.

198
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:50,822
- Thank you, sir.
- Take care.

199
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:57,688
Ok-soon, did you know?

200
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:00,770
The other pilots can't
stand that First Officer.

201
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,479
Why is that?

202
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:06,198
He was that fighter pilot who
disobeyed an order last year

203
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:08,722
and let that airplane
defect to North Korea.

204
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,238
I'm sure there was a reason.

205
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:11,943
What reason?

206
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,870
The way I look at it, he's an outcast.

207
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:15,562
I'm sure of it.

208
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:18,910
North Korea Must Immediately Repatriate
Abducted South Korean Citizens

209
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,415
Isn't coefficient B
there a multiple of 2?

210
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:52,706
An even formula.

211
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:55,946
You from Woochang Middle?

212
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,118
Yes.

213
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,169
Good to meet you, I also went there.

214
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:03,826
Good to meet you.

215
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:07,118
Hey, won't you fly with me?

216
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:10,142
It isn't fun flying alone.

217
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,212
You there.

218
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:14,082
Would you like some chocolate?

219
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,040
Sure.

220
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:17,988
Excuse me.

221
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:19,026
Sure thing.

222
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,069
Here.

223
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,695
- Thank you.
- Do you run well?

224
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:31,421
Yes.

225
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:43,374
Hiding out here?

226
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:46,180
Welcome, sir.

227
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,266
Yeah, give me one.

228
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:50,663
"Hope"?

229
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,495
Is it good?

230
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:54,162
I liked the design.

231
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,099
Why didn't you shoot?

232
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:11,820
Heard Min-su was your superior.

233
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,281
Yes.

234
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:19,471
I wanted to know if you can be trusted
with the lives of our passengers.

235
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,117
I was a bit nervous.

236
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,704
Because Min-su was in the cockpit?

237
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,914
Because of the passengers.

238
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:35,030
I saw him shaking his head,

239
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:38,746
it looked like he didn't want
to endanger the passengers.

240
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,920
You're a failure as soldier.

241
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,592
But commercial pilots must do that.

242
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:49,434
Right...

243
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,860
Making a logical decision
in that situation?

244
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,406
It's about instinct, the
instinct to save people.

245
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:04,204
Had I shot the engine precisely,
would everyone be safe?

246
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:08,973
Who knows.

247
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,032
No one would bat an eye
if everyone returned home.

248
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:17,116
It's all about the results.

249
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:28,931
I'm so sorry, sir.

250
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:29,956
What were you doing?

251
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:31,485
I had to take a dump...

252
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,382
Are we leaving tomorrow?

253
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:41,792
One moment, make way!

254
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:42,841
Stop it!

255
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,058
One moment! One moment!

256
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:44,939
What are you doing?!

257
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,157
Pardon me!

258
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:46,971
Don't push!

259
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,433
Ow, that's hot!

260
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,900
Could you open this door?

261
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,867
Put out that cigarette!

262
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,487
Man, they'll run like dogs, right?

263
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:11,210
Ok-soon, when will they start
selling reserved seats?

264
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,501
Soon.

265
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,315
How fast can you run 100m?

266
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:19,706
In 11 seconds.

267
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:21,366
I said 100m, not 50m.

268
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:23,703
That's what I meant.

269
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,185
11 seconds? You're
not an Olympic runner.

270
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,646
Good afternoon, welc...

271
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:07,148
Here here!

272
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,834
Please don't run!

273
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,445
Good afternoon, welcome aboard.

274
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,584
Please go inside.

275
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:15,402
You really are an Olympic runner.

276
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:22,093
Good afternoon, welcome aboard.

277
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:24,118
Please walk slowly.

278
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:25,423
We're almost at the front.

279
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,606
I'll sit by the window.

280
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:30,947
Good afternoon, welcome aboard.

281
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,829
Ma'am? Ma'am!

282
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:33,854
Ma'am?

283
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,338
You can wear your shoes.

284
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:40,378
Your shoes.

285
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42,689
Mother, your shoes.

286
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:50,169
Let's sit here.

287
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:54,109
Oopsie! Sorry about that,
my bag sat there first.

288
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:55,134
What the heck?

289
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,211
Move it at once.

290
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,075
You better watch your tone.

291
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,709
Have some respect for the elders.

292
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,734
Honey, we can sit here.

293
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,759
Make way! Make way!

294
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:05,972
Mr. Park!

295
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:07,189
Passing through!

296
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:09,214
Pardon me, Mr. Park, this way.

297
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,620
It's a full house today.

298
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:13,874
Over here, sir.

299
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:15,584
By the luggage?

300
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,218
You lost to the kid?

301
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,765
Allow me to put your
coat in the compartment.

302
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,790
Thank you.

303
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:30,504
Oh gosh, where are you
flicking your cigarette?

304
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:31,529
Sir.

305
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:33,897
You shouldn't flick
cigarette ashes on the floor,

306
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,040
please use this tray.

307
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:48,479
- Flap set.
- Flap set.

308
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:50,900
Check.

309
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:52,385
Just let her fly with it!

310
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:53,886
Don't you know this isn't allowed?

311
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,910
What was that?

312
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:56,658
Don't give me that attitude!

313
00:22:56,683 --> 00:22:58,518
It's not allowed in here!

314
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:01,889
It's not like this little thing will
make the airplane too heavy.

315
00:23:01,976 --> 00:23:03,198
Why can't she?!

316
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:05,150
Look here, mister,
don't you feel bad for her?

317
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,408
Excuse me! Excuse me!

318
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:07,322
Look, the pilot is here.

319
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:08,347
What's going on?

320
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:09,299
First Officer.

321
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:11,526
There is a chicken in the cabin.

322
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:12,479
A chicken?

323
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,504
I told her several
times it's not allowed...

324
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,111
According to aviation security laws...

325
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:19,010
Can't it be stored in the cargo bay?

326
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:20,870
There's no cage, it could
get crushed by baggage.

327
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:24,213
No animals allowed. Period. Understand?

328
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:25,650
My daughter is sick...

329
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:27,743
Please get up, I'll
look for a solution.

330
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:29,783
Mister pilot.

331
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:33,660
Just get rid of that damn chicken
and let's get this plane in the air!

332
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,685
She'll feed the chicken
to her sick daughter!

333
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:38,279
One moment, please.

334
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:40,033
I understand!

335
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:42,657
We can't take off if there's
commotion in the cabin.

336
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:45,518
Bus routes are down, do you
not want to go to Seoul?

337
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:47,260
- Of course I do.
- You do, right?

338
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:49,283
- You must go to Seoul.
- Of course, we do.

339
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:50,630
I beg for your cooperation.

340
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,654
Ma'am, keep it in your arms.

341
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:55,088
- But sir...
- One moment.

342
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:58,844
Marshal, I'll take the heat on
this, please get ready for take off.

343
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,358
Our plane will now take off.

344
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:13,673
Please fasten your seatbelt.

345
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:14,517
We're ready to take off,
please take your seat.

346
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,102
Please fasten your seatbelt, thank you.

347
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,081
Lift this part up first.

348
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,669
Hotel-Lima 5212,

349
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:35,694
wind, 190 at 11 knots.

350
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:37,246
Cleared for takeoff.

351
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:38,606
Cleared for takeoff.

352
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:42,074
Runway 05, Hotel-Lima 5212.

353
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:43,738
Runway clear.

354
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,121
Takeoff, rolling takeoff.

355
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:57,419
V1.

356
00:24:58,044 --> 00:24:59,044
Rotate.

357
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:18,233
1:07 P.M., January 23, 1971

358
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:30,754
Look, that house is the size of a bean!

359
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,353
I got to see such a marvel
thanks to my prosecutor son.

360
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:37,484
Look, look.

361
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,661
- She must be mute.
- All right.

362
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:43,313
Must be frustrating
not being able to talk.

363
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,960
Enough with the sign
language, it's embarrassing.

364
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:51,100
There.

365
00:25:51,692 --> 00:25:52,692
Gosh!

366
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:09,027
Why are you keep sniffing? It's
obviously from the chicken shit.

367
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,901
Did the chicken poop?

368
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:14,387
Wait!

369
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,770
Here.

370
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,145
Wow...

371
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,184
Oh gosh, it laid an egg.

372
00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:28,437
Here, try this.

373
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:30,289
- What?
- Go on.

374
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:34,798
But this is so precious...

375
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:40,033
Why are you traveling alone?

376
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,024
My mother died, and I'm gonna
live with my older brother.

377
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:47,142
Gosh, how did she leave
behind such a fine son?

378
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:52,287
When I got back from out of
town, she starved to death.

379
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,524
I cremated her with my own hands.

380
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,968
That's terrible, dear...

381
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,216
I'll engage autopilot.

382
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,241
Yup.

383
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:05,312
Hey wanna try an imported cigarette?

384
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,199
May I?

385
00:27:08,224 --> 00:27:09,731
It's just a cigarette.

386
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:13,073
Thank you.

387
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,484
I want you to land today.

388
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:31,642
Can I?

389
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:34,698
I want to see how good you are,

390
00:27:35,451 --> 00:27:38,292
and put my life in your hands.

391
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:41,383
We'll now start inflight service.

392
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:42,979
You're giving these to us?

393
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:45,245
We have black tea, coffee and snack.

394
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:53,584
Ma'am.

395
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,609
It will be much later

396
00:28:00,522 --> 00:28:02,042
until you meet that daughter of yours.

397
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:03,618
Do you like eels?

398
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:06,338
I never eat eels.

399
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,593
Without a drink.

400
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,057
Eels and drinks go hand-in-hand.

401
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,082
Sure.

402
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,566
So, let's have a feast
when we land in Gimpo,

403
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:21,438
with a drink.

404
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:22,856
That'd be great, Captain.

405
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:48,646
Bomb!

406
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
- It's a bomb!
- 3.

407
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:51,432
2,

408
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,097
1!

409
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:03,436
Captain, pull back!

410
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:13,445
We're losing altitude!

411
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:15,369
800!

412
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,061
7!

413
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,349
6!

414
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,380
5!

415
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:22,969
4!

416
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,614
3! 2!

417
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,706
We'll crash at this rate,
pull back harder!

418
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:51,816
Full throttle...

419
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:53,434
Captain, full throttle!

420
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,889
Full throttle!

421
00:31:28,828 --> 00:31:30,651
Check the roll level.

422
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:31,957
Roll level.

423
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:35,294
Level is stable.

424
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,323
Tae-in, what blew up?

425
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:44,959
I'm not sure.

426
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:48,642
Check oil pressure.

427
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:49,667
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:51,964
It's good, sir.

429
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:00,601
Head for the ocean!

430
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:06,976
Follow my orders,

431
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,451
and no one dies.

432
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:12,916
Go to the ocean.

433
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,806
Okay, fine.

434
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,698
But I need to check
the cabin's status first.

435
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:22,135
Goddammit!

436
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:25,478
You deaf?! Get to the ocean!

437
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,198
A bomb went off.

438
00:32:31,223 --> 00:32:33,397
Status check, I have
to check the cabin first.

439
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:38,196
Run your mouth again
and I'll cut off ya tongue.

440
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:42,113
Status check first.

441
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,131
We can go wherever you want.

442
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,209
Tae-in, get back there
and check the fuselage.

443
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:51,812
I'll turn the plane around.

444
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:54,030
I have control!

445
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,930
Could you step on this?

446
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,126
- What? What did you say?
- I need our help.

447
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,010
Move out of the way, I'll do it.

448
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,870
What was that? What happened?

449
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,580
We're in a hijacking situation.

450
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,080
I was handing out black tea,

451
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:52,040
and suddenly passengers
up front started screaming...

452
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,950
Ok-soon, it's okay.

453
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,920
But where's the gun?

454
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,120
Did you see it?

455
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,550
If you find it, keep it well hidden.

456
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,229
Ok-soon, I need your help.

457
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,610
You're now responsible for
the safety of the cabin, okay?

458
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,899
How could I do that by myself?

459
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,980
You were trained for this,
follow the manual.

460
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,600
Let's cover he hole first.

461
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,130
Go to the back and get me a net.

462
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,570
Marshal?

463
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,070
Marshal.

464
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,220
- Could you help me?
- Sure!

465
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,440
What in the world...

466
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,650
Easy.

467
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,670
Are we all go to die?
Is everything okay?

468
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,130
The situation is under control.

469
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:44,800
Please go back to your seat.

470
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Okay.

471
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,270
Hold on to it, take that sides.

472
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
Okay.

473
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,820
Secure it tightly on that side.

474
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,070
Okay, it's secured.

475
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,670
Ok-soon, get the first aid kit.

476
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,570
Do we have a doctor or
a nurse on the plane?

477
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,380
A doctor or a nurse?

478
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,100
That's it.

479
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,930
Is this political or are
you after money?

480
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,970
I dunno about politics.

481
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,040
Just go straight.

482
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,810
To Oeongchi.

483
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,420
In Sokcho area?

484
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,620
Is that your hometown?

485
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,550
This will sting a bit.

486
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,300
I'll tighten it now.

487
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,400
Ow!

488
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,720
Please go easy on him.

489
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,720
I'll go check it out.

490
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,860
Just hang in there.

491
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,640
Ok-soon, tweezers please.

492
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,470
Mr. Park...

493
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,890
Hang in there.

494
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,770
My money, it's my money
my precious money...

495
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,790
Put pressure on this. You will be okay.

496
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,540
Thank you.

497
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,120
Ok-soon, go to the cockpit,
Captain needs help too.

498
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,620
Mr. Pilot.

499
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,590
Where are we heading?

500
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,050
We're going to Seoul, right?

501
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,880
Yes.

502
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,656
I'll make sure to get you
to your destination.

503
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,510
There's a hole in the plane,
it's like we're in a war!

504
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,840
How could we not worry!

505
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,760
What did ya say?!

506
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,530
Y'all see this?

507
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,530
Huh?!

508
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,900
If you don't wanna die,
put your head down.

509
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,980
Put this on.

510
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,630
Shut the hell up!

511
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,210
This plane is now headed for...

512
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,010
North Korea.

513
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,980
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

514
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,810
Hotel-Lima 5212.

515
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,110
Hotel-Lima, we are
in a hijacking situ...

516
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,460
Mayday, mayday, hijacking aboard.

517
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Ahh...!

518
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,210
If ya radio without my permission...

519
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,640
this goes boom.

520
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,220
Stay on the shore and head North.

521
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,680
All right, heading to North Korea.

522
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,510
290.

523
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,580
Altitude 3,000 ft, speed 240 knots.

524
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,410
Fastening the yoke.

525
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,260
Good! Just follow my order.

526
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,460
Ok-soon! Please come up.

527
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,980
Captain needs to be treated.

528
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,350
Ok-soon, hurry!

529
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,480
Go ahead.

530
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,410
Captain, is your eye okay?

531
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,040
It's okay, blind in one
eye won't get me killed.

532
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,250
Why are you so desperate
to go to North Korea?

533
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,970
Are we on a death march?

534
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,540
People live there too, ya know.

535
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,330
My brother was taken
there during the war,

536
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,540
but became an officer
and lives the high life.

537
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,190
So, you're doing this
to meet your brother?

538
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,330
This man became a national hero there

539
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,560
when he took an airplane
from Gangneung.

540
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,966
Heroic Defector Cho Chang-hee!
Come to the North!

541
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,830
Taking this airplane there
will fetch me $2 million.

542
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,450
Let's swap seats.

543
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,790
Why?

544
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Get up.

545
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,290
Come on.

546
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,540
Hey!

547
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,910
You there!

548
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:18,000
When that guy comes back, let's
jump him and take him down.

549
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,760
Jump him?

550
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,430
Are...

551
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,370
If we're taken now, our
family will starve to death.

552
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,960
And what if you get killed?

553
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,080
Merchants like us are useless
there, they'll send us back!

554
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,460
Have you forgotten already?

555
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,230
I was a cop during the Korean War!

556
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
How the hell would they know that?

557
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,080
Sir, I'll join you.

558
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,870
You sure?

559
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,410
A fisherman in the next village
was taken to North Korea.

560
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,910
He managed to come back,

561
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,100
but cops harassed him endlessly
because he could be a spy.

562
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,070
Get up.

563
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
Ok-soon.

564
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,290
When we cross the border,
destroy all passengers' IDs.

565
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,740
ID?

566
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,690
We may not return.

567
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,290
Are you ready?

568
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,310
Yes.

569
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,600
Tie him up good.

570
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,270
He said to tie him up good.

571
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,826
Will you pull it harder? This is wrong.

572
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,440
You have to pull on your side, sir.

573
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
Shit!

574
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,670
Go back.

575
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Okay.

576
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,300
Turbulence up ahead,
hold onto the yoke.

577
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,530
Now!

578
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,150
What was that?

579
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
What do we do?

580
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,480
I can't get through
turbulence on my own.

581
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,920
Get him now!

582
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
No! Please!

583
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,880
Do you want to die?!

584
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,290
To the right!

585
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,860
There's a leeway.

586
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,400
Gil-ja, move! Move out of the way!

587
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,500
It's gonna blow!

588
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,080
You commie!

589
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,480
It's all over, you commie bastard!

590
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,600
I can't breathe because
of your commie stench!

591
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,130
Get off!

592
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,880
Commie, commie!

593
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,920
First Officer!

594
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,650
Tae-in!

595
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,610
An asshole like you...

596
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,070
Wait, please!

597
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,120
Let go!

598
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Stop it.

599
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,950
Did you come here to kill me?

600
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,290
Don't hurt the passengers,
I'm begging you.

601
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,250
Put your heads down!

602
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:22,800
Down!

603
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,650
Do ya all want to die?!

604
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,640
You too! Kneel!

605
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,680
I've had it!

606
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,900
Please, don't do this, son.

607
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,060
Did ya not hear what I said?!

608
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,370
We'll cross the border soon,
we just need to land.

609
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,680
Please stop.

610
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,680
Please! Stop! Stop!

611
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,670
Do you want to get to
North Korea as a killer?

612
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,370
Please stop, I'm begging you.

613
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,190
He deserves to be punished.

614
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,790
Mister pilot.

615
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,400
The North doesn't ask about our past.

616
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,350
Okay, I hear you.

617
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,180
Go.

618
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,050
He'll be fine.

619
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:31,210
Please, someone help, please help...

620
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:34,920
Let me through.

621
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,230
A man is injured.

622
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,930
Please help...

623
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,080
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your Captain speaking.

624
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,840
Our flight is forced to
enter North Korea.

625
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:01,050
As per flight attendant's
order, please destroy your IDs.

626
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:06,520
We'll be entering North
Korean airspace soon.

627
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,770
Please destroy your IDs.

628
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,890
Are we really?

629
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,190
Ok-soon.

630
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,120
Could you untie me?

631
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,260
Please tear up your
IDs and hand them in.

632
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,670
Especially those who are soldiers,
police, civil servants, and engineers.

633
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,970
We're entering North Korea,
please tear up your IDs.

634
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,300
Especially those who are soldiers,
police, civil servants, and engineers.

635
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,840
We're crossing the border,

636
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,260
Prosecutor

637
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,260
please tear up your IDs.

638
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,800
Especially those who are soldiers,
police, civil servants, and engineers.

639
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,280
Why did you eat that?

640
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,080
What did you do that for?

641
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,830
I'm okay.

642
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,240
I'll protect you even in North Korea.

643
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:52,410
Hey, Yong-dae, are you home?

644
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,510
We're here for an inspection.

645
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,220
Yong-dae.

646
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,020
I heard you're in contact with
your brother in North Korea...

647
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,100
It ain't true!

648
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,570
Please stop mentioning that commie.

649
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,560
Of course!

650
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,180
Have you heard?

651
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:16,310
Armed communist guerrillas came
down to kill our president.

652
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,370
Why do you have these commie fliers?

653
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,180
What's that?

654
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,850
They ain't mine!

655
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,560
You commie bastard!

656
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,730
You son of a...

657
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,410
Why are ya doing this to me?!

658
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,390
What did I do so wrong?!

659
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,810
- Just let me live my life!
- You bastard!

660
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,870
Leave me the hell alone!
I'm not a commie!

661
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:42,160
Goddamn commie,
you're better off in jail.

662
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,810
Get up!

663
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,350
Yong-dae!

664
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,560
Yong-dae!

665
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,070
Ma!

666
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,570
Ma!

667
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:08,530
Ma!

668
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,030
Ma!

669
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,120
Ma, no!

670
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,200
Ma!

671
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:27,795
Please!

672
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,530
Ma!

673
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,990
Especially those who are soldiers,
police, civil servants, and engineers.

674
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,820
Untie me!

675
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,590
Will you let him take
us to North Korea?

676
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:52,110
Let's end this before
we cross the border.

677
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,410
Please tear up your IDs.

678
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,110
Excuse me.

679
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,910
I want to untie you,

680
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,570
but I'm so scared...

681
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,770
Hurry.

682
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,840
Your IDs, please.

683
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,110
Faster.

684
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,280
Hold on.

685
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,610
Hurry.

686
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,990
IDs please.

687
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,280
It won't budge.

688
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,280
You didn't find your ID?
Let me help you.

689
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,390
Hey!

690
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,100
Hold on, wait.

691
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,720
Did you put it in this pocket?

692
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,510
Over here?

693
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,680
Goddamn!

694
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,040
Stay right there.

695
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:21,890
What's going on?

696
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,170
We're running out of fuel.

697
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,640
Tae-in, land the airplane.

698
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:27,920
Yes, sir.

699
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,860
Trying to fool me again?

700
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,930
Take a look, see this fuel gauge?

701
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,380
We already crossed the border,

702
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,920
we're in North Korea.

703
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,440
Will you...

704
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,940
swear it on your life?

705
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,280
Absolutely.

706
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:57,450
Captain, initiating descent.

707
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Descending.

708
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,910
Captain, what's the altitude?

709
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,410
I can't see...

710
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,620
Can you land on your own?

711
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,260
Sir, can you grab the
yoke upon touchdown,

712
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,910
and activate the brakes?

713
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,640
He'll kill us first when he realizes
that this isn't North Korea.

714
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,450
Seriously?

715
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,110
Hold on tight.

716
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,070
If ya let go, this goes boom.

717
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,990
Are you nuts? He's just a kid...

718
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,490
What?

719
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,990
Hey, kid.

720
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,020
Don't cry, don't cry.

721
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,720
I said, don't!

722
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,220
Ya know what older boys at
our village did to a little boy?

723
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,170
Wanting to root out commies,

724
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,900
they poured boiling water on him.

725
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,420
Don't believe me?

726
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,850
Do you see this?

727
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,580
See this?

728
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:33,900
Hold on tight.

729
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,660
What are you doing?! We're landing!

730
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,800
Raise the nose.

731
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,340
We're in North Korea.

732
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,280
I saw the Hwajinpo lake.

733
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,920
That emergency runway
looks North Korea to you?

734
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,280
Raise the nose.

735
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:02,960
If you don't, he be
dead instead of you.

736
00:57:03,741 --> 00:57:04,981
I'm sorry! I don't want to die!

737
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,913
I don't want to die!

738
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
Please help me!

739
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:27,320
I'm begging you, please!

740
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,460
I don't want to die!

741
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Nose up!

742
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,630
Please help me!

743
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,460
I'm begging you.

744
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,150
Please help! I don't want to die!

745
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,130
Nose up!

746
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,320
Please, sir, I don't want to die!

747
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,460
Please help me! He'll kill me!

748
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,210
Sir! Please!

749
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,850
Go-around!

750
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,570
Captain, throttle!

751
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,990
Full throttle!

752
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,230
Full throttle!

753
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:11,730
Tae-in!

754
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,380
Tae-in!

755
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,370
I'm all right...

756
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,570
Enough, you bastard!

757
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,160
My eyes are messed up, if
something happens to him

758
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,480
we're all dead, shit head!

759
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:34,270
Dying? Living is scarier.

760
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,380
The next bullet is to ya head!

761
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,510
I heard you loud and clear.

762
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,210
Let's send the kid back first.

763
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,340
We can talk this through.

764
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:50,755
Get up.

765
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Kid.

766
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
Son, you're fine...

767
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,780
Hold on.

768
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,390
Mister pilot.

769
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,820
My ma said to me

770
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,670
while wiping off the burn pus,

771
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,890
that I should always take
the last place in life.

772
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,390
When I entered middle
school at the top of my class,

773
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,830
a teacher said I was bringing shame

774
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,070
to the school, because a commie
was the smartest student.

775
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,940
A loser, nobody in the South,

776
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,900
could be a hero in the North.

777
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,930
Mister pilot,

778
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:43,690
you and I can be heroes.

779
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:48,060
Why do you risk your
life for those nobodies.

780
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,320
We can live lavishly in North Korea.

781
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:58,810
All right, I'll do whatever you ask.

782
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:03,270
But let's drop off the passengers
first.

783
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,760
We'll do that on the emergency
landing strip, it'll take 5 minutes.

784
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,220
And whether we live
lavishly, or become heroes,

785
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,380
I'll do whatever you ask.

786
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,260
Ya take me for a fool?

787
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,700
Those who want to stay should stay.

788
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,220
These passengers have over
a thousand extended families.

789
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,990
If we just go they'll all
be labeled as commies,

790
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,160
and live in misery just like you.

791
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,510
You're risking your life
to meet your brother.

792
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,510
I'll risk mine too.

793
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,800
Please, let's drop them off.

794
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,320
What the hell?!

795
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,920
Air Force! It's our Air Force!

796
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,040
Our Air Force is here!

797
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,170
Tae-in.

798
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:48,229
Radio frequency, turn to
the emergency frequency.

799
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,230
The emergency frequency.

800
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,080
...turn back at once.

801
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,710
You are entering the no-fly zone.

802
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,630
This is the ROK Air Force!

803
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,630
Turn back to the South.

804
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:03,350
Tango 1, initiating
interference to the flight path.

805
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:11,100
I'll check the cockpit.

806
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,420
Hotel-Lima 5212!

807
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,060
This is the ROK Air Force!

808
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:17,720
You're flying into restricted airspace.

809
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:20,460
- Dong-cheol.
- Turn the nose around.

810
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,170
Turn the nose South!

811
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,630
Tae-in.

812
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,920
Tae-in, it's me, Dong-cheol.

813
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,580
What's going on?

814
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,670
Tango squadron, intercept path!

815
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:41,220
Tango 1, begin warning
flight, Tango 2, standby.

816
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:44,410
Roger, Tango 2, hold position.

817
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,630
Roger.

818
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:47,390
Initiating warning flight.

819
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,320
They'll open fire on us.

820
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,480
If they do, how did the last
plane reach North Korea?

821
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,360
Ok-soon!

822
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,110
Don't cry, Air Force is here.

823
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,990
How's this?

824
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,660
Feel better?

825
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:21,990
Target heading 020.

826
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:24,570
No response, they're continuing course.

827
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:28,910
Tango 1, fire warning
shots, fire warning shots!

828
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,690
Master arm on.

829
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:32,970
Tango 2, move aside!

830
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,480
Roger.

831
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,280
Guns, guns, guns!

832
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,490
You see?

833
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:49,770
Cross the border now!

834
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,700
They'll shoot our engine
and force us to land.

835
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,200
We have to dodge it first.

836
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,300
This is Lee Ok-soon.

837
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,580
Buzz the intercom when the jets
are behind our wings again.

838
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:10,690
Yes, sir.

839
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,810
Tae-in! Tae-in! Respond!

840
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,560
Dong-cheol, it's me, do not shoot!

841
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,096
We're all dead if
you hit the fuel tank.

842
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,950
The situation is
different from last time.

843
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,819
A North Korean MIG squad is on the way.

844
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,820
Our squad was scrambled too.

845
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,600
This could trigger a war.

846
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,850
North Korean MIGs
scrambled from Wonsan Airstrip

847
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,910
Shoot down South Korean
fighters upon discovery.

848
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,130
Tango 1, force it to land
by shooting its engine!

849
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,210
Roger.

850
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,380
Ok-soon, over there.

851
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,180
First Officer!

852
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,480
First Officer!

853
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:15,150
Failed to shoot the engine,
failed to shoot the engine!

854
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:17,400
You are permitted to shoot
it down, open fire at once!

855
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:31,880
Guns, guns, guns!

856
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,680
I'll retreat into the clouds.

857
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:54,080
North Korean squad approaching
the border, shoot it down now!

858
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,680
Captain, get ready to release fuel!

859
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:59,150
I can't see anything.

860
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,680
They'll be right behind us again.

861
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,760
Stand by.

862
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,180
Release!

863
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,280
No visual on target,
low visibility, low visibility!

864
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,400
We got an order to shoot you
down, land on the beach now.

865
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,320
Okay, descending.

866
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,240
Captain, I'll land on the beach.

867
01:07:50,607 --> 01:07:51,607
Landing gear down.

868
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,470
Don't screw with me!

869
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:56,300
We're heading North.

870
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,510
Head North!

871
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:14,070
What are you thinking?
There's no time for this!

872
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,510
Will you really cross the border?!

873
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,730
7 miles to the border.

874
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:21,379
FOX 2, FOX 2, I repeat, FOX 2!

875
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,460
FOX 2?

876
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,790
North Korean squad
approaching the border!

877
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,040
Shoot it down at once!

878
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,160
Roger!

879
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,870
Tae-in, FOX 2, FOX 2!

880
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,560
Turn the plane around!
What are you doing?!

881
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:38,370
FOX 2...

882
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,950
That's the missile signal!

883
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,620
I repeat, Hotel Lima 5212,

884
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,920
last warning, head back to the South!

885
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:48,530
5212! Head back to the South!

886
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,470
There's no dodging this.

887
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,140
We'll get hit with a
missile and die right here.

888
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,720
There's no time, shoot it down now!

889
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,340
I repeat, shoot it down!

890
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:02,610
Nice to have company on my way to hell.

891
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,400
Tango 2, disengage.

892
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:20,960
Missile ready to fire,
confirm clear to engage.

893
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,300
Cleared to engage, fire at once!

894
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,380
Roger.

895
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,300
Tango 2! What are you doing?!

896
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,800
Get out of the way!

897
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,940
Bravo Delta. Requesting to
withdrawal shoot down order.

898
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,220
I'll force it to emergency land.

899
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,890
It's a hijacking situation.

900
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,500
Negative! Shoot it down immediately!

901
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,240
It's a hijacking situation.

902
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:56,370
Hijacker is threatening the pilots.

903
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,660
Shoot it down now!

904
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,080
I repeat, shoot it down at once!

905
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,790
Tango-2, out of the way! Pull out now!

906
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,200
Requesting for the last time!

907
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,260
Requesting order withdrawal!
Requesting order withdrawal!

908
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,930
The target is a passenger aircraft!

909
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,020
Tae-in, this is your last chance.

910
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,090
North Korean MIG squad

911
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:27,240
- This is the last chance.
- 5 miles to the border!

912
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:28,900
Let's land on the beach.

913
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,380
Tango 1, Tango 1. Comply to the order!

914
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,030
While crushing maggots
that were eating my ma,

915
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,620
I already died at that moment.

916
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,920
Fly straight.

917
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,530
Tae-in.

918
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,280
You did all you could.

919
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:54,180
Crash the plane on land
before crossing the border.

920
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,220
Let's allow their families
to recover the bodies.

921
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:01,930
Don't turn it around.

922
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,900
Tae-in.

923
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,070
Don't turn it around!

924
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,980
10 seconds to the border!

925
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,580
9!

926
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,020
Shoot.

927
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:58,960
- 8!
- Shoot me asshole!

928
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,370
Shoot!

929
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,580
7!

930
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,650
6!

931
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:08,270
Immelmann turn!

932
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,760
Full throttle!

933
01:12:26,878 --> 01:12:28,144
Full throttle!

934
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,030
Put your head down and hang on tight!

935
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,930
Hotel-Lima 5212 is turning
around, heading South!

936
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,600
Turning nose to South.

937
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:41,930
Requesting shoot down order withdrawal.

938
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:46,160
Captain, please take control.

939
01:14:46,185 --> 01:14:48,995
Tae-in, what are you gonna do?

940
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,610
I can't see a thing!

941
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,670
Pull the yoke in 10 seconds.

942
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,180
Sir, I'll land when I come back.

943
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:19,610
9..

944
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:21,770
10...

945
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:32,980
I'll do it!

946
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,940
Come to the cockpit.

947
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:49,570
Captain.

948
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,760
Sit beside me and be my eyes.

949
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:55,730
It's all over!

950
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,320
I have to go to North Korea!

951
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:59,720
I have to go!

952
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,900
I have to!

953
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:14,050
Don't you dare move!

954
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,800
Don't move!

955
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,220
Put the pin back in.

956
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,530
Please stop this.

957
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,040
We'll get you treated first.

958
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,960
You have to live.

959
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,670
We all must live to make sure that
no one gets mistreated like you did.

960
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:32,390
Mister pilot...

961
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,740
Don't you dare move!

962
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:38,850
I'm warning you, don't move!

963
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:35,350
Bomb!

964
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:36,260
Heads down!

965
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,010
Heads down!

966
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,140
It's a bomb!

967
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,750
5212! 5212!

968
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,120
Captain! Altitude is dropping!

969
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:06,970
What is your status?
Your fuselage is shaking.

970
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,370
Good, that did it.

971
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,580
Tae-in?

972
01:19:14,712 --> 01:19:15,962
First Officer! Sir!

973
01:19:16,945 --> 01:19:18,610
First Officer! Sir!

974
01:19:20,262 --> 01:19:23,531
First aid! First aid!

975
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:27,102
First Officer! Sir!

976
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,510
Do you recognize me?

977
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:33,530
Marshal!

978
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,140
What happened?!

979
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,870
The hijacker has been killed!

980
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,140
First aid!

981
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:45,410
Hotel-Lima 5212, hijacker
killed, hijacker killed!

982
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:48,770
Guide us to a nearby beach
for an emergency landing.

983
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:50,850
Direction of the beach, 150.

984
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,460
Maintain altitude.

985
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,930
Tae-in, get in here!

986
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,370
If you're okay, get back in here!

987
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,830
First Officer! You're bleeding badly!

988
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,560
Let's stop the bleeding first.

989
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,200
I'll take that.

990
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,060
Hotel-Lima 5212.

991
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,600
Maintain current heading.

992
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,480
Maintain current airspeed.

993
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,250
This is a painkiller,
you'll feel better.

994
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,810
Marshal!

995
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,390
The safety pin...

996
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:41,310
Look for the safety pin!

997
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,170
Everyone, look for the safety pin!

998
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,060
Someone cover this!

999
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:46,255
Okay...

1000
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:49,260
It's done.

1001
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:50,290
Thank you.

1002
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,090
Marshal!

1003
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,900
Will this do?

1004
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,130
You can let go.

1005
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,630
He did it, he did it!

1006
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:17,750
Ma'am we'll be landing soon,
please get to your seat.

1007
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:21,510
It's okay, please go sit down.

1008
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,680
5212, maintain altitude.

1009
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,260
Direction to beach, 140.

1010
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,260
Current heading, 150.

1011
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,390
Fasten your seatbelt, and heads down!

1012
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:46,510
Help me!

1013
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,220
Tae-in!

1014
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:49,550
Get in here!

1015
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,430
I can't land on my own!

1016
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:58,100
Yes, I'm coming...

1017
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,960
Mr. Pilot...

1018
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:07,720
Lean on me, get up.

1019
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:12,980
Tae-in, grab the yoke.

1020
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:14,820
I'm holding onto it.

1021
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,470
Sir, landing gear is malfunctioning.

1022
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:20,250
The pressure valve must be busted.

1023
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:28,750
There is a manual switch
under the step there.

1024
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:44,680
When I count to three,
pull as hard as you can!

1025
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,970
One, two, three!

1026
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:48,390
Pull!

1027
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:03,910
It's moving!

1028
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:05,110
One!

1029
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,200
Two!

1030
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,700
Three!

1031
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:09,490
One!

1032
01:23:09,530 --> 01:23:10,530
Two!

1033
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:12,150
Three!

1034
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,480
5212, you're too fast, reduce speed.

1035
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,440
Ok-soon, let me know when
the speed gauge reaches 180?

1036
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,020
Okay.

1037
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,000
Now.

1038
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:42,700
First Officer.

1039
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,890
I'm okay, please prep for landing.

1040
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,690
Yes, sir.

1041
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,350
I'll get ready for landing.

1042
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,920
We're landing soon! Get ready to land!

1043
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,750
Tae-in...

1044
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,400
- Buckle your seatbelt and put your head down.
- Can you do this?

1045
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:06,880
Yes.

1046
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:08,390
Good...

1047
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,660
Make the announcement.

1048
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,590
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your First Officer speaking.

1049
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:34,330
We'll be making an emergency
landing on the beach.

1050
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:39,960
In case of impact, please
check your seatbelt...

1051
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:44,380
and put your head down.

1052
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:53,090
I apologize for not getting
you to your destination.

1053
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:02,940
Gil-ja...

1054
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:04,690
Why are you crying?

1055
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,980
Can't you see how hard
that pilot's trying?

1056
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,670
Beach direction, 140.

1057
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,300
Godspeed, gents.

1058
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:31,590
I see the beach.

1059
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:37,500
What's going on?

1060
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:40,060
Why did that light turn oft?

1061
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:49,650
The engine...

1062
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:57,190
Tae-in, we've run out of fuel...

1063
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:07,900
Tae-in...

1064
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:10,710
First Officer, sir?

1065
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,440
Can't sleep?

1066
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:33,780
You did all you could.

1067
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,950
They're still alive,

1068
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,660
so, they'll come back.

1069
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,270
Would Min-su think so too?

1070
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,010
At least I do.

1071
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:03,630
So long as you're alive,
I'll hang on no matter what.

1072
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:35,920
Going into glide mode.

1073
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,060
Glide.

1074
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:44,730
Glide.

1075
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,270
It's an airplane!

1076
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:11,840
Evacuate!

1077
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:31,440
Unbuckle your seatbelt! Exit the plane!

1078
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:34,270
Ok-soon, are you here?

1079
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:35,610
Yes.

1080
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:37,070
Captain are you okay?

1081
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:37,970
Yeah, I'm fine.

1082
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:38,770
First Officer!

1083
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,900
Ok-soon,

1084
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,650
look after the passengers first.

1085
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:44,070
Yes, Captain.

1086
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:46,230
Tae-in.

1087
01:30:48,730 --> 01:30:49,860
Are you okay?

1088
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:52,650
Yes...

1089
01:30:58,930 --> 01:30:59,930
Han-bong.

1090
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,430
Han-bong, jump!

1091
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:17,030
Get to the back!

1092
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:23,490
- Look at that!
- Let's check it out!

1093
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,360
Grab her below! Slowly!

1094
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:29,450
Be careful!

1095
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,500
Grab him below!

1096
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,830
Go out first. Slowly!

1097
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:37,400
Honey it's okay, jump!

1098
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:54,790
Be careful.

1099
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:57,210
It's time.

1100
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,440
Tae-in.

1101
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:20,270
That was a good shot in the dark.

1102
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:25,140
Captain, all 59 passengers are safe!

1103
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,640
First Officer.

1104
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:40,380
First Officer, wake up!

1105
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:45,510
Please open your eyes, sir!

1106
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,840
First Officer...

1107
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,340
Everyone's alive!

1108
01:33:58,190 --> 01:34:00,230
They're all alive!

1109
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,700
Congrats on your first landing.

1110
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,140
Good work.

1111
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,640
Tae-in...

1112
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:23,760
Good work.

1113
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,330
You made it...

1114
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:42,950
On January 23, 1971, Korean Airlines F-27
crash-landed on Chodo Beach in Kosung.

1115
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:51,270
All 58 passengers and crew survived, the only 2 fatalities were
the 22-year-old hijacker and the co-pilot who threw himself at the bomb.

1116
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:57,420
Despite being injured, the lead pilot, Lee Kang-heun, successfully managed an emergency landing, a feat considered unprecedented in the history of commercial flights.

1117
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:04,850
Meanwhile, the 11 passengers and crew of the YS-11, who were abducted in 1969 have not returned home.
