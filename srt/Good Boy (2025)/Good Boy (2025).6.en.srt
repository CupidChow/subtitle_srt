1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,563
Can you see clearly?

4
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,196
Yes, very clearly.

5
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,615
Your body temperature is slightly high.

6
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,658
You also have dizziness
and low blood pressure.

7
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,494
I think it's a mild case
of heat exhaustion.

8
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,662
Did you experience any other symptoms?

9
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,793
It came out of nowhere,

10
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,294
so I got dizzy.

11
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,171
Excuse me?

12
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,178
What on earth happened

13
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,973
to put him in this state?

14
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,560
He's talking nonsense from the heat.

15
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:42,520
I see.

16
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,441
What kind of national team athlete
collapses so often?

17
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,276
You took tests at the hospital.
What did they say?

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,779
What do you think?
It's just the same old stuff.

19
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,239
Nothing serious.

20
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,999
This is about the Korea Customs Service.

21
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,465
-What's this?
-What?

22
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,677
Oh, call records from Min Ju-yeong's phone
that we seized that day.

23
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:18,347
I checked every number,
but they're all work-related calls.

24
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,515
There's nothing.

25
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,641
Anything else?

26
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,646
There was nothing unusual about
his belongings at the time of his arrest.

27
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,983
These records are almost too clean.

28
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,610
He didn't make any personal calls.

29
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,780
-In terms of text messages--
-There's nothing there either.

30
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,490
And there's no sign he deleted anything.

31
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,953
Min Ju-yeong knew what we were up to.

32
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,247
He knew we had found the hit-and-run car.

33
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,749
Someone told him.

34
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,171
I'll handle it without any problems,
so don't worry.

35
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,340
Understood.

36
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,944
Hey, where are we going?

37
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,362
We need to go somewhere.

38
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,822
Go by yourself. I have work to do.

39
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,325
But we're partners.

40
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,035
-If you don't listen to me, I'll--
-You'll what?

41
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,578
I'll spread rumors

42
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,788
-about how you kissed--
-Let's go.

43
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,125
On his way to the airport,

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,211
he learned that we had found
the hit-and-run car and hid here.

45
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,632
There you are.

46
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,218
Somebody definitely called and told him.

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,598
But if there's no record of that call…

48
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,768
it means that the bastard
used a burner phone.

49
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:49,229
It wasn't on him when he was arrested,

50
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,315
so he likely ditched it here.

51
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,576
-Found it!
-You found it?

52
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,036
Yeah, hold on.

53
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:07,790
I found it!

54
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,752
But the other half is missing.

55
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,716
It probably fell through here.

56
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:19,843
Can I lift this?

57
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,138
I wonder where this connects to.

58
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,473
It probably fell to the bottom.

59
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,185
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju. Here.

60
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,562
Thank you.

61
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,335
Why won't you answer--

62
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,881
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju.

63
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,760
Hey.

64
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,723
Hey.

65
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,226
Ta-da.

66
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,275
What are you doing? Get up.

67
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
My arm is stuck.

68
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,779
It's really stuck.

69
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,450
Hold on, I feel a cramp coming.

70
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,368
-It feels as if mice were climbing my arm.
-So?

71
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,955
It's getting worse.
What do you say to catch mice?

72
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,582
Come on, help me out.

73
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:14,666
Meow!

74
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,421
Hey, that did the trick.

75
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,514
I'm sorry about earlier. I apologize.

76
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,059
Everyone loses their mind
at some point in life, right?

77
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,894
I'm really sorry.

78
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,856
So can you forget it
and treat it like it never happened?

79
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,858
Man, it's hot.

80
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,403
The sun is really strong.
Can you put some sunscreen on me?

81
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,696
And can I have some water?

82
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,117
I'm craving sausage today.

83
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,619
-You know, the pink one.
-Hey.

84
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,414
Who knows what nonsense I'll say
if I collapse again?

85
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,166
Let's get you out of there. Come on.

86
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,127
-Let's try.
-I'm really stuck.

87
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,294
One, two…

88
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,381
It seriously won't come out.

89
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,883
Seriously? Is it really stuck in there?

90
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,802
Yeah, I can't get it out for real.

91
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,889
Stay here.

92
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,058
Where are you going?

93
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,853
If you just leave me here

94
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,981
I'll spread rumors about us

95
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,359
-Yes, his arm is stuck in a sewer grate.
-Rumors will fly

96
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,530
About how you and I…

97
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:39,877
You know.

98
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:46,049
The kind of sausage
that you coat in egg and lightly fry.

99
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,845
I really want sausage.

100
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,472
I bet my arm will heal quickly
if I have some.

101
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,017
How do you get in trouble every day?

102
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,523
I didn't get in trouble.

103
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,275
I'm in the process of collecting evidence.

104
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,319
Min Ju-yeong's burner phone.

105
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,539
-Hey.
-What?

106
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,210
Did something happen
between you and Han-na?

107
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,514
It might hurt your feelings if I tell you.

108
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,226
Let's just say

109
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,269
it's a little secret

110
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,065
between me and Han-na.

111
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,524
THANK YOU

112
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,781
Hey.

113
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,116
Soak up the sun.

114
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,202
They say vitamin D is good for your bones.

115
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,664
It might get that stupid grin
off your face too.

116
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,168
Hey.

117
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:04,878
Hey!

118
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,093
ANALYZING FINGERPRINTS…

119
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,137
It's a match.
They're Min Ju-yeong's fingerprints.

120
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,305
Yes!

121
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,015
The data's recoverable, right?

122
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,893
It'll take some time, but it's possible.

123
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,313
It's all over once we recover the data
and get the call history.

124
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,314
Counterpunch!

125
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,401
-You adorable little punk!
-What are you doing?

126
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,988
Great job.

127
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,124
GYEONGIL NOODLES

128
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,337
What are you kids doing?

129
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,800
We're being arrested
if the wall isn't squeaky clean.

130
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,593
Who said that?

131
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,012
A police officer.

132
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,938
Stop right there.

133
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,819
I can run 100 meters in 11 seconds.

134
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,613
If you run, I'll get you
and give you a hard time.

135
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,535
Hey, kids.

136
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,539
You kids drew on the wall and ran, right?

137
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,957
Don't deny it. I saw it.

138
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,002
We didn't do that one. Jae-seok did.

139
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,046
-What's your name?
-Kang Seung-wan.

140
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,340
-And you?
-Lee Won-ho.

141
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:32,924
Seung-wan and Won-ho.

142
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,843
Listen very closely.

143
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,304
If I see doodles again
when I drop by next time,

144
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,597
I'll arrest all of you.

145
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,057
I'm a police officer.

146
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,851
Is it good?

147
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,519
-Yes.
-Yes.

148
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,812
Will you draw here again?

149
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:46,897
-No.
-No.

150
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,732
Keep an eye out for people who do, okay?

151
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,067
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

152
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,711
I'm horrible.

153
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,647
GYEONG-IL'S MOTHER

154
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,856
Dong-ju.

155
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,111
If you're free tomorrow evening,
can you come to the restaurant?

156
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,785
OKAY

157
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,583
Goodness, Officer Yoon.

158
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,211
Hello, ma'am. How have you been?

159
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,422
Here you are.

160
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,424
I was about to call you.

161
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,967
What for?

162
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,928
I heard you got injured
while rescuing Han-na.

163
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,847
It's really nothing.

164
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,973
It's to be expected.

165
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,142
How is this something to be expected?

166
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,520
I'm always nervous about Han-na
working a job like this,

167
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,275
but I feel better knowing
she has someone reliable by her side.

168
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,653
Please continue
to take good care of Han-na.

169
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,823
Of course, ma'am.
There's no one here better than me.

170
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,992
You don't need to
worry about Han-na at all.

171
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,411
Don't worry, Mother.

172
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,706
You even have a great personality.

173
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,001
This is an insurance sign-up gift.

174
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,218
By law, I'm only allowed to give gifts
worth up to 30,000 won.

175
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,220
But I felt so grateful

176
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,681
that I got this for you personally.

177
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,309
It's just my small token.
I hope you find it useful.

178
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,437
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

179
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,316
-Thank you.
-I should be the one thanking you.

180
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,277
It's fortunate that you took out a policy
just before the accident.

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,904
-Don't you agree?
-Yes.

182
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,282
If I come across better products,

183
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,076
I'll recommend them to you.

184
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,954
But don't tell Han-na, okay?

185
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,540
Get well soon.

186
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,334
-I'll see you later.
-Thank you.

187
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,968
Hello.

188
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,641
What's that? Did you buy something?

189
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,725
No, it's a gift.

190
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,728
Guess what?

191
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:37,234
Han-na's mother was so grateful
that I saved Han-na

192
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,445
that she dropped this off for me.

193
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,490
-What is it?
-It's an air purifier.

194
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,244
-Nice.
-A black one.

195
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,247
Where should I put this?

196
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,790
I'll put it in the middle here.

197
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,542
-Are you sharing with us?
-Of course.

198
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,961
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

199
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,963
Holy cow!

200
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,467
Let's put mine in the middle.

201
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,261
Yeah, let's put yours there
instead of Dung-ju's.

202
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,762
Dung-ju, move it.

203
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,935
Senior Officer Ji, you're here.

204
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,042
Yoon Dong-ju isn't coming.

205
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,296
I'm bored out of my mind.

206
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,638
-It's too expensive.
-That's not the right stance.

207
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,973
Have you ever golfed before?

208
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,351
Yeah, I have. Don't pretend like you know.

209
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,228
-Captain.
-What?

210
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,777
-Do you need anything?
-No, I'm okay.

211
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,820
That's not it.

212
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,740
Damn it.

213
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,534
-Just some water.
-Right.

214
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,131
Damn it.

215
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,675
I don't know if I can take on five.

216
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,727
I need to hunt down the bastard
making fake Candy.

217
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,065
Wait a minute.

218
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,829
You're home.

219
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,464
Why are you looking at me like that?

220
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,633
Did you sell insurance
to Jong-hyeon and Officer Yoon?

221
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,967
What?

222
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,929
Oh, well, they said they needed it.

223
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,223
I told them they didn't have to.

224
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,017
What are you doing?

225
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,270
It's been a while since we ate together,
so I went to the market--

226
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,897
I told you not to come back.

227
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,611
Hey, I have a stake in this house too.

228
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,071
Don't be so mean.

229
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,365
Besides, you make me come looking for you.

230
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,574
What are you talking about?

231
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,746
What documents did you request
from your father's insurance provider?

232
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,498
Why do you ask?

233
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,792
The case manager contacted me.

234
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,670
I hear that might prompt
reinvestigation into your father's death.

235
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,257
If it turns out
he didn't die in the line of duty,

236
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,384
it'll be hard to receive
the insurance payout.

237
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,262
Don't go around causing trouble.

238
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,556
I need that money to pay off my debt.

239
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,724
Who's the case manager?

240
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,850
-What's their number?
-Hey, wait.

241
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,602
I'll take care of it. You just stay put.

242
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,982
Why are you suddenly doing this?

243
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,984
This isn't like you.

244
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,986
Aren't you curious?

245
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,238
Don't you want to know how he died?

246
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,912
Why would I be curious about that now?

247
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,414
It's been over ten years.

248
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,791
He might've been good to you,
but not to me.

249
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,336
Do you know how much I struggled
because of him?

250
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,506
You brat, why are you upsetting me?

251
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,220
Hey, the stew is ready! Eat before you go!

252
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,472
Han-na!

253
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:45,940
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

254
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,442
Come here.

255
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,457
SAUSAGE

256
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,258
What is it?

257
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,385
Do you want some sausage?

258
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,640
What kind of dog likes sausage so much?

259
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,976
Kim was having some earlier
when it stole some and gobbled it down.

260
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,895
Reminds me of someone.

261
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,190
What's his name?

262
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,526
He doesn't have one. He's just a mutt.

263
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,860
You should give him one.

264
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,288
Hey, Dung-ju.

265
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
Han-na.

266
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,470
Did you see your mother?

267
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,390
I'm sorry

268
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,851
for not telling you.

269
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,147
Have you kept in touch
with my mom this whole time?

270
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,359
Yeah.

271
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,570
I'm not comfortable
with you keeping in touch with her.

272
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,654
Please stop.

273
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,989
I know we broke up,

274
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,907
but it doesn't feel right
to avoid her calls.

275
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:18,908
Just ignore her.

276
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,536
She's acting like this
because you let her.

277
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,079
You know how she is.

278
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,623
I'm craving sausage today.

279
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,458
You know, the pink one.

280
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,060
What's this? Sausage?

281
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,275
Okay.

282
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,444
Tae-sik and rookie, stay here.
The rest of us are moving out.

283
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,486
Yes, sir.

284
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,947
-All right.
-Good luck, sir.

285
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,074
All right.

286
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,953
Sergeant Kim, call Senior Officer Shin
and go to Bukgu Port with the gear.

287
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,165
Where are we going?
Tell us what's going on.

288
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,249
We're going after Drugmon.

289
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,928
Where's the other bastard
putting out fake Candy?

290
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,014
Will you let me live if I tell you?

291
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,098
Sure.

292
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,563
Bukgu Port.

293
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,357
Every Friday night.

294
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,903
So you're saying this guy is Drugmon.

295
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,655
Also known as Bbong-pil,

296
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,115
he used to live in Seoul
but recently came to Insung

297
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,450
to expand his operation.

298
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,619
Her statement was true.

299
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,371
I remember now.

300
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,833
He said Bukgu Port

301
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,670
and something about manufacturing candy.

302
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,548
It turns out Bbong-pil set up a drug lab

303
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,175
on a workboat in the sea.

304
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,969
After working through the night,

305
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,472
they return to the port at daybreak
with the goods and distribute them.

306
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,308
So you'll have to wait a bit longer.

307
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,311
We'll cover the back road to the port.
You guys can handle things here.

308
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,729
I'm tired already.

309
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,730
You're tired?

310
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,900
-Here.
-What's this?

311
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,153
-What is it?
-Everybody can have one.

312
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,032
Here, take one.

313
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,250
Hey, I'm wide awake now.

314
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,835
Get ready to pull an all-nighter.

315
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,337
Then I'll let myself out.

316
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,381
-Good luck.
-All right. Stay off the radar.

317
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,390
When did you grab your gun?

318
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,684
Try getting stabbed
and hit in the head with a wrench.

319
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,811
You'd need a weapon to feel at ease.

320
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,023
Can we trust that woman though?

321
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,026
Don't you think it's strange?

322
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,902
She can't even remember her own name,

323
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,280
but crucial information like this
somehow returned to her?

324
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,076
No, I don't think it's a lie.

325
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,245
Dae-yong checked it out,
and it seems credible.

326
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,332
Let's catch Drugmon

327
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,045
and pin drug charges on Min Ju-yeong
so that he rots in prison.

328
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,422
I dare him to come.

329
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,619
Is it that car?

330
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:05,927
That's Bbong-pil, right?

331
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,428
It's Bbong-pil.

332
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,639
Where? Let's go catch Drugmon.

333
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:13,434
Damn it.
Has he conked out again after drinking?

334
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,605
I tell him to show up on time,
so why the hell is he always late?

335
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,691
Hey, where's the boat docked today?

336
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,163
Damn it.

337
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,460
Let's move! Run!

338
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:02,817
Did your legs give out already?

339
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,943
Real men have strong legs.

340
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,653
Keep your focus ahead.

341
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:28,885
Focus on Drugmon! Catch him!

342
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,305
Hey, over there!

343
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:35,850
Kim Jong-hyeon!

344
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,561
-Dung-ju!
-Dung-ju!

345
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,814
Get out of the way!

346
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,167
I just love him!

347
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,338
He's so cool!

348
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,464
Grab Dung-ju on the way!

349
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,558
BUKGU PORT FISHERS' ASSOCIATION

350
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,483
You're alive!

351
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,944
-Looking good.
-What are you on about?

352
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,695
Hold on.

353
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,697
-Those look good on you.
-What are you talking about?

354
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,700
"Focus on Drugmon"?

355
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:37,954
So making an arrest is more important
than saving a life, right?

356
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,038
Jeez.

357
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,498
This is attempted murder.

358
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,542
That's what the captain said.
I saved your life.

359
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,170
You should've learned how to swim.

360
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:47,755
You purposely aimed for my head,
didn't you?

361
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,466
What are you talking about?
It landed exactly around your head.

362
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,636
Exactly! You got revenge
because I ate your rabbit food.

363
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,479
I should've aimed for your mouth,
but I slipped.

364
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,360
I knew it. You hit me on purpose.

365
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,571
YOU

366
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,757
What's wrong?

367
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,593
The wrapping looks different. Take a look.

368
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,723
I don't think
there's a trace of Drugmon here.

369
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,435
The manufacturers also said
they've never seen or met Drugmon.

370
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,936
Isn't that weird?

371
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,273
Is Bbong-pil

372
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,191
really Drugmon?

373
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,497
-He's forthcoming about everything,
-Okay.

374
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,666
but he says he doesn't know
Drugmon or Min Ju-yeong.

375
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,084
I don't think he's lying.

376
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,627
Of course, he's lying.

377
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,296
He's spilling everything else.

378
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,380
So he must not know--

379
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,049
-I need to collect a hair sample.
-Hello.

380
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,925
I'll do it.

381
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,928
Hey. Do you know how to?

382
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,930
I learned it at the police academy.

383
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,353
I'm here to collect a hair sample.

384
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:30,691
This way. Slowly.

385
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,612
This way!

386
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,530
Slowly!

387
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,325
-Nice!
-Awesome!

388
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,118
Very nice.

389
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,830
"TAE Corporation."

390
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,459
"Russian… pollock."

391
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,252
Russian pollock.

392
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,255
Let's take a look.

393
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,258
It's pollock, and it's frozen solid.

394
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,179
Be careful with those.

395
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,764
-Oh my.
-Sir, we need you.

396
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,021
Hey, this is ephedrine.

397
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,898
It's used to manufacture painkillers,

398
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,691
but it's also often used
to make narcotics.

399
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,610
Goodness, there's a lot.

400
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,654
How much can be manufactured
with this amount?

401
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,989
There are 50 more boxes over there.

402
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,491
I'm not sure, but considering the amount…

403
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,370
This might be the largest bust
in the country's history.

404
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,038
You two really pulled off a big one.

405
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,125
See? I positioned the SCIT well.

406
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,042
My strategy worked.

407
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:32,711
Strategy?

408
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,214
-National team athletes are the best!
-Strategy, my ass.

409
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,267
Are you really not Drugmon?

410
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,061
I've never even seen Drugmon.

411
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,230
So you don't know who Min Ju-yeong is?

412
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,857
How many times do I have to tell you?

413
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,902
I've never met or seen anyone
with the last name Min.

414
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:57,987
Goddammit.

415
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,447
Just get a hair sample already.

416
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:01,866
Okay.

417
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,121
Do you see this?

418
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,960
The "thank" in "thank you" is gone
because of you.

419
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,296
So?

420
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,883
So if I catch you lying
from this moment onward,

421
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,929
consider yourself done for.

422
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,139
Done.

423
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,223
Done.

424
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,267
Done!

425
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,358
Jeez, this guy.

426
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,154
We collected plenty of samples
just in case.

427
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,655
Oh, thank you.

428
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,163
Seriously, don't be so difficult.

429
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,873
I just went there to sleep.

430
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,958
I have nothing to do with them.

431
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,502
So please let me go.

432
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,879
We were just at the same motel.

433
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,297
Aren't you still in school?

434
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,591
What minor stays alone at a motel?

435
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,511
I already told you
there's a reason for it.

436
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,096
I've only just arrived in Korea.

437
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,183
All right. But you're not going anywhere
until your parents get here.

438
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,809
Come and write down a contact number.

439
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,231
Bbong-pil

440
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,608
Bbong-pil

441
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,486
-Bbong-pil
-Bbong-pil

442
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,654
Hey, be careful.

443
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,073
JUVENILE DIVISION

444
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,786
-What are you doing?
-Get back here.

445
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,037
Let go of me!

446
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,331
Hold on.

447
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,212
Hey, where are you going?

448
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,841
Are you okay?

449
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,598
Unbelievable.

450
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:55,020
Hey, kid. Why were you running?

451
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,772
What do you think you're doing?

452
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,858
Hey, why are you clinging to him?

453
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,194
-Step away from him.
-Let go of me.

454
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,697
"Let go of me"? Move away from him.

455
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,240
-Who is this?
-Stop right there!

456
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:12,538
Captain, this kid ran off
while being questioned.

457
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,293
Go Jeong-a.

458
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,753
What are you doing here?

459
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,131
When did you return from the Philippines?
Where's your mom?

460
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,257
Did you come alone?

461
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:25,968
And why is your face so red?

462
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,761
What are you doing?

463
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,974
Her own daughter ran away from home,
but I guess she didn't tell you.

464
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,269
Let go of him.

465
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,814
-Come with me.
-Will you please let go?

466
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,982
What are you doing?

467
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,066
Let go of me!

468
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,151
Come on.

469
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,819
-I said come here!
-Let go of me!

470
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,156
So why is our kid here right now?

471
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,494
Do you think I'd be calling you
if I knew the reason?

472
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,497
-Hey, Han-na.
-That's what I want to say.

473
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,333
-Could you check this number for me?
-Who's that?

474
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,586
She's a fairy. Isn't she pretty?

475
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:04,757
-Not at all.
-What are you talking about?

476
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,884
Then what about that detective?

477
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,596
-Oh, he's a sneaky jerk.
-A sneaky jerk?

478
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,057
Why would you bring up
the three-year extension--

479
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,809
She always hangs up on me.

480
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,687
Come here, you.

481
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,731
Go change out of those pants right now.

482
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,151
-Get over here.
-We're at a police station. This is abuse.

483
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,028
Go ahead and report me then.

484
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,905
Let's share a moment in jail
as father and daughter.

485
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,240
You can look forward to it.
It'll be really great.

486
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:33,410
-Let go! Where are we going?
-Hey, rookie. Come over here.

487
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,162
I'm a little busy right now.

488
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,957
If she tries to go anywhere,
put her in cuffs or do whatever.

489
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,876
Go with this handsome rookie, okay?

490
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:42,753
Go change, you punk.

491
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,798
Gosh, I'm so busy.

492
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,467
Sergeant Kim, do you have mousse?

493
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,552
Mousse?

494
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,720
Who's this?

495
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,597
This is Captain Go's daughter.

496
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:56,308
He said to watch her closely
and not let her step outside.

497
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,936
He said to cuff her if she didn't listen.

498
00:32:59,019 --> 00:32:59,978
So I brought her here.

499
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,105
Please take a seat.

500
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,565
I'll take this shift.

501
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,152
-Bye.
-Goodbye, sir.

502
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,531
-Did you eat?
-Not yet.

503
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,629
Why are you getting so dolled up?

504
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:27,965
Be quiet, you punk.

505
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,133
I'm back.

506
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,010
Gosh, Captain. You look great.

507
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,932
-The commissioner?
-He's still exercising nearby.

508
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,810
I should be doing this
while the commissioner is watching.

509
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,271
-The reporters?
-They're waiting in the briefing room.

510
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,355
Okay.

511
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,110
"I will provide an update
on the investigation

512
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,821
into a large-scale drug ring
and a new drug seized at Bukgu Port."

513
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,241
"Early this morning, the SCIT received
a tip about a new drug called Candy

514
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,827
and was conducting a stakeout
at Bukgu Port when…"

515
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,996
Man, you look great.

516
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,205
Hey.

517
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:02,291
Mic check.

518
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,753
I will provide an update
on the investigation

519
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:09,590
into a large-scale drug ring
and a new drug seized at Bukgu Port.

520
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,843
Early this morning,
the SCIT received a tip

521
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,637
about a new drug called Candy.

522
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,765
Twelve suspects with records…

523
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:18,849
I'm sorry.

524
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,559
Including Park,

525
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,562
we have apprehended
a total of 28 members of the drug ring.

526
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,230
EVIDENCE

527
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,483
The seized drugs and pharmaceuticals
are valued at…

528
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,609
Goodness.

529
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,152
A total of 12 billion won.

530
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,364
Please stand up.

531
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,869
Watch your head.

532
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,332
-Sergeant Seo Do-jae.
-What now?

533
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,917
Did you meet the survivor from the scene?

534
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,001
I did.

535
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,795
What about the survivor's statement?

536
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,463
Look at me.

537
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,590
She's the only survivor
who knows Park Bong-pil.

538
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,841
We need her statement to…

539
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,010
I said look at me, Sergeant Seo Do-jae.

540
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,179
I'm already looking at you.

541
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,974
Please take down the survivor's statement.

542
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,684
I'm counting on you.

543
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,941
-He's loving it.
-How do you feel about solving

544
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,400
the country's largest drug case?

545
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:13,862
That's not an official question,
so I'm unable to comment on it.

546
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,322
-It's the greatest success to date.
-Sir.

547
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,865
Please share your thoughts.

548
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,076
Later.

549
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,124
This is Cheongil Shipping's sales data.

550
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,626
In 2006, it was 210 billion won.

551
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,586
In 2007, it was 225 billion won.

552
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,173
And in 2008, it was 238 billion won,
showing steady growth.

553
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:36,927
At the time, they were competing for third
or fourth place in domestic shipping.

554
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,681
But the following year, they defaulted on
their maturing promissory notes

555
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,808
and were declared bankrupt.

556
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,393
So what about it?

557
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,396
The promissory note they defaulted on
was only 400 million won.

558
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,857
Cheongil Shipping
deliberately caused the bankruptcy.

559
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,901
The then CEO was sued on charges of fraud
including bankruptcy fraud,

560
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,778
embezzlement, and breach of trust,

561
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,071
but was acquitted of all charges.

562
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,657
Why is this important?

563
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,993
The company that bought
Cheongil Shipping at a bargain price

564
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,161
was TAE Corporation.

565
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,457
The company that imported the pollock
we found this morning on the workboat?

566
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,710
Yes. It was a startup at the time,

567
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,211
but after acquiring Cheongil Shipping,

568
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:13,297
it quickly rose to second place
in the industry.

569
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,884
And the company handling
TAE Corporation's logistics

570
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,385
belongs to Mr. Oh Jong-gu.

571
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,846
J9 Security.

572
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,267
So that's how they're connected.

573
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,812
So you're saying TAE Corporation
smuggled drug materials

574
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,065
by concealing them
in frozen Russian pollock.

575
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,152
Then J9 Security's Oh Jong-gu
handed off the goods

576
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,278
to Drugmon.

577
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,406
Or rather, he gave it to Bbong-pil.

578
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,161
REQUEST GRANTED BY MIN JU-YEONG

579
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,581
That bastard Min Ju-yeong
covered for them.

580
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,293
The truth is out. Let's go arrest them.
Let's round them all up.

581
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,128
It's not that easy.

582
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,880
The CEO of TAE Corporation is…

583
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,426
Steve Roh. Roh Seong-tae.

584
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:03,972
Roh Seong-tae's father
probably holds more power

585
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,849
since he's actually in charge.

586
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,267
Who's his father?

587
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,354
Roh Seong-tae's father?

588
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,398
Who is it?

589
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:14,858
Wait.

590
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,735
Move your feet!

591
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,570
The mayor of Insung, Roh Deok-gyu.

592
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,657
He and the commissioner
have something going on under the table.

593
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:37,589
Your backhand is a thing of beauty, sir!

594
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:41,593
It's all thanks to this racket
you bought me!

595
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,804
How about another set?

596
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,890
-Of course, sir!
-Okay, great!

597
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:52,104
The bastard must be full of energy
because he's young.

598
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:54,564
I think you should take this, sir.

599
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:55,649
Okay.

600
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,111
Hello?

601
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,700
What's going on?

602
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:10,038
So that's how that bastard Min Ju-yeong
has been getting away with it.

603
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,289
He had the mayor backing him.

604
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:15,419
The reporters will catch on soon enough.
What do we do?

605
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,670
We really stepped in shit this time.

606
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,213
Why is it shit?

607
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,590
Let's push out the commissioner
while we're at it.

608
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:21,967
Yeah, don't be scared. Let's push him out.

609
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,677
If there's a chance of illegal activity,

610
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,846
we must investigate,
no matter the sacrifice.

611
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:28,765
Hang on.

612
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,642
So the RIU figured out

613
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,770
the mayor's connection in all this
and set us up to take the fall, right?

614
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,732
You should give the briefing
for this case.

615
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,443
Why not give it together?

616
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,362
What's the point of sharing credit anyway?

617
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,781
Besides, you've put in a lot of work.

618
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,243
An Dae-yong, you bastard!

619
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,286
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

620
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,370
An Dae-yong!

621
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,716
-How long have you known?
-I find out right before the briefing!

622
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,135
You should've called it off then!

623
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,012
-Damn it.
-Captain!

624
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,889
-Aren't I right?
-Don't be like this.

625
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,850
-Separate them!
-Pull them apart!

626
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,351
Captain!

627
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,688
-Come on!
-It's the commissioner!

628
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:17,773
The commissioner!

629
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,497
Who was it?

630
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,500
Excuse me, sir?

631
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,752
Who investigated

632
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,171
TAE Corporation?

633
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:47,677
I guess it was me, sir.

634
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:56,103
I'm sorry, sir.

635
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,689
Man-sik!

636
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,861
Mr. Min.

637
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,245
You've been monitoring
this company, right?

638
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,371
Yes, sir.

639
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:19,501
The mayor wanted things handled thoroughly
to avoid issues like this.

640
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,503
That's why he pulled the strings

641
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,964
to keep someone like you here for so long.

642
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,383
How dare you
get us dragged into this mess?

643
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,219
I'm sorry, sir.

644
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,390
I'll apologize
and make sure this gets resolved.

645
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,309
INSUNG CITY HALL

646
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:41,857
What's that?

647
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,779
I thought it wouldn't be proper
to come empty-handed.

648
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,704
You can go in now.

649
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,678
MAYOR ROH DEOK-GYU

650
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:34,743
Watch.

651
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,745
Watch.

652
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,833
Mayor Roh.

653
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:44,794
Mayor Roh.

654
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,434
Have you already forgotten

655
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,520
who made it possible
to get your name on this?

656
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,147
No, I haven't.

657
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:07,108
-You shouldn't forget a favor, right?
-Right.

658
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,740
Why?

659
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,451
Seriously, why?

660
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,289
Why did you take my goods behind my back
and cause all this trouble?

661
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,374
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,504
Mayor Roh.

663
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,675
You know,

664
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,720
I spoon-feed everything to you.

665
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:38,014
A politician once said,

666
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,724
"If your spoon is too big,

667
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,018
it'll tear your mouth."

668
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,863
By the way,

669
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,825
I've got a lawsuit on my hands.

670
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:57,993
Take care of it.

671
00:42:58,952 --> 00:42:59,953
Understood?

672
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,456
What did I tell you to do
if you understood?

673
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,501
I understand.

674
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,986
I don't like doing this.

675
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,573
It's hard to make a living, isn't it?

676
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:38,658
It is.

677
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:43,079
You said you coached Officer Yoon Dong-ju
back in your boxing days, right?

678
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,706
Yes.

679
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,166
You can say I practically raised him.

680
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,335
Was he annoying back then too?

681
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:50,879
Don't get me started.

682
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,383
He's beyond stubborn
and has a way of getting under your skin.

683
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:57,719
I see.

684
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,893
What do you think, Mr. Oh?

685
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,605
Do I look like a bad guy?

686
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,315
Excuse me?

687
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,984
Officer Yoon keeps calling me a bad guy.

688
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,112
So I'm wondering
if I really did do so many bad things.

689
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,239
I'm not really sure.

690
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,621
What do you think?

691
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,582
Am I really that bad?

692
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,545
No, of course not.

693
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,636
Why would he say that then?

694
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,015
I guess there's no choice.

695
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,101
I'll need to borrow some guys.

696
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,519
I want tight-lipped ones.

697
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,771
What do you need them for?

698
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,608
If that's his wish, I should oblige.

699
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,652
I'll show him how bad I am.

700
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:03,076
I've been through so much today
that I'm exhausted.

701
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,078
You traitors.

702
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,038
How could you
throw your captain under the bus?

703
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:09,541
There was no need
for all of us to get blamed.

704
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,585
That's what a captain is for.

705
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,587
Thank you for treating me like a captain.

706
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,299
"Push out the commissioner"?

707
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,219
I meant if you pull us forward
and lead the charge,

708
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,638
we'll be right behind
to give you the push you need.

709
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,350
What do you have to say?

710
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:29,769
I'd like to remind you
that an investigation like this

711
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,062
demands a small sacrifice, sir.

712
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:40,321
I didn't say a word.

713
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:43,741
-You were the first to go.
-And I sincerely apologize for that.

714
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:46,744
I should've turned a deaf ear.

715
00:45:46,828 --> 00:45:48,496
Do your cauliflower ears trouble you?

716
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,834
As captain, I--

717
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,627
What are you doing?

718
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,174
What the heck?

719
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,134
This place sure has good meat.

720
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,510
It's delicious!

721
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:05,722
After we eat, we have to go back
to the house and reinvestigate,

722
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,724
so let's just have water tonight.

723
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:12,228
The toast will be
"Small sacrifices for the great good."

724
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:14,522
-Small sacrifices…
-For the greater good!

725
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,902
Try some. It's good, right?

726
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,404
Eat up.

727
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,159
Where are you going?

728
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,243
The bathroom.

729
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,373
I can make it there.

730
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:34,709
Hold on.

731
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,961
RIU ROOKIE

732
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,756
Come on. You can do it.

733
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,304
-It's locked.
-Captain Go Man-sik.

734
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,805
What?

735
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,185
What's taking him so long?

736
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:54,687
Tell me about it.

737
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,356
-Want to go check on him?
-Yeah, let's go.

738
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:57,857
-We'll be back.
-Okay.

739
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:03,530
Jeez, what's wrong with you?

740
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,031
You're not even drunk.

741
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,700
Get up already.
You can't just sleep on the street.

742
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,661
Captain.

743
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,081
Captain, it's cold. Get up.

744
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,671
-Captain!
-What is it?

745
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,047
What is it?

746
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,466
-Captain, wake up!
-Captain! What happened?

747
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,301
His head is bleeding.

748
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:26,469
What happened?

749
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:27,887
He was on the ground.

750
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,848
-Call an ambulance.
-No, don't.

751
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:34,435
Don't call an ambulance.
Call the agency first.

752
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,979
Those bastards

753
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,274
-took my gun.
-Gun?

754
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,237
WE PROMISE SAFE CONSTRUCTION
OF GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY

755
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:30,658
One hour ago, shots were fired
from an unidentified location,

756
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,870
posing a threat to the safety of citizens.

757
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:36,998
A vehicle's windshield
and a window of a home

758
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,958
in a redevelopment zone were shattered,

759
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,044
leaving the citizens in fear.

760
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,796
The four bullets that were fired
included a blank round

761
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,215
and were 6 mm caliber bullets
issued to the police…

762
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:48,134
I think it's your gun, sir.

763
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:52,180
It had one blank round
and four live rounds in it.

764
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,016
So there's one round left.

765
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,853
They've set up checkpoints
on all roads leading to Yeonseo-gu.

766
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,355
They'll catch the perp soon.

767
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,650
No. We can't just stay here.

768
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,735
You're in no shape to go anywhere!

769
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:15,912
DNA ANALYSIS REPORT
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

770
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,832
Remember the woman who saw Drugmon?

771
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,669
I found traces of the dead junkie's blood

772
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,587
in the bloodstains on her clothes.

773
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,547
Maybe it was a coincidence.

774
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,633
She was in close proximity to the guy.

775
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:31,844
The bloodstains were found
in the neck area of her top and jacket.

776
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:34,889
The junkie's epithelial cells
were also found there.

777
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,850
It means the junkie grabbed the collar

778
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,602
with his bloodied hands.

779
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:41,187
BLOODSTAIN ANALYSIS REPORT

780
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,151
Have you run the fingerprints
of the witness?

781
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:51,572
Authorities found that a synthetic drug
called Candy was manufactured.

782
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:55,952
The drugs were distributed
by TAE Corporation.

783
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,287
I got rid of the fake Candy maker,

784
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:00,248
but now this?

785
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,208
…and the shock is spreading.

786
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,252
Mr. Min must be pissed off.

787
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,757
Now what should I do?

788
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,389
Look what we have here.

789
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,891
Oh, now I remember.

790
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,728
What do you mean?

791
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,479
I remember where I saw you.

792
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,150
Me?

793
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,154
You know me?

794
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,656
Yeah. From the plane.

795
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:37,201
-Please stop crying.
-Mommy.

796
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,286
You can sleep at home.

797
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:39,996
Mommy.

798
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,723
Kim Yeon-ha.

799
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,391
I even know your name.

800
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,064
I'm sorry.

801
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,164
But you look

802
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,250
very different from when I first saw you.

803
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:27,585
I almost didn't recognize you.

804
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,969
I see.

805
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,475
That's where you saw me.

806
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,021
Why do you overdo things?

807
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,941
That's why you keep collapsing.

808
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,026
This is so frustrating.

809
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,570
Han-na, did you get the results?

810
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:06,666
It burned to the ground.

811
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,167
Are you okay?

812
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:10,002
-We think this is the source.
-Thank you.

813
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,382
Captain, here.

814
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,435
It's my daughter's.

815
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:30,940
Where is she?

816
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:34,819
She disappeared
while I was in the bathroom

817
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,153
along with that woman.

818
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,701
-I'm so sorry--
-You punk!

819
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,162
Captain.

820
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,247
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

821
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,482
Come with me.

822
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,861
Where are we going?

823
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,613
We're going to see something pretty.

824
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:19,572
Let's go.

825
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,200
Jeong-a!

826
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:24,952
Captain!

827
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,665
-Let's get you up.
-Jeong-a…

828
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,501
I'm going to check my place.

829
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:35,504
The rest of you,
keep looking for them here.

830
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,381
Jeong-a!

831
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,508
-Let's go.
-Okay.

832
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:41,761
Jeong-a!

833
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,025
It's so pretty.

834
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:08,663
It's been a while, Mr. Min.

835
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,290
When did your style change?

836
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:15,169
I know it's a bit childish.

837
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,213
Why were you there for so long?

838
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:19,131
They must've watched you closely.

839
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,384
No, it wasn't that.

840
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:24,595
It was quite heartwarming and nice there.

841
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,394
What's that?

842
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,273
Looks like you picked up a weird hobby
while I was gone.

843
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,526
It was more fun than I'd thought. Get in.

844
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,239
I have a friend.

845
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,579
The daughter of the SCIT captain.

846
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:55,668
What should we do?

847
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,006
There's one more round left.

848
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,763
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

849
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,557
Have you seen this girl?

850
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,392
If you see her…

851
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,148
-Hello.
-Welcome.

852
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,274
I'm with the police.

853
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,360
I'm looking for someone.
Can I check the CCTV footage?

854
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,698
Have you seen this person?

855
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,782
No, I haven't.

856
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,284
Excuse me.

857
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,540
This is Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

858
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:38,669
Where are you again?

859
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:42,673
She's gone missing!

860
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,300
What? Did you try tracking her phone?

861
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,386
Her phone is damaged,
so I can't track her location.

862
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,180
Didn't I tell you to send her back to me?

863
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,724
Whatever! Just text me anything
that might help!

864
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,808
Okay.

865
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,100
They called me because she couldn't pay
for her ice cream.

866
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,019
Apparently, she gave my name
to the precinct officers.

867
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,489
You little brat!

868
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:58,999
Stop crying.

869
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:06,173
Where's Kim Yeon-ha?

870
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:09,552
Oh, Yeon-ha?

871
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,138
I have to get going now.

872
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:13,139
Where are you going?

873
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,601
I have something more fun to do.

874
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,399
Something fun?

875
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:24,984
Officer Yoon Dong-ju?

876
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,485
Yes, that's me.

877
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,571
You're Yoon Dong-ju, right?

878
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,657
Excuse me.

879
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,285
Who's the sender?

880
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,829
I don't know. I'm just the courier.

881
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,581
Have a good night!

882
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:42,710
Let me see that.

883
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,211
OFFICER YOON DONG-JU

884
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:55,723
It's my gun.

885
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,034
GYEONG-IL'S MOTHER

886
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:19,788
Hello, ma'am?

887
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,251
Hello?

888
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,422
Hello?

889
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:32,218
When you're in the ring,

890
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,387
don't take your eyes off your opponent

Ma'am?

893
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,852
The moment you think
you have them cornered…

894
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,650
The second you let your guard down…

895
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,614
That's when you get hit
with a counterpunch.

Get up!

914
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,013
I said get up, you bitch!

915
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:28,394
Hey! Not again!

916
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:29,770
I said get up!

917
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,064
Don't hit your sick wife!

918
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:34,566
Who do you think you are
coming into my house?

919
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,210
"Like the poet Yoon Dong-ju

920

"Love, Mom."

925
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,169
I must be losing it.

926
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:18,921
What did I just do?

927
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,716
Right. I lost my mind for a second.

928
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,384
It's because of the hot weather.

929
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,929
The heat can do that to you. That's right.

Do you want to give up now?
