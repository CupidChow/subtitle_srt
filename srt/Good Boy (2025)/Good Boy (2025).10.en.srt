1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,198
Jong…

4
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:15,868
Jong-hyeon.

5
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,369
Jong-hyeon!

6
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,769
-Run!
-Kim Jong-hyeon!

7
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,608
Kim Jong-hyeon!

8
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,288
Oh, dear.

9
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,290
Things are about to get messy.

10
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,171
MAYOR OF INSUNG

11
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:00,723
Kim Jong-hyeon.

12
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,100
Kim Jong-hyeon, wake up.

13
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,184
Jong-hyeon.

14
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,487
You can't come in.

15
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,344
Doctor…

16
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:16,048
INSUNG CITY COUNCIL
SAFE AND CLEAN INSUNG!

17
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,098
INSUNG CITY HALL

18
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,267
The person you are calling
cannot be reached.

19
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,352
You will be directed to voice…

20
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,652
It's me.

21
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,655
Send over the thing I prepared

22
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,824
with a few of your men.

23
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,502
Our district caught a break
thanks to the quick approval

24
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,712
of the development project.

25
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,963
Cheers to that.

26
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,173
-It's good that we can count on you.
-Cheers.

27
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,434
Here you are, Mayor Roh.

28
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,948
What kind of civil servant
doesn't answer calls?

29
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,533
Well…

30
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,161
It's not that I didn't answer on purpose.

31
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,412
Something urgent came up.

32
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,543
I heard about your situation--

33
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,881
If my civil complaint has reached you,
shouldn't you process it?

34
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,175
I'm short on time, you see.

35
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,135
As much as I want to help--

36
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,219
What is it?

37
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,013
Haven't you been paid enough already?

38
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,432
How much more do you want? Tell me.

39
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,476
No, it's not that.

40
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,394
I'm telling you, my hands are tied.

41
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,736
Oh, jeez.

42
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,031
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

43
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,407
This isn't about money.

44
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,995
What's this? Come on!

45
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,748
What's this all about?
I swear it's not about the money!

46
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,832
Open wide.

47
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,585
Open wide.

48
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:31,058
Isn't it a civil servant's duty

49
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,268
to aid a petitioner?

50
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,273
Especially when the said petitioner
always goes out of his way to make sure

51
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,651
you get everything in return?

52
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,877
Do you still need more?

53
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,422
No!

54
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,633
Then take care of it, okay?

55
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,929
-Okay?
-Okay.

56
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,890
Good.

57
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,188
KOREA COAST GUARD

58
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,648
INSUNG CUSTOMS

59
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,068
I'm Sergeant Lee Ji-seok
of the Insung Coast Guard.

60
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,487
-Please stop what you're doing.
-The Coast Guard?

61
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,157
-We're from the Korea Customs Service.
-This is our jurisdiction.

62
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,283
The Korea Customs Service?

63
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,744
So what's going on right now?

64
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,998
The Coast Guard and Korea Customs Service
are fighting over jurisdiction.

65
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,082
I can't do anything.

66
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,710
That's not right.
What about the commissioner?

67
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,211
He's not answering.

68
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,842
Damn it, they're here too?

69
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,220
-Who?
-The prosecution.

70
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,806
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,392
Understood, sir.

72
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,896
-Everyone, stop!
-What the heck?

73
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,607
Stop right now!

74
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,652
Damn, this is so annoying.

75
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,405
I'm Prosecutor Kim Seok-hyeon.

76
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,912
Jong-hyeon might die any minute,

77
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,747
but his older brother is busy kissing ass.

78
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,124
Captain!

79
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,504
Sergeant Kim has been moved to the ICU.

80
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,633
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

81
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:33,889
Fortunately, the bullet missed his heart,
so they say he's going to live.

82
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,892
Has he come to?

83
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,270
He just got out of surgery,
so we'll have to wait.

84
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,356
I'll go talk to the doctor.

85
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,858
Thank goodness
Dung-ju learned how to swim.

86
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,318
He saved Sergeant Kim.

87
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,865
Good work, Senior Officer Ji.

88
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,410
Where's Dong-ju anyway?

89
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,791
KIM JONG-HYEON, RUPTURED LIGAMENT

90
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,507
Wait, 2018?

91
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,932
Is this from back then?

92
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,149
Where are you going?

93
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,608
You said you wanted to try boxing.

94
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,071
Sorry, but I have to go somewhere.

95
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,531
When will you be back?

96
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,366
It won't take long.

97
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,492
Want me to go with you?

98
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,202
Go ahead to the gym.

99
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,580
Okay.

100
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,693
GYM RESERVATION
JULY 26TH, YOON DONG-JU, 6:30 P.M.

101
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,718
Where did you go without a word?

102
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,844
What's that?

103
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,014
He'll be here for a while,
so I brought a few things he'll need.

104
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,557
How is he?

105
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,017
It's too early to tell.

106
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,437
I'm not sure he can return to work
even if he wakes up.

107
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,815
What do you mean?

108
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,858
Something's wrong
with Sergeant Kim's ankle.

109
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,528
It wasn't good even when he was competing,

110
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,530
but the fracture is serious this time.

111
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,325
What are you waiting for?
Senior Officer Ji is alone.

112
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,451
I'm going to the agency.

113
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,330
Hey!

114
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,707
Yes?

115
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,585
Are you okay?

116
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,338
I'm fine.

117
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,173
I guess that's a relief.

118
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,683
Sir?

119
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,601
Are you awake?

120
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,981
Just a moment. I'll call the doctor.

121
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,065
Okay.

122
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,320
Jong-hyeon, are you okay?

123
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,374
I'm so glad you're awake.

124
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,441
Here.

125
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,372
What did the commissioner say?

126
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,917
I shouldn't have put together this team.

127
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,295
Who was I kidding?

128
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,839
This all happened

129
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,384
because of my greed.

130
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,553
I'm sorry, Senior Officer Shin.

131
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,014
I'm ashamed to face you.

132
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,907
You're really irresponsible.

133
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,702
Mr. Yoon Dong-ju.

134
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,581
Don't underestimate your condition.

135
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,667
If your blood pressure spikes
from reckless behavior,

136
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,419
it can cause a cerebral hemorrhage

137
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,297
as well as blindness
due to optic nerve damage.

138
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,432
This hearing is to address accountability
for the officer casualty accident

139
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,060
that occurred
during SCIT's overzealous investigation.

140
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,854
As the incident occurred

141
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,689
while carrying out a duty…

142
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,162
That's it.

143
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,517
Hey, that's a foul!

144
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,195
Was that a right hook from the opponent?

145
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,446
I think he got hit with an elbow.

146
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,699
It looks like Yoon Dong-ju

147
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,077
has a cut above his eye.

148
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,456
Everything

149
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,416
is a mess.

150
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,286
Damn it.

151
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,330
Nothing is going my way.

152
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,678
SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

153
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,140
3 MONTHS LATER

154
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,187
I'm glad to see you're doing better.

155
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,106
You'll be discharged in no time.

156
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,568
Yes, sir.

157
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,446
Did you hear the SCIT got dissolved?

158
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,073
Let me know
if you have a department in mind.

159
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,867
The commissioner
will accommodate your request.

160
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:15,952
What about the team members?

161
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,664
They returned to work not long ago
after receiving suspensions and pay cuts.

162
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,708
This is an abduction, I tell you.

163
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,376
-I'm sorry.
-Let go of me.

164
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,170
-Come on, babe.
-I'm sorry.

165
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,963
-You can't do this, ma'am.
-Come on!

166
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,175
Hey.

167
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,051
Did you just touch me?

168
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,636
No, I didn't touch you. You fell.

169
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,388
-I'm a cop--
-You touched me!

170
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,310
Pull over! I want to get out!

171
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,438
-Let me out right now! Hey!
-Please be quiet.

172
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,483
-Damn it, let me out!
-I said be quiet!

173
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,276
Who the hell are you?

174
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,908
TRAFFIC POLICE

175
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,326
-Please stop.
-Let me out!

176
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,703
Why won't you stop the car?

177
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,997
Stop the car right now!

178
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,083
-Please save me!
-Just pull over!

179
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,794
-I said pull over!
-Save me!

180
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,420
SCHOOL ZONE

181
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:10,048
Save me! Please!

182
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,435
KI BANK: YOUR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
PAYMENT DUE DATE IS APPROACHING

183
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,812
WIFE

184
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,198
INTRODUCING NEW BODY CAMERAS
TO SAFEGUARD INSUNG CITIZENS

185
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,245
This is the only place
we can assign you for now.

186
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,706
You see, the others feel a teensy bit
uncomfortable around you.

187
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,710
Feel free to tell me
if you don't like it here.

188
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,254
I'll look into another place for you.

189
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,717
RECORDS ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

190
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,972
It's not too bad.

191
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,224
I like being alone anyway.

192
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,268
What about Officer Yoon?

193
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:04,978
Do you mean Yoon Dong-ju?

194
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,648
He got himself a sweet assignment,
courtesy of the commissioner.

195
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,358
He's a special support officer.

196
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,908
Hurry it up. We need to mobilize tonight.

197
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,993
I'm on it.

198
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,042
Why don't you help me then?

199
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,470
ROOM 4, JEONG MI-JA
INSUNG NANUM NURSING HOME

200
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,889
Ma'am, it's me.

201
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,813
Let me freshen you up.

202
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,774
This is nice and warm.

203
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,786
I didn't know this before,

204
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,664
but Insung has
a lot of great places to eat.

205
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:12,420
There's a famous knife-cut noodle place
in Gumyeon-dong.

206
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,383
In Baekdang-dong,
there's a good oyster and rice soup place.

207
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,303
Right, and this place in Jinhang-dong

208
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,014
has mind-blowing nakgopsae.

209
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,849
Do you know what that is?

210
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,644
I think you'd really like that place.

211
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,813
We'll go for a walk to admire flowers…

212
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,692
and enjoy the fall foliage.

213
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,864
I hope we'll get to visit
many different places together.

214
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,167
You're suspected of drug use,

215
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,920
so I need you to provide
a urine sample right away.

216
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,676
Mister, can you hold it steady down there?

217
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,761
My hands feel weak.

218
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,847
What kind of nonsense is that?
You're not a kid.

219
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,516
Here, take this and aim well.

220
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,893
Go ahead. You can manage.

221
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,020
Hurry up. We need to send it
to the Narcotics Unit.

222
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,105
Do it yourself then.

223
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,067
Seriously.

224
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,486
-Excuse me.
-Okay, that's nice.

225
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,737
Get ready.

226
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,200
Hey!

227
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,294
Stop showering,
or your skin will peel off.

228
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,547
How many times have you showered?

229
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,007
That damn junkie.

230
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,551
I can still smell the stench.

231
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,430
What's that?

232
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,021
Is this mukeunji, aged kimchi?

233
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,319
Braised chicken and mukeunji
go well together.

234
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,071
-This is delicious.
-It's good, right?

235
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,287
Dad, can we get a dog?

236
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,372
What's this crazy talk
in the middle of the night?

237
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,458
We already have an annoying mutt.

238
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,710
Hey, mutt! Come and eat.
I bet you're hungry.

239
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,211
I already asked him to eat.

240
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,214
Come on. Let's get a dog.

241
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,133
Who will clean up after it?

242
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,217
I will.

243
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,262
As if. Clean up your room first.
It looks like a pigsty!

244
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,770
What are you doing?

245
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,023
Hey, stop making a mess when you eat.

246
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,775
Did you talk to your mom?
What about school?

247
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,235
And why isn't your mom coming back?

248
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,034
The wind slammed the door!

249
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,376
Where are you going?
I know you're hungry. Come and eat!

250
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,670
This mutt is going out for a walk.

251
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,011
Where were you assigned today?

252
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,888
Event support for the mayor.

253
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,098
What about tomorrow?

254
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,350
Cracking down
on illegal objects on the road.

255
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,144
And I'll be doing community service
at the bank the next day.

256
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:18,231
They call it special support duty,
but they treat you like a day laborer.

257
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,942
They send you wherever
and make you go through hell.

258
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,820
A suspension and pay cut are enough.
What kind of crap is this?

259
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,154
I know, right?

260
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,327
There's an opening at a security company,
so go work there.

261
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,870
My friend runs the place.

262
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,622
You'll get paid better there.

263
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,126
Ms. Jeong's nursing home bills
must be steep.

264
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:50,888
Why are you staring at me?

265
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,891
Because I'm thankful.

266
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,563
Where's this coming from?

267
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,732
Why do you care so much for me?

268
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,734
It makes me feel bad.

269
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,824
Who says I care for you?

270
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,951
I just don't want to hear you whine
like a little mutt.

271
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,537
I don't know why I bothered with you.

272
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,541
My nose still aches every time
the seasons change because of you.

273
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,711
I should've just ignored you back then.

274
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,463
I don't know why I felt sorry for you.

275
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,591
-Hey, are you sick?
-Come here.

276
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,259
Hold on a second.

277
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,052
You little…

278
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,388
Give it back to me
before things get worse.

279
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,224
You're letting a sick bastard beat you up?

280
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,646
-Damn it.
-Give it back.

281
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:57,538
Hey!

282
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,133
Word has spread about him
being the best fighter in Insung.

283
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,801
So kids pick fights with him every day.

284
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,762
But I hear he's a good kid.

285
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,016
What good kid uses his fists?

286
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,894
My son is an only child
and never causes mischief.

287
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,355
I'm telling you,
he's the one who hit my kid.

288
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,814
Where's his guardian?

289
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,651
He doesn't have a father,
and his mother isn't answering.

290
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,569
I left a contact number though.

291
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,123
MEDICINE

292
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,584
CHOI SEONG-HUI

293
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,341
THE LATE CHOI SEONG-HUI
SON: YOON DONG-JU

294
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,055
Mom…

295
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,403
Well, this is a surprise.

296
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,071
I guess you didn't fight back today.

297
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,490
You're here way too often.

298
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,909
Let's see here.

299
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,039
Take them.

300
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,419
If you want to keep fighting,
put those to good use.

301
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,713
Don't get into fights on the streets.

302
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,059
What are you staring at?

303
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:50,318
The CAS has announced its decision
regarding boxer Yoon Dong-ju,

304
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,112
who faced losing his gold medal
due to doping allegations.

305
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,115
After a protracted two-year legal battle,

306
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,869
the CAS confirmed there was no evidence
of banned substance use by Yoon Dong-ju

307
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:03,622
and declared
his suspension from competition invalid.

308
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,375
Let's move on to soccer news.

309
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,430
2020 CAREER COMPETITIVE RECRUITMENT
MARTIAL ARTS ATHLETES (OFFICER)

310
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,017
COMPETITIONS ELIGIBLE FOR EVALUATION:
AQUATIC SPORTS, COMBAT SPORTS…

311
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,075
Thank you for always helping me…

312
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,870
when things were tough.

313
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,499
You'd actually listen to me
if you meant that.

314
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,461
Stop staring at me like that.
I know I'm handsome.

315
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,464
I'll arrange a meeting with my friend
for you soon, so be ready.

316
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,925
I can handle it on my own.

317
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,136
Nice and slow.

318
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,096
One.

319
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,973
Two. Take it slowly.

320
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,017
One.

321
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:09,146
Don't overdo it.
It's your first day of physical rehab.

322
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,192
This is harder than I thought.

323
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,652
Should we stop here for the day?

324
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,488
-Yes.
-Okay. Take a seat.

325
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:22,868
-Good work.
-Thank you.

326
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,640
KIM JONG-HYEON, RUPTURED LIGAMENT

327
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:48,519
Jong-hyeon.

328
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,646
Do you remember that day

329
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,315
when you met my mom
before the competition?

330
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:12,251
Oh, you're here early.
But why didn't you come with Jong-hyeon?

331
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,003
You called Jong-hyeon?

332
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,297
I told you we broke up.

333
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,383
You can always get back together.
Guys like him are hard to come by.

334
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,136
I'll take care of it.

335
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,682
Goodness, I don't know why
she didn't dress for the occasion.

336
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,559
Who's this?

337
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,894
Sit down.

338
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,646
-Shall I?
-Don't be shy.

339
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,066
He's the guy I mentioned before.

340
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,113
You look prettier in person than on TV.

341
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,365
I'm Richard Jung.

342
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:51,957
It's okay.

343
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,250
That's a nice tie clip.

344
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,919
It is, isn't it?

345
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,129
My darling said
it was an important day today

346
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,257
and gave it to me as a gift.

347
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,260
Actually, I bought that.

348
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,431
Thank you so much.

349
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:11,352
How did you find the time to buy it
with your busy training schedule?

350
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,354
When did you prepare this?

351
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:15,523
When I was 12.

352
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:17,983
I bought it

353
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,778
using the prize money I won
at the National Sports Festival.

354
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,072
It was my late father's birthday gift.

355
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:28,077
So don't thank me
because it's not yours.

356
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,748
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, my.

357
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:34,917
Honey?

358
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,546
I'm so sorry.
She's rather on edge these days.

359
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,595
I'm sorry.

360
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,278
Han-na.

361
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm so sorry.
She's rather on edge these days.

362
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,718
Are you okay?

363
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,428
Yeah.

364
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,977
You said you were okay.

365
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,521
That's why you lost that match, right?

366
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,116
Come in.

367
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,201
Are you ready?

368
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,870
Yes.

369
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,583
Is something wrong with his ankle?

370
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,128
Kim Jong-hyeon is having trouble
lunging forward today.

371
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,964
Why didn't you tell me?

372
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:07,051
I feel so bad. You should've told me.

373
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,720
You're right. I should've told you.

374
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,891
Would that have changed things between us?

375
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,356
I wanted to start over with you back then.

376
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,361
And I still want to

377
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,155
start over with you.

378
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,079
DUNG-JU

379
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,497
WARNING
DO NOT TOUCH, DOG WILL BITE

380
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,290
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

381
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,590
Why isn't she coming?

382
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,155
WARNING
DO NOT TOUCH, DOG WILL BITE

383
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,707
You should just leave the force.

384
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,835
Why can't you let go of being a cop?

385
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,777
DUNG-JU
HAN-NA, ARE YOU DONE?

386
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,195
And I still want to

387
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,905
start over with you.

388
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,827
But this is just how I feel.

389
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,414
I don't want to pressure you at all.

390
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:04,209
And I didn't lose the match
because of what happened that night.

391
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,796
So don't feel bad about it.

392
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,364
STEAMED BUN
I'M HOME NOW! DID YOU WAIT LONG?

393
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,714
INSUNG CLASSIC BULGOGI

394
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,676
-How about a speech, sir?
-What?

395
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,513
Me? No, it's okay.

396
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,139
Come on, sir.

397
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,641
Shall I then?

398
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:09,608
Mr. Min has been a dedicated member
of the Korea Customs Service,

399
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,695
so it's a shame to see him retire.

400
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,573
Thanks for all your hard work.

401
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:18,951
Same to you, sir.

402
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,912
-Right.
-I'll keep in touch.

403
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,375
What?

404
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,793
Oh, sounds good.

405
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,002
All right.

406
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,421
-Let's have a drink.
-Okay, sir.

407
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:32,631
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

408
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,885
Now that I think about it,

409
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,055
Mr. Min doesn't drink, smoke,
or have a girlfriend.

410
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,640
What's the fun in living then?

411
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,642
I'm just curious. Aren't you, sir?

412
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:44,893
What?

413
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,353
Right.

414
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,063
I wonder what he does for fun.

415
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,985
I have more fun than you think.

416
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,531
-Can I choose whatever I want?
-Of course.

417
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:00,409
-Okay, then.
-Go ahead.

418
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,328
What should I get?

419
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,297
Welcome.

420
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,381
Hello.

421
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,384
Looks like you're having fun.

422
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,441
You didn't call ahead of time.
What's going on?

423
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,401
Can I help you, ma'am?

424
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,485
It's okay.

425
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,864
Since when have we ever
called ahead of time?

426
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,282
I thought we were closer than that.

427
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,788
Are you going to leave him alone?

428
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,582
The cop, I mean.

429
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,627
A disobedient mutt
should be tied up nearby.

430
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,546
And as you said, he's cute.

431
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,340
Especially when he tries to fight back.

432
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,176
Did you come here to ask me that?

433
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,391
I did my part, so now you need to tell me.

434
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,686
Where's that bitch?

435
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,814
Why are you so impatient?

436
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,943
Do you even know where she is?

437
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,363
If I find out you lied to me,

438
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,865
you won't survive the repercussions.

439
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,079
Of course, I know where she is.
I wouldn't dare lie about that.

440
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,874
She's the only person…

441
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,544
who remembers who you are.

442
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,013
A little gift to motivate you.

443
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,061
You'll see her soon.

444
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,190
Once you finish producing
the last batch of Candy.

445
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,526
Go ahead and wait for me.

446
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,362
I promise to come and get you.

447
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,571
Okay, then.

448
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:06,660
Hold on to this hairpin for me
until I see you again, okay?

449
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,286
Promise me.

450
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,124
Okay, I promise.

451
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,668
I mean it.

452
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,273
JI HO-CHEOL

453
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,901
Gosh, it's so hot!

454
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,570
What's wrong with the weather?

455
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,904
Why are you so late?

456
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,032
There was way too much traffic.

457
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,241
Look at this.

458
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:50,370
I got these peaches from Jochiwon.
They're big and absolutely delicious.

459
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,247
These are hard to come by.

460
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,250
Look. It's as cute as a baby's bottom.

461
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,794
Take a whiff. It's so sweet that--

462
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:58,920
Forget it.

463
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,590
Why did you bring peaches?
Dad doesn't like them.

464
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,134
Who cares if your dad doesn't like them?

465
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,594
Why are you in your uniform?

466
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,721
Is there a special event today?

467
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,640
Mom.

468
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,894
You don't know what today is, do you?

469
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,646
Today? What do you mean?

470
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,069
What is it?

471
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,153
Goodness.

472
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,073
What is it?

473
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,241
Oh, dear.

474
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,660
Han-na, wait for me!

475
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:31,787
ANNIVERSARY OF DAD'S PASSING

THE LATE JI HO-CHEOL
WE LOVE YOU AND WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU

477
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,559
This is top-shelf.

478
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,771
Sorry. This is for someone else.

479
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,828
REQUESTED BY KIM SEOK-HYEON
RELATIONSHIP: OLDER BROTHER

480
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,461
You're all set for discharge.

481
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,967
Why are there so many forms to sign?

482
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,178
Family ties can be such a hassle.

483
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,056
I didn't ask you to come.

484
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,725
I'm not here
out of some brotherly love either.

485
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,479
The Prosecutors' Office has a ton of work
because of what your precious SCIT did.

486
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,565
And what if you'd gotten killed, huh?

487
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,443
You had us worried.

488
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,571
I mean, Father was worried.

489
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,368
I'm not a kid anymore,

490
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,328
but I'm still running his errands
at my ripe old age.

491
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,413
What a joke.

CORPORATE SHARE WAIVER AGREEMENT

493
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,427
Father says if you're going to
waste your life like this,

494
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,971
you should hand over your shares to me.

495
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,222
TRANSFEROR:
TRANSFEREE: KIM SEOK-HYEON

496
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,349
You know how he is
better than I do, right?

497
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,518
As if becoming a cop wasn't bad enough,
you had to get shot, huh?

498
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,353
He won't just stand by anymore.

499
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,482
Once you decide,
send it back through Secretary Kim.

500
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,407
Hey.

501
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,535
If you're going to hide,
stay well out of sight.

502
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,412
If you're going to fight, go all in.

503
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,332
Not that I care much,

504
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,250
but take care of yourself.

505

506
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,807
Hello, ma'am.

507
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,142
Welcome.

508
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,686
Welcome.

509
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,275
-Hello, ma'am.
-Welcome.

510
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,236
Hello, sir.

511
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,154
Welcome.

INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT
DEBIT CARD, MIN JU-YEONG

513
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,089
Thank you.

514
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,601
Thanks to you, I received severance pay.

515
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,728
So I opened a savings account.

516
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,106
You should buy me a meal
if you really are thankful.

517
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,317
Maybe I will.

518
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,361
What do you want to eat?

519
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,530
Unbelievable.

520
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,166
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

521
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,921
This is it?

522
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,716
I'm unemployed,
so I need to watch my spending.

523
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,427
Prices have gone up too much.

524
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,680
Look at you,
being so financially responsible.

525
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,640
Why not eat alone and save money then?

526
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,226
You don't seem to have friends either.

527
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,270
It's nice for loners to eat together.

528
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,207
Sorry.

529
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,209
This is for someone else.

530
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:53,798
Black Cat was a mafia organization

531
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,675
that operated in the Russian Far East.

532
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:59,804
There used to be a famous smuggler.
He went by Oh Dollar.

533
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,307
Where can I meet him?

534
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:03,808
He's dead.

535
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,727
It's been about 15 years.

536
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,854
Back in 2008,

537
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:10,732
a Russian mafia member
was shot dead in Insung.

538
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,536
Stop following us. It's embarrassing.

539
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:26,122
You can't hang out with us
until you ride a two-wheeler.

540
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,708
Go play with the little kids.

541
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:31,252
Those little brats.

542
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,322
What are you doing?

543
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,615
Are you playing detective?

544
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,617
Are you bored?

545
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,953
Is this what you've been doing
instead of working?

546
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:08,540
What now? Are you going up against
the Russian mafia this time?

547
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:10,500
I'm sorry.

548
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,628
Ranks and departments exist for a reason.

549
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,756
Carry out your assignment
of organizing the storage.

550
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,468
The fastest way to catch these criminals
is to focus on your job.

551
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,681
You should start with Section B.

552
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,643
Get moving,
or they'll be destroyed in a month.

553
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,561
Yes, ma'am.

554
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,730
Seriously.

Hello.

This is the Investigation Support Team
at Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

558
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,421
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:01,676

SMUGGLER OH BONG-CHAN MURDER CASE

561
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:10,560
His real name was Oh Bong-chan.

562
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:14,230
He made a ton of money by dealing dollars.

563
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,274
That's why they called him Oh Dollar.

00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,557
What is it?

571
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,351
Do you want to keep fighting?

572
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,521
Haven't you had enough?

573
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,272
You must be tougher than you look.

574
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:57,899
I'm used to slugfests

575
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,235
because I grew up taking beatings.

576
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,695
Eat up and get your head on straight.

577
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,407
I'm telling you this out of concern.

578
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:10,286
No matter how hard you try on your own,

579
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,414
nothing will change.

580
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,335
Do you still not understand

581
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,712
what drives people?

582
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:30,265
Welcome.

583
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,082
Haven't you had enough?

584
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:59,002
No matter how hard you try on your own,

585
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:00,545
nothing will change.

586
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,053
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

587
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:17,145
STEAMED BUN

588
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,661
Why aren't you riding your bicycle?

589
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:15,995
Is it broken?

590
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,831
The kids make fun of me.

591
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:20,917
They say I'm riding a bicycle for babies.

592
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:26,673
My dad was supposed to
take off the training wheels

593
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,469
and teach me how to ride without them.

594
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,861
Do you know what you're doing?

595
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,572
Of course I do.

596
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,409
Just wait. I'll get it done in no time.

597
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,079
-Mister.
-Yeah?

598
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,332
Have you stopped catching bad guys?

599
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:03,668
What?

600
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,044
Well…

601
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,215
Not exactly, but something came up.

602
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:13,136
Then what about the person
who hurt my dad?

603
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:20,560
What?

604
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:23,229
My grandma said

605
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,773
the man who confessed

606
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,025
wasn't the person who hurt my dad.

607
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,236
She said the real bad guy
hasn't been caught yet.

608
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,328
All done.

609
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,458
You want to give it a ride?

610
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,466
Are you sure I can ride this on my own?

611
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,052
Of course you can.

612
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,138
I learned on my own too.

613
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,558
-Why?
-I didn't have anyone to teach me.

614
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,187
I said get the hell up!

615
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,063
-Get up.
-Hey!

616
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:09,859
-You have a death wish?
-Don't hit your sick wife!

617
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,545
What if I fall?

618
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,924
If you fall, just grit your teeth
and get back up.

619
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:36,385
You can't achieve anything
if you don't face your fear.

620
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:44,560
I'll hold on from behind,
so don't be afraid.

621
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,145
You can do this.

622
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,731
And about the person who hurt your dad,

623
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:50,608
I'm going to catch them, no matter what.

624
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:51,734
I promise.

625
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,904
I'm a man of my word.

626
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,198
Look straight ahead.

627
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,033
I haven't let go.

628
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,577
Okay, keep going.

629
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:04,664
-Okay.
-You're doing well. I'm holding on to you.

Hello, sir.

637
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:46,474
What's this?

638
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,267
The thing is…

639
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:51,103
Some random guy came in and…

640
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,535
-What the hell?
-Hey!

641
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:07,828
Stop right there!

642
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,174
Get him!

643
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,236
Catch the bastard and kill him!

644
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:53,791
You bastard!

645
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,640
Hey, get up!

646
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,642
Come on, get him!

647
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,394
Get him!

648
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:39,420
Hey. Go, go.

649
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,838
Move it!

650
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,391
-Damn it!
-Stay down.

651
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,603
Wait, please stop!
Please don't do this to me!

652
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,525
Hey, you bastard!

653
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,069
Did Kim send you?

654
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:04,904
Or was it Oh?

655
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:08,074
You bastard, do you know
who owns this store?

656
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:09,450
Why are you doing this?

657
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,160
Just give me one name.

658
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:12,870
That's all I want.

659
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,163
Whose name?

660
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,623
Sir?

661
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,667
This here.

662
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:20,753
Who else has this?

663
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:26,675
Excuse me, can you help me get out?

664
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:28,177
Pull me out, please.

665
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,512
Thank you.

666
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:32,348
Thank you, sir.

667
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,475
-Let's cuff you now.
-Can this wait?

668
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,477
Businesses involved in illegal operations

669
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,855
have recently been hit with penalties,
including suspensions and closures.

670
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:42,817
All of these businesses were exposed
thanks to a tip from a citizen

671
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,987
who is believed to be the man
seen in the CCTV footage.

672
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,782
While the man's identity remains unknown

673
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:53,035
due to his face being covered by a hoodie,

674
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,247
his appearance closely matches
that of the person seen in CCTV footage…

675
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,540
That bastard!

676
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,792
…from other recently reported
illegal businesses.

677
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,377
I'm not talking about you, sir.

678
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,753
That little punk.

679
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,297
Why can't you let go of being a cop?

680
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,300
The only things I'm proud of in my life…

681
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,971
are my gold medal and being a cop.

682
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,723
I won't let anyone take them away from me.

683
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,227
Not until I catch that bastard.

684
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,314
I won't.

685
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,736
SIGNS POINT TO THE MAN
BEING A FORMER ATHLETE

CORPORATE SHARE WAIVER AGREEMENT

687
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:07,359
The fight is over
the moment you get scared.

688
00:58:07,443 --> 00:58:09,278
If you're going to hide,
stay well out of sight.

689
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,197
If you're going to fight, go all in.

690
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,166
The person you are calling
cannot be reached. You will be directed…

691
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,001
DUNG-JU

692
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:27,296
DUNG-JU

693
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,409
Between rounds…

694
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,997
there's a brief one-minute break.

695
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:04,917
That time

696
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:06,794
is not just for hydrating…

697
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,130
and wiping off sweat.

698
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,884
That's when you crouch down

699
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,303
to snatch a victory in the next round.

700
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:27,439
Let's go!

701
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,006
Damn.

702
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:54,091
This is a bit more than I thought.

703
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:57,553
What the hell?

704
00:59:58,554 --> 00:59:59,930
Who the hell are you?

705
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,865
The match is simply on pause.

706
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:19,825
Damn it, get him!

707
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,161
The next round…

708
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:24,371
will soon follow.

709
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,324
SPECIAL THANKS TO KO JUN AND LEE JI-HOON
FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCE

710
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,658
Hey, why do you keep avoiding me?

711
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,243
Do you have some time?

712
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,829
I need to show you something.

713
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:09,083
He hasn't come home for days.
What in the world is he doing out there?

714
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:14,922
Just how much money
does Min Ju-yeong have?

715
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,507
What if Drugmon finds out?

716
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,176
-Because of the person you're looking for?
-Yeah.

717
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,762
Nothing happened even when we had
officers getting stabbed and shot.

718
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,515
The higher-ups will just cover it all up!

719
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:28,477
He'll know
where Min Ju-yeong hid the money.

720
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,187
Hey, owner of 4889.

721
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,230
Have you eaten yet?

722
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:33,982
If not, should we eat together?

723
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:36,819
I have no choice but to avoid you.

724
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:45,077
