1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,149
What the hell?

4
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,817
It's that dumb bastard.

5
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,486
He's so damn annoying!

6
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,489
-Hey.
-The bastard has some skills.

7
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:41,852
Hey!

8
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,849
Seriously?

9
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:20,975
You're so damn annoying!

10
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,956
Once the spotlights go out,
we're forgotten.

11
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,419
But…

12
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,967
But remember…

13
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,013
that our hearts

14
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,098
continue to burn and scream…

15
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,439
as if they're ready to explode.

16
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,951
I wonder if I threw out my back.

17
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,827
-I feel fine.
-Stop lying.

18
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,208
-Hey, cuff all of them.
-Yes, sir.

19
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,709
Let's cuff them.

20
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,710
Dong-ju.

21
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:14,546
Yun Dong-ju!

22
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,298
Yun Dong-ju.

23
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,592
Yun Dong-ju.

24
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,096
Dong-ju? Yun Dong-ju!

25
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,180
Dong-ju!

26
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,683
That's Golden Bunny, right?

27
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,569
Get moving.

28
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,863
Hurry up and get going.

29
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,700
Sir.

30
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,665
You're so cool.

31
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,458
How did you take so many down?

32
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,343
-Hey, kid. Get a move on!
-Yes, sir.

33
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,846
Damn it.

34
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:12,771
Doping or not,
there's a reason why he won the gold, huh?

35
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,314
What are you on about?

36
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm going to
crush you to pieces, Dong-ju. Hey!

37
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,200
How am I supposed to
write up a report on this?

38
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,244
What did you use?

39
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,121
-Tell me what you used.
-A manhole cover, sir.

40
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,205
What?

41
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,750
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

42
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,710
It's a miracle that I'm still alive.

43
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,129
You should arrest him
for injuring me like this.

44
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,427
I'm Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

45
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,970
I need a car to head to a scene.

46
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,430
Sure, go ahead.

47
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,561
I can take that. I'll put it back.

48
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,108
LEE JIN-SU
KOREA CUSTOMS SERVICE

49
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,779
Han-na! Ji Han…

50
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,575
Are you okay?

51
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,922
Don't worry. I didn't kill him.

52
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,314
Let go of me!

53
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,277
Stop grabbing me.

54
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
-You already have me cuffed.
-Be quiet!

55
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,946
How did you get hurt
when you didn't even do anything?

56
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,657
What do you mean? I did plenty.

57
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,741
My back!

58
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,621
Take it easy for a while.
As for your nose…

59
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,291
The bridge of your nose got higher.

60
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,542
-Excuse me?
-Take a look.

61
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,130
Hey, it's true.

62
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,549
I can breathe better too.

63
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,885
-The swelling will go down soon.
-Okay.

64
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,768
-I can't believe it.
-When are they coming?

65
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,564
-When are they coming?
-How much longer?

66
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,483
They're here.

67
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,735
Over here, please.

68
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,529
Is it true that you took down
armed intruders with a gun?

69
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,072
-Yes, it's true.
-Sergeant Kim,

70
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,283
you've made quite an impact
since joining the agency--

71
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,452
He's always making impacts
and is always amazing.

72
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,538
Are you Shin Jae-hong, the discus thrower
who won the bronze back in 2012?

73
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,999
Yes, that's me. I won the bronze medal.

74
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,292
Hey, Dong-ju!

75
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,544
Yes, I'm Shin Jae-hong…

76
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,088
-Excuse me. Are you Officer Yun Dong-ju?
-Yes.

77
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,424
Is it true you took down
the entire Golden Bunny Gang alone?

78
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,885
What made you go against them alone?

79
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:34,723
Because I'm a police officer.
It's my job to catch bad guys.

80
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,225
How about a pose for a press photo?

81
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,769
There's definitely something different
about Korea's top 1%.

82
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,063
He was a national athlete for a reason.

83
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,773
I thought he was just a little turd.

84
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,525
Is he really the turd
that can help my career bloom?

85
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,908
-One more time!
-How about some shadowboxing?

86
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,373
Senior Officer Ji Han-na.
The weapon you used at home

87
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,874
-was a paintball gun, correct?
-Yes.

88
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,460
Are you talking about a manhole cover?
That heavy thing?

89
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,462
Yes, the round thing on the ground.

90
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,546
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir?

91
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,924
-Sergeant Kim is done, right?
-Yes, he is.

92
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,008
Can I have a word with you?

93
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,557
Sergeant Kim,
don't worry about Senior Officer Ji.

94
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,269
The local precinct
will be on 24-hour patrol duty.

95
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,355
Those Rat Snake gangsters are a menace.

96
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,649
They even put a hit on an officer.

97
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:30,487
But with skills like yours,
you should be in the Violent Crimes Unit.

98
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,406
This is a waste of national talent.

99
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,574
My current job is a better fit for me.

100
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,702
I see.

101
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,664
Anyway, things are taking a weird turn,
don't you think?

102
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,459
It's like Dung-ju said.
It's not a simple hit-and-run case.

103
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,837
Lee Jin-su reported
the Golden Bunny Gang's smuggling

104
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,255
and was killed in a hit-and-run.

105
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,966
Then some guys wielded knives at a cop
and all they stole

106
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,676
were those documents before running off.

107
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,721
What were those documents?
Does Senior Officer Ji know?

108
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,224
She saw some kind of design
but didn't read the content.

109
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,103
I think those documents caused this mess.

110
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,896
I wonder what's going on.

111
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,648
Those people don't seem to know anything.

112
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,234
I guess we'll find out
when we catch the ones who escaped.

113
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,988
Hold on. I'm getting a feeling.

114
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,781
If I'm lucky,

115
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,659
I might even fly first-class
instead of business.

116
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,041
Hey, wait up.

117
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,682
Are you still following me?

118
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,435
It's dangerous to be alone.

119
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,146
Your house must be a mess.
Let me help you.

120
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,731
You look more dangerous.

121
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,736
What do you mean? I'm not dangerous.
I'm a reassuring presence.

122
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,072
Cut the crap.

123
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,699
Cut the crap?

124
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,451
I'm acting out of pure concern--

125
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,036
Put that concern away. I don't want it.

126
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,663
Bury it deep in your heart,
or I'll bury you.

127
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,625
Steamed Bun.

128
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,709
What now?

129
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,132
Who's the punk causing trouble
in our neighborhood?

130
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,343
Why are you bothering our lady officer?

131
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,512
-Who are you?
-I'm a police officer.

132
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,639
Why is a police officer
harassing our young lady?

133
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,350
You'd better leave now.
I was chopping kimchi just now, you know.

134
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,644
Oh, I…

135
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,481
See you tomorrow.

136
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,274
Call me if you get scared.

137
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,527
My number is still the same. Bye!

138
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,619
YOUR INSTALLMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT
HAS MATURED

139
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,706
Why is he following you around
like a little mutt?

140
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,043
-Who is he?
-He's just a colleague.

141
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,087
Really? But what's going on?

142
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,505
Are you okay?

143
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,714
Yes, I'm fine.

144
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,218
Thank you and good night.

145
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,696
Hey, Gyeong-il.

146
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,448
Are you okay?

147
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,824
Do you want a piggyback ride?

148
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,951
I'm not a kid.

149
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,035
What's wrong?

150
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,954
Are you embarrassed?

151
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,080
Nobody's around.

152
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,207
Hop on. Hurry up.

153
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,292
Get out of my way.

154
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,752
Come on.

155
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,796
Wait up.

156
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,717
How have you been?

157
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,553
So inside that pitch-black factory,

158
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,513
paint exploded everywhere,

159
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,142
and I landed an uppercut
and sent Golden Bunny to the moon.

160
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,852
What an admirable deed.

161
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,146
You should still be careful though.

162
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,981
Don't get hurt in the process.

163
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,025
It's nothing. It's just a graze.

164
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,903
Goodness, I made soup
but forgot to bring it out.

165
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,821
It's okay.

166
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,080
CONTENT: MEDICAL PRODUCTS

167
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,340
Hey, why aren't you
using the thing I got you?

168
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,343
The treatment device.

169
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,970
Stop buying stuff like that.
It's not like it'll cure me.

170
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:26,598
It's really good though.
You haven't tried it, have you?

171
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,225
I'm telling you, you have to try it.

172
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,813
This is a domestic product. Made in Korea.

173
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,483
-This will relax your muscles--
-Just stop.

174
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,948
What was that, you brat?
You should be thankful.

175
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,157
Pick it up right now.

176
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,453
But I was in the middle of eating…

177
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,121
That's why…

178
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,332
I'll try it after dinner.

179
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,416
After dinner?

180
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,210
Okay, then. After dinner.

181
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,506
-Why did you throw it?
-I told you I didn't want it.

182
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,008
-I got it for you though.
-The rolled omelet is good, right?

183
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,803
-You didn't even open the box.
-Let's eat now.

184
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,972
-I was only thinking of you--
-That's enough!

185
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,808
-This is really good.
-It is.

186
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:10,934
You're joking, right?

187
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,018
-No.
-It's really good.

188
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,395
How is it, ma'am?

189
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,613
GYEONGIL NOODLES

190
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,034
Ma'am, are you sleeping?

191
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,582
PASSCODE: 0223
SAVINGS BANKBOOK

192
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,593
Gyeong-il.

193
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:46,970
Are you sleeping?

194
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,517
You sleeping?

195
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,483
-Didn't you hear me?
-What now? Cut it out.

196
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,612
What work are you doing for Jong-gu?

197
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,617
Hey.

198
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,753
Stay away from Oh Jong-gu
and be good to your mom.

199
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,338
I did some research

200
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,131
and they say surgery can help you.

201
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,343
So stop worrying your mom so much

202
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,261
and help her around here
until the surgery--

203
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,055
Stop pretending to be nice.

204
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,389
Who said I wanted surgery?

205
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,142
Just mind your own business, okay?

206
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,020
But the surgery will help you
and ease your mom's mind.

207
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,564
What about my mind?
I guess it'll put yours at ease.

208
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,942
You were born good,
so you be the good son.

209
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,361
It's too late for me.

210
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,113
Nobody is born good.

211
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,414
I'm just making an effort to be good…

212
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,751
so I don't regret it later.

213
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,297
I'm not interested,
so go ahead and put in a lot of effort

214
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,508
and get a Good Kid Award or something.

215
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:11,054
I'm trying to talk to you,
but you're not even facing me.

216
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,348
Stop, it tickles! Let go of me.

217
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,059
-Be quiet. Your mom's sleeping.
-Then stop bugging me.

218
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,603
What's that? Is it Jong-gu?

219
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,858
It's Jong-gu, isn't it?

220
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,654
Hey, where are you going?

221
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,907
Stay out of it. It's not a big deal.

222
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,118
Hey.

223
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,541
Damn it.

224
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,128
Where did he go?

225
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,926
The phone is turned off,
and you will be connected to voicemail.

226
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,720
Charges will apply after the beep.

227
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,514
THE RETURN OF KOREA'S HEROES
"NATIONAL TEAM" COPS TAKE DOWN CRIME RING

228
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,598
Sir.

229
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,227
Could you assign
the special recruits to me?

230
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:00,979
To do what, exactly?

231
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,815
I'll take away all the stress
you've been holding inside.

232
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,525
-How?
-How?

233
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,651
Allow me to tell you.

234
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,653
Sir, the national athletes…

235
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,196
-That was nice.
-Shall I say… Faster.

236
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,493
Further.

237
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,704
Stronger.

238
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,414
Finish.

239
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,126
Just like this.

240
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,421
That's the idea.

241
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,385
The return of the heroes. The Avengers.

242
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,262
Is that what you're going for?

243
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,347
Exactly, sir.

244
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,974
I'm Iron Man.

245
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,352
Right now, Insung City is getting overrun
by violent crimes.

246
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,479
-Let go of me!
-Hey!

247
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,814
Resisting arrest. Disorderly conduct.

248
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,942
Insulting police officers. Assault.

249
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,778
-Murder.
-Do you know who I am?

250
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,573
We will no longer tolerate actions
that mock the law

251
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,242
and undermine the authority
of the law enforcement.

252
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,496
I, Cho Pan-yeol,

253
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,540
will guarantee the safety of our citizens.

254
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,043
Faster!

255
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,587
Further!

256
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,839
Stronger!

257
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,426
In a strong response
to the rise of violent crimes,

258
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,387
Insung Metropolitan Police Agency's
Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol

259
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,057
announced the temporary launch
of the Special Criminal Investigation Team

260
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,184
and the introduction
of new tactical suppression gear…

261
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,478
SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

262
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,064
All right.

263
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,775
Let's get organized
and go have a team dinner!

264
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,152
Wait a second.

265
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,737
What could this be?

266
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:33,822
Oh, my.

267
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,909
The senior superintendent
gave us the company card.

268
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,329
All right, let's get moving.

269
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,292
SENIOR OFFICER JI HAN-NA

270
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,921
Goodness.

271
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,423
Dae-yong, do you guys want to join us?

272
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,425
We're having hanwoo tonight!

273
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,095
You go enjoy yourselves.
We have work to do.

274
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,179
Let's get back to work.

275
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,139
-Oh, well. That's a shame.
-Yes, sir.

276
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,975
We're having Grade-A hanwoo!

277
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,893
Number Nine, top-tier grade.

278
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,813
Number Nine, please don't leave me

279
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,858
-How many servings, Jae-hong?
-I'm a vegetarian.

280
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,526
Then I'll eat your share too!

281
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,163
What are you doing?
Why aren't you setting up?

282
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,249
I'm done. Do you need help?

283
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,209
CAFETERIA MENU: 3RD AND 4TH WEEKS OF MAY

284
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm fine.

285
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,720
-Why is this seat empty?
-What?

286
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,268
You're the key member of this team.

288
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,646
-Without you--
-I'll inform the commissioner myself.

289
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,275
And I'll continue to help you
with the Golden Bunny investigation.

290
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,113
Let's clear this out and spread out.

291
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,740
It'll just take up space otherwise.

292
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,200
Hey. Put that back.

293
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,912
Stop fooling around and get ready
to interrogate Golden Bunny.

294
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,830
He's out of the hospital.

295
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,918
Right, Golden Bunny.

296
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,419
-Captain, what about me?
-Yeah?

297
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,838
Right. Senior Officer Ji.

298
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,423
You can take the hit-and-run case.

299
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,592
-Analyze the case evidence!
-Yes, sir.

300
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,137
Senior Officer Shin, ask Insung Customs
to cooperate with the investigation!

301
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,972
-Yes, sir.
-Get going, Dong-ju!

302
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,518
EVIDENCE ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

303
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,647
Hello.

304
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,690
-You seem well.
-Do I?

305
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,238
You look better out of uniform.
Now you look like a proper detective.

306
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,743
LEE JIN-SU
KOREA CUSTOMS SERVICE

307
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,417
Can I return Mr. Lee Jin-su's
personal effects myself?

308
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,961
Sure.

309
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,921
You're the detective
in charge of his case after all.

310
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,385
-That is core act.
-What does that mean?

311
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,844
Oh, you said "That's correct."

312
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,932
Mr. Lee Sang-gon.

313
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,143
Do you remember

314
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,854
who you sold this car to?

315
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,025
Don't shake your head like a little kid.

316
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,485
Are you trying to act cute?

317
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,703
Where did you get this watch?

318
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,373
That bastard gave it to you, right?

319
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,874
What is it?

320
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,460
The hit-and-run driver
was wearing the same watch.

321
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,046
I have 20/20 vision. I know what I saw.

322
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,048
Where did you get this from?

323
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:44,929
I bat it.

324
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,264
-What?
-What?

325
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:47,849
I sat I bat it.

326
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,143
What are you saying, you damn bunny?

327
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,894
I should just punch you
straight to the moon.

328
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,232
I said I bought it with my own money.

329
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,692
-I see.
-You bought it?

330
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,153
-Yes.
-You bought this yourself?

331
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,071
-Yes.
-From where?

332
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,742
-Sirs.
-Hello.

333
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,661
-We'll be taking him.
-Where to?

334
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,415
Where are you taking him?

335
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,625
-What's going on?
-We're taking him.

336
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,669
Hey, that's my bunny!

337
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,047
Did he just smile?

338
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,256
Hey!

339
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,886
Take everything we need.

340
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,556
-Hey, grab all the investigation records!
-Yes, sir.

341
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,476
What are you doing?
You can't take our investigation records.

342
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,019
It's the commissioner's order.

343
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,814
He's assigning an important task
to the amazing SCIT,

344
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:39,400
so he told us to wrap up…

345
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,029
To wrap up this case.

346
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,280
Hold on. He said that?

347
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,490
Yes.

348
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,658
What important task?

349
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:51,412
The new, high-performance stab-proof vest

350
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:54,874
not only stops knives
but also stops bullets with ease.

351
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,292
The new gear you'll see today…

352
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,627
Are you the SCIT?

353
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,128
This is the demonstration outline.

354
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,297
Please review it.
Our staff will be right with you.

355
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,592
A demonstration?
We're supposed to do this?

356
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,095
What a large crowd.

357
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,056
NEW EQUIPMENT DEMONSTRATION

358
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,272
There you are.

359
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,316
Our stars are here now.

360
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,984
-Tell the director to get ready.
-Yes, sir.

361
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,197
Ms. Han-na, I'm counting on you today.

362
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,033
-You guys are up after Ms. Han-na.
-"Ms. Han-na"?

363
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,910
Go warm yourselves up over there.

364
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,497
Ms. Han-na, there are lots of reporters,

365
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,374
so get it right the first time.

366
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,168
You can't make mistakes like last time.

367
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,755
I'll demonstrate for you, Ms. Han-na.
Watch and copy what I do.

368
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,674
-Hurry up and get me a gun.
-"Ms. Han-na" again?

369
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,760
Watch carefully.

370
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,652
Am I seriously supposed to do that?

371
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,197
Is this what the SCIT does?
This isn't what I signed up for.

372
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,159
What do you think of
the Special Criminal Investigation Team?

373
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,660
Let's catch criminals at the scene.

374
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,579
Don't stay cooped up
in a dusty place like this.

375
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,705
Will I be issued a gun?

376
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,999
Of course. A super big one!

377
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,750
He said he'd give you a gun.

378
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,919
Man, it's super big.

379
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,007
So we're the Public Relations Team.

380
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,551
Now I get why Sergeant Kim didn't join.

381
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,720
I prefer it here over the field.

382
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,222
Sure, it's nice here.

383
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,808
You can even study for the promotion exam.

384
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,060
But what's more important
than a test score?

385
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,521
Your direct supervisor's evaluation score.

386
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,442
-Who am I?
-My direct supervisor?

387
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,195
Close the book.

388
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,324
What's the matter with you?

389
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,201
What do you think?

390
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,327
SCIT?

391
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,162
I'm not interested.

392
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,372
Ji Han-na is joining.

393
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,542
Really?

394
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,757
-One, two, three, four.
-Are you serious?

395
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,220
We were never the SCIT.

396
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,596
We were the PR Team.

397
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,944
What is this? What's going on?

398
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,946
This isn't what we discussed.

399
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,365
Don't get mad at me. Didn't you know?

400
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,658
Didn't know what?

401
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:37,286
Let's be real. Why would the commissioner
trust you and those guys to form the SCIT?

402
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,955
The agency's public image
has hit rock bottom.

403
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,624
His weapons program
is facing criticism from the city council.

404
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,502
He's using them
to revamp his public image.

405
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,296
What word comes before the SCIT?
"Temporary" SCIT.

406
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,589
This is just a show.

407
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,300
He's putting on an act
to set the stage for his mayoral bid.

408
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,223
Did you see that, Ms. Han-na?
Just do what I did.

409
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,182
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

410
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:01,060
Make sure to teach her
how to handle the gun.

411
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,562
-Hey, director! Let's hurry.
-You're saying my guys are just props.

412
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,231
You knew that and didn't tell me?

413
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,817
Who was the one who pushed for it
without consulting me?

414
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,443
That would be you.

415
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,987
That explains why he was all ears.

416
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,240
You can load a total of six rounds
in this shotgun.

417
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,701
-Load the rounds here--
-I know.

418
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,913
-Let's get this over with.
-Okay.

419
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,083
She's so cool.

420
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,294
She's cool.

421
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:38,764
What is she doing?

422
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,367
Hey, Ms. Han-na. Don't aim here.

423
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,786
You need to aim here!

424
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,079
A demo should pack a punch.

425
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,805
Paramedics!

426
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,018
Sir!

427
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:35,780
He'll be okay. He's wearing the new vest.

428
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,032
Excuse me. Coming through.

429
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,825
Thank you for your patience. Excuse me.

430
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,833
Take a deep breath, please.

431
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,878
Stop that, damn it.

432
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,755
I think he has a cracked rib.

433
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,924
He'll need an in-depth examination
at the hospital.

434
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,304
This cost a lot of money.

435
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,182
What kind of stab-proof vest
gets punctured so easily?

436
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,103
Launch a special investigation
against the company that made this

437
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,021
-and those assigned to the project.
-Yes, sir.

438
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,316
And fire Ji Han-na tomorrow.

439
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,652
I was too nice to her
and look what happened.

440
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,155
Why aren't you answering me?

441
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:19,824
Sir.

442
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:23,119
Public opinion will only get worse
if you discipline her right now.

443
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,996
This can actually be a good opportunity.

444
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,834
The reporters are still here.

445
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,336
It was a planned exercise

446
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,214
to test the new stab-proof vest.

447
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,092
Commissioner Cho
personally wore the new vest

448
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,136
and took on a rubber bullet head-on.

449
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,596
Where did she go? Why can't I reach her?

450
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,809
Even her letter of resignation is cool.

451
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,608
NO ENTRY
BIRD CONTROL IN PROGRESS

452
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,657
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

453
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,535
Is he really a cop?

454
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,412
He's been waiting for hours.

455
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,664
Maybe he's a stalker.

456
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,605
That won't do.

457
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,652
Hello? Thank you for your hard work.

458
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,618
How did you know?

459
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,205
I called the station,
and they said you retrieved your gun.

460
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,666
So I figured you might be here and came.

461
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,629
You seem too relaxed
for someone who attempted murder.

462
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:00,674
So? Are you here to arrest me?

463
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,594
That decision is on hold for now.

464
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:07,139
But you shot the commissioner,
so you'll receive disciplinary action.

465
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,351
They can do whatever.
It doesn't matter anymore.

466
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,981
Aren't you giving up too easily?

467
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,817
This was your dream.

468
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,362
It wasn't an easy decision.

469
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,031
Han-na.

470
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,242
We haven't caught the men
who entered your house.

471
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,703
You could still be in danger.
It's safer to be a cop than a civilian.

472
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,872
If you want to quit,
wait until the case is solved.

473
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,123
Thanks for your concern.

474
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,627
But I can take care of myself.

475
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,656
Han-na!

476
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,452
Where have you been?

477
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,998
You didn't even answer your phone.
Were you out shooting?

478
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,043
Have you eaten yet?

479
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,505
Just go. I'm not in the mood to talk.

480
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:23,966
If you haven't eaten yet, let's go eat.

481
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,266
Are you really going to quit?

482
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,561
You're not, right?

483
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,897
Technically, you did nothing wrong.
Why do you have to quit?

484
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,278
-Hey.
-What?

485
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,156
It's none of your business
whether I quit or not.

486
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,782
How is it not my business?

487
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,618
That's pretty mean,
considering our relationship.

488
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,077
What relationship?

489
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,458
I told you not to like me.

490
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:05,049
People can't shut off their feelings
whenever they want to.

491
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,592
And who knows?

492
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,012
Maybe you'll fall for my charms
and like me back.

493
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,765
-You think I'm easy?
-No, I think you're easy to like.

494
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,525
Just so you know…

495
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,945
there's no chance that I'll like you.

496
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,116
Why do you make it sound so final?

497
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,662
That hurts my feelings.

498
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:35,829
Should I say it again?

499
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,082
I don't like you.

500
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,333
I really don't.

501
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,097
That little mutt is back again!

502
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,363
Whose dog is this?

503
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,116
No idea. It's been around
these past few days.

504
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,534
Maybe it was abandoned.

505
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,787
What a cutie.

506
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,292
No chance?

507
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,669
You don't like me?

508
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,129
She's so mean

509
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,255
and still so pretty.

510
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,590
Be quiet!

511
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,978
-Search it.
-Yes, sir.

512
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,273
These items were seized after the takedown
of the so-called Golden Bunny Gang.

513
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,191
We'll take questions now.

514
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,961
The phone's ringing.

515
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,133
Insung Metropolitan Policy Agency's
Regional Investigation Unit--

516
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,468
Hello?

517
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:13,886
Where?

518
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,473
Okay.

519
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,683
We'll take care of it.
Don't call anywhere else.

520
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:21,935
What?

521
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:28,066
I'm Captain An Dae-yong
of the Regional Investigation Unit…

522
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,742
They spotted some guys trying to
stow away to China and chased them.

523
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,995
But some of them were the ones
who broke into Senior Officer Ji's house.

524
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,455
We have to catch them before the RIU does.

525
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,875
Let's show them what the SCIT can do
so that they'll stop looking down on us.

526
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,461
Can the three of us handle it though?

527
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,880
-Backup will be waiting for us there.
-Who?

528
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,089
Han-na?

529
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,258
-I'm so sick of this.
-Is it Han-na?

530
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,053
Hello? Is anyone home?

531
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,431
Who are you?

532
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,767
Oh, hello, ma'am.

533
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,728
I'm from the Insung Police Agency.
I came to deliver something.

534
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,772
You came because of the old lady's son.

535
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,816
Nobody's here.

536
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:12,444
The old lady left this morning
to find a burial site for her son.

537
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,029
I see. Thank you.

538
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,033
They haven't held a funeral yet.

539
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,244
I feel so bad for them.

540
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,874
PERSONAL EFFECTS
WALLET AND ID BELONGING TO LEE JIN-SU

541
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,463
Wait. Is that Kim Jong-hyeon?

542
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,346
Hey there.

543
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,976
Why is the Inspection Division
on the scene?

544
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,018
You seem pretty free.

545
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,729
That's no way
to talk to someone helping us!

546
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,692
According to the tip, eight people
are hiding in a building in the back.

547
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,988
It's the building in the back.

548
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,574
The patrol team
will be blocking the metal gate.

549
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,494
Senior Officer Shin and I will go left.
Captain, you can take Officer Yun--

550
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,788
Who do you think you are
planning a strategy?

551
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,415
Are you the boss?

552
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,499
Our captain--

553
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,378
The patrol team
can take care of the others.

554
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,338
-Let's get the two Korean Chinese guys.
-Okay.

555
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:15,007
-Which way do we go?
-That way.

556
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,783
What are you doing? Everyone's upstairs.

557
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,035
Where am I?

558
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,162
I see.

559
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,707
-Dong-ju!
-Be quiet.

560
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,544
Let's go to Jeju Island
and see canola flowers.

561
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,254
Canola flowers…

562
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,801
-Captain, are you okay?
-Mom said canola flowers…

563
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,720
Pull yourself together. What's going on?

564
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,013
I have to go to Gate Three.

565
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,181
Captain?

566
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,439
Is the evidence analysis complete?

567
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,774
This isn't just candy.

568
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,151
It's a type of hallucinogen.

569
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,278
And a highly refined form
of new narcotic at that.

570
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:19,947
Captain, get it together.

571
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,077
My team…

572
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,746
-Bibimbap…
-I said get it together!

573
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,207
Come on.

574
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,585
Captain.

575
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,587
Are you okay?

576
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,174
Man-sik.

577
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,721
Seriously?

578
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,433
Did you hear that? Is someone here?

579
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,435
-Damn it.
-Let's pack up.

580
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,563
Senior Officer Shin.

581
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,625
There you are.

582
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,414
They went that way!

583
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,541
Calm down and stay still!

584
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:55,834
Get back inside!

585
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,964
Hold on!

586
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,717
It's okay.

587
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,220
I said it's okay!

588
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:14,227
A-site!

589
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,937
A-site!

590
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,690
I dare you to jump, you piece of crap!

591
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,108
B-site!

592
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,991
Fire in the hole!

593
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,328
Captain!

594
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,754
Are you okay? Hang on tight!

595
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,590
Move!

596
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,855
Captain, wait a second.

597
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,107
Go downstairs!

598
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,068
Where are you right now?

599
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,446
We have the documents. Just help us.

600
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:08,865
Okay, I got it.

601
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,826
I'll be there.

602
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:29,636
Mr. Yang Chun-bae, you're under arrest
for unlawful entry and aggravated robbery.

603
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,142
Damn it!

604
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,977
Stop chasing me, you bastard!

605
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,395
I've got nothing to lose.

606
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,814
Come at me if you want to die!

607
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,257
What the hell?

608
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,637
That hurts.

609
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,604
-Captain!
-Captain!

610
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,106
Damn it.

611
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,941
You'll be okay.

612
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,611
Don't stand there. Call an ambulance!

613
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,155
Captain, are you okay?

614
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,282
Wee-woo wee-woo.

615
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,242
-Wee-woo wee-woo.
-Kim Jong-hyeon, get it together!

616
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,621
Why aren't we moving?

617
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,706
There's a major accident
on the bridge up ahead.

618
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,249
There'll be a one-hour delay.

619
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,502
-How is he?
-We administered first aid.

620
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,296
But we need to get to the hospital
to know more.

621
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,090
He's still bleeding,
and if any organs have been damaged,

622
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,383
he could be at serious risk.

623
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:51,760
No…

624
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,888
Emergency patient being transported.
Please make way.

625
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,898
-Are you awake, sir?
-Yes.

626
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,609
Luckily, there was no internal bleeding.
We just stitched you up.

627
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,694
I'm concerned about your jaw though.

628
00:42:10,362 --> 00:42:12,447
-You must've been beaten severely.
-I know.

629
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,409
How did I get here?

630
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,051
If you'd arrived any later,
the bleeding could've been fatal.

631
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,053
He saved your life.

632
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:41,226
I heard he ran over 30 minutes
while pushing you in a cart.

633
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,617
Excuse me!

634
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,578
I'm sorry! Please let me through!

635
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,455
I'm sorry! Coming through!

636
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,814
Hey, Jong…

637
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:28,898
I mean…

638
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,694
-The captain will be okay.
-That's good to hear.

639
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,198
You're injured.
Shouldn't you get that treated?

640
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,867
It's just a graze.

641
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,202
All right.

642
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,405
We didn't find the documents,
so this was all I could bring.

643
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,407
It was my mistake.

644
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,951
I apologize for taking so long
to bring them to you.

645
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:24,829
Thank you for at least bringing these.

646
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:32,170
Miss, are you a police officer?

647
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,049
Please find

648
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,676
and punish the person
who did this to my dad.

649
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,919
Mr. Oh, you've grown weak…

650
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,589
seeing how you can't handle
a simple task like this.

651
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,474
You were never like this back in the day
when you taught me the trade.

652
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:27,767
You've gone soft.

653
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,185
-Get me some water.
-Yes, sir.

654
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,245
Here you go, sir.

655
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,372
Here.

656
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,249
Bite down.

657
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,511
Bite down.

658
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,658
Don't overthink things.

659
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,786
It's not that complicated.

660
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:34,042
Fatal hit-and-runs carry
a minimum five-year prison sentence.

661
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,378
But if you settle,

662
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,090
you can get probation
of three years or less instead.

663
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:42,842
I'm sure Mr. Oh here

664
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,595
kindly explained it through the lawyer.

665
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,394
An arrangement has been made
to settle with the victim's mother.

666
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:04,197
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il.

667
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:10,453
You heard about
the Narcotics Control Act, right?

668
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:11,746
You already have a record.

669
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,332
If aggravated punishment is applied,

670
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,210
you're looking at
at least ten years to life imprisonment.

671
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,587
It's quite simple, right?

672
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,089
Will it be three years

673
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,007
or ten years?

674
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,094
Will it be ten years…

675
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,849
or three years?

676
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,312
If you understand…

677
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,108
nod your head.

678
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,161
Make sure he gets it
and send him off by tomorrow.

679
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,830
-I'll get the guys to--
-No.

680
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,207
Do it yourself, Mr. Oh.

681
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,503
-Without any loose ends.
-Yes, sir.

682
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,047
Without any loose ends.

683
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:18,980
THE RETURN OF KOREA'S HEROES

684
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,785
Mr. Min. It's me, Baek.

685
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,831
I caught the guys.
What should I do with them?

686
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,708
So, did you get all our stuff?

687
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,126
Just wait a bit.

688
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,921
-What's taking you so long?
-Yes, we have the documents.

689
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,299
-Let's go home now.
-Let's go.

690
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,593
Hey, get ready.
The boat will be here soon.

691
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,886
Yes, sir.

692
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:52,055
Got it.

693
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,851
Hey, where are you from?

694
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,978
-Yanbian, sir.
-Harbin, sir.

695
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:00,605
Yanbian?

696
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:03,316
Oh, dear. The boat fare will cost double.

697
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,569
That won't do.

698
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,117
-What are you doing?
-Keep still.

699
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:14,702
Boss?

700
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,204
-Boss!
-We did all you asked.

701
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,538
Please spare us!

702
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,290
Don't do this to your fellow countrymen!

703
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,505
Please don't kill me.

704
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:26,673
Stay still.

705
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,725
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

706
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,653
It'll finally be nice and bright now.

707
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,240
They said it'd take a month.
I guess they came early.

708
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,159
They must've been scared,
seeing how they came at night to fix it.

709
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:00,915
Remember the little mutt
that followed you around?

710
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,542
Dong-ju or Dung-ju
or whatever his name is.

711
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,754
He hounded the district office
so relentlessly that they came running.

712
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:09,507
When I made the report,
they just ignored me.

713
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,259
He must've been really persistent.

714
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:21,394
He even had all the security cameras
in the neighborhood fixed.

715
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,858
It's so dark
and the utility pole light is out.

716
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,569
I'm in front of Insung Supermarket.

717
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,154
I bet the security camera's out too.

718
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,198
It looks really old,
and the light is out too.

719
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:42,749
Good night.

720
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,884
Is this 9th Street?
The lights are out here too.

721
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:58,055
How can people walk up here
when it's so dark?

722
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,645
Yes. Numbers 13 and 15 are both dark.

723
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:11,319
All of the lights are out here
at Number 16.

724
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,743
The lights in front of Number 16
are completely out.

725
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,286
Please make sure to fix these.

726
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:39,764
Ma'am.

727
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:44,060
Please give this kid a vitamin drip.

728
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,270
Sure.

729
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:31,941
Why didn't you wake me up?

730
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,359
My stitches, you punk!

731
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,989
Isn't this too small a reward
for someone who saved your life?

732
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,824
Take them off then. Give them back.

733
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,450
You can't give something and take it back.

734
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:42,827
-Dung-ju!
-Hi.

735
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,537
-Captain, how are you feeling--
-That little brat.

736
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,664
Watch it!

737
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,040
What's the matter with you guys?

738
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,419
You've been discharged already?

739
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,670
I heard you got stabbed.

740
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,338
It wasn't a big deal.

741
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:57,133
It's normal to get stabbed
when you're on the job as a cop.

742
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,843
-Do you want to see?
-Yes, sir.

743
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:07,310
Jeez, you got stabbed
and got high all in one day.

744
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,228
-Lucky you, huh?
-It was candy.

745
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,856
Let's be respectful
and not answer other people's calls.

746
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:16,193
You weren't at your desk,
so I took the call instead!

747
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,033
Sir, here's what you asked for.

748
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,409
Right, thank you.

749
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:25,202
-I borrowed it from my brother.
-Thanks.

750
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,495
What's with the suit?

751
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,205
Going on a blind date?
Do you love someone else?

752
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:30,708
It's Mr. Lee Jin-su's funeral today.

753
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,921
Did you see the culprit?
He came to turn himself in.

754
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,339
The culprit?

755
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,341
Who turned themselves in?

756
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,092
The hit-and-run driver.

757
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,387
He just gave his statement
and will be sent to the prosecution.

758
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,281
Why are you here?

759
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,453
-What's this?
-Don't tell my mom.

760
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,831
-I'll take care of it.
-What are you talking about?

761
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,541
He has to go. You can talk later.

762
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:13,626
Wait a minute.

763
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,878
Why are you taking him?

764
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,214
Because he made a confession.

765
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,674
You're in the way. Who are you?

766
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,385
What do you mean he confessed?
He hasn't done anything wrong.

767
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:26,639
Hey, what kind of nonsense did you say?

768
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:27,765
Who did this to your face?

769
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,642
Excuse me, please let go of him.

770
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,978
You can get the details from his guardian.

771
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:33,896
-His guardian?
-Let's go.

772
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:40,569
COACH OH
I HAVE WORK FOR YOU, LET'S MEET

773
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,072
It's Jong-gu, isn't it?

774
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,074
Hey, where are you going?

775
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:46,993
Stay out of it. It's not a big deal.

776
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,789
We're almost done.

777
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:55,668
Please sign here, and we can wrap this up.

778
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,628
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM

779
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,090
Did Oh Jong-gu put you up to this?

780
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,592
I told you to stay away from him
because he'll screw up your life.

781
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,221
Why are you doing this?

782
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,889
You're not the culprit.

783
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,142
Hey, what's wrong with you?

784
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,398
Did Oh Jong-gu do this?

785
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,110
Tell me.

786
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,196
-Lee Gyeong-il!
-Stay out of it!

787
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,033
This is my business.

788
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:28,909
Let's go now.

789
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,382
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM

790
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:45,593
Thank you for persuading him
to turn himself in.

791
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,429
Since he's settled with the bereaved,
things will proceed accordingly.

792
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:51,265
You even got him a lawyer.
You've gone out of your way, sir.

793
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,851
He's my employee and a former student,
so I must look out for him.

794
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:54,935
Right.

795
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:57,897
What are you doing?

796
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,190
What the hell?

797
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:05,196
What kind of crap
are you pulling with Gyeong-il?

798
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,655
I warned you.

799
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,824
I told you to stay away from him.

800
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:10,576
What are you talking about?

801
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:13,829
He made a mess,
and I'm cleaning up after him.

802
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:14,914
That's bullshit.

803
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:17,541
What, are you going to hit me?

804
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,543
You ungrateful bastard.

805
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:22,546
After all my work training you,
you want to punch your mentor?

806
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,341
Mentor?

807
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,427
What could you have taught me?

808
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,346
You're nothing.

809
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,060
We're in a police station,
but I guess we can go a round.

810
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:39,772
-You still have a lot to learn.
-Fine with me.

811
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:41,398
Don't whine after I beat you to a pulp.

812
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:42,817
You arrogant punk.

813
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,033
Hey, Dong-ju!

814
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,577
Stop it!

815
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,872
Come here, you rude little bastard.

816
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,085
-That's enough.
-What are you people doing?

817
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,965
You're just… Damn it.

818
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,801
I'm sorry, sir. He's a good kid,
but he's weird in the morning.

819
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,970
Why did you stop me?

820
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,471
I was going to destroy him!

821
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:14,682
If I hadn't stopped you,
would you be standing here?

822
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,392
What were you thinking?

823
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,269
A middleweight
can't take on a heavyweight.

824
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,604
Do you think you have iron fists?

825
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,525
I had them give you a vitamin drip,
and you wasted it on this.

826
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:27,570
I'm heading out first.

827
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,502
Sir, are you okay?

828
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,383
Authorities plan to investigate

829
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,637
whether criminal charges may apply
to the post and its author.

830
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:56,265
The police also state
they will launch a formal investigation

831
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,684
if it is determined
that the case is criminal.

832
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,686
This is Lee Hwan-hui reporting for JTBN.

833
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,813
In the recent hit-and-run accident
on a local road

834
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:07,359
that resulted in the death of Mr. Lee,
Suspect A has been--

835
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,238
Oh, you startled me.

836
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,617
-I'll fix you a meal.
-No, it's okay.

837
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,453
Then why are you here? Aren't you on duty?

838
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,372
I was on my way somewhere and stopped by.

839
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,374
You're so silly.

840
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:28,214
Since you're here, can you call Gyeong-il?

841
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:29,882
He's not answering his phone.

842
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,634
I think he's mad because I scolded him.

843
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,887
Tell him to come home early.
I'm making beef bone soup.

844
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:36,388
You're welcome to join us.

845
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,601
What are you doing?

846
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:42,770
Give him a call.

847
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:44,563
Right.

848
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,024
Didn't he tell you?

849
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,195
He said he was going to Seoul for a bit.

850
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,614
-On a business trip.
-Seoul?

851
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,367
Yes, to Seoul.

852
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,750
Don't worry. It's only for a few days.

853
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:08,295
Why didn't he tell me he was going?

854
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,548
I can take my time with the soup then.

855
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,070
4-PART TRANSFORMING ROBOT
POWER KING

856
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,330
-Can you give this to the little boy?
-Sure.

857
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:14,403
THE LATE LEE JIN-SU

858
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:32,356
Are these all the people
who came to pay their respects?

859
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,359
Yes, I think they were his work colleagues

860
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:36,693
from the Korea Customs Service.

861
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:38,862
-The Korea Customs Service?
-Yes.

862
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,574
"Insung Customs."

863
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:46,412
I'm going to borrow this.

864
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,163
-What? Wait.
-I'll bring it right back!

865
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,665
INSUNG CUSTOMS

866
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,793
-Mr. Lee Myeong-sik?
-That's me. Who are you?

867
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,671
Hello. I'm a police officer.

868
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,215
Excuse me for just a moment.

869
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:02,636
Sit to the side
and turn your head slightly.

870
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,555
-Good.
-Okay.

871
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,266
Please hold up your arms
as if you're driving.

872
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,103
Stay right there. Just a second.

873
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,276
It's not you.

874
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,944
Yes, just like that.

875
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,738
Thank you. It's not you.

876
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:24,283
Can you hold up your arms
as if you're driving?

877
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,826
-That's enough!
-Look straight ahead.

878
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,286
Sorry. Just give me a second.

879
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,747
I'm leaving now.

880
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,542
Is there another department here?

881
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:53,896
Excuse me!

882
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,315
You said you were leaving.
What are you doing back here?

883
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,442
-You have to leave.
-Let me check something first.

884
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,986
No, you have to go.
We're getting complaint calls.

885
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,070
Give me a second.

886
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,108
It's you.

887
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,876
-Who are you?
-I think you know.

888
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,630
I told you before
that I was a police officer.

889
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:05,300
Officer Yun Dong-ju
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

890
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,515
Did you forget already?

891
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,059
I remember you

892
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,352
very clearly.

893
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,996
Officer Yun Dong-ju
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

894
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,208
You hit-and-run bastard.

895
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,561
I'm telling you it's the same bastard.

896
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:43,607
That little bastard took my car again.
Where does he keep going?

897
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:46,818
Let's look here. Just once.

898
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,488
Why do you ask about your father's case?

899
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:51,490
Where did you get this from?

900
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:55,243
The agency's information is leaking.
If we don't stop it…

901
01:05:55,911 --> 01:05:58,830
I don't believe everything Dong-ju says,
but it still has credibility.

902
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:00,957
Can you look into it, Sergeant Kim?

903
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,710
I need to take Mr. Lee Gyeong-il.

904
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:06,546
All you need to say
is that you didn't kill him.

905
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,383
Do you hate me that much?

906
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,843
Korea's Ji Han-na.

907
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:13,261
Don't give up. Final shot.

908
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,473
-Keep a cool head.
-And a passionate heart.

909
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,891
A passionate heart.

910
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:20,936
I put my trust in you…

911
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,897
and now you need to deliver on it.

912
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,734
I may not have raised him well,
but he's not a killer.

913
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:35,033
