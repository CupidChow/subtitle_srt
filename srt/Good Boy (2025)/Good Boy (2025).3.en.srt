1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,101
I'll take you through my day.

4
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,021
Health, beauty,

5
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,773
and Bellissimo.

6
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,859
Have a Bellissimo day.

7
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,612
WOMEN'S 50 M RIFLE 3 POSITIONS FINAL
JI HAN-NA COMPETING

8
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,363
We're coming to you live

9
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:14,366
at the Women's 50-meter Rifle
3 Positions Final.

10
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,038
Korea's Ji Han-na is entering the venue.

11
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,125
She has already taken the gold
in the 10-meter Air Rifle.

12
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,628
If she wins the gold in this event,

13
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,547
she'll become a double gold medalist
for the third consecutive competition.

14
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,133
-What an impressive record.
-Indeed it is.

15
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:35,471
Anticipation is high as we wait to see
if she will break a world record.

16
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,767
According to economic research analysis,

17
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,311
each shot fired by Ji Han-na

18
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,897
-is valued at over one billion won.
-My goodness.

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,774
She truly is a million-dollar baby.

20
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,734
-It's absolutely amazing.
-Yes.

21
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,820
-She'll take the gold for sure.
-Right.

22
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,197
The world record is just within reach.

23
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,995
Nicely done.

24
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,747
That was an excellent shot.

25
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,755
Good luck to Korea's Ji Han-na
with her last round.

26
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,217
Five.

27
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,094
Four.

28
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,263
Three.

29
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,412
It's you.

30
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,376
-Who are you?
-I think you know.

31
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,212
I told you before
that I was a police officer.

32
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,883
Officer Yoon Dong-ju
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

33
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,676
Officer Yoon Dong-ju
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

34
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:00,055
Did you forget already?

35
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,142
I remember you

36
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,019
very clearly.

37
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,106
You hit-and-run bastard.

38
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,954
It seems there's a misunderstanding.

39
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,832
This is my first time meeting you,
Detective.

40
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,502
Your first time?

41
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,756
MIN JU-YEONG
INSUNG CUSTOMS

42
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,342
Hey.

43
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,468
SURVEILLANCE DIVISION
CUSTOMS OFFICER MIN JU-YEONG

44
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,722
Take a look. Is it still your first time?

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,892
You did this to me. Look at it.

46
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,810
Look!

47
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,312
What's the matter with you?

48
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,191
Excuse me. What do you think you're doing?

49
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,401
-Let go of me.
-Seriously!

50
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:58,155
Hey, you'd better remember
exactly who I am.

51
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,782
-Just leave.
-Remember who I am.

52
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,909
-Let go of me!
-Be quiet and leave.

53
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,160
Remember me!

54
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,913
Do you hear me, you hit-and-run bastard?

55
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,458
He's quite a character.

56
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,878
Thank you.

57
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,381
So now what?
What did the commissioner say?

58
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,840
He made a fuss about your team.

59
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,009
He can't just dissolve the SCIT.

60
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,178
But he doesn't feel comfortable
parading you around either.

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,097
It's just a headache for him.

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,473
What about Ji Han-na?

63
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,477
Her status is on hold.
But if she quits, we can't stop her.

64
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,730
Don't process her resignation yet.

65
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,399
I'll talk to her in person today.

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,317
SEOBU STATION SENIOR INSPECTOR KANG

67
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,861
Hey, what's going on?

68
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,573
Yoon Dong-ju?

69
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,783
Hey.

70
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,537
You did this to me. Look at it. Look!

71
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,124
Excuse me. You can't do this.

72
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,084
-Get him out.
-Let go of me!

73
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,964
Why do you keep
taking your pants off everywhere?

74
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,719
Are you an exhibitionist?

75
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,928
Come here, you pervert.

76
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,556
That's not the issue right now.

77
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,350
I'm telling you it's the same bastard.

78
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,768
Here's the proof!

79
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,186
That's enough. Pull up your pants.

80
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,606
What proof? Will you send your butt
to the National Forensic Service?

81
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,693
That's a good idea.
Should I take a photo and send it?

82
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,903
A photo won't do. Let me rip it off you.

83
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,113
What do you think, Jae-hong?

84
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,656
I'm not sure.

85
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,492
He looks like an ordinary civil servant.

86
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,286
That's what I mean.

87
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,328
What do you mean?

88
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,998
A Grade 7 customs officer…

89
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,126
is linked to murder,

90
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,671
a gang boss, and knife-wielding
Korean Chinese thugs.

91
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,173
Isn't that strange?

92
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,759
You're the strange one here.

93
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,053
That's all conjecture.
You don't have any proof.

94
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,764
That's why we need to investigate!

95
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,017
Let's take a photo and send it to the NFS.

96
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,770
Jae-hong, take a photo
before the evidence fades away.

97
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,773
Take a photo and then a recording.

98
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,857
Do you see it?

99
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,151
There were two or three lines.
Or was it one?

100
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,653
-It's not very clear.
-Look closely up top.

101
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,239
-That's gross. Do it somewhere else.
-It's not gross.

102
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,579
Hey.

103
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,419
What brings you here, Sergeant Kim?

104
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,547
How's your injury? I've been worried.

105
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,216
Can't you see that he's fine?

106
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,180
The doctor said I was fine,

107
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,681
but I don't feel great.

108
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,810
I'm just glad you didn't get hurt.

109
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,606
Not that I want to
make a big deal out of it,

110
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,443
but the fact remains
that I saved your life.

111
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,946
And I'm grateful for that.

112
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,323
That's enough. Come here.

113
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,327
Goodness, look at this.

114
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,954
This desk was made for him.

115
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,289
You're just the right addition
to complete the SCIT.

116
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,876
How about you join our team

117
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,045
as a way of repaying me?

118
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,463
Well, Captain--

119
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,300
Why don't we have a welcome party
since we're having a team dinner?

120
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,302
-We'll do both at the same time.
-Captain--

121
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,681
Sergeant Kim, what do you like? Beef?

122
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,015
I'm against it.

123
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,604
-You eat whatever I buy, you punk.
-No.

124
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,984
Who says he can join our team?

125
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,029
Even if you're the captain,
you can't make decisions like this alone.

126
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,241
Every team member should have a say in it.

127
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,994
I'm against it. You too, right, Jae-hong?

128
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,662
I don't mind.

129
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,038
What?

130
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,500
Fine.

131
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,712
Han-na and I are against it,
so that's two to one.

132
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,674
How do you know what Han-na thinks?

133
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,551
Of course I know what she thinks.

134
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,387
He says he doesn't want to join.

135
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,055
Stop begging. It makes you look desperate.

136
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,142
What if I want to join?

137
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,270
What? Seriously?

138
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,647
You can do whatever you want.

139
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,275
Why does he get to do whatever he wants?

140
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,526
Because he's Sergeant Kim.

141
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,238
Let's be real. He's not helpful at all.

142
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,032
He only knows how to play swords like kids

143
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,784
and freezes up
when it comes to the real thing.

144
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,875
Do you want to check for yourself…

145
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,630
if I really freeze up or not?

146
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:27,841
I'm in.

147
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,176
-Where?
-Here.

148
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,011
-When?
-Now.

149
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,515
You can't beat me with punches like that.

150
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,643
I have 180-degree peripheral vision.

151
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,561
I know where every punch is coming--

152
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,399
-We have to see this.
-Shouldn't we stop them?

153
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,400
Let go of me.

154
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,780
TRAINING ROOM

155
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,492
So? Ready to get serious now?

156
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,453
Perfect. I was in a crappy mood anyway.

157
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,412
Let's get serious.

158
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,998
If you win, you can join
or do whatever you want.

159
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,917
That's up to me.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,919
But if I win, stop speaking informally.

161
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,546
Say that after you win.

162
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,134
You don't get to see
a big match like this every day.

163
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,594
It's Dung-ju versus Jong-hyeon.

164
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,054
Which side will win?

165
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,222
Regardless of your division,

166
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,849
I'll pay for the team dinner tonight,
so place your bets!

167
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,227
I bet on Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

168
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,063
He only got one scratch on his face
when he took down that gang.

169
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,731
My money's on Sergeant Kim, five to one.

170
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,651
Come on. It's like Officer Yoon said.

171
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,653
Boxing is the way to go
in a weaponless fight.

172
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,489
He's the Asia boxing champion
and won a gold medal.

173
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,741
-Right. We saw what happened.
-Exactly.

174
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,576
-You're right, we saw it.
-Yeah, we did.

175
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,079
-I saw it too.
-We all did.

176
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,124
I bet on Sergeant Kim.

177
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,834
What about you, Captain?

178
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,794
Is it Kim Jong-hyeon or Yoon Dong-ju?

179
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,297
Me?

180
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,008
Isn't it obvious?

181
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,926
I choose this side.

182
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,474
Did that hurt?

183
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,600
But I barely moved.

184
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,106
-I'm fine.
-That's good to hear.

185
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,780
Look at you.

186
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,365
You know how to move.

187
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,714
Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

188
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,175
He was a reserve member of the
national taekwondo team in high school.

189
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,721
-Dong-ju, are you okay?
-What the…

190
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,514
-What the heck?
-What happened?

191
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,600
Darn it, I shouldn't have switched.

192
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,393
-Did he lose?
-Damn it!

193
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,164
That was so unfair.

194
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,583
He should've mentioned
that he did taekwondo.

195
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
That sneaky jerk.

196
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,087
You said you'd buy beef, not gopchang.

197
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,964
This is expensive, you punk!

198
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,341
It is?

199
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,345
It's good.

200
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,057
Hey, stop eating gopchang and daechang.

201
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,019
Eat yeomtong, the beef heart, instead.
Look at you. You're all flabby.

202
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,189
No wonder
none of your punches landed right.

203
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,487
By the way,

204
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,281
does that still happen

205
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,076
because of the accident?

206
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,998
Just ride it out!

207
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,959
-That's it!
-Keep going!

208
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,349
INSUNG CITY
YOON DONG-JU

209
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,730
A straight right to the face.

210
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,232
It's your signature punch.

211
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,734
You had a chance to end it,
so why did you hold back?

212
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,612
You could've won with one of those.

213
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,448
Even I can do it.

214
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,245
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,456
Stop talking and eat.

216
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,173
Do you want to know the secret tactic
for beating Sergeant Kim?

217
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,428
Take it back.

218
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,180
Don't make a rash decision.

219
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,098
The higher-ups will give you some time,

220
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,476
so take a moment to think it through.

221
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,935
There's no rush.

222
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,521
No, I've already made up my mind.

223
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,024
I appreciate your concern.

224
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,570
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

225
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,368
Senior Officer Ji.

226
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,788
Did you talk to the captain?

227
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,083
-Yes.
-I guess you made your decision.

228
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,294
-Yes.
-That's a shame.

229
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,962
What about the team dinner?

230
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,756
I don't think I should go.

231
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,716
What about you?

232
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,260
I'm going home.
My second-eldest suddenly has a fever.

233
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,432
I guess it's just the captain
and Dung-ju then.

234
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,314
If you don't have any plans,
how about you go cheer him up?

235
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,779
As you know, he's a very proud type.

236
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,991
He probably took it hard because he lost
in front of the person he likes.

237
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,660
He's a simple guy,

238
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,372
so I thought he might cheer up
if he saw you.

239
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,290
No pressure though.

240
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,626
You don't need to go
if you have some family event

241
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,461
or if your parents need a caretaker.

242
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,338
But consider going if neither is the case.

243
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,633
Imagine how happy Dung-ju will be
if he sees you.

244
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,094
I mean, just imagine it.

245
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,346
He'll be over the moon about it.

246
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,057
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if you didn't have any plans?

247
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,651
GOPCHANG RESTAURANT
THE VALLEY

248
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,200
One, two, then to the right!

249
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,786
Why won't you budge?

250
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,538
Why can't I flip you over?

251
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,999
This is the weak spot! Right here!

252
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,501
What kind of secret tactic is this?

253
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,004
I said this is the weak spot!

254
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,131
I'm flipping you over!

255
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,508
Hi there.

256
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,302
-Han-na!
-Han-na!

257
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,429
Cheer him up, my ass. He's perfectly fine.

258
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,014
Wait, don't go!

259
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,184
Are you Popeye the Sailor?

260
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,437
How do you maintain this physique
living off rabbit food?

261
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,521
I'm amazed.

262
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,523
And you don't drink, right?

263
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,109
-Right. Would you like some?
-Oh, jeez, no thanks.

264
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,737
Can you survive on just that?

265
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,864
This is the best way to lose weight.

266
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,619
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

267
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,874
Did you get a search warrant
for the hit-and-run bastard?

268
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,834
Warrant, my ass.

269
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,544
Warrants don't appear out of thin air.

270
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,296
You didn't even request one, did you?

271
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,839
I should've known.

272
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,299
I'll do it myself.

273
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,134
Don't do anything stupid. Just stay put.

274
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,510
I'll look into it.

275
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,221
I can't just stay put.
The police are funded by taxpayers.

276
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,015
-We have to work.
-You brat!

277
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,603
The driver behind the fatal hit-and-run
of a customs officer

278
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,732
has been identified as Mr. Lee Gyeong-il,
a former boxing prospect.

279
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,276
Police suspect that Mr. Lee,
who turned himself in,

280
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,487
may have been on drugs
at the time of the accident…

281
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,829
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,750
I wanted to get more details
before telling you.

283
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,421
It's okay.
It's fine as long as he didn't do it.

284
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,090
Don't worry.

285
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,883
Of course.

286
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,219
I'm sure you'll take care of things.

287
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,804
I'm not worried.

288
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,724
I may not have raised him well,

289
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,519
but he's not a killer.

290
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,603
I'm sure of it.

291
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,856
If he's innocent, he'll be released.

292
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,367
Are you going to the temple?

293
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,787
Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well
these past few days.

294
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,041
This is your favorite,
stir-fried dried squid.

295
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,475
I may not have raised him well,

296
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,436
but he's not a killer.

297
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,110
It wasn't imported
through normal channels,

298
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,570
and the plate number wasn't registered.

299
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,364
It's too hard to track it down.

300
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,330
INSUNG CITY JUNKYARD

301
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,376
I'm borrowing these.

302
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,838
Hey, where are you going?

303
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,673
Yoon Dong-ju!

304
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,269
Have you seen this car here?

305
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,437
That's not a common model.

306
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,024
Good day, sir.

307
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,442
Have you seen this car?

308
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,903
I said there was no car like this here.

309
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,071
Right, let me just check again.

310
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,866
-We never got a car like that.
-Oh, wait.

311
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,202
Never mind.

312
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,167
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

313
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,128
I don't believe everything Dong-ju says,
but it still has credibility.

314
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,005
Things are taking a strange turn too.

315
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,007
Can you look into it, Sergeant Kim?

316
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,760
I'd like to examine Lee Gyeong-il's case,

317
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,180
but my team isn't in a position
to do so right now.

318
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,642
I already asked the prosecution
for an interview with Mr. Lee.

319
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,144
We may need him as a reference
for an internal investigation.

320
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,437
Of course you did.

321
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:28,775
By the way, I heard the new prosecutor
who took over is rather difficult.

322
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,401
There's a new prosecutor in charge?

323
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,196
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il, do you acknowledge
everything in your statement?

324
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,743
It's Prosecutor Kim Seok-hyeon
of the Criminal Department.

325
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,328
PROSECUTOR KIM SEOK-HYEON

326
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,996
-Hey.
-Yes?

327
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,706
Stop wasting my time and answer me.

328
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,333
I'm busy as hell.

329
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,668
Is this statement correct?

330
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,796
-Yes.
-What?

331
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,842
Yes, I did it.

332
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,178
All right, then.

333
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,848
You can take him away now.

334
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,058
Let's go.

335
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,786
Why did the departmental chief assign
such a worthless case to me?

336
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,958
Sir, the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency
requested an interview with Mr. Lee.

337
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,293
What for?

338
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,963
The Office of Audits and Inspections
asked for it but didn't specify why.

339
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,591
Office of Audits and Inspections? Who?

340
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,094
Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon
of the Inspection Division.

341
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,095
Who?

342
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,681
Who? Kim Seok-hyeon?

343
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,683
Why? Do you know him?

344
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,102
Yes.

345
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,564
Tell him to come here

346
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,983
and report to me directly.

347
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,280
OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS

348
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,781
This is Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

349
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,702
Very well.

350
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,621
I'll be there at 3 p.m.

351
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,205
INSUNG DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

352
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,044
-Hello.
-Hey, Gwang-seok.

353
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,546
I'm glad you called. Yeah.

354
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,881
Next week?

355
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,634
Next week sounds great. Why?

356
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,219
Sir, Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon is here.

357
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,473
Yeah.

358
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,975
Sure, let's have a get-together
among the younger crowd

359
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,102
without the older folks.

360
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,856
I'll call Yong-hui. All right.

361
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,281
Hey, Yong-hui. Are you busy?

362
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,408
Yeah, next week.

363
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,870
Gwang-seok and Yong-hui
are really excited.

364
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,414
Okay, see you next week.

365
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,708
Yeah, let's talk more next week.

366
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,627
All right. Bye.

367
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,517
What's with the bow?

368
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,018
It's been a while.

369
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,063
You came empty-handed?
But it's my birthday next week.

370
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,524
We're not on such great terms
to exchange birthday gifts.

371
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,529
I was just hoping you matured a bit.

372
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,325
I need to take Mr. Lee Gyeong-il.

373
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,078
I can't disclose the reason
because an investigation is underway.

374
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,749
I'm afraid you can't.

375
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,545
Then why did you have me come?

376
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,338
I just wanted to see you.

377
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,675
Hey, you knew
I was the prosecutor in charge.

378
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,593
Did you really think
I'd agree to the request?

379
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,015
Man, I guess I forgot because we haven't
seen each other in a while.

380
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:48,766
You've always been a jerk.

381
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,935
That's no way to talk
to your older brother.

382
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:54,647
This is why people think
we're half-brothers.

383
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,357
Aren't you too old to be rebelling?

384
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,069
Is it fun playing a cop?

385
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,779
Do you think I do this for fun?

386
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,323
All right, all right.
Don't get so serious.

387
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,617
I was only hoping
you were having fun at the job.

388
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,369
That way, you won't run away again.

389
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,371
What?

390
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:13,750
Running away has been your specialty
since you were a kid.

391
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,878
You couldn't beat me academically
or in taekwondo.

392
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,671
That's why you took up fencing.

393
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:22,008
You ended up not winning the gold
and ran away from that too.

394
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,843
So stop wasting your time

395
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,595
and go work under Father.

396
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,556
What's the matter? Too embarrassed?

397
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,433
Want me to talk to him?

398
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,104
Hey, eat before you go.

399
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,408
Mr. Jang.

400
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,535
Please look into what he's up to.

401
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,379
Running away has been your specialty
since you were a kid.

402
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,466
Seok-hyeon, not only did you rank first
in every subject,

403
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,469
but there's a huge margin
between you and the second-place student.

404
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,679
Dad, please buy me the present
you promised.

405
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:09,680
RANK/TOTAL ENROLLED STUDENTS: 2/483

406
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,350
KIM SEOK-HYEON

407
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,104
KIM JONG-HYEON

408
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,870
Is that what you're going to say
to your mom?

409
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,874
What did you tell my mom?

410
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,501
Are you actually worried?

411
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,087
Explain to her in person
what's going on right now.

412
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,719
All you need to say
is that you didn't kill him.

413
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,724
Then I'll get you out of here,
no matter what.

414
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:02,900
Gyeong-il.

415
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,665
I'd like to go back now.

416
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,974
Excuse me.

417
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,813
When can I see my lawyer?

418
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,620
GOLDENGATE SELF-SERVICE GAS STATION

419
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,842
Please select the service…

420
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,719
He came for a visitation?

421
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,096
Yes, but they didn't
discuss anything specific.

422
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,016
How's Mr. Lee Gyeong-il doing?

423
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,144
He seems a bit nervous,

424
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,522
but all first-time detainees
are like that.

425
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,408
They're all like that, huh?

426
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,420
Even so,

427
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,508
wouldn't it be better
to eliminate any risks?

428
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,511
Excuse me?

429
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,112
The watch suits you.

430
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,867
Thank you, sir.

431
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,294
CHEONUL JUNKYARD

432
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,175
Holy crap!

433
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,385
You little punk!

434
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,680
Move over before I stomp on you.

435
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,265
-You scared me.
-Hey.

436
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,434
Didn't I tell you
to bring the car back by morning?

437
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,477
Did I or did I not, you punk?

438
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,688
I just wanted to check out
a few more places.

439
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,690
How much have you been driving around?

440
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,108
I filled up the tank two days…

441
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,279
You little bastard, I ought to just…

442
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:56,824
Jeez, you're such a pill.

443
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,367
Wait, where are we going?

444
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,869
Let go.

445
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,249
I said I needed the car
to get there by 10 a.m.

446
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,709
There's still time left.

447
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,169
They open at nine. Let's go after.

448
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,920
No, wait a minute.

449
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,256
Let's look here. Just once.

450
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,883
Please.

451
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,052
Get off me!

452
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,851
I bet you were up to no good.
You went clubbing, didn't you?

453
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,689
9. CHEONUL JUNKYARD, 10. NAMHAE JUNKYARD,
11. JUNGBU INSUNG JUNKYARD…

454
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,992
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

455
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,161
Sergeant Kim, what's going on?

456
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,874
What?

457
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:02,431
I'M SORRY
I DEEPLY APOLOGIZE

458
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,196
-You can't go in.
-Excuse me.

459
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,280
Hey!

460
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,744
-Let go.
-What's going on?

461
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,288
You can't go in.

462
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,043
Damn it, this is such a headache.

463
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,730
Yes, sir.

464
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,733
I'll be there shortly. Yes, sir.

465
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,594
…investigations are underway
on the smuggling routes…

466
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,845
Would you like some help?

467
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,056
It's okay. I don't have many belongings.

468
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,141
I can tell.

469
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,479
Former pro boxer, Mr. Lee Gyeong-il,
who was arrested on hit-and-run charges,

470
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,689
left a suicide note of apology

471
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,608
and took his own life
in the detention center.

472
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:38,194
Mr. Lee was an up-and-coming boxer

473
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,572
whose victory in the
2013 junior national team trials

474
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,907
made him a rising star…

475
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,137
I thought it'd be best
if you delivered this.

476
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,348
THE LATE LEE GYEONG-IL
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

477
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,808
If you'd rather not, I could…

478
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,020
Why is this here?

479
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,902
Why is this here?

480
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,487
It's Lee Gyeong-il's personal effect.

481
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,199
He wasn't allowed to have that on him,
but I guess he did.

482
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,784
This doesn't belong to Gyeong-il.

483
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,454
Take a good look at the watch.

484
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,666
It's the same model as the one
Golden Bunny and that bastard wore.

485
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:19,378
It belongs…

486
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:22,756
to Gyeong-il's killer.

487
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:30,180
If we send this to the NFS
and check for fingerprints and DNA--

488
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:31,181
It's over.

489
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,602
What do you mean it's over?

490
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,397
Something will come up if they run a test.

491
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,901
The prosecutor ruled the case as a suicide
and already closed it.

492
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:43,986
What kind of bull…

493
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,863
What kind of bullshit is that?

494
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,827
Gyeong-il died only a few hours ago.

495
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,464
Okay. I'll look into it.

496
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,718
Hey! There's no use taking that!

497
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,886
Yoon Dong-ju!

498
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,694
Hey.

499
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,754
You had him killed, didn't you?

500
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,674
What are you here to say this time?

501
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,258
-Mr. Lee Jin-su--
-Lee Gyeong-il.

502
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:53,889
You don't know him?

503
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:55,683
Lee Gyeong-il?

504
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,977
Who's that?

505
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:01,438
Don't act like you don't know.

506
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,440
You had him killed.

507
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:14,410
Was that a smile?

508
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:18,997
-What the…
-Damn it.

509
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,791
-Go help him.
-Hold on a second.

510
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,917
We have a situation here.

511
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,086
Get up.

512
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,426
Get up.

513
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:54,867
Captain, what was that watch about?

514
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,493
That watch

515
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,912
was the same model as Golden Bunny's.

516
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,207
And I'm not sure about this,
but Dong-ju claims

517
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:05,711
Lee Jin-su's hit-and-run driver
also had the same watch.

518
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,773
POLICE ID: JI HO-CHEOL
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

519
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,911
In his statement, Mr. Min Ju-yeong said
there was no prior agreement

520
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,038
to meet with you, Mr. Yoon Dong-ju.

521
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,332
According to Mr. Min Ju-yeong…

522
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,374
You're here.

523
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,251
What happened?
What about the one who got hit?

524
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,879
The inside of his mouth got busted,
so he had to get stitches.

525
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,589
Is that correct?

526
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,510
Mr. Yoon, if you don't respond,
I'll consider it an admission.

527
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,266
Why do you ask about your father's case?

528
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,811
I just got curious.

529
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,314
I'm not sure
if we still have any records of his case.

530
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,107
By the way,

531
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,610
have you seen this before?

532
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,903
I think it was my father's.

533
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,659
Did he wear something like this?

534
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:21,537
They don't import it into the country.

535
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:27,334
I know someone
who specializes in such things.

536
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,586
He runs a pawnshop.

537
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,714
Let me get you his number.

538
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,095
It's Ji Ho-cheol.

539
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:42,850
Can I get a copy of the death certificate
submitted with the insurance claim?

540
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:46,728
I see.

541
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:48,605
Yes, I understand.

542
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,862
You got a three-month pay reduction
but avoided suspension.

543
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,154
Luckily, he won't file a suit.

544
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:58,532
In exchange,

545
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,325
start writing.

546
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,827
Write what?

547
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,497
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT

548
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,378
Copy the whole book as an act of remorse.

549
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,338
That's Min Ju-yeong's condition
for not filing a suit.

550
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,674
I'm not doing it.

551
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,800
Why should I?

552
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,886
Would you rather get sued
and leave the force?

553
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,013
Tell him to go ahead and sue me!

554
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,431
I'm not afraid.

555
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,976
Jeez, that punk.

556
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,228
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju!

557
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:34,318
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

558
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,612
My mother loved gold watches like this.

559
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,906
I should've been a better son to her.

560
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:39,990
MOM

561
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,491
But what's the use of regret now?

562
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,206
Where did you get this from?

563
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:53,003
-Why do you ask?
-You see, this isn't an ordinary watch.

564
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,421
This is made by a Swiss craftsman

565
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:58,175
by the name of
Christian D'artisan Diar Watch,

566
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,092
believe it or not.

567
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,929
He only makes 12 of these a year.

568
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:05,432
The last time I saw one of these in Korea
was back in 2003.

569
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,767
Did you say 2003?

570
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,603
A few appeared on the market
in Insung back then.

571
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,022
There used to be a famous smuggler.

572
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,106
He went by Oh Dollar.

573
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,317
"Oh Dollar"?

574
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,235
His real name was Oh Bong-chan.

575
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:20,697
He made a ton of money by dealing dollars.

576
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:23,325
That's why they called him Oh Dollar.

577
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,453
All smuggled goods in Insung
went through him.

578
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,789
Where can I meet him?

579
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,040
He's dead.

580
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,167
It's been about 15 years.

581
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,628
This feels one gram heavier
than it should.

582
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,964
I wonder if it's real or fake.

583
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,429
What's that?

584
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,931
That?

585
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,850
This guy with an uglier mug than mine
took out a loan with it some time ago.

586
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,727
He was an absolute troll.

587
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:58,944
Dong-ju.

588
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:03,824
Yes?

589
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,120
Don't come here anymore.

590
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,460
Don't think I'm being cruel

591
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:17,879
and take this back with you too.

592
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,181
I'm sorry.

593
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,810
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

594
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,731
I know it's not your fault.

595
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,901
But I don't think

596
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,988
I can keep seeing you.

597
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:49,453
I'm afraid I might resent you.

598
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,751
So…

599
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,424
let's not see each other anymore.

600
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,844
If I don't hear from you,

601
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,846
I'll assume you're doing fine.

602
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,599
Let's just leave it at that.

603
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,356
Dong-ju.

604
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:25,363
Take the burden off your chest…

605
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,534
and live your life with peace of mind.

606
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:42,589
GYEONGIL NOODLES

607
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,032
GYEONGIL NOODLES

608
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,159
These cases occurred
over the last two weeks,

609
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:13,703
and I think they might be related.

610
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,038
I'd like to go in reverse order

611
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,207
and investigate
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il's death first.

612
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,669
The prosecutor in charge closed the case
within two hours of his death,

613
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,754
and the correctional officer in charge
is unreachable.

614
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,923
Just observe for now.

615
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,552
The agency's information is leaking.
If we don't stop it--

616
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,678
That's why I said

617
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,848
just observe and stay put.

618
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,352
The correctional officer has been
absent for days without calling in,

619
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,436
and you haven't checked?

620
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,607
Suicide or murder,
he's still a key witness.

621
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,110
Surely it can't be that difficult
to give me his number.

622
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:46,987
You want to know who I am?

623
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,906
I'm Go Man-sik with Insung Police Agency's
Special Criminal Investigation Team.

624
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,907
What did you say?

625
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,119
Why you punk… He hung up.

626
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,215
You should've taken better care of it.

627
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,695
I'm disappointed
that you were so careless with it.

628
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,203
Open your eyes.

629
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,457
Look at me.

630
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,500
Officer?

631
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,545
-Correctional Officer Han?
-Sir.

632
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,548
I wiped the security camera footage,
and there's no other evidence.

633
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:50,175
-I swear.
-No.

634
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,802
That's not what I was talking about.

635
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:58,266
Why do you think I gave this to you?

636
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,518
This isn't just any watch.

637
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,063
It's a token of my trust and faith in you,

638
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,147
which is why

639
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,777
you should never lose it
or take it off, right?

640
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,404
I'm sorry. It won't happen next time.

641
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,035
Sorry, but there's no next time.

642
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,621
You can take this off…

643
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,459
only once.

644
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,045
Please spare me, sir!

645
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,546
Please save me!

646
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,221
I keep finding myself
in Mr. Baek's debt these days.

647
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,181
Please tell him I'll get in touch…

648
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,561
The Yanbian guys opened it
to check the documents.

649
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,482
Those bastards are under control,
so there won't be any problems.

650
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,277
But the thing is,

651
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,114
this could've been opened
before they checked the contents.

652
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,075
That female cop…

653
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,369
She was a famous
former national team shooter.

654
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:01,413
She used to be on TV a lot too.

655
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,711
She's another risk factor.

656
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,466
CHEONGIL SHIPPING'S IMPORT/EXPORT
OFFICER IN CHARGE: MIN JU-YEONG

657

CHEONGIL SHIPPING

659
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:38,825
Mr. Oh.

660
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,579
I put my trust in you…

661
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,124
and now you need to deliver on it.

662
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,548
Thank you, sir.

663
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,600
…the financial damages
in the early 2000s amounted to 12 billion.

664
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,560
From 2019 up to last year,

665
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,396
the annual loss exceeded 20 billion won
for five years in a row.

666
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,149
With voice phishing schemes on the rise…

667
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:13,568
ULTRASOUND NERVE THERAPY DEVICE

668
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,321
…if someone impersonates a family member
for information via text or phone,

669
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,449
it is essential that you take caution
and carefully verify the facts.

670
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:21,159
This is Cha Sang-hun reporting for JTBN.

671
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:26,164
Lee Gyeong-il, the former athlete involved
in a drug-related hit-and-run scandal,

672
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,333
has taken his own life.

THE LATE LEE GYEONG-IL LEAVES SUICIDE NOTE

674
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:33,546
Lee, a former boxing prospect, was injured
in a match against Yoon Dong-ju

675
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,883
during the 2018 national team trials…

676
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,108
Stop! Neutral corner!

677
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,194
One, two, three,

678
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,696
-four, five…
-Get up!

679
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,032
…six, seven, eight…

680
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:02,659
Are you okay?

683
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,217
-Neutral corner!
-Hey, wake up!

684
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,552
We need help!

685
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:22,053
Gyeong-il!

686
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:23,888
Gyeong-il, wake up!

687
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:25,473
Gyeong-il!

688
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,724
Lee Gyeong-il!

689
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:42,782
Gyeong-il…

690
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,370
I'm sorry.

691
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,516
ON-CALL ROOM

692
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:54,020
Now, just imagine all of this
being replaced by high-rise apartments!

693
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,064
Doesn't that sound amazing?

694
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,608
The location is great,

695
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,485
and the prime property in Insung…

696
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,153
Oh, here we are.

697
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:04,113
It's this house right here.

698
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,908
What are you doing?

699
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,451
Oh, you were home.

700
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,495
Hello, ma'am.

701
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,288
I'm a real estate agent.

702
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,749
-Real estate agent?
-Didn't you get a call?

703
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,085
The lady put this house up for sale.

704
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:22,674
Please take your time
and look around the neighborhood.

705
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,133
CAPTAIN GO MAN-SIK

706
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,261
You're probably well aware

707
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,764
that without a few
solid insurance policies,

708
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,350
you could suffer great financial losses.

709
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,436
Gosh, the mere thought scares me.

710
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,317
I'm already insured.

711
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,152
What policies do you have?

712
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,279
A variety.

713
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,864
Actually, the RIU does dangerous work.

714
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,908
-Goodness.
-Dae-yong, don't you need--

715
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:50,868
The commissioner is calling for me.

716
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,245
Hey, did you call them?

717
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,788
See? All of you need insurance.

718
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,957
Please take a look at this.

719
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,500
-Okay.
-My number is on it.

720
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,419
Feel free to give me a call.

721
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,421
Hey, Jae-hong.

722
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,757
This guy here has four kids
and probably needs insurance.

723
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,301
Goodness, is that so?

724
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,094
Captain, I need to go
to the Support Division.

725
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,305
Oh, I have to go there too.

726
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,931
No, this is more urgent.

727
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,600
Oh, dear! Are you okay?

728
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:16,811
Oh, my goodness!

729
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,980
Gosh, you're so silly.

730
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,398
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

731
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,735
Insurance companies
lose money on this product.

732
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,570
Just hear me out.

733
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:30,199
Police officers have had to deal
with limited coverage

734
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:34,662
and restrictive premiums
due to the high risk of accidents.

735
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:37,248
Drink this. It's good for your joints.

736
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:39,876
What do you think?

737
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,086
It's good.

738
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,881
Feel free to drink all of these.

739
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,218
-Hey, Han-na. Don't you need insurance?
-Oh, my.

740
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,179
Don't worry about her insurance.

741
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,347
Han-na!

742
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,058
What's the matter?

743
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,101
Why did you come here without telling me?

744
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,103
I gave you a call,

745
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,688
but you didn't answer.

746
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,607
Maybe your phone is broken.

747
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,692
You haven't answered a single call.

748
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,944
You don't call me or take my calls.

749
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,821
What's with that tone
after all these months?

750
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,865
You're breaking my heart.

751
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,160
Now that we're on the subject,
how come you never reach out first

752
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,828
to tell me how you're doing?

753
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:16,913
Are you listening?

754
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,957
Hey, are you listening to me?

755
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,002
-Did you put Dad's house up for sale?
-What?

756
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:25,797
Yeah.

757
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,632
That's not your decision to make.

758
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,967
That's why I called you.

759
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:33,096
My loan is overdue.

760
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,764
Still, how could you consider selling it?

761
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,224
What else can I do?

762
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,892
Where else can I get such a large amount?

763
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,645
You should've listened to me
and signed with the management company.

764
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,189
Why did you become a cop of all things?

765
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,734
-Let's talk later.
-Wait.

766
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,611
Where are you going? We're not done yet.

767
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:50,363
I don't like fighting with you.

768
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,490
That's why I'm going.
I don't want to fight with you.

769
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:55,201
Do you hate me that much?

770
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,327
Didn't you know?

771
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,578
Han-na…

772
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,165
You can do whatever you want,
but leave Dad's house alone.

773
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,000
And don't come back here again.

774
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,085
But…

775
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:23,354
Goodness, Director.

776
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,941
Let's discuss the extension

777
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,777
of the shampoo advertisement contract
another time.

778
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:31,738
No, Han-na won't accept those terms.

779
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,615
No, there's no way we will.
What do you even mean?

780
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,285
No, we won't extend it
unless our terms are met.

781
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,495
Your terms are terrible.
Can't you do better?

782
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:41,330
Han-na is better than that.

783
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,916
She brought home a world record.

784
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,220
The world record is just within reach.

785
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:58,681
She brought home a world record.

786
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,186
She brought home a world record…

787
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:14,197
What just happened with Ji Han-na?

788
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,241
This is a surprising turn of events.

789
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:20,203
It seems she lost her focus
at a crucial moment.

790
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,168
Good job, dear.

791
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,544
You're the best. Hold on.

792
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:31,839
No, we just can't agree to those terms!

793
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:35,843
Listen to me, Director.
Han-na is number one in the world.

794
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:38,137
She's number one on the face of the Earth.

795
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:40,932
If it were you, would you renew a contract
under those conditions?

796
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:45,186
If you miss out on my daughter,
it'll be a huge loss for you.

797
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:49,190
I actually feel bad for you.
What should we do about this?

798
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,283
Oh, no, your hair!
Do you know how much you cost us?

799
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,536
What am I going to do?

800
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,721
That's why I'm going.
I don't want to fight with you.

801
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,848
Do you hate me that much?

802
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:04,891
Didn't you know?

803
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,267
Are you okay?

804
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,229
Are you okay?

805
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,783
I should be worried for him,
not the other way around.

806
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,954
He's such a fool.

807
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,000
Can you stand up?

808
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,800
Do you still get like that?

809
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:23,386
Sometimes.

810
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:27,765
Is that why you still take medication?

811
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,434
Only when it gets bad.

812
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:34,563
I'm used to it.
I've been this way since middle school.

813
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,028
How did you win so many gold medals
when you weren't well?

814
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,948
It took me all I had to secure one.

815
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,994
It's hard to see anything
from 50 meters away,

816
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,162
but you still managed
to hit that tiny target.

817
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:54,250
You're a genius for sure.

818
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,252
There's no such thing as a genius.

819
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,713
You just grit your teeth and do it.

820
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:04,552
When the target is in your sights,

821
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,721
you have to remain steady.

822
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,223
In that moment,

823
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,767
all trivial thoughts
and sounds of breathing

824
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,644
must fade away.

825
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:15,646
If not…

826
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,150
everything will vanish in an instant,

827
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,570
including my faith and effort.

828
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,155
So that's why…

829
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:26,949
you need to remain steady.

830
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,392
Keep a cool head and a passionate heart.

831
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:55,728
A boxer should know this.

832
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,482
Don't get worked up needlessly.

833
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,150
Focus on the target.

834
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,944
Go get that bastard.

835
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:30,096
"Such provocation…"

836
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:40,356
Why in the world
am I sitting here writing this?

837
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,441
On a Friday night, at that.

838
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,528
Damn it, Dung-ju.

839
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,532
"Such provocation…"

840
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,659
HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION

841
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,670
The agency's information is leaking.
If we don't stop it--

842
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,421
That's why I said

843
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,132
just observe and stay put.

844
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,592
Sorry for the wait.

845
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,846
You requested personnel records, right?

846
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,389
Yes, that's correct.

847
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:16,433
Can I also review the records
of the contract workers within the agency?

848
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:17,518
Sure.

849
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,233
Oh, looks like someone
was searching something.

What brings you here?

853
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,869
I'd like to take back
my letter of resignation.

854
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,287
I hope it's not too late.

855
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,497
Of course not.

Where did he stop?

859
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:09,088
Senior Officer Ji!

860
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,465
Hi there!

861
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,050
Good morning, Captain.

862
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,552
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

863
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,264
All right.

864
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,599
Jae-hong, green really suits you.

865
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:21,809
Hey.

866
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:24,853
Is there still room for me?

867
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,814
Of course.

868
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:28,899
This is great.

869
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:31,944
Senior Officer Ji is back,
and Sergeant Kim is joining us.

870
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,946
Now it feels like a real SCIT.

871
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,198
Real SCIT, my foot.

872
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,161
This isn't some corner store.

873
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,080
You can't come and go as you please.

874
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,623
I thought I could do whatever I wanted.

875
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,876
If you're going to be a crybaby,
leave the team.

876
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,920
Don't ruin the vibe here.

877
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,380
Who are you calling a crybaby?

878
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:52,464
You, of course.

879
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,968
Did you cry? Your eyes are red.

880
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:58,053
I pulled an all-nighter.

881
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,851
I'll take the Lee Jin-su hit-and-run case.

882
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,228
Would you like to?

883
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:07,980
That's my case. Stay away from it.

884
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,818
All you do is sit and cry.

885
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,278
How can you catch anyone?

886
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:16,613
By the way,

887
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,491
I told you not to speak informally.

888
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:20,909
Don't mess with me.

889
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:24,872
Sir.

890
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:27,458
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT

891
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,217
What's the matter with him? Is he crazy?

892
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,886
Hasn't he always been that way?

893
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,971
He actually seems normal now.

894
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:44,808
-That's true.
-Right. You have a point.

895
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,188
-He is crazy.
-Settle down.

896
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:01,992
RICE PORRIDGE

897
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,539
GYEONGIL NOODLES

898
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,264
What are you here for this time?

899
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:25,891
I just need a quick word.

900
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:28,310
-You can't go in!
-What trouble are you going to cause now?

901
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,354
I need to deliver something.

902
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,397
Just go.

903
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,399
Jeez.

904
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:35,526
Okay.

905
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,028
I just need to deliver this.

906
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:39,988
Hey, wait a minute!

907
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:44,952
INSUNG CUSTOMS

908
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,954
What's going on? Who are you?

909
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:49,456
I'm sorry, sir.

910
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:56,088
Mr. Min Ju-yeong, we need to talk.

911
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:00,050
-You have to leave.
-Hold on a second!

912
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,468
I found the person I was looking for.

913
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,637
It's okay. I'll take care of him.

914
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,558
I'm sorry, sir.

915
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,184
Take care of this, Mr. Min.

916
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:14,356
I'll leave after I give him this.

917
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:37,504
Now that you're in front of me,
I can't seem to control myself.

918
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:38,589
You know?

919
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,848
Keep a cool head and a passionate heart.

920
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:52,311
Keep a cool head

921
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:54,646
and a passionate heart.

922
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,419
This must've been hard work.

923
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,925
I'll drop the suit,
so don't worry about it.

924
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,426
Let's never see each other again.

925
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,811
You never look up at the sky, do you?

926
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:37,689
What?

927
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,864
Ever heard of "Prologue"?

928
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,245
"I long to feel no shame
as I look up at the sky."

929
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,664
"A mere breeze stirring the leaves…

930
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:57,793
pained my heart."

931
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,257
If you're an actual human being,

932
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,051
you'd be ashamed of yourself.

933
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,928
I see you enjoy literature.

934
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,152
Asia boxing champion.

935
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,533
National team boxer and gold medalist.

936
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,203
Undefeated in 21 matches with 21 KO wins.

937
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:36,665
What?

938
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,876
That's who I am.

939
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,505
Try and run away if you can.

940
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,300
Anyone who faces me in the ring…

941
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:49,720
always goes down.

942
01:06:19,226 --> 01:06:21,561
From now on,
our team will operate in these two pairs.

943
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:24,606
You can't just pair us up like that.

944
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,275
These are the crime scene photos
from your father's case.

945
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,320
His name is Monkey.

946
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:33,740
He's the best in the country
when it comes to smuggling cars.

947
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:37,160
Sometimes, you have to make bad choices
for the sake of justice.

948
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:38,662
What are you doing?

949
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:41,039
An ordinary civil servant
can't handle all this.

950
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:42,708
Mr. Min.

951
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,293
Min Ju-yeong is leaving the country
tonight at seven.

952
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:47,212
There's been a change of plans.

953
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:50,048
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il
didn't die because of me.

954
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:51,925
He died because of you.

955
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:57,013
He's a rotten bastard through and through.

956
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:58,932
What the hell are you going to do?

957
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,517
Isn't it obvious?

958
