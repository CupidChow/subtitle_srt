1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,523
Breath.

4
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:08,986
Tremors.

5
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:13,866
Wind.

6
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,414
You take everything into account…

7
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,794
and still,
the bullet strays off course sometimes.

8
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,760
There are days

9
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,554
that feel like a stray bullet.

10
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:37,890
Like today.

11
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:45,815
So is that it?

12
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,650
Is that what you want to do?

13
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,946
Do you want to give up now?

14
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:04,124
No.

15
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,711
I won't give up.

16
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,630
Why would I?

17
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,930
What good would that do?

18
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,978
I think I've really lost my mind.

19
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,202
You should go inside.

20
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,747
I'll see you later.

21
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,007
Where are you going?

22
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,177
You said you had nowhere to go.

23
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,471
Stay here.

24
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,643
Just for the time being.

25
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,072
Yoon Dong-ju.

26
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,199
I'm heading out first.

27
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,842
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
COMMUNITY DAY WITH THE POLICE

28
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,262
SHOOTING EXPERIENCE

29
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,191
All right, everyone.

30
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,151
CPR has a four-minute golden window.

31
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,987
I'll teach you about CPR today.

32
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,115
Check where your patient is,
quickly go to their side,

33
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,492
then lace your fingers like this.

34
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,994
We have to make sure no air escapes.

35
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,286
So open your mouth wide.

36
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,751
You can't do that. No fooling around.

37
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,045
This is an emergency. Don't fool around.

38
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,006
Everyone, you can't… Stop!

39
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,173
En garde.

40
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,300
Prêts?

41
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,593
Allez.

42
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,815
It's okay.

43
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,650
You couldn't let a child win?

44
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:18,986
I'm sorry, ma'am.

45
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,362
It's okay. Don't cry.

46
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,541
-It's a dog!
-Let's go.

47
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,436
How long does my team
have to keep this up?

48
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,272
I'd say until the commissioner softens up.

49
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,568
Goodness, they've still got it.
National team athletes are different, huh?

50
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,240
-One more time!
-One more time!

51
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,242
-Would you look at that?
-One more time!

52
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:10,370
-One more time!
-One more time!

53
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,539
What about Dong-ju?
What's going to happen to him?

54
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,545
I must be getting old.

55
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,381
I attended one event,
and now my whole body aches.

56
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,302
Drink this, sir.

57
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,848
So this is supposed to be good
for my joints, huh?

58
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,141
Yes, sir.

59
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,980
Hey, this is good!

60
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,441
That feels great.

61
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,152
You could make a living giving massages.

62
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,487
Are you certified?

63
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,949
Yes, I have Level 1 certification
in sports massage.

64
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,700
Then you should've pursued that instead.

65
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,371
Why did you become a cop
and get into all sorts of trouble?

66
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,081
I'm sorry, sir.

67
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,919
A former athlete should know better
than to throw punches so recklessly.

68
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,131
You have to know when to use your fists

69
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,716
for them to have real significance.

70
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,469
A former athlete should never be so rash.

71
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:08,470
You're a professional.

72
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,555
Am I right or not?

73
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,973
You're right, sir.

74
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:15,894
In any case,
I'll let this slide just once.

75
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,729
So do better, okay?

76
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,731
Yes, sir. I will.

77
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,900
All right. That's it.

78
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,069
That's the spot. Oh, dear.

79
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,779
Your muscles are really tight.

80
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,156
I'll loosen them up.

81
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,994
Goodness, Mayor Roh.

82
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,834
I'm sorry, Mayor Roh.

83
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,046
What are we doing here?

84
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,756
It's like we're using a sledgehammer
to crack a nut.

85
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,219
But we're still here, thanks to Dung-ju.

86
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,889
They say everything has its purpose.

87
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,141
-I'm proud of you. Come here.
-What's going on?

88
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,768
What are you doing? Stop being gross.
Get off me. It's hot.

89
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,647
Thanks for everything.
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

90
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,650
What's the matter with all of you?
Get away from me.

91
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,862
What did the commissioner say?

92
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,781
It's a one-month suspension
if I stay out of trouble.

93
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,909
It could've been worse.

94
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,660
That's a relief.

95
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,287
Good luck. You'll need it.

96
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,249
What do we do now?

97
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,962
We show them what we're made of.

98
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,465
Launching an investigation
into the mayor's connections

99
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,717
may not be feasible right now.

100
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,304
And it'll be difficult to get evidence
on Min Ju-yeong in one attempt.

101
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,514
We need to work our way up,
one step at a time.

102
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:38,060
For now, we can start with the drugs.

103
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,896
We might find some leads if we look into

104
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,606
Bbong-pil's drug precursor shipment route.

105
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,901
As always,
excellent input from Sergeant Kim.

106
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,444
Okay, let's do that.

107
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,448
And you stay behind the scenes
and support us.

108
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,783
Got it.

109
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,245
Wait a minute.

110
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,498
You should be exhausted right now,
but you look strangely good.

111
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,750
Your face is all glowy.
What did you do yesterday?

112
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,755
I did something you don't know about.

113
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,758
This guy probably doesn't know either.

114
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,485
So…

115
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,154
Let's keep our personal
and professional lives separate.

116
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,073
Don't make it obvious.

117
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,157
I didn't.

118
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,450
You're being really obvious.

119
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,660
You are too.

120
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,287
What do you mean?

121
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,832
See? You're getting flustered.

122
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,375
I'm acting as I always have.

123
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,460
When did I get flustered?

124
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,214
Just now.

125
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,602
Okay. I won't make it obvious.

126
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,771
See you at home tonight.

127
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,444
You said I could stay with you
since I don't have a place to go.

128
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,866
I'll bring my stuff over.

129
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,661
Without being obvious.

130
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,478
One, two, three, four, five…

131
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,401
My poetry book.

132
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,404
Where did it go?

133
00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:01,661
SKY, WIND, STARS, AND POEMS

134
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,579
What are you reading?

135
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:04,581
Poems.

136
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,335
How sweet. Why poems all of a sudden?

137
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,754
No reason. I just got interested.

138
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,466
So he likes stuff like this.

139
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,427
He's so sentimental.
It's giving me butterflies.

140
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,513
You've never had anyone
give you real butterflies, huh?

141
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,682
"Returning home in glory."

142
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,935
-What do you think?
-It sucks.

143
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,399
"Disgusting, uncomfortable,
nauseating, vile."

144
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,858
This is when I can use these words.

145
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,444
-Exactly.
-Goddamn.

146
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,199
I apologize for being late.

147
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,620
When will I get my Candy precursors?

148
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,705
It's taking a while.

149
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,749
And there's too much fake Candy out there.

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,336
This isn't what you promised me.

151
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,256
Isn't it a breach of contract?

152
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,967
Departure is in a week.

153
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,302
I need to load the goods before then.

154
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,055
The Japanese guys won't wait long.

155
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,266
I'll give you something else
before the goods come in.

156
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,143
A fancy appetizer of their liking.

157
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,023
Mr. Min, you need to get the goods moving
for us to do business.

158
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,277
The container has already
been cleared by customs.

159
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,322
The transportation is the issue,

160
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,450
so unfortunately, there's a delay.

161
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,956
The vehicles have been arranged,

162
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,749
but we're short on truck drivers.

163
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,209
We'll have them soon.

164
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:36,047
No idle dog should get to enjoy
the luxury of food and comfort.

165
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,341
Hey, come on.

166
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,343
It's okay. Take a seat.

167
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,054
By the way, Mr. Min.

168
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,349
Why are you leaving
that little mutt of a cop alone?

169
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,809
Why not just bury him?

170
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,146
It's cute when he tries to fight back.

171
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,569
And it's fun toying with him.

172
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,533
Where do I start looking for
Min Ju-yeong's drug precursor route?

173
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,577
Nothing's easy about this.

174
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,873
We first need to find the dealer
who supplied ephedrine to Park Bong-pil.

175
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,793
Tracking isn't an option
because they all use burner phones.

176
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:14,961
This is so tricky.

177
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,839
Captain.

178
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,174
Oh, my!

179
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,261
It's been so long.

180
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,679
All right, that's enough.

181
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,390
What brings you by?

182
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,100
What are you doing?

183
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,853
What do you mean?

184
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,314
-What do you want for lunch?
-Ginseng chicken soup?

185
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,942
You're on suspension, so why are you here?

186
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,528
-You should be resting at home.
-I came here to eat. Got a problem?

187
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,447
What is it? What do you need?

188
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,117
The shooting case at the bonded warehouse

189
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,661
was assigned to my unit.

190
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,747
This is the analysis of the blood
found at the scene.

191
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,627
BLOOD ANALYSIS REPORT
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

192
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,963
That guy right there. You know him, right?

193
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,965
CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD
NAME: LEE GWANG-SE

194
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,767
-The phone is turned off…
-Damn it. His phone is turned off.

195
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,103
Captain.

196
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,482
It seems he was kidnapped
in front of the hair salon.

197
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,651
His phone was last pinged there.

198
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,611
-Did something bad happen to him?
-Of course not.

199
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,863
The RIU is looking for him, so let's wait.

200
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,202
-Captain.
-Sergeant Kim, did you find anything?

201
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,289
It seems there was more ephedrine
that came through Insung Port.

202
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,583
More drug precursors?

203
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,835
Yes, according to
Park Bong-pil's testimony,

204
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,504
he was supposed to
get more goods from a smuggler.

205
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,131
Where are the rest of the precursors?

206
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,676
He only heard there was a delay
due to customs clearance procedures.

207
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,429
If it didn't clear customs…

208
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,558
It means it's still at Insung Port.

209
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,400
Regarding the goods I mentioned,

210
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,028
please handle them separately.

211
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,863
How did you get here?

212
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,657
But the thing is…

213
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,077
Okay, I got it.

214
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:18,793
INSUNG CUSTOMS

215
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,008
Mr. Oh.

216
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,429
I'm moving everything today,
so get the vehicles ready.

217
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,265
But without permission
from the Korea Customs Service,

218
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,601
we can't seize it even if it's there.

219
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,688
They won't cooperate at all
without any hard evidence.

220
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,274
If this drags on,
Min Ju-yeong will take off with it.

221
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,070
We just need to find evidence
that it's there.

222
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,072
But how do we do that?

223
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,495
Why have you been scratching yourself?
I'm starting to itch now.

224
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,954
You should shower more often.

225
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,748
I shower twice a day!

226
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,042
Then what's the matter? Let me see.

227
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,546
What's this?

228
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,756
What's wrong with you?

229
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,508
I got bitten by some ants or something.

230
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,635
-Why is it getting worse?
-Ants?

231
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,472
I think I got bitten by ants
when we seized Bbong-pil's drugs.

232
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,058
Nice!

233
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,810
This is pollock, right?

234
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,274
-Damn it.
-What's the matter?

235
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,485
Were they red ants, by any chance?

236
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,986
And were the tail ends brown?

237
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,239
What are you talking about?

238
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,200
Ants aren't red. They're shiny and black.

239
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,202
Hold on a second.

240
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,288
I'm fine.

241
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,456
Really, I'm fine.

242
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,335
Look here.

243
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,421
We saw this while investigating
the port containers.

244
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,507
They found red fire ants
at Insung Port last year.

245
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,051
It led to a major pest control operation.
Check out the stinger.

246
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,304
That thing is huge.
Did you say red fire ant?

247
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,349
They're also called killer ants
because of the venom in their stingers.

248
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,559
Don't be ridiculous.

249
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,018
Killer ants?

250
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,690
It says you could die
if you get bitten by it.

251
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,860
Stop with all the talk about dying.

252
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,321
The red fire ants came in the cargo
that passed through Russia.

253
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,241
They came through the same route
as the seized drug precursors.

254
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,744
Do you have any symptoms
like vomiting or trouble breathing?

255
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,706
I have indigestion, but that's because
I have chronic gastritis.

256
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,711
"Loss of consciousness due to paralysis
or sudden low blood pressure."

257
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,921
You should go to the hospital
just in case.

258
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,883
-No, I'm fine.
-You could go into anaphylactic shock.

259
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,885
Look, it says you could die!

260
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,136
You little punk!

261
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,472
It sounds like you want me to die.

262
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,850
Nobody's dying. Who dies from ant bites?

263
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,059
It just itches.

264
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,896
Be quiet and get back to work.
Stop slacking off.

265
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,231
And you, Dong-ju.

266
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,901
You shouldn't joke about…

267
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,320
-Captain!
-Captain!

268
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,241
We'll monitor his condition
while he rests for a couple of hours.

269
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,993
Why did he collapse?

270
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,579
Was it because of red fire ants?

271
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,581
Yes. There are bite marks,

272
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,042
and based on the hives,
it seems that's the case.

273
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,419
But…

274
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,380
He also seems to have indigestion.

275
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,133
And he has severe constipation.

276
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,343
He has issues overall.

277
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,845
I knew you ate too much.

278
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,138
You scared us for no reason.

279
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,893
Doctor, am I going to die?

280
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:22,936
Yes, get some rest.

281
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,146
He said yes.

282
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,397
Thank you.

283
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,524
Sergeant Kim…

284
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,068
-Sergeant Kim…
-If there are red fire ants…

285
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,236
This is our chance.

286
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,237
What do we do now?

287
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,446
What else?

288
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,907
We're going to sucker-punch
that bastard Min Ju-yeong.

289
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,418
ON OFFICIAL DUTY
KDCA

290
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,462
The Korea Customs Service
and the Insung Port Authority

291
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,216
have announced that they will deploy
an emergency response team

292
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,594
to address the red fire ant infestation
at Insung Port's Dock 1.

293
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,513
Working together with the KDCA,

294
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,431
authorities are enforcing
access restrictions…

295
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,432
What's the next step?

296
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,351
The next step?

297
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,519
Just leave it to me.

298
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,146
You shouldn't get up right now.

299
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,606
-Captain!
-Jeez.

300
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,737
J9 SECURITY

301
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,698
What with the quarantine inspections,

302
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,533
my hands are tied
with all eyes on the port.

303
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,994
In fact, I tried everything I could,

304
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:25,498
but I'm afraid it's too difficult
for me to help this time.

305
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:26,916
I see.

306
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,545
It's too difficult, huh?

307
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,714
Yeah, this one's a bit too much.

308
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,425
Right.

309
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,677
It is, isn't it?

310
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,387
Yeah.

311
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,015
How's your daughter doing in school?

312
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,267
Oh, right.

313
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,978
They don't normally accept new students
during the semester.

314
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,981
It's all thanks to you
putting in a good word for her

315
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,357
that they accepted her.

316
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,902
I'm truly grateful.

317
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,903
Don't mention it.

318
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,988
We're just helping each other out.

319
00:19:58,281 --> 00:19:59,532
But isn't that country…

320
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,577
a bit dangerous?

321
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,915
The public safety there isn't great.

322
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,293
Korean students who study abroad there

323
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,754
often get kidnapped and held for ransom.

324
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,464
And if they're girls,

325
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,175
I hear they get trafficked
into the red-light district

326
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,052
so that their families
can't ever find them.

327
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,430
They also get injected
with strange substances.

328
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,183
No. Mr. Min, don't do this.

329
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,809
Not my daughter!

330
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,980
I'm not saying
I'll do that to your daughter.

331
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,733
I was merely stating facts out of concern.

332
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,818
She should be careful.

333
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,321
-No, wait.
-It's a dangerous place, after all.

334
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,366
Wait! Hang on! Please, Mr. Min.

335
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,118
Ask me anything else, and I'll do it.
But the situation at the port…

336
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:47,330
There's just nothing I can do
about clearing the goods.

337
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,333
Please…

338
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,965
It seems your broken finger has healed.

339
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,227
It healed well.

340
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,030
Contact our guests
and ask them to meet with us.

341
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,407
And take him to the hospital.

342
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:23,908
Yes, sir.

343
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,540
INSUNG PEST CONTROL

344
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,292
-Come on, Man-sik.
-I'll make it up to you.

345
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,795
-I really can't.
-Make it happen, okay?

346
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:36,754
For goodness' sake.

347
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,758
Those are expensive,
so be careful putting them on.

348
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:43,553
I'm only doing this
because it's you, Man-sik.

349
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,762
If anything goes wrong…

350
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,973
I got it, you punk.

351
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,226
Guys, just go in and check
which container it's in. Understood?

352
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,227
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

353
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,354
By the way, when did you
build a connection like this?

354
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,690
Do you think
I spend all my time doing nothing?

355
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,027
Damn it, that's expensive.

356
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,487
I think it's smaller
than it's supposed to be.

357
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,822
Let's go.

358
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,907
We'll keep watch out here.

359
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,463
-How's it going?
-Let me do a quick check.

360
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,548
-How many people?
-Four, sir.

361
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,102
INSUNG PEST CONTROL

362
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,406
It's like a maze in there.

363
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,909
If you get lost,
you won't be able to find each other.

364
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,661
Identify the containers,
and I'll open them for you.

365
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,830
Go inside and start disinfecting!

366
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:53,873
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

367
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,443
-This one.
-Okay.

368
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,463
I think it's this one.

369
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,466
Sir?

370
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,843
Yes, where are you?

371
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,344
Can you try opening this one?

372
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,305
Did you want me to open something for you?

373
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,563
Sir?

374
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:00,523
Sir?

375
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,066
Sir?

376
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,110
What the heck?

377
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,278
Sir, can you…

378
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,283
Hey, Steamed Bun.

379
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,620
Han-na, did you find something?

380
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,291
Where's the manager?
I think we should open that one.

381
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,921
Hey, why aren't you answering me?
Where are you going?

382
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,382
Where did the sneaky jerk go?

383
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,092
Damn it, I can't see anything.

384
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,261
Why are you walking so fast?

385
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:31,762
Steamed Bun!

386
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,681
Slow down.

387
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,933
I have to tell you…

388
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,270
Now isn't the time to tell you,
but I packed my stuff.

389
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,106
Let's go home together later, okay?

390
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,357
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju.

391
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,903
Where's the manager?

392
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,738
Why are you coming from there?

393
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:53,951
Who's this?

394
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,746
Who's this?

395
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,167
Who are you?

396
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,503
Get her!

397
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,552
Nice.

398
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,512
Damn it.

399
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,517
Hi there.

400
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,228
It's been a while.

401
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,647
I can't believe this.

402
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,737
I'm sorry, but can you take these off?

403
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,656
They hurt a lot.

404
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:35,243
Seeing how you showed up,
your guys must've left something behind.

405
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,913
My wrists really hurt.

406
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:41,207
Can you please remove these?

407
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,961
No.

408
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,172
You've been arrested
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

409
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,800
Did Min Ju-yeong put you up to this?

410
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,681
You're so mean.

411
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,351
Can you take a look at this?

412
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,270
I think I got bitten by something.

413
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:06,023
-Is it a red fire ant bite?
-It looks like you pinched yourself.

414
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,025
Me?

415
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,568
You'll get treated if it gets worse,

416
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,445
so just keep still until then.

417
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,614
You're in for a long interview
when we return to the agency.

418
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:14,991
We'll start with your name.

419
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,707
Those questions are boring.

420
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,126
Why don't you ask something else?

421
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,168
What?

422
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:31,716
For example, why do those two smell like
they use the same shampoo?

423
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,719
Is it lavender?

424
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,679
Stop talking nonsense.

425
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,810
How ridiculous.

426
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:52,903
Seriously?

427
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,032
What do you think you're doing? Get up.

428
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,326
Get up and pull it together.

429
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,870
Get up right now.

430
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,581
Jeez, she's really
putting on a show, isn't she?

431
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:04,957
Would you look at that?

432
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,751
She could be an actress.

433
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,587
Excuse me.

434
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,422
Hey.

435
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,050
Is she not faking it?

436
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,468
I think it's a seizure.

437
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,511
Hey, get up. Come on!

438
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,055
Hey!

439
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,057
We need to call an ambulance.

440
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,726
Is she breathing?

441
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,694
These damn bastards!

442
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,119
Hey.

443
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,663
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

444
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,710
Hey, Steamed Bun.

445
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,797
I think I know

446
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,257
where the remaining ephedrine is.

447
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,641
Did you find it? Still no luck?

448
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,727
-Check the containers discreetly.
-Hold on.

449
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,562
It'll be a headache
if security catches you.

450
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,066
Hello? Why aren't you answering?

451
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,734
Sergeant Kim!

452
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:14,985
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL ID
KIM JONG-HYEON

453
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:25,871
Hey.

454
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,748
Did you track where Drugmon went?

455
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,252
-I lost her.
-Damn it.

456
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,838
It's okay. Focus on these teddy bears.

457
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,134
The drugs are here.

458
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,602
-What's wrong?
-What?

459
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,147
I just…

460
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,652
Did you get bitten?

461
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,903
Did you?

462
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,573
This is bad. Doctor!

463
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,408
Doctor!

464
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,742
INSUNG PORT RED FIRE ANT QUARANTINE AREA

465
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,912
It seems you're allergic to the venom.

466
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,372
When did you get bitten?

467
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:12,168
I'm not sure. Maybe 20 minutes ago.

468
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,504
Your heart will start racing,
and you'll have trouble breathing soon.

469
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,465
But don't worry about it too much.

470
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,259
You don't look so good,
and you have a fever.

471
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,261
You just need a shot in the thigh.

472
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,013
-Just wait here.
-A shot?

473
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,890
-In the thigh?
-A shot in the thigh.

474
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,852
I think a prescription will do.

475
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,480
Getting a shot right now is more effective

476
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,148
-than a prescription.
-He's right.

477
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,942
Are you okay, Sergeant Kim?

478
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,819
He's clearly not okay.

479
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,237
Look at him sweating.

480
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:41,906
Hurry, Doctor.

481
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,491
Doctor, I…

482
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,242
I'll be okay without the shot.

483
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,328
What do you mean? It's not okay with me.

484
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,496
Keep your arm still.

485
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,915
Why are you scared of a shot?
You're acting like a kid.

486
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,291
Doctor, please wait.

487
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,169
-I'm really okay. I just need to rest.
-Sergeant Kim.

488
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,254
You're not okay.
You look as pale as a ghost.

489
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,048
You could go into anaphylactic shock.

490
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,800
One shot of epinephrine, and you're good.
So hang tight.

491
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,928
-Now's not the time to be stubborn.
-Wait a second.

492
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,930
Please wait! I…

493
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,848
-Wait, I just…
-I can't give him a shot in this state.

494
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,269
-All good, right?
-Right.

495
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:15,814
Jeez.

496
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,152
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

497
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,492
What do we do with that?

498
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,251
Thank you, sir.

499
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,056
Let's go!

500
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:55,145
What's this?

501
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,148
Don't act so shocked.

502
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,534
Is that really it?

503
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,827
I bought it on my way here.

504
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,710
What did Man-sik bring back this time?

505
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,798
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

506
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,383
We'll make do with soda tonight

507
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,218
since things will get busy
starting tomorrow.

508
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,430
Make sure to eat your fill here tonight.

509
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,140
It's on the commissioner.

510
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,560
Hey, RIU. Let's go.

511
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,895
Where are you going? Let's eat together.

512
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:40,357
Go ahead and eat up.
We're not jealous, we're just full.

513
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,567
We can't enjoy it without you.

514
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,651
Whatever, let's eat!

515
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:43,902
Let's eat!

516
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,243
Han-na.

517
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,912
Try eating it like this. It's good.

518
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,751
It's good, right?

519
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,544
Yeah, it is.

520
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:02,713
This is good.

521
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,850
-Why do I still feel empty?
-You ate a lot.

522
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,353
-Thank you for dinner.
-See you tomorrow.

523
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,229
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Senior Officer Ji.

524
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,773
Where are you going, Dung-ju?

525
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,360
-What?
-Where are you going?

526
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,528
You don't have a place to stay.
My house is this way. Come on.

527
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,323
Of course, I have a place to stay.

528
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,492
Don't worry about me and go.
I can look after myself.

529
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,790
What is it?

530
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,125
-You can stay at my place.
-Why?

531
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:45,297
It's the least I can do
for someone who saved my life.

532
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,305
-Thanks for the meal.
-Good night.

533
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,362
The door is open.

534
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,498
The door is locked.

535
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,922
Just how many properties do you own?

536
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,051
Here.

537
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,019
You can use this room.

538
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,522
Room?

539
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,107
Don't you mean storage?

540
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,943
I don't have extra rooms,
and I don't like a messy living room.

541
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,195
Or do you want to sleep with me?

542
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,488
No way.

543
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,117
Same here.

544
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,370
I'll move the boxes next time.
Can't say when though.

545
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,801
I can't sneak out to Han-na's.

546
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:15,721
Has he caught on?

547
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,390
Whatever.

548
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,062
Be careful. The boxes might fall over.

549
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,981
Well, thanks for the heads-up.

550
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,155
It's Han-na.

551
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:36,867
What's all this?

552
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,245
She's so cute.

553
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,460
But why is he still holding on to these?

554
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,087
Once you break up, you need to move on.

555
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,007
He's still stuck in the past, huh?

556
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,844
Look at this cute heart pose.

557
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,390
I wonder if he has more.

558
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,979
Hey, I'll organize the stuff
that fell over.

559
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:18,867
FENCING SILVER MEDALIST KIM JONG-HYEON
RETIRES DUE TO INJURY

560
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,495
"Fencing silver medalist, Kim Jong-hyeon."

561
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:24,623
Pretty cool.

562
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,416
FENCER WITH BOWED HEAD, STILL A HERO TO US

563
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,876
"Still a hero to us."

564
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:34,007
Fine, I admit it. You're pretty cool.

565
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,469
LEFT EYE INJURY
ENDS KIM JONG-HYEON'S BID FOR GOLD

566
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,601
En garde.

567
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:46,854
Prêts?

568
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,148
Allez.

569
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,488
A counterattack point.

570
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,707
What the heck? He's losing.

571
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,500
So much for showing off.

572
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,586
Here, sit down.

573
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,006
Have some water.

574
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,757
My ankle hurts.

575
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,177
But you were fine yesterday.

576
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,031
Roger attacks.

577
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,742
Kim Jong-hyeon parries
and goes in for an attack.

578
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,660
He has to keep going.

579
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,078
He gets blocked but follows through.

580
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,246
Kim Jong-hyeon succeeds!

581
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,915
Kim Jong-hyeon scores a point!

582
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,713
What are you doing? Get up.

583
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,308
En garde.

584
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:08,977
Prêts?

585
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:12,272
Allez.

586
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,817
I punched his left side.

587
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,071
I should've punched his right side.

588
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,757
I'll be right back.

589
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,527
Where's the gym Dong-ju used to go to?

590
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:47,993
JI HO-CHEOL

591
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:03,467
HAN-NA
ANY LUCK FINDING DONG-JU?

592
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,144
DUNG-JU

593
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:18,857
Can I help you?

594
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,900
INSUNG SUPERMARKET

595
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,028
This dog's name is Dung-ju?

596
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,697
That's right. Dung-ju.

597
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,533
The lady police officer calls him that.

598
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:38,794
Goodbye, ma'am.

599
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,421
Come here, Dung-ju.

600
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:42,589
Dung-ju!

601
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,258
It's time to eat, Dung-ju.

602
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,447
What are you doing?

603
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,784
Oh, no. Looks like it'll scar.

604
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,495
Open wide.

605
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,955
It's all scraped up in here.

606
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,706
There's no way you'd be fine
after my punch.

607
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,291
What do you think you're doing?

608
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,418
I bought ointment. I'll put it on for you.

609
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,422
Cut it out. It doesn't hurt.

610
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,218
I said I'd put it on for you.
Come over here.

611
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,845
I said it doesn't hurt.

612
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,597
Even if it doesn't,
you need it to prevent scarring.

613
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,183
-Come here.
-What's wrong with you? Get lost!

614
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,101
What now? Come here.

615
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,644
Seriously, stop it.

616
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,354
Get away from me, Yoon Dong-ju.

617
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,064
-What's wrong with you?
-Come here.

618
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,030
Hey, are you okay?

619
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,617
-Indefensible par terre!
-Wait!

620
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,036
-Keep still.
-Wait!

621
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,954
"EPHEDRINE" HIDDEN IN TOYS

622
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,038
Goddammit.

623
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,291
Looks like we won't get our goods.

624
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:04,546
Some of that belongs
to the Japanese, right?

625
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,048
If this is how we start out,
it won't go well for both of us.

626
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,341
May God help us.

627
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,011
Drugmon.

628
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,722
It won't do for you to catch a cold.

629
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,266
My black cat.

630
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,851
Meow.

631
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,688
Hey, do you have a fever?

632
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:22,606
Don't you dare.

633
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,858
Damn, you're so snappish.

634
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,027
-Meow.
-Meow.

635
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,113
Mr. Min, what are you going to do?

636
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,533
Once they take it
to the evidence storage tomorrow,

637
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,912
we'll never get our goods, will we?

638
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,458
Mr. Min?

639
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,127
We'll get it back.

640
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,378
It's ours, after all.

641
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,297
How?

642
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,049
If we know the route

643
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,344
and the departure time…

644
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,347
the answer is clear.

645
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,437
What was that?

646
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,576
I'm sorry, but can I please
use the bathroom?

647
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,078
Who are you?

648
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,500
My name is Lee Gwang-se.

649
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,226
Be quiet!

650
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:43,812
Mama?

651
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,107
I told you not to call when I'm working.

652
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:50,277
That's not what I meant.

653
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,363
I'm not killing people. I swear.

654
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,783
I'll call you back when I'm done. Got it.

655
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,118
I love you, Mama.

656
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,969
You received Mama's blessing.

657
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:26,062
Thank you, Mama.

658
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,109
Well, he received Mama's blessing.

659
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,237
Blessing, my ass.

660
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,532
Isn't this the dumb bastard
the cops are after?

661
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,075
He probably heard everything.

662
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,910
We can't let him live.

663
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,163
How much did you hear?

664
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,874
My hearing isn't good,
so I didn't hear a single thing.

665
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:50,879
That's a relief.

666
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,429
Why are you upsetting me?

667
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,431
You keep lying and making excuses.

668
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,266
This is why…

669
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:06,686
This is why…

670
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,856
I can't help but go insane.

671
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:10,982
I'm sorry, sir.

672
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,319
You bastard.

673
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,365
Hey!

674
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,506
When did he put these on my face?

675
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,309
Yes, Mayor Roh.

676
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,311
RELIABLE AND PROUD INSUNG POLICE

677
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:51,022
I GUARANTEE INSUNG CITY'S SAFETY

678
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,065
Yes, sir.

679
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,901
I'll make sure to do that.

680
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:01,408
Go straight to the evidence storage.

681
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:02,867
The riot police will control the traffic.

682
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:04,035
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

683
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,620
-One more thing.
-What are you looking at?

684
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,956
Fax the documents to the evidence storage,
Senior Officer Shin.

685
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,082
Yes, sir.

686
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,669
Be careful and come back safe.

687
00:45:15,672 --> 00:45:17,257
The weather is beautiful today.

688
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,594
Drive safely!

689
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,222
Hello.

690
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:37,986
Hello?

691
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:45,910
Oh, jeez!

692
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:47,745
Why are you here?

693
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,664
I came to eat.

694
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,958
You're suspended. You don't get to eat.

695
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,334
This isn't a boarding house.

696
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:56,087
Let's just go for now.

697
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,381
Are we going out to eat? Really?

698
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,509
Are we going far? We can just eat
at the barbecue place nearby.

699
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,553
Barbecue, my ass. We're not going to eat.

700
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,596
Hurry up and get in.

701
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,055
Then where are we going?

702
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,892
Where are we going?

703
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,937
We found Gwang-se.

704
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:20,904
-Just rest.
-Thank you, Doctor.

705
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,614
What was that?

706
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,033
I said thank you!

707
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,952
Thank… Jeez, whatever.

708
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,337
What?

709
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,299
As I said, I wanted to live a quiet life,
but you dragged me into this mess.

710
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,134
Now look at me!

711
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:45,678
I just wanted to live quietly!

712
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:47,889
Instead, I got shot and stabbed!

713
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,558
Who gets shot in Korea?
Do you know how badly it hurts?

714
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,644
I'm the only one who got shot.
It's so unfair!

715
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,605
Who can I talk to about this injustice?

716
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,689
Blow your nose.

717
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,027
I'm sorry, okay? Just calm down.

718
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,696
Tell me the whole story. What happened?

719
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,490
What do you think happened?

720
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,242
I almost died twice.

721
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:12,288
Mr. Min, what are you going to do?

722
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,124
-We'll get it back.
-"We'll get it back."

723
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,292
It's ours, after all.

724
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:19,420
If we know the route
and the departure time,

725
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,798
the answer is clear.

726
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,468
So you're saying Min Ju-yeong
is going to steal the seized goods?

727
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:29,180
He already knew the date,
the time, and the route.

728
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,600
He has an effective inside man
within the agency.

729
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:36,688
You're not lying, are you?

730
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,691
How could you ask that?

731
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:43,152
Why would I lie for a man
who stabbed me in the leg?

732
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,281
I'm risking my life

733
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,117
by telling you this.

734
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,746
Is that a cat?

735
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:55,164
It's a tiger!

736
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,711
Did you check it out?

737
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,005
Because of the protest at City Hall,

738
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,674
the riot police sent a few guys
to Sergeant Kim and Senior Officer Ji,

739
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,634
and the rest are stationed at City Hall.

740
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:07,927
Who gave that order?

741
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:08,970
The commissioner.

742
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:10,930
It was his direct order?

743
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,981
POLICE

744
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,867
We'll have to leave
through the back door, sir.

745
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,036
-This way, sir.
-Okay.

746
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,913
Gosh, look at all those people. Let's go.

747
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,252
Han-na, is everything okay? Where are you?

748
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:43,338
We're entering the Jungdong Tunnel soon.

749
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,052
You good, Sergeant Kim?

750
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,929
Take a different route once you've
passed through the Jungdong Tunnel.

751
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,640
We have a leak within the agency.

752
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,559
-Yes, sir.
-We're on our way there right now.

753
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:58,478
-Be careful.
-Okay.

754
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,699
INSUNG'S LONGEST TUNNEL SECTION AHEAD

755
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,841
Dae-yong, did you meet with Gwang-se?

756
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:32,095
Is this some kind of joke?
What's going on?

757
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:37,350
I'm here, but he's not.

758
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,894
I'll see you back at the agency.

759
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,402
Running away?

760
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:52,490
Go ahead. I'll let you go.

761
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,825
Sorry?

762
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,912
And go tell those bastards

763
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,207
everything you heard.

764
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,585
Tell them every single word.

765
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:10,299
If you don't, I'll make sure
you can't use your other leg either.

766
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:27,233
Gwang-se, you punk.
You can run, but you can't hide.

767
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,529
Your call cannot be connected…

768
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,780
The call won't go through.

769
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,369
-Hey, Jae-hong.
-Captain.

770
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:41,497
I'm heading over with the RIU.
I'll call you when I get there.

771
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,584
Okay. Call the Jungdong Substation
and get all the manpower you can.

772
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,501
Yes, sir.

773
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,379
How much longer?

774
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,047
We'll be there soon.

775
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,054
Are we all set?

776
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:08,316
This guy won't be able to
call his mama either.

777
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,652
Step on it.

778
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,585
Let's begin.

779
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,542
Hold on a second.

780
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,039
What the heck?

781
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:48,374
Why is it blocked?

782
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,377
-Who are these punks?
-Damn it.

783
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,753
Are those assholes serious?

784
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:55,464
Let's go.

785
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:02,471
Who the hell are you guys?

786
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,182
Why bother asking? They're the bad guys.

787
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,020
Let me borrow this for a second.

788
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,062
What are you doing?

789
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,815
How many can you take on?

790
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:13,816
Let's see.

791
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:15,943
Three?

792
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,653
That's more than enough.

793
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:19,238
No, I mean two!

794
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,201
Damn it.

795
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,879
Hey!

796
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:11,183
You bastard!

797
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:30,786
Captain!

798
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,125
Hey!

799
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,920
You're not going in blind!
Wait until Jae-hong arrives!

800
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:42,798
That's exactly why I'm going.
We don't know the situation.

801
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,217
Don't go!

802
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,595
Hey!

803
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,055
I said don't go!

804
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:51,515
They're getting up.

805
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:53,893
I told you I could only take on two!

806
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,892
Hey there, pal.

807
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,644
You're in Korea, so speak Korean!

808
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,562
Hey, RIU.

809
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,356
RIU…

810
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,249
Where are you going?

811
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,793
Did I surprise you?

812
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,086
What are you looking at?

813
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:18,978
Hey, you bastards!

814
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,319
You bastard.

815
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:17,823
There are days like that.

816
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,332
Breath.

817
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:29,835
Tremors.

818
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,094
Wind.

819
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,401
You take everything into account…

820
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:59,448
and still,
the bullet strays off course sometimes.

821
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,117
You son of a bitch.

822
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,250
I have to go, you bastard.

823
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:10,269
There are days…

824
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,112
that feel like…

825
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,031
a damn stray bullet.

826
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:26,493
Like today.

827
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,036
Those of us stepping into the ring
risk our lives just the same.

828
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,456
Today is going to be a very memorable day.

829
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,582
We have to keep looking.

830
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,459
Han-na will be there.

831
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,925
It's unlike you to be so calm.
I thought you'd be losing your shit.

832
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:27,763
I'm holding back.

833
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,767
I'll lose my shit…

834
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:35,854
Han-na.

835
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:37,231
…once I find her.
