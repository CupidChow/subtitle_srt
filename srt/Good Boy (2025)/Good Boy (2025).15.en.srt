1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,804
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,683
Dong-ju!

4
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,744
Man, this feels good.

5
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,078
You bastard!

6
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,919
Hey.

7
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,053
I told you.

8
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,347
This is what a champion looks like.

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,272
Damn, what a tragedy.

10
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,984
You're really losing your vision.

11
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,155
I told you to keep that blood pressure
in check, didn't I?

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,450
You know, when your coach
tells you something,

13
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,952
you should listen, kid.

14
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,914
How in the hell
are you gonna take me on like this?

15
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,066
I can still beat you with my eyes closed.

16
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,246
VICTORY GYM

17
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,330
Hey, take it easy!

18
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,041
Come on! I'm bouncing around, damn it.

19
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,711
-What is this, a damn stroll?
-My bad, sir.

20
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,879
Move it, idiot!

21
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,632
You wanna watch me bleed to death
or something?

22
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,301
It was a rubber bullet,
so you should be fine.

23
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,261
-Rubber, my ass. Are you kidding?
-Let's keep moving.

24
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,222
-Whoa, easy, easy!
-Wait, what?

25
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:43,849
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

26
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:44,934
Hey!

27
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,354
Hey! Careful, careful!

28
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,315
Be careful, damn it.

29
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,318
I told you to get a chopper, idiots.

30
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,320
Yoon Dong-ju.

31
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,781
Yoon Dong-ju.

32
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:01,784
What are you doing?

33
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,370
What happened to you?

34
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,788
Yoon, what happened…

35
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,790
Yoon, what's going on? Yoon Dong-ju!

36
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,917
-Get off me, you bastard!
-Yoon, get a hold of yourself!

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,001
Yoon, come on!

38
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,211
Yoon Dong-ju, stop! It's me!

39
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,796
What's going on? Look at me!

40
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,547
What's wrong? Yoon Dong-ju.

41
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,225
Yoon Dong-ju.

42
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,529
Jong-hyeon.

43
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,657
You…

44
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:43,909
I…

45
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,997
I'm blind. I'm blind.

46
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,921
Yoon Dong-ju!

47
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,688
Dong-ju.

48
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,273
Yoon Dong-ju!

49
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,360
Dong-ju!

50
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,320
Jong-hyeon!

51
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,138
Let's go.

52
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,984
Min Ju-yeong's already slipped out.

53
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,446
Where the hell is that bastard?
Did you run the plates?

54
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,074
They're keeping us from accessing
the building's CCTV.

55
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,159
It's a total mess in there, isn't it?

56
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,243
No one knows a thing.

57
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,245
They're too busy tiptoeing
around the commissioner.

58
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,664
The commissioner harboring a criminal?

59
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,459
Wait, doesn't this mean
we should investigate him first?

60
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,503
Who's gonna interrogate the commissioner?

61
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,761
I'll do it. Fine.

62
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,554
Just get the security footage
from around here

63
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,056
and track down the car.

64
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,557
Let's go rip him apart ourselves.

65
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,059
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

66
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,812
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

67
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,815
Sergeant Kim. Found him yet?

68
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,779
Understood, take him now.

69
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,031
What's up with Dung-ju?

70
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:47,950
It's pretty serious.

71
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,619
-What?
-Captain!

72
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,038
-What…
-I'll tell you later.

73
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,208
Oh! Hey, Ji! Nice work.

74
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,709
Let's go see the commissioner.

75
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,002
Okay. Come on, let's go.

76
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,214
Have you seen Dong-ju or Jong-hyeon?

77
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,924
Oh, I just saw them going to…

78
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,717
Well, uh, I think they're already out

79
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,261
-looking for Min Ju-yeong.
-…to look for Ju-yeong.

80
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,180
-Okay, come on. Let's get out of here.
-They seemed to be in such a rush too.

81
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,641
God, it's killing me!

82
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,227
Jesus. Hey, hey! Come on please!

83
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,563
Faster, faster. God, it's killing me!

84
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,273
Oh, it hurts so bad. Oh, the pain!

85
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,316
-Hurry up!
-Stop!

86
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,734
I'm sorry about this.

87
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,987
-What the hell do you think you're doing?
-What's going on?

88
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,572
What do you want with him?

89
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,699
-God, it's killing me…
-Commissioner,

90
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,409
where's Min Ju-yeong? Where did he go?

91
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,119
You know where he is, don't you?

92
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,829
-What are you doing?
-Get your damn hands off me.

93
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,459
Sir, talk to me. Are you seriously
gonna do nothing to clean up this mess?

94
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,712
You're the goddamn commissioner!

95
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,382
What? What did you say?

96
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,342
You're a cheap ass pair of briefs.

97
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:48,677
You're nothing but dead weight.

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,053
And somehow you're proud of that?

99
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,513
Cheap ass pair of briefs?

100
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,974
-Yeah!
-You little shit!

101
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,143
You're all…

102
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,644
You're all going to pay for this.

103
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,898
How dare you! How dare you
shoot the commissioner right in the ass!

104
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,067
Hey, where's Han-na?

105
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,403
Riot squad, find Ji Han-na. Where is she?

106
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,197
-Huh? Where the hell is she?
-Move! Come on!

107
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,574
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Get me out of here.

108
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,951
-Hey, aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
-Oh, my God. The pain.

109
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,036
You new here or just lost?

110
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,872
Are you cops? Special recruits?
What the hell is this?

111
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,499
-Get out.
-I'm too damn embarrassed

112
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,919
to call myself a cop in this city!

113
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,055
Where are we going?

114
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,558
Min Ju-yeong.

115
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,770
That's what you're worried about
right now?

116
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:41,980
You should focus on yourself.

117
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,663
INSUNG SEONGSIM HOSPITAL

118
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,123
Why are we here?

119
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,708
To get a check-up for your condition.

120
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,961
The doctor who helped you before
is waiting.

121
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,257
She knows about your situation,
so she'll keep it quiet.

122
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,300
I know you're worried.
I'll talk to Han-na.

123
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,470
I don't need a check-up. Forget it.

124
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,474
What? Are you scared?

125
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,851
What would I be scared about?

126
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,897
You know better than anyone
how serious punch-drunk syndrome is.

127
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,826
Do you want me to come in with you?

128
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,412
What am I, a child?

129
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:30,714
Jong-hyeon.

130
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,053
Mr. Yoon Dong-ju.

131
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,559
She's calling you.

132
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,770
Please, follow me.

133
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,618
Thanks.

134
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,830
For looking out for me.

135
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,126
You must be really out of it.
Will you just go?

136
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,883
Don't smile. You'll grow on me.

137
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,314
JONG-HYEON

138
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,199
At around 2:20 a.m. today,

139
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,077
a gunshot was fired
at the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

140
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,246
Authorities say one of the suspects
who escaped

141
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,999
during the recent crackdown on an illegal
arms and drug smuggling cartel,

142
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,334
infiltrated the agency

143
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,962
and attempted to assassinate
Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol.

144
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,549
That jerk! Serves him right.

145
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,427
Why do you come home so late every night?

146
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,763
Is it because of all those maniacs
running wild these days?

147
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,016
I saw you on the news the other day.
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.

148
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,769
Don't go putting yourself in danger
like that again.

149
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,355
Even if it's an order,
you should play it smart.

150
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,941
Yeah, I'll be careful.

151
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,693
Where's Dung-ju?

152
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,279
Oh, my husband took him to the vet.

153
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,073
-Do you know what's the matter?
-I don't know.

154
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,950
They say they need to run some tests.

155
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,535
He looks healthy enough,

156
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,954
but he keeps making me worry.

157
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,967
INSUNG REDEVELOPMENT SHOOTOUT SUSPECT
BREAKS INTO POLICE AGENCY…

158
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,051
Good grief.

159
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,179
Snore any harder
and he'll lose his nose hairs too.

160
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,349
Don't throw your pillow.

161
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,895
Hey, Man-sik. Why are you always
crashing here instead of going home?

162
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,396
What's the point of going home?

163
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,814
It'll only stress me out.

164
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,941
INSUNG POLICE COMMISSIONER TARGETED…
COMMISSIONER CHO NOW IN EMERGENCY SURGERY

165
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,986
I'm flying in today.
We need to talk.

166
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,033
Dong-ju's okay.

167
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,327
Don't worry.
I made sure he got checked out.

168
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,661
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

169
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,005
Ah, shit!

170
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,969
Mayor, what did I just say?

171
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,599
There's…
There's a ship coming.

172
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,976
It's coming in from Japan tomorrow night.

173
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,061
Exactly.

174
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,315
I told you I really need to
ship the goods out on it, didn't I?

175
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,194
All I need from you is to make sure
I get aboard and go quietly.

176
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,904
I-I…

177
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:41,988
I'll try.

178
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,783
I'll do whatever I need to make it happen.

179
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,960
You only live if I walk away alive.

180
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,756
Thanks.

181
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,472
Or do you want to die with me?

182
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,768
-No.
-Your son, his wife, your grandson.

183
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,645
-All of them.
-No.

184
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,648
No… …I'll do it.
Okay? I swear.

185
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,942
-Leave now.
-Thank you.

186
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,913
The ship departed Japan.

187
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:35,000
We have to move quickly
and secure the Candy for the deal.

188
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,962
If the deal falls through again,

189
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,965
the Japanese won't just let it slide.

190
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,844
Then we'd better
get the goods back from Mr. Baek first.

191
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,647
Not even the Buk-dong
or the Black Dragon guys?

192
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,066
No one will touch it,
not if it came from Min.

193
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,570
Stupid bastards. They're goddamn cowards.

194
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,407
Word is, Min is looking for us.

195
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,242
What do we do now?

196
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,579
What's that?

197
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,789
Hey, friend.

198
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,168
What the hell is this bonehead saying?
"Friend"?

199
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,545
I'm glad you speak a little English.

200
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,881
But we're not exactly friends.

201
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,513
Wow, Min! You're here!

202
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,558
I thought you were dead.
I guess I was wrong.

203
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,352
What?

204
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,606
-Are you disappointed?
-No, of course I'm not.

205
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,816
Looks like
there's a serious misunderstanding.

206
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,778
Then what's that look on your face?
Like a thief whose time is up.

207
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,449
I look like a thief?
What're you talking about?

208
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,160
That looks like mine.

209
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:56,998
That?

210
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,584
How is all of that yours?

211
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,711
You're not paying for my boys' blood?

212
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,839
With that bitch Drug Demon
and the Black Cat bastard both dead,

213
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:10,136
we're the only ones alive.
Let's split it fair and square.

214
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,058
What do you say?

215
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,980
That sounds good.

216
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,482
Let's do it.

217
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,817
Fair and square.

218
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,820
Whoever lives takes it all.

219
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,657
Fucker.

220
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,785
Min Ju-yeong, you goddamn bastard!

221
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,712
Hi, Captain.

222
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,172
Yeah, I just got the call.

223
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,257
Yes.

224
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,426
I'm gonna head straight over to the scene.

225
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,469
Oh, Dong-ju?

226
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,972
He came back home late. He must be asleep.

227
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,598
Dong-ju, uh…

228
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,951
Seriously, didn't you miss me?

229
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,661
You've gotten so much bigger.

230
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,872
You think I've changed too?

231
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,082
What's up? You never texted me back.

232
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,103
Sorry.

233
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,355
I broke my phone.

234
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,110
Been out looking for Min Ju-yeong?

235
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,839
You know,
I'm so glad to see you.

236
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,489
Aw, that's adorable.

237
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,032
Hi, there.

238
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,409
Oh, you're great together.
Such a good-looking pair.

239
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,538
-Thank you.
-You finally did it.

240
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,622
Let's go.

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,335
DUNG-JU

242
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,045
Hey, here they come.

243
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,300
-How's it going?
-Hey, Dung-ju. Come here.

244
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,597
How's it going?

245
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,061
You should be
in the hospital getting treated!

246
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,312
What are you doing here?

247
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,399
I can get treated
while I'm working, though.

248
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,776
But if you keep benching me,
I won't get treated at all.

249
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,029
-If I get hurt, it'll be all your fault.
-Don't be ridiculous.

250
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,365
You're wanted! Did you forget about that?

251
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,826
Han-na, the site's over there.

252
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,038
What're you gonna say
if other cops see you?

253
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,707
Would you chill out?

254
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,293
The only ones who showed
are Forensics and RIU.

255
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,253
Anyway,
who'd notice me with everything going on?

256
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,130
All you do is run that damn mouth

257
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,340
-and ignore everything I say!
-Dong-ju!

258
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,509
-Hey. You all right?
-Oh, hey.

259
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,428
-You were at the hospital, right?
-Why? Is someone sick?

260
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,471
Is it Ha-min, Ha-jun, Ha-yul, Ha-yeong?

261
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,765
What? What are you talking about? Wh…

262
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,184
Uh, Dong-ju stayed over. Yeah.

263
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,729
In separate rooms.

264
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,189
Uh, it's, you know…

265
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,525
It's my wife. She's at the hospital.

266
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,944
-Is she now?
-Honestly, I don't think she heard.

267
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,988
You don't think? Are you kidding, man?

268
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,616
But I covered it. Switched it to my wife.
Quick and smooth.

269
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,661
Hey.
Guys, you should wait outside.

270
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,955
-Go on. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yes, sir. I'll get the car started.

271
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,672
EVIDENCE: SUNFLOWER SEED SHELLS

272
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,633
How about Seok-chun?

273
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,760
His body isn't here,
so he probably got away.

274
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,346
Residents who heard the gunfire

275
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,222
said they saw Min Ju-yeong
and some Russian men.

276
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,433
But we have no idea
where they disappeared to.

277
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,644
We checked the footage
all the way from the agency,

278
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,812
and we still can't figure out
how they even got here.

279
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,024
Huh? That's odd.

280
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,651
What's odd.

281
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,278
Well, they got here
and then went somewhere else?

282
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,989
That means they passed
at least seven checkpoints.

283
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,824
But no one stopped them. How's that?

284
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,661
Good point.

285
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,704
There's still someone inside the force

286
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,123
making sure Min Ju-yeong
never gets caught.

287
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,959
So it wasn't just that rookie
on your team.

288
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,794
We've got a mole in our ranks again.

289
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,630
Yeah. But I doubt Jong-hun was involved.

290
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,549
A .38 caliber revolver
issued by the agency.

291
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,344
The wound matches the weapon exactly.

292
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,428
Hold up.

293
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,306
So, he might've been killed
by one of our own?

294
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,766
Looks like it.

295
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,977
We looked into Jong-hun's movements,

296
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,728
but there's zero connection
to Min Ju-yeong.

297
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,647
If it is a cop,

298
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,691
you think Jong-hun found the mole
and paid for it?

299
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,026
It's humiliating. But I'm certain.

300
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,279
That damn mole's on my team.

301
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,042
Ha!

302
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,463
If Min Ju-yeong slipped through all
the patrols as well as the checkpoints,

303
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,424
then he probably went west.

304
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,261
And if we assume
he's still hiding out in Insung,

305
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,847
that narrows it down to three areas.

306
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,100
Seo-gu, Daejeong-gu, and Hoeun-gu.

307
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,436
Here's a list of everyone
at the launch ceremony

308
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,688
for the police-prosecution
joint task force.

309
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,774
Most of them must be connected
to Min Ju-yeong somehow.

310
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,776
There must be someone on this list

311
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,529
who owns a building
in one of those three areas.

312
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,532
If we check them out,
we could connect Min Ju-yeong.

313
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,577
Looks like every major player in Insung
is on this damn list.

314
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,203
It'll take some time, but, uh,

315
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,456
let's start by checking
who owns property there.

316
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,166
And see if anyone's hiding Min Ju-yeong.

317
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,459
Huh? Someone's here.

318
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,503
Who is this guy? Huh?

319
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,339
I told you to clear out,
not invite more people.

320
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,051
Well, well. So, the whole mob is here,

321
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,178
including the wanted man in person.

322
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,307
Not you.

323
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,641
What are you doing here?

324
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,936
Thought you might want to know
how the commissioner is doing.

325
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,980
Why would I care how he's doing?

326
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,316
I mean, unless he died during surgery…

327
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,818
No, he's fine. Sorry to disappoint.

328
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,656
I wonder. How did you shoot him
so clean without hitting a single nerve?

329
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,201
Impressive.
Even the doctors were surprised.

330
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,454
That's national team precision for you.
Clean as hell.

331
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,749
That's our Ji
with a gun in her hand!

332
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,586
-I'm sorry.
-You pulled the trigger.

334
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,631
Should've nailed him in the asshole
so it hurts to take a crap!

335
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,843
Even he's starting to feel
the pressure from all this.

336
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,638
He even told me to take Dong-ju
off the wanted list.

337
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,768
Out of nowhere? Why?

338
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,603
He's saying he can't get involved.

339
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,523
But if you want to take down Min Ju-yeong
he's not going to stop you.

340
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,733
So we're the ones who'll pay
if it goes south.

341
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,611
What the hell is his deal?
Is he playing neutral now?

342
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,865
It's not looking
like he's got a direct link

343
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,284
to that crazy bastard Min Ju-yeong.

344
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:34,080
He just can't because the mayor
and some other big names are involved.

345
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,791
Which is why I decided to hear him out.

346
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,835
How can I get involved?

347
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,670
What if things go wrong?

348
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,215
No telling what that bastard's got on me.

349
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,177
Remember this.

350
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,138
There's a lot…

351
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,059
more than just money that I can offer.

352
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,271
So, money isn't the only thing he has?

353
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,273
If it's not money,

354
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,734
then why the hell
is everyone groveling at his feet?

355
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,447
Min Ju-yeong finds people's weaknesses

356
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,991
and uses them to keep control.

357
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,744
Whatever dirt he has on them
it's enough to keep them in tow.

358
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,582
You see, most of the people on this list,

359
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:21,752
their families made their money
through overseas trade back in the day,

360
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,546
including the chief prosecutor's father.

361
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,840
Some of them are still running
those companies now.

362
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,469
Here's a list of the companies.

363
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,807
Every single one of them
started growing fast right after Ju-yeong

364
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,767
took charge of their customs processing.

365
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,020
Figure out what he did for all of them,

366
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,397
and you'll know what kind of dirt
he's holding over them.

367
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,400
Where did you even get a list like this?

368
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,278
Come on, you think I was just
lounging around on that business trip?

369
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,156
I don't look it,
but I was in Intelligence.

370
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,784
When Ju-yeong joined the customs office,

371
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,287
he started in
the Intelligence Management Division.

372
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,207
His job at the time was managing
the integrated database.

373
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,917
Integrated database?

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,003
Back then, the customs office
was launching a paperless system.

375
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,423
And he was tasked with
digitizing all the old paper records

376
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,133
and destroying the originals.

377
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,385
Papers, huh?

378
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,720
What kind of papers?

379
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,735
IMPORT TAX INVOICE
COMPANY NAME: CHEONGIL SHIPPING

380
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,493
IMPORT TAX INVOICE
COMPANY NAME: CHEONGIL SHIPPING

381
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:39,121
Cheongil Shipping, the company
Mr. Lee Jin-su was in charge of.

382
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,706
Could it be related to that?

383
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,208
Wait, that reminds me.

384
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,126
Before they went bankrupt,

385
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,797
Cheongil Shipping was investigated
for fake tax invoices.

386
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,090
Hang on. I saw it earlier.

387
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,429
Oh, here.

388
00:25:56,514 --> 00:26:00,268
It says the investigation started
with a tip from inside the customs office.

389
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,605
What if Min Ju-yeong
was the one who tipped them off?

390
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,692
He probably
found those fake invoices

391
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,485
before the system was digitized.

392
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,447
Cheongil Shipping
must have been one of them.

393
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,700
Oh,

394
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:16,826
Now it all makes sense.

395
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,745
Those old records. They were a gold mine.

396
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,916
He used them to blackmail people,

397
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,961
take bribes, and build connections.

398
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,214
Once he had real power behind him,

399
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,425
he went off the rails.

400
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,468
I swear, I really don't know!

401
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,846
How the hell should I know
where Oh Dollar is!

402
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,807
He took out Oh Dollar,
tricked that punk Leo…

403
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,728
…and wiped out all the other gangs.

404
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:49,817
GWANGHO LOGISTICS
2025 TAX INVOICE

405
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,111
That's how he started
taking over the city.

406
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,572
One piece of paper at a time.

407
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,658
He had 'em by the throat,

408
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,619
and nothing scared him anymore.

409
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,581
If you can just find those papers,
we can crush them all.

410
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,751
Take out the trash
and finally clean out Insung.

411
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,003
But how? We've got no clue
where he stashed them.

412
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,421
Another container?

413
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,922
I doubt it.

414
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,674
He'd hide those somewhere safer.

415
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,384
The documents are way too important.

416
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,721
If they were in a container,
we would've found something by now.

417
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,557
We already searched
every container worth checking too.

418
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,934
We could ask someone, though.

419
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,395
The one who locked them up.

420
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,022
Who locked them up?

421
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:31,901
Min Ju-yeong.

422
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,115
A trap for the rat.

423
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,701
We'll make sure he knows exactly…

424
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,120
where we're planning to show.

425
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,414
How?

426
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,212
First, let's handle the mole situation.

427
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,589
RIU, focus your search
on the southern side.

428
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,634
Our guys will cover
the search of the northern area.

429
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,554
Keep low.
We gotta stay completely under the radar.

430
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:01,847
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

431
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,600
If Min Ju-yeong finds out
that'll be game over.

432
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,478
This is our last chance
to catch that asshole.

433
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,771
Got it?

434
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,356
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

435
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,653
Please limit phone use
as much as possible.

436
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:19,115
Use these to communicate.
Set it to channel four.

437
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:21,992
Here you go. Take one.

438
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:24,912
It's channel four!

439
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:25,955
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

440
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,428
As Dong-ju suggested,

441
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,763
let's use the informant
from the investigations unit.

442
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:46,142
We can't trust anyone right now,
not even Dae-yong.

443
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:49,603
Okay.

444
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,607
-Okay. Let's move.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,369
So, are you sure this thing even works?

446
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:12,668
This may seem outdated,
but it's CIA equipment.

447
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,087
Got impressive range
and runs like a charm.

448
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,423
Plus, I'm the one handling it, so…

449
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,216
Can you hear something, though? Ow.

450
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,136
I'm the one handling it.

451
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,017
He's just fiddling with it.

452
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,065
-Hold it up right!
-Oh, shit.

453
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,317
Then come do it yourself.

454
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,653
I can't get a signal
because you're gripping it all wrong!

455
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,490
Put those down.

456
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,992
All is working fine down here!

457
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,745
That idiot's got zero redeeming traits.
He's got squat!

458
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,170
-No sign of him yet at the intersection…
-I'm the one handling it.

459
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,797
-Quit dragging RIU's name through the mud.
-That guy's completely useless.

460
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,425
What exactly are we doing?
Think this will catch Min Ju-yeong?

461
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,303
Uh, don't ask me.
For now we just have to do what they say.

462
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,597
-Damn. Who is this mole?
-I think Go Man-sik…

463
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,057
-CIA gear, they say.
-…is suspecting me now.

464
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,517
No, not you, Captain.

465
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,936
-Solid as hell. Just annoying sometimes.
-I'm gonna step out for a smoke.

466
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,146
-I'll be right back.
-He's just fiddling with it.

467
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,814
I'm exhausted.

468
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,488
Yeah!

469
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,034
After long hours of trying hard,

470
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,036
someone's finally talking to him.

471
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,165
Uh, hi, can you hear me?

472
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,460
I'm not exactly sure what's going on,

473
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,879
but it looks like they're trying
to track you down.

474
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,298
Everyone's on stakeout.

475
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:44,051
Once you decide where to go,
I'll help you out.

476
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,304
But not until the payment goes through.

477
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,890
Uh, make sure you stick to that.

478
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,643
At least it's not Dae-yong.

479
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,274
AN DAE-YONG

480
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,410
-You son of a bitch. You goddamn…
-Wh-What? What? What? What?

481
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,537
-You really don't know, huh?
-Wait, what? What's going on?

482
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,247
-Don't play dumb with me, asshole!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

483
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,748
-Back off, you bastards!
-Move! Move!

484
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,085
-He can't protect you!
-Just go do it over there!

485
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,461
For God's sake!

486
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,381
-Captain, what the hell's going on?
-Hey! Stop playing dumb, you bastard!

487
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,425
-Captain.
-Goddamn it.

488
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,760
-Goddamn it. Hey!
-What the hell's your problem?

489
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,095
-What is this?
-Get off me!

490
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,597
What the fuck are you doing with my phone?

491
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,932
-Where's the burner phone?
-What burner phone?

492
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,601
What the hell are you talking about?

493
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,186
What are you digging through the car for?

494
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,022
You son of a bitch.

495
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,398
We know, all right?

496
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,067
We heard you talking
on the phone with Min Ju-yeong!

497
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,154
I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

498
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,406
Why would I talk to him, huh?

499
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,825
Seriously, what the hell's going on here?

500
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,206
Then what's this, man?

501
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,546
Min Ju-yeong, what did he say?

502
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,675
Answer the question!

503
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,345
He… He didn't say anything
that was worth anything.

504
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,763
-You son of a bitch!
-Wait.

505
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,514
It's true. I'm telling the truth.

506
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,933
He only said "okay",
then he quickly hung up.

507
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,226
Said he'd call back later.

508
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,895
Hey. How long you been at this?

509
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,855
It hasn't been long.

510
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,149
-I swear, it's true.
-What else have you sold out?

511
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,484
It's just…

512
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,986
recent intel we picked up on him.
That's it.

513
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:27,738
What is it?

514
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,239
Is everything all right?

515
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:33,410
The Special Criminal Investigation Team
just requested backup, so I'm checking in.

516
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,288
So…

517
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,502
murdering Jong-hun, that was you?

518
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,462
-You fucking bastard!
-Whoa. Hey. Hey, hey.

519
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,089
-Okay. Okay. Okay.
-Let go, damn it!

520
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,091
You…

521
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:52,221
What did he do to you?

522
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,140
He…

523
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,225
He caught me.

524
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,309
Jong-hun.

525
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,480
Did you have something to say to me?

526
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,650
I'll explain everything.
Let's just go talk somewhere else.

527
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,610
No, right here's fine. Just talk.

528
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:09,154
I said I'll explain everything.
Let's take a walk.

529
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,079
You call yourself
a human being?

530
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,293
You don't think Ju-yeong figured it out?

531
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,297
Why don't we just beat
the crap out of this asshole?

532
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,800
No, just wait a little bit.

533
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,386
Ju-yeong's gonna make a move first.

534
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,930
How can you be sure of that?

535
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:38,392
He acts like he's unfazed,
like it was no big deal,

536
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,686
but losing that cash container
must've rattled him.

537
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:46,233
After you've been hit good,
even a fake-out makes you shudder.

538
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,746
He's gonna make a move for sure.

539
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,339
Pick up.

540
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,967
This is how you pay for what you did.

541
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,387
Make it up to Jong-hun.

542
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:22,770
Hello?

543
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:30,569
RESTRICTED NUMBER

544
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,952
I need
Gumyeon Intersection to be cleared.

545
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,163
And I need a truck.

546
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,290
Okay. I'll check
and get back to you.

547
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,512
Well, we goin' or not?

548
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,474
You sure he's okay?
Something's wrong with his head.

549
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,392
When did he get smart? It scares me.

550
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,602
Come on. Let's go.

551
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,104
Right.

552
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,001
Hey, Shin, you ready? Ju-yeong's
coming through Gumyeon Intersection.

553
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,169
Don't let him out of your sight.

554
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:31,046
-No slipups.
-Yes, sir.

555
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,722
We'll clear the way for you.
Don't worry.

556
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,726
He's heading toward Insung Middle School.

557
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,770
-Should we deploy the patrol now?
-Yeah.

558
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,606
All right, patrol unit seven, move in.

559
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,629
Patrol unit's done.

560
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,556
Target vehicle's on the move again.

561
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,808
He's turning left at Jungang Intersection,

562
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,269
heading toward Insung Industrial Park.

563
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,902
Target's entering Gumyeon Underpass now.

564
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,115
Stop, Misha.

565
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,620
What's taking so long?

566
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,874
Captain, he went into
the Gumyeon Underpass,

567
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,042
but he's not coming out.

568
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,586
What do you mean he's not coming out?

569
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,338
Jae-hong, we're almost there.

570
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,027
-He's not in there?
-No.

571
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,075
Shit.

572
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,289
This bastard hijacked a car
and took the other exit!

573
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,625
Check every vehicle
that came out of the underpass!

574
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,711
Can you show me all the vehicles
that came out of the underpass?

575
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,421
They're checking the vehicles that exited.

576
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,133
Yeah, but he took off without the truck.

577
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,093
So? What about it?

578
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,679
Captain.

579
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,763
Have you considered…

580
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,432
What if Ju-yeong's
not after the documents?

581
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,730
Destroy all the documents now.

582
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,112
Just burn everything.

583
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,156
Get rid of it.

584
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,159
Where do you think
he kept those documents?

585
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,205
Once you're through that underpass,

586
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,124
you can get to Unseon-dong in Yeonsang-gu,

587
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,127
Geumjeong-dong, Chungmu-dong,
and Anseong-dong in Jeong-gu.

588
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,878
Yeonsang… Yeonsang-gu?

589
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,297
Wait a second. Yeonsang-gu…

590
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,009
Yeah, the mayor used to be
the head of that district.

591
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,096
-He was the head?
-Yeah, I used to live there, you know!

592
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,640
-Good catch. Attaboy.
-Mm-hmm.

593
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,142
That dirtbag grew up there

594
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,769
-and held office there for quite a while.
-Yeah.

595
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,858
He would need to find some huge storage
space to store all those documents.

596
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,570
A safe place where they won't
be damaged, even after a long time.

597
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,321
LIST OF BUILDINGS

598
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,075
Here it is. Look.

599
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,911
Your reasoning skills are as good as mine.

600
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,204
That's the one. Yes.

601
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,168
When the mayor
first took office as district head,

602
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,669
the first project he pushed for

603
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,963
was building
the Yeonsang-gu Public Library.

604
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,007
And it has an underground archive.

605
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,469
-Freeze! Now
-Insung Police. Stop what you're doing!

606
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,096
-Put that down! Put it down!
-Shut down the shredder! Shut it down!

607
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,518
Don't move! Don't move!

608
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,982
Wow. So these are all records
of their corruption, huh?

609
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,277
Luckily, not much was shredded.
Most of the files are still here.

610
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,154
COMPANY NAME: TAE CORPORATION

611
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,531
I found it.

612
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,116
TAE Corporation.

613
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,369
TAE CORPORATION
TAX INVOICES

614
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,622
All right. Here you go.

615
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,627
This stuff reeks of corruption.

616
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,838
Let's go get him.

617
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,927
Oh! Oh, hey. How'd it go?

618
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,970
-What did Commissioner Cho say?
-I couldn't speak to him.

619
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,055
Visitors aren't allowed.

620
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,057
Goddamn it, you idiot!

621
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,769
You seriously came back empty-handed?
What the hell were you doing?

622
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:56,978
You dumbass!

623
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:59,815
Oh, shit! This is driving me insane!

624
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,026
Pan-yeol, that bastard's
not picking up his phone!

625
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,029
Come on! What are you waiting for?
Get the fucking car ready now!

626
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,871
Forward, march!

627
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,918
Right, face! Forward, march!

628
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,756
He's going down the central stairs.
Stop him.

629
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,299
Walking up the stairs now.

630
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,393
Shit!

631
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,244
Wow.

632
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:58,373
-Company, halt!
-One, two!

633
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,297
That's all I know. I swear to God.

634
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,718
I did all those things only because
Min Ju-yeong, that bastard, made me.

635
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:13,096
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?
Tell me you do.

636
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,766
I'm not lying. Look,
there's context to all of this, you know.

637
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,185
Uh-huh.

638
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,649
-They're all here now.
-Who's here?

639
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,359
What do you mean?

640
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,736
Is it Cho Pan-yeol?

641
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,946
All right, looks like we got
what we need here, so…

642
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,202
-let's wrap this up.
-Wrap this up?

643
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,621
Oh, come on, guys. W-What are you doing?

644
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:40,749
Wait!

645
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,170
No, don't do this! Stop! Stop!

646
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,422
Oh, hey, call 119! Call 119!

647
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,049
Come on, guys! Stop! Call 119 now!

648
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:50,258
911, my ass.

649
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,844
Hold on. Does the commissioner know
what you're doing?

650
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,639
Do you know where Cho Pan-yeol is?
Bring him here now!

651
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:56,932
I told you everything I know!

652
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,143
It's not what you think
between me and Min Ju-yeong!

653
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,895
Why don't you save your lame excuses
for the press?

654
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,647
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

655
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,610
No! Stop! Don't do this!

656
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,780
Do… Come on. Don't do this to me!

657
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,706
Can we just talk, please?
Let's talk it out, okay?

658
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,917
Let's just slip out quietly, please!
We can slip out--

659
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,001
Bye now.

660
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:37,764
HAPPY INSUNG WITH CITIZENS

661
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,024
Why are you all doing this to me?
Go away! Get away from me!

662
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:51,194
Enough!

663
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:52,946
You get away now!

664
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,114
I'm not the mayor!

665
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,198
Get out of here!

666
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,784
Get out of here! Get out! Shit!

667
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,786
I'm being serious. Just get away.

668
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,870
Get away.

669
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,665
You scared me.

670
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,501
He's saying he's not the mayor.

671
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,753
Jesus.
Then what is he, a doomsayer?

672
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,261
He wasn't even running the city.

673
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,013
He was out here preaching the end times.

674
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,265
Doomsayer. Seriously, that was hilarious.

675
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,854
In a shocking turn of events,

676
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,316
Min, a former customs officer recently
implicated in a drug smuggling case,

677
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:32,652
was confirmed to have had long-standing
ties with high-ranking officials,

678
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,404
including Insung Mayor Roh Deok-gyu.

679
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,656
For decades, he's been operating
in the shadows, protected

680
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,242
-by the people meant to stop him.
-Man, that feels so damn good.

681
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,577
Let's dig in, shall we?

682
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,082
Haven't had an appetite like this
in a while.

683
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,044
I'll go get some more water.

684
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,091
Hey, Yoon. You all right?

685
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,510
Yeah, you look a little pale.

686
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,388
Are you burning out? You look tired.

687
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:06,186
Me? Burning out? No, I'm fine.

688
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,276
Ah. The meat's so nice and tender.
Excuse me!

689
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,944
-Can we order some extra meat?
-Sure.

690
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,488
-And kimchi too.
-All right.

691
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:18,990
-Here.
-Mmm.

692
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,451
Thank you.

693
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,373
Come on.

694
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,504
-Where are Dong-ju and Jong-hyeon?
-They're in the restroom, I think.

695
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,773
Are you an idiot?

696
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,902
Stop pushing yourself like that.
You're being obvious.

697
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,946
It's those meds. They've got me in a fog.

698
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,615
Uh, why'd you send me
to that quack doctor?

699
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,326
Hide that before Han-na sees it.

700
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,130
I'm good.

701
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,683
What are you staring at?

702
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:31,479
I didn't know I meant that much.

703
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:32,564
To you, I mean.

704
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,691
What are you talking about?

705
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,611
Captain told me. I know.

706
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:44,284
You better be grateful to Kim
for the rest of your life.

707
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:47,579
Just to save an idiot like you,
he gave it all up.

708
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,581
What are you talking about?

709
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,129
Sergeant Kim gave up
his company shares.

710
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,589
He did that to save you.

711
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,883
You need to help us.

712
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,428
Well…

713
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,723
I get why you'd give up
your entire fortune for me.

714
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:07,932
I'm just that charming.

715
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:09,267
Yoon Dong-ju.

716
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,021
Those side effects hit hard. Don't they?

717
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,158
Dong-ju, take it. It's the nursing home.

718
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:29,746
Hello, it's Dong-ju.

719
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:35,126
You're safe here. There's
an officer on watch around the clock.

720
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:03,947
I'm sorry, Auntie.

721
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:09,327
I'm sorry, all this…
This is what I dragged you into.

722
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,664
I don't have the words.

723
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,542
Don't say that.

724
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,963
You have nothing to apologize for.

725
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,174
They told me everything.

726
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,303
Thank you, Dong-ju.

727
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,437
Look at you.

728
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,690
Why do you look so…

729
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,651
It breaks my heart.

730
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:52,829
You're not just close.
You're as good as my own son.

731
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,916
I shouldn't have been so harsh to you.

732
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:02,338
Saying I didn't want to see you again,
that had to hurt.

733
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,175
It's okay. It didn't.

734
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:14,684
Dong-ju?

735
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:17,437
Yeah?

736
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,814
From now on…

737
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,776
let's live like a family.

738
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,154
As a mother and with her son.

739
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:28,823
Lean on each other.

740
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,492
You and I've been through enough.

741
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,202
You want that?

742
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,795
My dear Dong-ju.

743
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:45,757
My son.

744
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,108
Don't cry.

745
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,268
The Japanese canceled the deal.

746
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:42,647
They said penalty fees weren't necessary.

747
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,112
So, they're planning to kill me then.

748
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:51,155
What should we do with the Candy?

749
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,084
Looks like he got involved with
Min Ju-yeong, taking bribes from clubs.

750
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,461
Turns out,

751
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,672
he had gambling debt and owed loan sharks.

752
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,888
What's up, Sergeant Kim?

753
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,766
You… You found Oh Jong-gu?

754
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:29,569
What the hell are you doing?

755
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,612
Get out now! You need to rest right now!

756
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,239
Min Ju-Yeong's not resting.

757
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,659
Come on. We have to go.

758
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,289
For God's sake.

759
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:50,214
We need to find it fast if we want
to figure out where Min Ju-yeong is.

760
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:53,718
I'm heading out to the scene for a bit,
all right?

761
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,762
Yeah. Don't worry about things here.

762
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,056
MOM

763
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,018
Another mystery, another win.

764
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,729
Hi, Mom. I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later.

765
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,024
What?

766
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:10,902
Why are you looking for Dong-ju?

767
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,612
I just need
to check something with him

768
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:13,905
for some insurance paperwork,

769
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,990
but he hasn't been answering his phone.

770
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,743
By the way, is he sick?
What's wrong with him?

771
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,246
Hey, you're not seeing him, are you?

772
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,125
That's not your concern.

773
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:29,378
Oh, and, Mom?

774
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,839
I can take care of myself now.

775
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,174
Don't worry about me.

776
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,928
SAFETY IS OUR COMPANY'S TOP PRIORITY

777
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,601
-Hey. Did you get him?
-No.

778
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,395
He's gotta be in here somewhere.
Let's split up and search.

779
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:48,689
Whoa, what the hell?

780
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:49,816
You can't be serious.

781
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:51,108
You stay put. Just wait.

782
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,528
Oh, come on. What are you talking about?

783
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:54,779
-Let's go.
-Come on. Take these off!

784
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,864
-Wait here. Just wait.
-Jae-hong! Wait! No, no, wait! Wait!

785
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,242
Jae-hong! Kim Jong-hyeon! Captain!

786
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,869
Are you kidding me? Take these off!

787
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,496
Let me go with you! Come on!

788
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,250
Damn it.

789
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,086
Ah, Jesus.

790
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,634
Shit.

791
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:22,014
Damn it!

792
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,600
Oh Jong-gu!

793
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:28,646
He's not here.

794
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,816
Sergeant Kim. About the cuffs…

795
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,151
I mean, Dong-ju can't break free, can he?

796
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,696
There's no way he can escape those.

797
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,658
Hey, Oh Jong-gu!

798
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,418
Jesus Christ.

799
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,720
Hey, where are you going?

800
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,055
You've got nowhere left to run.

801
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:08,644
What now?

802
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,397
Still standing? Didn't learn your lesson?

803
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:14,066
Do you wanna die or what?

804
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,027
Not today.

805
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,696
This time, you're goin' down.

806
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,532
Yo.

807
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,411
Hey.

808
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:09,664
Thanks a lot.

809
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,291
That thing was getting in the way.

810
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,460
And guess what?

811
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,046
-Rematch time.
-This fucker.

812
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:25,846
Come on.

813
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:31,268
Fucking little…

814
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,527
You little shit. Think you're clever now?

815
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,529
Trying to tire me out?

816
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,905
Look who finally caught on.

817
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,991
So you're not as dumb as you look.

818
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:46,534
I'm not gonna lie. Your punch?

819
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,328
It's pretty good.

820
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,417
Hey, focus, old man.

821
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,003
No wonder you can't read any of my moves.

822
00:54:57,086 --> 00:55:00,548
You little shit, you're trying to
teach me now? Do I look like a joke?

823
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,425
You're not a joke.

824
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:04,218
You're just pathetic.

825
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,512
What?

826
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:08,514
Back when you were still in the ring,

827
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,475
I put you on a pedestal, I did.

828
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:15,479
And who the hell do you think
made me end up like this?

829
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,648
If you hadn't backed out of that contract,

830
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:20,985
you think I'd be kissing
that bastard Min Ju-yeong's ass right now?

831
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,361
Don't blame me for that.

832
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,572
It's all because you're an idiot.

833
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,866
What did you just say?

834
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,661
That's what you said to me that day,
after I lost at the national team trials.

835
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:34,707
I never learned much about boxing
from you, but I never forgot that line.

836
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,293
You cocky little shit,
who the hell do you think you are?

837
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:44,925
Ow! Oh, God.

838
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,928
Go train some more, kid.
This is how you use your head.

839
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,240
Get up.

840
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,715
Oh.

841
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,467
You know what?

842
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,928
I just remembered something else.

843
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:33,891
What you used to say to me
before a match. Every time.

844
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,645
"Greedy moves bring trouble.

845
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,314
Your fists start getting heavier.

846
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:42,900
That's the slip.

847
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:45,277
Then it's over!"

848
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,458
Fuck.

849
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:02,461
Yoon Dong-ju!
I told you to stay in the damn car!

850
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:04,588
What is that?

851
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,135
Damn it, Dong-ju!

852
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,637
This damn little mutt
can't even stay tied up!

853
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,098
What's wrong? I took him down, didn't I?

854
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,516
Oh, yeah? Well done!

855
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,270
Oh Jong-gu, you're under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act,

856
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,856
-and for using and selling fake plates.
-Oh! J-Ji!

857
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,115
You knew about Dong-ju's condition too.

858
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,199
Don't lie to me.

859
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,036
Oh, so you knew as well?

860
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:41,584
-Has it gotten worse?
-Well… … uh,

861
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,170
Kim took him to the hospital
a few days ago.

862
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:48,924
If you all knew he was sick,

863
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:50,384
-how could you--
-No, it's…

864
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:02,146
Oh Jong-gu.

865
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,662
Does it hurt badly?

866
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,789
No, not badly at all.

867
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:21,874
I'm fine.

868
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,463
Oh Jong-gu's head was as hard as a rock.

869
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,797
You're not fine. It hurts badly.

870
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:31,383
Come on, this is nothing.
I'm telling you.

871
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:33,219
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

872
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:34,803
It's just a tiny little…

873
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:38,349
just a tiny little crack, I think.
If I take good care of it, it'll heal

874
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,684
-in no time--
-Not a big deal, just a little crack?

875
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,023
Uh,

876
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,400
w-what's wrong?

877
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:52,529
How long were you gonna
keep pretending you're fine?

878
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,741
I told you to tell me
when it hurts, didn't I?

879
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:58,118
When you need to lean on someone,
lean on me.

880
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:01,747
Stop keeping it all in and hurting
in silence. You're not alone anymore.

881
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:05,376
I don't want to see you in pain,
so if you care about me at all…

882
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,881
Jesus.

883
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,471
How long have you known
something was wrong?

884
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,889
How could I not know?

885
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:27,314
I figured you didn't want me to know, so…

886
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,151
I'm sorry.

887
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:34,238
What? Why…
Why are you apologizing?

888
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,948
I'm the one who didn't tell you.

889
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:41,078
I just didn't want you to see me that low.

890
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,706
For you to worry about my condition.

891
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,417
I'm sorry, Han-na.

892
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:52,131
So what now?

893
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,884
Come on. Don't worry so much.

894
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:59,221
Um, well…

895
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,348
…Kim found me a good doctor.

896
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,268
She said as long as I take my meds

897
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,854
and keep up with the treatment,
I'll be fine.

898
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,026
Well, you better be fine.

899
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,862
If you're not,
I'm actually gonna kill you.

900
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,240
Next time, say something,
even if it's small.

901
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,702
Tell me everything. When you take
your meds, doctor's visits, all of it.

902
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,746
-You got that?
-Mm-hmm.

903
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,709
Actually, I'm feeling a little
off-balance right now.

904
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:31,920
Oh!

905
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,849
And you? Are you feeling better?

906
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,102
Mm-hmm. I guess so, yeah.

907
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:50,731
I stopped taking meds a while ago.

908
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,527
I guess I'm your cure, huh?

909
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,614
Maybe.

910
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,240
I'm glad.

911
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,744
I'm sorry, Han-na.

912
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,330
Hey!

913
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:12,836
Give me your hand.

914
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,131
Does it hurt bad?

915
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,008
Nope, it doesn't.

916
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,435
-So…
-Hmm?

917
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,146
Do you really think we can do it?

918
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,235
Of course.

919
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:39,154
Absolutely.

920
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,329
RESTRICTED NUMBER

921
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,600
Ah, fuck. My best customers…

922
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:16,442
Where's the product?

923
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:29,746
Looks a lil bit different.

924
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,458
Is this the wrong product?

925
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,209
Is this fake?

926
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,996
Hey, how much of this do you have?

927
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:18,128
It's packed in the truck.

928
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,131
We can't afford all of that.

929
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:23,258
That's way beyond our budget.

930
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:24,551
Sorry, man.

931
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,136
It's free.

932
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:30,349
But I need you to do something.

933
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:10,514
"A hazy fog rolls in."

934
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,683
"The street flows along."

935
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,687
"With no harbor to rest in,

936
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:21,900
I stand there with my hands
on the red postbox on the street corner."

937
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,994
Hey, Good Boy.

938
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,580
How about you give me my book now?

939
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,086
Min Ju-yeong.

940
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:45,924
He's one crazy bastard,
much worse than you could ever imagine.

941
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:48,343
If he wants something, he has to have it.

942
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:51,471
And if he can't, he'll destroy it.

943
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,642
I don't know when it's going to be.

944
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:58,478
Although, now that he's cornered,
maybe this is it.

945
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:01,857
Watch your back.

946
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,445
You're on the ropes.

947
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:13,410
179-45, CHEONGMA 7 FACTORY,
CHEONGMA-DONG, YUWOL-GU

948
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:17,998
CAPTAIN GO MAN-SIK

949
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,293
-Yes, Captain?
-Ji,

950
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:24,504
we got a tip that the truck carrying
the drugs is headed to Cheongma-dong now.

951
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,214
Jae-hong and I are on our way there.

952
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:28,383
I'll find Jong-hyeon.
We'll meet you there.

953
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,058
Officer Yoon!

954
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:40,145
Officer Yoon, I'm here!

955
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:42,898
Car keys!

956
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,232
Take her.

957
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:50,697
Han-na, are you on your way?

958
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,282
That truck might explode.

959
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:54,910
We have to stop it
before it gets into town no matter what.

960
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:56,703
-'Kay. Got it.
-Let's find that truck.

961
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,163
Okay. Be careful, guys.

962
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:33,490
Is it that truck?

963
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,451
Oh, truck! There's a truck!

964
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:39,413
Jong-hyeon?

965
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,754
Take it easy.

966
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:04,479
Hold on tight.

967
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,114
Shit.

968
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,417
-Out of the truck!
-Out of the truck now!

969
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,630
Ah, shit.

970
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:12,798
Get out of there right now!

971
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:16,384
-I'm not gettin' out, assholes!
-Oh, hey, stop! Stop!

972
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,822
Look forward to it.

973
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,366
Today's going to be a day to remember.

974
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:24,077
What's Min Ju-yeong's next move?
Think carefully here.

975
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,705
Who do you think
would still help Min Ju-yeong now?

976
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:28,748
It's almost time. Watch closely.

977
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,418
Listen closely
to what I'm about to say.

978
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,379
Dozens of high-ranking
officials in Insung have been in bed

979
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,673
with Min Ju-yeong all these years.

980
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,801
You really think you can solve that
all at once?

981
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:42,053
I'm gonna give you a chance.

982
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:45,724
We've got to find that bastard fast,
or who knows what else he'll pull.

983
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,144
The days when the whole world was on fire…

984
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:52,314
Let's go!

985
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:56,109
Someone like you
isn't even worth an excuse.

986
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,402
I'll catch you!

987
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:01,114
This doesn't end with me.
Don't kid yourself.

988
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,825
We were heroes.
