1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,056
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,517
Prêts?

4
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,060
Allez.

5
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,896
Kim Jong-hyeon goes in for an attack.

6
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,233
Roger successfully parries
and lands a riposte.

7
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,778
Halt. Attack parried. Riposte awarded.

8
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,446
Is something wrong with his ankle?

9
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,783
Kim Jong-hyeon is having trouble
lunging forward today.

10
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,503
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

11
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,550
The slowed footwork is making
his movements more exaggerated,

12
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,344
leaving him exposed to more attacks.

13
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,679
An attack point.

14
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,097
Roger scores a point.

15
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,770
What are you doing? Get up.

16
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,689
His opponent is left-handed,

17
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,609
so he has to read his moves
and anticipate the incoming attacks.

18
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,332
En garde.

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,084
Prêts?

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,169
Allez.

21
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,219
-What was that?
-Oh, my.

22
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,887
-What happened?
-What?

23
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,057
What just happened?

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,184
There's been an unexpected turn of events.

25
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,273
It appears that the blade snapped suddenly

26
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,568
and pierced his mask from beneath.

27
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,778
This doesn't look good at all.

28
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,196
This is truly unfortunate.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,867
Let's hope his eye injury
isn't too serious.

30
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,504
Jong-hyeon, are you okay?

31
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,685
Are you sure you're okay?

32
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,769
I can continue.

33
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,280
I can do this.

34
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,157
I can do this.

35
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,540
En garde.

36
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,419
Prêts?

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,504
Allez.

38
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,439
Wait. I'm hurt.

39
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,768
Look at this idiot here.

40
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,103
Hey, does this scare you?

41
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,063
Does it?

42
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,981
Does it scare you?

43
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,233
Are you afraid?

44
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,114
What happened to Superman?

45
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,618
You were flying around a while ago,
but now you're shaking.

46
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,162
Come over here. Come on!

47
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,829
Damn it.

48
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,874
You asshole!

49
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,167
Darn, I missed.

50
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,140
Hey, you.

51
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,477
My guy here doesn't even care for needles.
Why are you bullying him?

52
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,148
He's with you? I didn't know.

53
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,232
It's okay.

54
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,276
Now you know.

55
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,155
And now you have to pay
for messing him up.

56
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,824
You little hamster.

57
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,325
A hamster?

58
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,910
You son of a bitch!

59
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,875
You asshole.

60
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,507
You little shit.

61
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,318
You asshole.

62
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,487
Get up.

63
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,032
We're just getting started.

64
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,673
Yoon Dong-ju!

65
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,938
Mr. Min!

66
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,481
Hey!

67
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,032
Are you dead?

68
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,412
You're still alive.

69
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,583
How does it feel

70
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,544
lying in the street?

71
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,840
Not like the ring, is it?

72
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,265
You can scheme and plot all you want,

73
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,183
but this is the outcome.

74
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,978
Why do you make things hard for yourself?

75
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,148
That's what sets me apart,

76
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,068
you dirty asshole.

77
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,621
Save the childish games for the ring.

78
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,581
I told you before.

79
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,333
Don't even dream

80
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,627
about fighting for justice.

81
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,254
You see…

82
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,340
we risk our lives for this.

83
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,177
Today…

84
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,307
is going to be a very memorable day.

85
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,228
You can look forward to it.

86
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,314
Here. Jab.

87
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,321
Childish games?

88
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,038
Those of us stepping into the ring…

89
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,833
risk our lives just the same.

90
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,380
Consider yourselves lucky!

91
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,385
Hey, little mutt.
Move unless you want to die.

92
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,647
You okay?

93
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,192
What about you?

94
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,321
-Where's Han-na?
-We have to go find her.

95
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,405
Hey!

96
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,911
That's going to leave a scar
on your pretty face.

97
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,664
What are you doing, you idiots?

98
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,874
Move your cars. Snap to it!

99
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,337
Get the goods and go!

100
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,716
Hurry up.

101
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,596
Let's go.

102
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,058
Han-na!

103
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,019
-Ji Han-na!
-Han-na!

104
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,111
Han-na.

105
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,196
Han-na!

106
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,247
Han-na.

107
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,332
Han-na?

108
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,500
Ji Han-na!

109
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,127
She's not here.

110
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,921
Han-na!

111
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,216
Han-na!

112
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,638
Sergeant Kim!

113
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,515
You okay, Dong-ju?
What about the motorcycle?

114
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,310
Are you okay, Captain?

115
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,603
I think I dozed off a bit.

116
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,980
That's not important.
Where's Senior Officer Ji?

117
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,607
I can't reach her on the phone.

118
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,400
There's no way to contact her.
What do we do?

119
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,113
What's the matter with the signal?

120
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,615
This whole area is like that.

121
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,742
The nearby cell tower is acting up.

122
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,245
I hear it's going to take a while
to fix it.

123
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,081
This all happened
after the riot police pulled out.

124
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,500
They trapped our guys here
and attacked as planned.

125
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,795
Isn't there a tracker on the container?

126
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,129
It's right here.

127
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,132
It's busted.

128
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,345
Guys, they set us up.

129
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,430
Jae-hong's in bad shape.

130
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,808
He's heading to the hospital,
but his lower back is wrecked.

131
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,643
After the Jungdong Tunnel,

132
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,437
the road forks off to Seo-dong,
Cheoli-dong, and Cheolsam-dong.

133
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,607
Seeing how they cut off the network
and all the surrounding CCTVs,

134
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,984
they're very meticulous.

135
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,152
You'll need backup to catch them by today.

136
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,571
Think you can manage it?

137
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,408
We have to keep looking.

138
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,578
Han-na will be there.

139
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,252
-Your belongings are in the back seat.
-Thank you.

140
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,963
I'll check in with Jae-hong first

141
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,631
and then head to the agency for backup.

142
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,551
Go to the hospital with the captain
and get checked out.

143
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,060
I said go to the hospital.

144
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,188
Kim Jong-hyeon.

145
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,649
We have to find Han-na.

146
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,943
You're in no shape to do that.

147
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,028
I'll go find her myself.

148
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,238
Then get in the car. There's no time.

149
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,913
Get out of the way.

150
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,041
Just get in. I'll drive.

151
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,295
Get it together
if you want to find Han-na.

152
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,188
The road forks
to Cheoli-dong and Seo-dong here.

153
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,106
Let's make a stop here.

154
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:04,964
Which way did they go?

155
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,664
This is Han-na's.

156
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,387
I'll look in this direction.

157
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:35,930
Okay.

158
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,986
Yoon Dong-ju!

159
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,654
I found something.

160
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,288
I think it's that way.

161
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,349
This is Han-na's, right?

162
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,268
Yeah, it is.

163
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,687
Hang on. Stop the car.

164
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,952
The phone's busted.

165
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,789
It's hers, right?

166
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,757
Let's get going.

167
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:55,927
Hurry up!

168
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,345
What are you waiting for?

169
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,056
Hurry up and get moving!

170
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,183
Check the goods carefully!

171
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,477
Hurry up!

172
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,937
Unload all this before sundown!

173
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,111
Get the doors open. Are the goods secure?

174
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,863
Go over everything.

175
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,197
Hey, the trucks are here.

176
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,961
They divided the goods
and split up to avoid getting tracked.

177
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,006
They had multiple vehicles,
judging by the tire tracks.

178
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,402
Four, one, three, one.

179
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,029
What's this?

180
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,054
INSUNG 96
P4131

181
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,222
I think it's a license plate number.

182
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,849
-We have to find this truck quickly.
-Hold on.

183
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,189
Captain, can you run a plate number

184
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,358
for a truck ending in 4131?

185
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,275
Thank you.

186
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,655
Let's go back to the agency
and check all the working CCTVs.

187
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,076
Captain, did you run…

188
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,003
Wait a second. I'm getting a call.

189
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,421
It's the senior superintendent.

190
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,673
Just decline.

191
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,925
What's this about?
We don't have time. Where's our backup?

192
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,468
Backup, my ass.

193
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,637
If we get caught, we can't do anything.

194
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,431
Our hands will be tied.

195
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,225
How dare this bastard not answer my call?

196
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,060
The person you are calling cannot…

197
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,646
-Dong-ju isn't answering either.
-Neither is Sergeant Kim.

198
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,064
Hey, let's go over there to listen in.

199
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,991
I've had it with these idiots.

200
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,285
Do you really not know
where Go Man-sik is?

201
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,079
I saw him at the tunnel, but after that…

202
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,414
After that?

203
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,707
I haven't seen him at all since.

204
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,459
If I do, I'll bring him in immediately.

205
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,419
Look, it's Go Man-sik!

206
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,504
There he is! Oh, wait.

207
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,298
Jeez, that's not him.

208
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,676
-Cut it out, you punk.
-Yes, sir.

209
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:27,722
He's gone now.

210
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,690
So 96 P4131 is an unregistered vehicle.

211
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,443
Senior Officer Shin requested
the traffic unit to track its route,

212
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,987
-so something will come up.
-Isn't Jae-hong in the hospital?

213
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,322
Over there.

214
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:46,908
Jae-hong.

215
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,745
How's your back? Is it really bad?

216
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,623
No, I just sprained it.

217
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,707
What about you two?

218
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,584
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

219
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,922
We need to find Senior Officer Ji.
I can't just lie down and wait.

220
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,841
I need to do what I can.
I'd feel more at ease that way.

221
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,095
He's right. We have to do
whatever it takes to locate her.

222
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,679
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

223
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,389
Hop in.

224
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,641
-I have to get back in?
-Get in.

225
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,187
Who is it?

226
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,980
Do you know what time it is?

227
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,858
Who the hell are you?

228
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,236
For goodness' sake.

229
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,159
Who are these guys with the ugly mugs?

230
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,246
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

231
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,707
What are you doing here at this hour?
I need sleep to survive.

232
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,793
I was dreaming about getting married.

233
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,962
And why do you all look like crap?

234
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,840
Something happened.
So did you look into it?

235
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,050
I'm a private investigator,
not a pawnshop owner.

236
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,971
I'm a pawnshop owner,
not a private investigator.

237
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,013
What?

238
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,682
-Thank you.
-What do you think you're doing?

239
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,725
Look at you,
blatantly taking advantage of me.

240
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,104
Our country produced Nobel laureates.
You should have better manners than this.

241
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,898
Just wait a bit.
They said they'd get back to me.

242
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,534
Here's the truck with the 4131 plate,

243
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,953
spotted at the Seo-dong Intersection.

244
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,123
From here, it took Route 23,

245
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,333
but there's no footage of where it went.

246
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,092
Route 23 is right there.

247
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,845
But there are too many exits.

248
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,431
They're all side roads,
so we can't check them all.

249
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:39,353
We'll have to check footage
for every truck that took Route 23.

250
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:44,734
They would've needed many trucks
to move all the goods in the container.

251
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,819
We should look into
where those trucks came from.

252
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,197
-What about Oh Jong-gu?
-It's not him.

253
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,035
He's right. Oh Jong-gu's drivers
are at the City Hall protest.

254
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,829
I don't even know where to begin.

255
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,089
Hello?

256
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:09,717
I've got it, okay?

257
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,094
Yeah?

258
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,721
Right.

259
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,058
What?

260
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:19,435
I see.

261
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,729
Oh, sure.

262
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:22,813
Okay.

263
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,484
-You got word?
-You were right.

264
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,903
Gwang-se contacted a broker to stow away.

265
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,490
-Where?
-Dageum Port, 4 a.m., the Geumdong.

266
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,826
Let's ask the bald eagle.

267
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,372
Geumdong, where are you? I'm here.

268
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,207
Damn it, where is it?

269
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,376
Hey, Geumdong.

270
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,462
Is that you, Geumdong?

271
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,006
Hey. Can you help me with this?

272
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,217
Hey, Gwang-se.

273
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,513
You're just asking for trouble
if you whistle at night.

274
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,599
-Hello, sir.
-Are you happy to see me?

275
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,725
Yes.

276
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,353
-Hey, be careful.
-Damn it. How did he know I'd be here?

277
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:05,940
What am I going to do?

278
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,652
I'm disappointed.

279
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,405
I thought you were on our side.

280
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,031
You're all here.

281
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,246
That's adorable.

282
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,582
Is that what you got from Min Ju-yeong
after selling us out?

283
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,210
No, I bought this myself.

284
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,963
It's a gift for my daughter in Vietnam.

285
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,257
It even has a mustache.

286
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:32,967
Not that.

287
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,678
I mean what's inside.

288
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,436
-Hey.
-Hold him still!

289
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,316
Oh, jeez.

290
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,110
What's this?

291
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,657
Are you trading drugs now, you bastard?

292
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,577
What's the penalty
for trafficking drug precursors?

293
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,953
-Wait, what?
-Ten years.

294
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:04,332
-That's right. Ten years.
-These aren't drugs.

295
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,083
It's the medicine I got for my cold.

296
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,133
We have no time to waste.
Are you going to talk or not?

297
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,385
Stop drinking. Haven't you had enough?

298
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,929
I have to dilute it somehow.

299
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,223
I took so much of it. What if it kills me?

300
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,435
Too much water can kill you too.
Give it here and start talking.

301
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,686
Just leave him be.

302
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,188
Go ahead and drink more.

303
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,151
I don't drink water when I compete.
Do you know why?

304
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,987
One wrong punch in the gut
after drinking water…

305
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,035
could burst your organs.

306
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,205
A bowel rupture hurts so much
that you'll wish you were dead.

307
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,461
I'm done drinking.

308
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,755
Gosh, I'm full. I should stop now.

309
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,256
Now start talking.

310
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,925
I'm not in the mood
to joke around anymore.

311
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,844
Tell us everything. Every last detail.

312
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,142
Then promise you'll protect me this time.

313
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:08,104
I can't keep risking my life
like this anymore.

314
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,035
I only heard that they were dealing
with the Japanese.

315
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,037
The Japanese? Like the yakuza?

316
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,288
Where's the deal going down?

317
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,086
Golden Bunny. I bet he'll know where.

318
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,756
He was in charge of all deals
with the yakuza.

319
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,512
Are you not going to say anything?

320
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,600
Oh Jong-gu took over
all of your operations.

321
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,477
You're dead broke now.

322
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,897
So why are you still loyal
to Min Ju-yeong?

323
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:56,902
Your trial is still ongoing, right?

324
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,071
I hear you're exercising
your right to remain silent.

325
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,199
If you keep it up,
you'll likely be found guilty

326
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,617
of all charges against you.

327
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,078
You'll end up taking the fall

328
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:07,329
for Min Ju-yeong's crimes.

329
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,960
Guess you won't see
your younger brother, Silver Bunny.

330
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,171
He'll be dead by the time you get out.

331
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,971
You met with Min Ju-yeong, didn't you?

332
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,535
What did you do to my brother?

333
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:47,828
He's still alive.

334
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,040
So…

335
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,546
If you want me to talk…

336
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,801
go find my brother.

337
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,767
PROGRESSIVE CORRECTIONS
FOR A BETTER FUTURE

338
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,519
It looks like Min Ju-yeong came by.

339
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,396
He got Golden Bunny
to keep his mouth shut.

340
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,191
It seems his younger brother
is being used as leverage.

341
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,818
How will we find Silver Bunny?

342
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,489
We issued an APB for him over a month ago,
but there hasn't been a single tip.

343
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,907
That means he fled the country.

344
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,785
Do you think Min Ju-yeong
knows his whereabouts?

345
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,955
Let's go look for Han-na for now.

346
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,248
Where do we even start?

347
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,586
It's been almost a day
since we heard from her.

348
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,880
If we don't find her soon…

349
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,639
Stop talking nonsense, Kim Jong-hyeon.

350
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,267
I know Han-na is holding up.

351
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,144
If only we could track her location.

352
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,772
Wherever it is,
Golden Bunny conducted his deals there.

353
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,567
We'll comb through his files
and find the areas he was active in.

354
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,068
That'll take a lot of time.

355
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,861
We don't have any other options.

356
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,572
We have to do everything we can.

357
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,286
I couldn't bring
all the files from the agency.

358
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,496
The RIU will take care of the rest.

359
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,333
How many crimes did he commit?
Why is there so much?

360
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,627
This is all he did over the past 20 years.

361
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,421
I'm sure we'll find something fishy.

362
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,508
METH SMUGGLING
AND VACANT PROPERTY BURGLARY CASE

363
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,926
Sumang-dong, Okmi-gu.

364
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,262
-Sumang-dong, Okmi-gu.
-Daeri-dong.

365
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,556
Which Daeri-dong? Oh, here it is.

366
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,726
-Bumyeong-dong, Jung-gu.
-Bumyeong-dong, Jung-gu.

367
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,521
Help us with our search,

368
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,107
or I'll make you a bald eagle.

369
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,070
Could I start after I eat?

370
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,616
I was so busy running yesterday
that I haven't eaten a thing.

371
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,243
I feel dizzy.

372
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:55,122
I'd be so grateful
for a bowl of ox bone soup.

373
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,000
It'll help wash down
the squeaker in my throat.

374
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,838
Be grateful that I haven't killed you yet.

375
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,131
Thank you, sir.

376
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,453
North Port in Choryeon 1-dong, Jung-gu.

377
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,132
Hey, this is good.

378
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,967
Can I have one too?

379
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,053
-It's good.
-So give me one.

380
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,554
Keep working.

381
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,059
Are you telling me
you're not doing anything?

382
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,227
Haven't you seen the news?

383
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,687
What do you mean?

384
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,814
It's absolute chaos here.

385
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,023
You shouldn't have acted so violently

386
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,441
without reporting your rally
ahead of time.

387
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,318
I didn't throw that soju bottle, did I?

388
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,487
Come on. Calm down, sir.

389
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,072
How can I calm down?

390
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:11,949
I trust you.

391
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:17,162
This is a direct act of defiance
against governmental authority…

392
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,331
So how badly was he hurt?

393
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,250
He has a one-centimeter cut
on his forehead.

394
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,878
In any case, it's crazy here right now,
so we can't provide backup.

395
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:25,963
You…

396
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,340
Damn it.

397
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:32,136
He's putting on a ridiculous show
just to keep us from catching a criminal!

398
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:35,180
How can we not investigate
when one of our own is missing?

399
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,557
I'm so pissed right now.

400
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,018
I'm going straight
to that damn commissioner and…

401
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:41,729
Get back in here.

402
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,355
Authorities are looking
for a man in his thirties

403
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,691
who fled the scene
after throwing a soju bottle…

404
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,609
We didn't expect help anyway.

405
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,987
We'll find her ourselves.

406
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,412
It's unlike you to be so calm.
I thought you'd be losing your shit.

407
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:00,998
I'm holding back.

408
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,380
Finding Han-na is our priority.

409
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:09,715
I'll lose my shit…

410
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,969
once I find her.

411
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,805
INSUNG POLICE COMMISSIONER
TO UNCOVER THE TRUTH

412
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,352
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

413
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:32,613
Is that really Dong-ju?

414
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,948
He's finally acting like a real cop.

415
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,332
BANG

416
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,437
You should get some rest. You look tired.

417
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:08,982
I could say the same thing to you.

418
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,277
Get some rest yourself
before you pass out.

419
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,426
Please check out the sample first.

420
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,095
Something came up,

421
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:41,098
so the goods
will have to be sent in installments.

422
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,600
But let's seal the deal here tonight.

423
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,910
He says he was due the goods yesterday
and that this wasn't the agreement.

424
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,162
I just said something came up.

425
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,457
I thought what mattered
was the goods' quality.

426
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,263
He says he can't trust the goods
because you broke your word.

427
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,519
I'll give you a present.

428
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,027
I play

429
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,697
an essential role in this organization…

430
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,117
as an interpreter.

431
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,877
So?

432
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,588
Did I earn back your trust?

433
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,050
Not satisfied?

434
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:03,972
What about now?

435
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,808
Are you satisfied?

436
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,682
Jeez, Insung sure has gotten big.

437
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,227
These are all the locations
connected to Golden Bunny.

438
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,979
Jeez, that's a lot.

439
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,815
Ruling out places under new ownership
or ones repurposed

440
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,233
will help narrow it down.

441
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,695
Let's scout the places
where the deal is likely to occur.

442
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,280
Okay. We'll let you know
if anything comes up.

443
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,573
And take this guy with you.

444
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,409
He knows every corner of Insung.

445
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,576
-He'll be of help. Go.
-Okay.

446
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,746
That was my first bite.

447
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,207
Please, I was about to have my first bite.

448
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,210
Let me have a bite before we go. Please!

449
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,545
I'm not done yet.

450
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,661
-Are all the goods on board?
-Yes, boss.

451
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,413
-Well done.
-Thank you, sir.

452
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,736
Oh, damn.

453
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,157
This looks expensive.

454
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:31,453
Don't touch what isn't yours, you rat.

455
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,581
Who are you calling a rat?

456
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,124
You, of course. Who else?

457
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,375
You hamster.

458
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,087
Do you have a death wish?

459
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,255
-Me?
-What's this?

460
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:45,634
This is top-shelf.

461
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,303
Screw you.

462
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,097
Sorry.

463
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,766
This is for someone else.

464
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,352
I'll get something better for you.

465
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,562
My black cat.

466
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,816
Someone else? Who?

467
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,192
Just someone.

468
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,529
Come on, tell me. Who?

469
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,905
You're not going to tell me?

470
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,928
"Presumed to be a .30 caliber
Russian-made Tokarev."

471
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,142
"Possible involvement
of Russian mafia gang, 'Black Cat.'"

472
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,519
My black cat.

473
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,179
What are you doing?

474
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,555
Why bother? There's nothing there.

475
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,433
-This isn't it.
-Let's move on.

476
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,393
You're going to Jangpo next, right?

477
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,520
Take a right out of here. It's faster.

478
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,988
Should we try this area?

479
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,449
Which area are you talking about?

480
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,533
GEUMPO SHIPYARD

481
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:34,618
Here.

482
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,329
Where? Tell me where.

483
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,207
GEUMPO…

484
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,815
My black cat.

485
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:06,900
Seriously.

486
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:10,904
Look who it is.
A cute little rat snuck aboard.

487
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:15,450
Hey, catch that bitch!

488
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,620
Get her!

489
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,211
Are you serious? You can't catch one girl?

490
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,629
Get over here!

491
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,055
Mr. Min, you're the best.

492
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,600
Damn it.

493
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,687
I wasted the wine I got
to celebrate the ship's departure.

494
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,857
-Go through her pockets.
-Hey.

495
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,283
Nothing on her?

496
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,243
Not even a cell phone?

497
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,999
What's going on?

498
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,209
You followed us here all alone?

499
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,549
I can't tell if you're brave or stupid.

500
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,178
Hey, get her up.

501
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:31,484
Man, you look even prettier like this.

502
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,864
I'm not here for you to admire.
Don't touch me.

503
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,700
There's definitely something about her.

504
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,952
You little bitch.

505
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:43,621
She's got an attitude
like someone else I know.

506
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,541
Cop or not, you end up as fish food
once you're chopped up.

507
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,084
I'll carve you up nicely.

508
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:51,796
Come on now.

509
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,217
Shouldn't we avoid bloodshed
on departure day?

510
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,722
It's bad luck.

511
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,603
I guess you're right.

512
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,612
I'm not a hopeless bad guy
who beats up women.

513
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,448
But earlier,

514
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,492
I was flustered and couldn't help it.

515
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,202
I hope you understand.

516
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,621
That must've hurt.

517
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,582
She followed us here.
Why wouldn't you kill her?

518
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,127
We'll send her somewhere nice.

519
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,047
You'll like it too.

520
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,840
It's a pretty great place.

521
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,177
If it's that great of a place,

522
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,346
the fare must cost a lot.

523
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,264
Don't worry.

524
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:46,142
Since we know each other,
I'll give you the ticket free of charge.

525
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,144
Lots of empty seats, you see.

526
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,527
-Let go of me!
-You bitch!

527
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,294
I didn't want you to be lonely.

528
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,214
They can't talk, so it'll be quiet.

529
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,842
I guess I should thank you.

530
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,885
The ship will sway a bit.

531
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,595
If you feel sick, just tough it out.

532
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,641
It's a small space,
and there's no ventilation.

533
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,728
After about a week,

534
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,189
my guys will let you off
in the middle of the Pacific.

535
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,485
You'll float in the ocean for a while…

536
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:41,948
and sink to the bottom.

537
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,203
If you're lucky enough
to survive until then, that is.

538
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,582
In any case,

539
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,250
I hope you enjoy your trip.

540
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:57,672
We're behind schedule.
Let's have the ship depart by 3 a.m.

541
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:01,634
Just one question.

542
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,182
All right. Ask away.

543
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:11,728
Back in 2008,

544
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,190
a Russian mafia member
was shot dead in Insung.

545
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:23,198
The police officer in charge of the case

546
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,034
was also shot dead.

547
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:29,162
His name was

548
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:31,122
Ji Ho-cheol.

549
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,339
What does that have to do with you?

550
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:48,723
That dead police officer…

551
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,018
was my father.

552
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:56,689
Why close the case?

553
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,567
I said Oh Dollar didn't kill them.

554
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:01,486
But we don't know where he is.

555
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,657
So let's look first
and see if there's a different suspect--

556
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:07,825
But the Russian…

557
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:09,702
Understood.

558
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,699
Make necessary arrangements

559
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,701
to ship Drugmon's new batch of Candy
to Japan first.

560
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:34,370
What will we be left with then?

561
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,956
We have to keep our word
until all the Candy is produced.

562
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,667
That was one of Drugmon's conditions.

563
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:44,172
So we can't sell it in Korea
or to little kids?

564
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,757
Those are bullshit conditions.

565
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,593
Am I supposed to sit here and watch
while she gives it all away?

566
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,471
That won't happen.

567
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:55,308
What do you mean?

568
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,019
Please make sure the ship departs safely.

569
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,452
Let go of me!

570
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:15,620
You bitch!

571
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,348
NO SIGNAL

572
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,150
This is… 112 Emergency Center.
How can… help you?

573
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,196
Sergeant Kim.

574
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,782
The 112 Emergency Center got a call,
and I think it was Senior Officer Ji.

575
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,162
Could you check
if it came from the Geumpo Shipyard?

576
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:01,290
-Okay, hold on.
-If it did, that'd be amazing.

577
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,001
I got the recording.
Sending it to you now.

578
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,587
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

579
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:07,672
MESSAGE FORWARDED

580
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:11,092
Hello?

581
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,428
This is… Officer Ji… of In… Police Agency.

582
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,138
My location is…

583
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,683
a shipyard with… view… Insung Bridge.

584
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,352
I'm in a container…
on a Russian vessel… the Victory.

585
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,438
112 EMERGENCY CENTER

586
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,982
Please… Go Man-sik… of In… Police Agency.

587
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,066
I only hear "Go Man-sik."

588
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,776
Hello?

589
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,195
-Jeez.
-Hold on.

590
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:34,657
-A shipyard with a view…
-Of the Insung Bridge.

591
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,784
A shipyard
with a view of the Insung Bridge.

592
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,578
A shipyard
with a view of the Insung Bridge.

593
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,455
That's Geumpo Shipyard.

594
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,914
It's Geumpo Shipyard.

595
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,667
It's Geumpo Shipyard! That has to be it!

596
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,003
Hey, we found it! Holy cow!

597
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,255
-Captain, we're almost there.
-Got it.

598
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,721
It's Geumpo Shipyard.

599
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:00,683
The Russian vessel mentioned
in the recording is being repaired.

600
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,560
They reported
its departure schedule as 3 a.m. tonight.

601
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,353
Let's go. What about you?

602
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:06,773
-I need to stay at headquarters.
-We'll be back.

603
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:09,275
Don't just focus on the details.
Look at the big picture.

604
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,652
Hello?

605
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,584
Let's go.

606
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,273
RESTRICTED AREA
GEUMPO SHIPYARD

607
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,343
It looks like they're going to
load the goods here in secret and leave.

608
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,637
When a foreign ship
is docked in a shipyard for repairs,

609
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,597
surveillance tends to get lax,

610
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,809
but they've got some nerve
to do this so openly.

611
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,686
Han-na must be on there.

612
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,064
There's less than 20 minutes left
if they're departing at 3 a.m.

613
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,945
How can we get on board
with so many of them around?

614
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,029
Hold on.

615
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,160
Excuse me, but may I leave now?

616
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:46,163
I'm pretty sure
I won't be of any help to you.

617
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,209
Sure. You can go.

618
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:52,044
-Really?
-How's your leg?

619
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,964
It's totally fine. I can go by myself.

620
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,008
It's completely healed. See?

621
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,510
Good. Then run.

622
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,053
-What?
-If you want to live, that is.

623
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:04,974
Who the hell are you?

624
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:06,684
I'm sorry.

625
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:12,440
Now.

626
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:21,741
I'll go this way. You go there.

627
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:25,745
Han-na?

628
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,209
Han-na, can you hear me?

629
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,794
Ji Han-na.

630
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:35,588
Han-na.

631
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,425
Han-na!

632
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,052
Ji Han-na.

633
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,349
Han-na.

634
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,475
Han-na.

635
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,393
Han-na, can you hear me?

636
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:50,770
I'm here, Han-na.

637
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,022
Dong-ju?

638
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,399
Han-na, say something if you hear me.

639
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:57,109
-What are you doing here?
-Ji Han-na.

640
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:59,195
-Didn't you hear me? Get lost!
-Be quiet.

641
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,988
Han-na!

642
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:03,658
-Give me a second! Han-na!
-Dong-ju.

643
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:04,825
Do you have a death wish?

644
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,203
I can't hear her, you bastards!

645
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,538
Are you going to tell me where she is?

646
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:14,961
I'm here.

647
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,671
I'm in here!

648
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:20,758
-I'm here. Yoon Dong-ju!
-Han-na? Ji Han-na.

649
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,427
-Han-na. Ji Han-na.
-I'm in here!

650
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:24,428
Hey!

651
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,310
Han-na!

652
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,734
-I'm over here.
-Han-na.

653
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,445
-Over here.
-Han-na.

654
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,698
Han-na!

655
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,033
-Where is she?
-Call out if you hear me.

656
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,202
Han-na!

657
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,080
Han-na.

658
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:52,957
Han-na, are you in there?

659
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:54,875
I'm in here.

660
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,587
-Han-na! I found her!
-I'm in here.

661
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,160
It's okay.

662
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:31,787
I'm sorry it took me so long.

663
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,791
Are you okay, Han-na?

664
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,460
Are you all right?

665
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,964
What happened to your million-dollar face?

666
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:53,851
Put these on.

667
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,193
Hurry. We have to get off.

668
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:22,338
Save Han-na, Kim Jong-hyeon!

669
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:24,381
Han-na!

670
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,820
Did you come back
for another taste of this?

671
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,079
We'll settle this once and for all.

672
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,041
Hey, you.
You're settling it with me, you asshole.

673
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,797
Hey, didn't I tell you
to leave my guy alone?

674
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,340
You crazy bastard!

675
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,060
Where do you think you're going?

676
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,233
Open the door, you son of a bitch!

677
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,568
-Are you okay?
-Open the door!

678
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,913
Yoon Dong-ju, are you okay?

679
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,054
Damn it.

680
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:55,973
There are too many of them.
What do we do?

681
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,684
It's the same in the ring.

682
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:03,022
The fight is over
the moment you get scared.

683
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,487
The only way to conquer fear

684
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,324
is to advance, no matter what.

685
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,951
You can move, right?

686
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:17,995
Take Han-na and go.

687
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,414
-What about you?
-What are you going to do alone?

688
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,042
What do you think?

689
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,085
Now that I've found you…

690
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,798
I'm going to lose my shit.

691
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,031
Get out of here!

692
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,306
Go! Hurry!

693
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,463
Jong-hyeon.

694
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,139
Kim Jong-hyeon!

695
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,601
Kim Jong-hyeon!

696
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:04,555
Things are about to get messy.

697
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,473
MAYOR OF INSUNG

698
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,267
SPECIAL THANKS TO KO JUN AND KANG GIL-WOO
FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCE

699
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,560
Are you okay?

700
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,522
Thank you for always helping me

701
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,315
when things were tough.

702
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,527
Don't underestimate your condition.

703
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:21,780
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Here.

704
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:25,242
I feel so bad. You should've told me.

705
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,578
Why can't you let go of being a cop?

706
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,580
No matter how hard you try on your own,

707
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:31,540
nothing will change.

708
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,376
You don't know what today is, do you?

709
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:38,422
If you fall, just grit your teeth
