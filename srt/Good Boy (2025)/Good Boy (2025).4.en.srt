1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,015
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,352
In the 1960s,
the undisputed world heavyweight champion

4
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,062
was Sonny Liston.

5
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,357
There was a rookie who challenged him.

6
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,444
The challenger was only 22 years old,

7
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:14,116
and the world expected the champion
to win by a landslide.

8
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,870
Experience.

9
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,538
Reach.

10
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,623
Punch.

11
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:24,418
The champion dominated
the challenger in every aspect.

12
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:26,337
However…

13
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,883
in the seventh round,

14
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,010
the challenger took down the champion.

15
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,846
To win this match,

16
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,264
I have to float like a butterfly.

17
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,392
Just like the challenger,

18
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,186
Muhammad Ali.

19
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,945
My dear Dong-ju.

20
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:55,282
Why did you cause trouble
right after getting your act together?

21
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,784
Why did you break the glass?

22
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,203
It's not like I wanted to break it.

23
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,539
-I barely tapped it.
-I see.

24
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,000
Then what if I just barely tap your face?

25
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,962
How much can a glass window cost anyway?

26
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,297
Including sales taxes,
it costs 3.3 million won.

27
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,340
-What?
-What?

28
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,843
Why is it so expensive? Let me see that.

29
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,846
The Korea Customs Service sent over
a 3.3 million won repair invoice.

30
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,098
REPAIR INVOICE

31
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,891
This doesn't qualify
as a business expense,

32
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,601
so take care of it yourself.

33
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:25,813
Jeez, 3.3 million won…

34
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,862
It's double-glazed glass.
No wonder it's expensive.

35
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,156
-Do you own a glass store?
-Yeah.

36
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:37,908
My family owns one.

37
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,494
What the heck?

38
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,969
Mr. Min.

39
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,513
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:03,058
Why are you disrupting
the workplace these days?

41
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,269
I'm sorry, sir. This won't happen again--

42
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,022
That goes without saying.

43
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:14,069
I had a hard time
covering for you this time.

44
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:15,821
You know that, right?

45
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,119
-Thank you, sir.
-That's it?

46
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,377
I made dinner reservations
at your favorite restaurant.

47
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,922
You did? That place is expensive.

48
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,841
It's the least I can do for you, sir.

49
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,218
Also, about the Libya business trip.

50
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,764
Would you mind if I went in your place?

51
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,517
I've always wanted to go.

52
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,518
Really?

53
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,021
That works for me.

54
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,983
It's nice over there,
and it'll broaden your horizons.

55
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:56,195
-I'll report this to the higher-ups.
-Yes, sir.

56
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:02,993
Mr. Min.

57
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,828
Mind your actions from now on, okay?

58
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,747
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,666
Hey, Mr. Min.

60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,710
Why are you so cute?

61
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,629
You're just adorable.

62
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,548
All right, then.

63
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,238
-Is it good?
-Very.

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,993
Have they found
the missing correctional officer?

65
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,997
They claim he went into hiding
because of his gambling debts,

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,666
but I don't think they're going to try,
and it's not in our jurisdiction.

67
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,792
More importantly,

68
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,295
our priority should be
the two Korean Chinese fugitives.

69
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,132
The RIU hasn't caught them yet,
so let's beat them to it.

70
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,093
Let's canvas Chinatown
and figure out who they are.

71
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,554
They're illegal immigrants
from Yanbian and Harbin.

72
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,597
I already ran a background check on them.

73
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,268
Captain, remember the day
when you were high like this?

74
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,229
Shouldn't we locate the van
that picked up those two thugs?

75
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,943
I asked the Traffic Management Center
to track the van's route and its details.

76
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,864
Just having you here puts me at ease.

77
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,741
I feel full and satisfied already.

78
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,577
-Here, have this.
-Thank you, sir.

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,496
What are you talking about?
We need to get the hit-and-run guy first.

80
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,665
That case is more complicated
than you think.

81
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,667
We have to be thorough to crack it.

82
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,919
That's why we need
to arrest that bastard and--

83
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,046
Here, eat this.

84
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,717
Right. If we jump the gun now,
we can't do anything about it later.

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,887
And someone within the agency
is leaking information.

86
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,806
This means we need to be
more discreet and methodical.

87
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,392
Sergeant Kim is always right.

88
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,352
I agree.

89
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,313
I'm sure there are more cases
we're unaware of.

90
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,191
Right, we shouldn't rush into things.

91
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,359
-Look at you.
-We shouldn't…

92
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:03,113
You hardly earn your keep,
but you never skip a meal, huh?

93
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,491
I heard you got reassigned, Sergeant Kim.

94
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,784
Is this where you ended up?

95
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,619
You could've joined the RIU.

96
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,497
A person should be in a place
that suits them.

97
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,165
This place feels right to me.

98
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,458
Is that so?

99
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,294
Then good luck to you.

100
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,800
Why are those punks being so childish?

101
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,636
Sergeant Kim and Senior Officer Ji,

102
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,471
find Silver Bunny
and the Korean Chinese guys.

103
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,432
Senior Officer Shin and Dung-ju,
look into Oh Jong-gu.

104
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,017
I'm sure you'll find something.

105
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,562
From now on,
our team will operate in these two pairs.

106
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,858
You can't just pair us up like that.

107
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,403
Even a captain should consider
everyone's opinions before deciding.

108
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,613
Is everyone okay with this?

109
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,698
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, I like being with Dung-ju.

110
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,075
I'm okay with it too.

111
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,870
Okay with what?

112
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,413
You want to partner with him?

113
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,707
-Yeah.
-Why? You should be with me.

114
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,417
-Why?
-Why?

115
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,044
-Why?
-Why?

116
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,505
What do you mean?

117
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,965
Why do I have to partner with you?

118
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,926
That's because…

119
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,263
I mean…

120
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,474
Why him?

121
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,602
Because I can learn
a lot more from him than you.

122
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:16,728
Good point.

123
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,273
Senior Officer Ji sure is sharp.

124
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,650
HANO GLASS

125
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,569
STOCK PRICE: 201,000
MARKET CAP: 1.7862 TRILLION

126
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,445
Hano Glass.

127
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,322
It's a key player
in the building material industry.

128
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,658
Didn't you know Sergeant Kim
is the second son of that family?

129
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,618
I knew he came from money,

130
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,246
but I mean,
you can't call this a glass store.

131
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,999
It's technically a glass store
but on a global scale.

132
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,920
We're definitely not compatible.

133
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm surprised you agreed to
partner with me.

134
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,426
I didn't think you'd like it.

135
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,678
Don't get the wrong idea.
It doesn't mean anything.

136
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,472
And there's nothing to dislike.

137
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,270
Dong-ju, you're acting insecure.

138
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,190
You're acting weird, Jae-hong.

139
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,734
You've been low-key
taking his side these days.

140
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,110
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,028
I'm not going with you.

142
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,072
Hey, Dung-ju!

143
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,663
Hey, what are you doing?

144
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,754
I'm an ignorant officer
with a long way to go,

145
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,798
so I want to learn from an amazing mentor.

146
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,011
So please let me go with him,
Senior Officer Ji.

147
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,221
Cut the crap and get out.

148
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,724
Hey!

149
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,771
Suit yourself.

150
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,495
I can't wait to work with you, sir.

151
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,456
Stop acting cute.

152
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,333
And drop the formal tone
and just be yourself.

153
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,334
But why, sir?

154
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,170
Why? Tell me why, sir.

155
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,801
Shall we get going then?

156
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,386
Yes.

157
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,433
You're my senior colleague,
so feel free to speak casually.

158
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,728
That'll come in time.

159
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:23,605
Okay.

160
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,536
Please take a good look.

161
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,579
I said I don't know. Go away!

162
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,498
I'm from the Insung Police Agency.
Have you seen--

163
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,416
I don't know him.

164
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,919
-Have you seen this--
-I said go away!

165
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,421
Don't you dare come back!

166
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,632
Let's go elsewhere.

167
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,645
J9 SECURITY

168
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,650
Why did you share my schedule
without even asking me?

169
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,777
-When did they call?
-About 30 minutes ago.

170
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,573
If they come here,

171
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,992
-tell them I'm away on a business trip.
-Okay.

172
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,102
You told me he had no plans today
when I called earlier.

173
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,022
That was then. This is now.

174
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,983
-When will he be back?
-I'm not sure.

175
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,109
Where did he go?

176
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,028
Seongjin City.

177
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,283
Isn't the car parked outside
Mr. Oh Jong-gu's car?

178
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,785
I guess he left his car behind.

179
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,620
He took the train.

180
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,248
But Seongjin City
doesn't have a train station.

181
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:13,882
They're gone.

182
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,343
Mr. Oh.

183
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,678
You should've sent them off quickly.

184
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,431
Why did you answer all of their questions?

185
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,724
I was just…

186
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,185
I wish you could use your head more.

187
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,145
Jeez, my neck feels so stiff.

188
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,106
Hello, sir.

189
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,025
Mr. Oh, I thought you were gone,
but you came out of nowhere.

190
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,863
I thought you had just left.

191
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,075
But then again,
there are many entrances here.

192
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,703
That's a nice watch.

193
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,417
Thank you.

194
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,897
Damn it.

195
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,567
Not again.

196
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,445
Did we get a match
on that van from the system?

197
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,571
You were right.

198
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,073
It's an unregistered van.

199
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,284
What about its route?

200
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,078
I analyzed the CCTV footage
starting at the abandoned building,

201
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,122
but I lost track
at the Baekdang-dong Intersection.

202
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,341
So his family has more buildings like that
across the country, huh?

203
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,345
Then why did the young master
become a cop?

204
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,264
It must be the young master's hobby.

205
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,103
Becoming a cop is one thing.

206
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,563
Why did you join the SCIT?

207
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,150
You went back and forth.
You're all over the place.

208
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,401
It's for the same reason as you.

209
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,445
What?

210
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,947
I still like Han-na.

211
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,078
Get out. I have an appointment to attend.

212
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,715
I can't bring myself to like him.

213
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,553
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

214
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,139
Have a good night.

215
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,140
Okay.

216
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,684
Good night.

217
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,325
Get in.

218
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,419
I'm here to rob you.

219
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,421
Cut the crap and come inside.

220
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,422
Okay.

221
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,515
I told you not to put eggs in it.

222
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,392
I ought to boil your mouth instead.

223
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,394
Without eggs,
ramyeon wouldn't have made it so big.

224
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,020
Ramyeon companies owe tons to the hens.

225
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,022
If you don't like it,
eat it raw and drink hot water.

226
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,116
Who's the big fish
in car smuggling these days?

227
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,951
When it comes to that market,

228
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,161
Gwang-se has been in control
for a long time.

229
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:31,788
Gwang-se?

230
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,041
As in the baldy Lee Gwang-se
with an eagle tattoo on his arm?

231
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,668
It's a bald eagle tattoo.

232
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,337
But he's not doing well
because some guy has invaded his turf.

233
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,380
Who's this guy?

234
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,673
I don't know everything.

235
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,425
Ask Gwang-se yourself.

236
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,303
I should've brought liquor instead.

237
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,600
Have you come across this recently?

238
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,649
My word, this again?

239
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,527
What is it?
Did someone come here with this?

240
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,405
A rather unattractive woman
came a while ago.

241
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,782
I've never seen
such an unattractive woman.

242
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,493
A woman?

243
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,789
Back in 2008,

244
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,168
a Russian mafia member was shot dead here.

245
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,089
Your father was in charge of the scene.

246
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,886
I'm not sure
whether I should show you these, but…

247
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,100
These are the crime scene photos
from your father's case.

248
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,736
The van was caught on camera
in a different area.

249
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,820
Where?

250
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,490
On the hill leading to Sinhu-ro
from Cheongma-ro, Yuwol-gu.

251
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,158
It was caught on camera there a few times.

252
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,166
Let's go.

253
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,629

257
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,606

258
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,860

THE 7TH YOUTH SHOOTING COMPETITION

262
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,843
Han-na, promise you won't tell your mom
we had hamburgers.

263
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,595
Obviously, Dad.

264
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,348
That's what you said before
but you told her we had pizza,

265
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,516
stabbing me in the back.

266
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,769
But she kept asking me.

267
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,938
Is there anything you want?

268
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,107
-I want a digital camera.
-A digital camera?

269
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,192
One that records too.

270
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,694
I want to record myself training
and correct my posture.

271
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,406
At this rate,
you'll sweep all the gold medals.

272
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,285
That's nothing, Dad.
I'm going to set the world record too.

273
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,790
Will you let me use this too?

274
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,793
No, it's just for me.

275
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,377
Come on, share with me.

276
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,547
Then let me see you fire your gun.

277
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,467
Han-na, the thing about real guns

278
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,636
is that you only show them to bad guys.

279
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,720
Bang!

280
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,014
That's not fair.

281
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,599
Then I want to be a cop.

282
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,309
Go for it.

283
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,936
You can be whatever you want.

284
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,730
This is mine, okay?

Hello, sir.

Hello, sir.

294
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,763
My word, this again?

295
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,015
Did someone come here with this?

296
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,268
A rather unattractive woman
came a while ago.

297
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,103
I've never seen
such an unattractive woman.

298
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,982
-What's wrong?
-What?

299
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,903
It's nothing.

300
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,200
How did it go with Oh Jong-gu?

301
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,746
He just gave routine answers.

302
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,415
"I only helped a former student

303
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,500
who was like a younger brother to me."

304
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,463
I only helped a former student
who was like a younger brother to me.

305
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,049
Is that a crime?

306
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,676
If I had committed a crime--

307
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,137
It would've been failing
to guide him on the right path.

308
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,850
You're repeating what you said
during your interview.

309
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,977
-As if you memorized it.
-You're pretty blunt.

310
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,441
What is this?

311
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,319
I'm starting to get upset.

312
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,824
Are you implying
I had a hand in Gyeong-il's death?

313
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,498
Did you?

314
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,588
I don't appreciate…

315
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,675
the way you're talking to me.

316
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,969
"I don't appreciate the way
you're talking to me."

317
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,434
In any case, he was the last person
to see Lee Gyeong-il before he confessed,

318
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:09,519
so keep looking into him.

319
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,187
Will do.

320
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:13,731
What about you two?

321
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,149
We didn't find out much.

322
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,945
The Chinatown merchants couldn't even look
at the photos of the Korean Chinese guys.

323
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,655
It seems like someone shut them up.

324
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,867
And as for the getaway van…

325
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,079
It was unregistered
and difficult to track.

326
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,332
Chinatown is Golden Bunny's territory.

327
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,668
The gang has been broken up,
so why won't they cooperate?

328
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,712
I'm not sure.

329
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,840
Silver Bunny is wanted right now,
so he can't have any pull either.

330
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,261
But why did you two go together,

331
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,303
and not Sergeant Kim?

332
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,559
What is it?

333
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,395
Well…

334
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,521
Come on, tell me.

335
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,316
PAWNSHOP

336
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,609
Hello?

337
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,154
You found him?

338
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,949
Got it. Thank you.

339
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,245
All right.

340
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,414
Where's Yoon Dong-ju?

341
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,999
Dong-ju.

342
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,251
Hey, wake up.

343
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:17,879
Yoon Dong-ju!

344
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,091
What did you do last night
to still be sleeping like a log?

345
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,426
I ought to just…

346
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,220
That Min Ju-yeong…

347
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,265
Hurry up. We have somewhere to be.

348
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,309
Where are we going? Wait!

349
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,686
Where are we going?

GWANG-SE

351
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,426
The procedure turned out well, sir.

352
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,261
Look at all this hair you have now.

353
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,389
Be gentle.

354
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,558
It hasn't been long,
and my hair is fragile.

355
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,153
I told you to be gentle!

356
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,697
Lose the tension in your hands
and rub gently with your fingers.

357
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,783
Are you doing laundry or something?

358
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,076
Seriously.

359
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,412
What is this?

360
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,373
How much hair did I lose?

361
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,795
Do you know how much this cost me?

362
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,974
Detective, what are you doing here?

363
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:55,685
I have a question for you.

364
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,354
I see. You have a question for me.

365
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,149
-Your eyes must sting.
-Just a bit.

366
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:07,530
Move!

367
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,742
Out of my way!

368
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:14,996
Get out of the way!

369
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:19,333
Move!

370
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,380
Wait for me!

371
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,470
-Make way!
-You have to return the gown!

372
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,264
Hey, you punk!

373
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,230
Sorry!

374
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,777
-Take the other way and cut him off!
-Yes, sir!

375
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:06,964
Jeez, what a heavy bastard.

376
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,134
Was that really necessary?

377
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,553
I just wanted to ask a question.
Why did you run?

378
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,472
What is it?

379
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,598
This here.

380
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,978
You smuggled it in and passed it
to the Golden Bunny Gang, right?

381
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,608
I'm out of the game,
so I don't know anything.

382
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,819
If you're out,
then who's running things now?

383
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,113
-I said I don't know.
-It'd be better if you do.

384
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,535
Goodness.

385
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,249
Most smugglers stash their earnings
in cash or gold bars.

386
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,835
But you stashed yours in your hair.

387
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,838
All criminal proceeds
must be confiscated by the government

388
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,174
one by one.

389
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,134
You learned a lot by copying that book.

390
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,389
The best kind of eagle is a bald eagle.

391
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:58,933
Your hair is too long.

392
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,142
Let's get started.

393
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,103
Start what? Hold on a second.

394
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,272
No, wait! I'll tell you!

395
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,940
His name is Monkey.

396
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,360
He's the best in the country
when it comes to smuggling cars.

397
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,155
There's a guy at Insung Customs
who covers for him.

398
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,283
He keeps detaining all of my goods

399
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,451
but clears Monkey's stuff
without inspecting them.

400
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:20,288
So what else can I do
but shut down my business?

401
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,164
That bastard customs officer…

402
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,459
There's this leech
in the Surveillance Division.

403
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,044
His name is Min Ju-yeong.

404
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,087
MIN JU-YEONG
KOREA CUSTOMS SERVICE

405
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:31,966
So are you saying

406
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,969
this guy named Monkey still has that car?

407
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:38,764
Yes. That car's a limited edition model,
even overseas.

408
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,934
With some minor repairs, you can resell it
at well over triple the value.

409
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:45,646
He moves his goods
through Libya and Russia.

410
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,399
When news spread
about that one being in Korea,

411
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,026
people have been contacting me nonstop

412
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,445
-to learn when it'd go into the market.
-When is it?

413
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,614
After all the paperwork is done,
it'll be gone by tomorrow at the latest.

414
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,791
They say egg yolk is good for hair loss,
so eat up.

415
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:07,668
It's a fertilized egg.

416
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:09,795
Answer when I call later.

417
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,299
Goddammit.

418
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,475
This is pretty.

419
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,310
You seem busy these days.

420
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,729
Come on, you should share
what you find out.

421
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,568
Not again. Why does everyone
get so quiet and on edge?

422
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,946
-What are you doing?
-Excuse me?

423
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,740
Oh, would you like an egg?

424
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:38,699
No.

425
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,202
-What about you, Sergeant Kim?
-Nothing.

426
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,495
You're smiling awkwardly again.

427
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,122
You guys are petty.

428
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,793
-Good day, sir.
-Thanks.

429
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,799
Use the messenger app.

430
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,677
This is Monkey, the car smuggler.

431
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,472
If Min Ju-yeong finds out
we're searching for a car,

432
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,308
it'll disappear along with any cooperation
from the Korea Customs Service.

433
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,435
We'll be racing against the clock
to catch the dealers

434
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,062
and search their warehouses right after.

435
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,480
Will that be possible?

436
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,857
If they're smuggling on a national scale,

437
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,692
they'll have a huge number of warehouses.

438
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,611
Right. We can't handle this on our own.

439
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,906
What in the world are we doing?

440
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,533
Just talk out loud!

441
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,329
Sit down.

442
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,915
Sit down.

443
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,462
I told you we need to be discreet,
you little punk!

444
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,885
I hear only one workshop handles repairs
and dashboard tampering before export.

445
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,762
We just need to raid that place, you punk.

446
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,265
I… understand…

447
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,808
Do you know the location?

448
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,310
We'll find a car they like
and put it out as bait.

449
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,397
That'll get the fence to make a move.

450
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,606
Where will we get a car?

451
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,316
I thought you were smarter than that.

452
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,236
Don't worry.
With this kind of information,

453
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,322
the commissioner will provide a car
and plenty of backup.

454
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,159
THEN ARE WE…

455
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,495
Fine.

456
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,500
-Hello.
-Hello.

457
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,668
Use that energy in your work.

458
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,962
-Salute.
-Salute.

459
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:18,674
Get out, you bastard!

460
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,259
I GUARANTEE INSUNG CITY'S SAFETY

461
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,554
If we can't have the riot police,
then how about a patrol unit?

462
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,889
A patrol unit?

463
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,100
Keep talking,
and I'll have you patrolling hell!

464
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,351
You idiot.

465
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:34,899
There he comes.

466
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,576
-We meet too often.
-Cut it, punk.

467
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,745
So what about this car?

468
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:50,456
What on earth is this junk?

469
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,874
Who would take this piece of crap?

470
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,542
A bait car should be shiny and powerful.

471
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,169
And it should be foreign.

472
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,172
Hey, it's not a piece of crap.
My wife bought it for me.

473
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,549
And who do you think you are
handing over my car?

474
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,176
Because we don't have one!

475
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,595
You promised we'd get support on this.

476
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,806
Forget backup for now.
We need something to catch the bastard.

477
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,934
What about my car?

478
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,102
Let's take a look.

479
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,441
Well, it's not bad,

480
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:20,319
but it's not enough
to make you drool over it.

481
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,695
Captain.

482
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,865
I inquired with the Korea Customs Service
and apparently,

483
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,742
Min Ju-yeong is going
on an overseas business trip.

484
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,285
He's leaving next Monday.

485
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,204
The bastard's making a run for it.

486
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,039
We should just drag him here.

487
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,208
Be quiet. I'm restless as is
even without you piling in.

488
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,713
Where can we find
a shiny new car in a day?

489
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:45,010
How about a black sedan with low mileage,
no prior accidents, and a 3,000 CC engine?

490
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,304
It's a German model too.

491
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,682
That's the type of car
that dealers go nuts over.

492
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:50,975
It'd be total chaos.

493
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,560
There's one right over there.

494
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,690
Hey, that's nice.

495
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,608
Whose is it? It has temporary tags.

496
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,571
What are you doing?

497
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,365
Is it the commissioner's car?
Did he get a new one?

498
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,076
It's perfect.

499
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,828
Are you out of your mind?

500
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,663
You want to use
the commissioner's car as bait?

501
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,706
Why not?

502
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,208
-What?
-It sounds good to me.

503
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,127
Not you too, Sergeant Kim.

504
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,753
Sometimes, you have to make bad choices

505
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,256
for the sake of justice.

506
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:23,757
Keep me out of this.

507
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,303
We'll borrow it and return it.

508
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,721
Captain.

509
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,556
I'm going to lose it.

510
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,475
But how many years would we get
for stealing the commissioner's car?

511
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,704
Anyone call a designated driver?

512
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,674
I don't feel good.

513
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,231
Everyone, focus.

514
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,234
Monkey has major trust issues,

515
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,071
so he doesn't do
face-to-face transactions.

516
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,240
When I drop off the car
at the designated location,

517
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,868
they'll remove the GPS and take it.

518
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,120
If you pull a fast one,

519
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:36,955
you know what'll happen, right?

520
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,249
Come on, I'd never do that.

521
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,461
I'm a professional when it comes to work.

522
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,712
I don't mess around.

523
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,342
I'll get in touch
once the location is set.

524
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,776
Please ring these up too.

525
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,570
We can't do a stakeout
on an empty stomach, right?

526
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,074
Please ring those up.

527
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,424
That woke me up.

528
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,426
You should wake up too, sir.

529
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,513
Thank you for the treats.

530
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:57,953
They left already. You're with me. Get in.

531
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,732
Those two look pretty cozy.

532
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,692
It's the perfect setup
for romance to bloom.

533
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,112
Like this. And this.

534
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,826
But it probably won't happen.

535
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,371
Hey.

536
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,588
Those little bastards.

537
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,514
-Hey, is this it?
-Yeah, it is.

538
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,557
Let's get rid of the GPS and go.

539
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,101
It's that egg sushi guy.

540
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,938
Hey! What are you doing to my car?

541
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,482
Those are the guys
who stole the captain's car.

542
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,609
I got you, you bastards.

543
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,028
Hey!

544
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,324
Is someone in there?

545
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,242
I don't know.

546
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,501
He's coming this way!

547
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,211
I'm sorry.

548
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,048
-Keep still.
-What?

549
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,471
Be quiet.

550
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,834
Have a good time, you two.

551
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,044
Hey, it's nothing.

552
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,170
Okay.

553
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:39,948
Stop.

554
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,367
Have a great time, you two!

555
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,246
Return to position.

556
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,709
What are you doing?

557
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:52,794
Returning to position.

558
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,345
The car is on the move.

559
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,641
Okay, Han-na.
We'll move out right now too.

560
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,819
Go find my car right now!

561
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,322
Are you kidding me?

562
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,157
I only had it for a day!

563
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:41,468
Look at you two.

564
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,886
You've got the undercover look down.

565
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,013
How many are inside?

566
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:47,265
There seem to be about ten people or so.

567
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,643
Piece of cake.

568
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:53,021
They usually go through the back to enter,

569
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,564
so let's park here and head in.

570
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:57,109
Don't worry about others.
Our priority is Monkey.

571
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,903
And don't forget to keep
the commissioner's car safe and sound.

572
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,322
I'll stand guard in the back
so that no one escapes.

573
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,991
Senior Officers Shin and Ji,
take the rear.

574
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,702
The three of us will face them head-on.

575
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,705
-Yes, sir.
-I hear they use whatever tool is handy,

576
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,289
so grab your gear.

577
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,295
Thank you.

578
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,007
That's mine.

579
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,092
All right.

580
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,177
Is this supposed to be this small?

581
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,905
Sergeant Kim,
that's way more than ten people.

582
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,201
-Let's just go in.
-Seriously?

583
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,495
-Go in?
-Yes.

584
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,956
-On the count of three.
-Okay.

585
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,583
One, two, three!

586
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,295
What the heck?

587
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,629
Who are you?

588
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:00,797
Hey!

589
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:07,262
Freeze! Put your hands up!

590
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,556
Go find my car right now!

591
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,224
Hey, stop.

592
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:17,731
-Hurry up.
-That's what I'm doing.

593
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,071
That punk, Dae-yong,
is trying to take the credit.

594
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,405
RIU, move out!

595
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,490
-Move out!
-Move out!

596
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,160
Find Monkey. We have to catch him!

597
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,203
Let's do this!

598
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,841
You're not him!

599
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,864
We have to find Monkey.

600
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,032
Get over here.

601
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:09,991
You're not him.

602
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,119
Not you either.

603
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:14,955
Not you!

604
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:28,510
You're not him!

605
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,555
Where's Monkey?

606
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,105
Get away from me!

607
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,523
Don't come near me!

608
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,358
Go away!

609
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,572
You're not him!

610
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,073
You little punks!

611
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:55,954
Get lost!

612
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:58,874
Get away from me!

613
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,293
I said get away from me!

614
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,759
Don't step on the car, Sergeant Kim!

615
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,678
Sergeant Kim!

616
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,763
Don't do that! Get down from there!

617
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:14,973
Don't step on it!

618
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,267
Sergeant Kim, get off the car!

619
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,977
Get down! You can't do that!

620
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,312
-Goddammit!
-Please don't do that!

621
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,317
You bastard.

622
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,069
Oh, no! What did I do?

623
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,825
The car! Captain Go, the car!

624
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,577
Nice blocking!

625
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:37,913
Great job, Captain Go!

626
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,127
Great job, An Dae-yong!

627
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,923
Nicely done, Dae-yong!

628
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,718
Good job!

629
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,455
Hey, Monkey!

630
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,542
Monkey's over there!

631
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:25,627
RIU, move out!

632
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,628
Damn it!

633
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,838
Hey, grab him! He's climbing up!

634
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:30,507
You damn bastard!

635
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,385
Hey, they're climbing up!

636
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:34,803
Damn it.

637
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,429
Hey!

638
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:37,389
Throw the wrenches, boys!

639
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,351
-Hey.
-Nail them, you punks.

640
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,145
Hey!

641
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,734
Listen! We have to catch Monkey!
RIU, advance!

642
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,579
Hey! That crazy bastard.

643
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:02,706
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

644
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:03,999
Oh, gosh.

645
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,669
Has that damn bastard lost his mind?

646
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,264
That way, you idiots.

647
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,392
-Go that way!
-We have to catch Monkey.

648
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:23,601
Wait here.

649
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:34,779
Jae-hong!

650
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,156
Jae-hong!

651
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,245
-Jae-hong!
-No!

652
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,583
Grab him!

653
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,434
Han-na!

654
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:27,582
Captain!

655
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,464
Captain, watch out!

656
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,341
I'm okay!

657
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,188
Monkey. Where's Monkey?

658
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,237
No, not this car!

659
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
Open the door, you bastard!

660
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,449
Why does he keep chasing me?

661
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,203
Where are you going, you bastard?

662
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:11,376
Please don't go!

663
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,015
Oh, man. We're so screwed.

664
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:32,939
Kim Jong-hyeon! Go after Monkey!

665
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,406
Captain.

666
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,949
What's this? Let's get you up.

667
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:47,996
-Han-na, are you okay?
-Yeah.

668
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:54,627
Sergeant Kim, please catch Monkey!

669
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,257
Hey!

670
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,049
Hurry up and get moving.

671
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,720
Hurry up.

672
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:30,640
-Stop resisting.
-Let's get going.

673
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,769
Captain, the foreign car is gone.
I think they moved it already.

674
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,981
The others are checking the warehouses,
so we'll just have to wait.

675
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,487
And we can't ask Monkey about it.

676
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,241
So much for finding it easily.

677
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,493
Are you okay?

678
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:51,953
He's here.

679
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,148
Be strong.

680
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:26,988
I'm screwed.

681
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,620
Just die already!

682
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:35,038
Hey, Dong-ju.

683
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,123
Senior Officer Ji.
It's okay. Let them talk it out.

684
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,626
That car is worth more than you!

685
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,434
DO NOT ENTER
ONGOING INVESTIGATION

686
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,729
Sir.

687
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,314
Hey.

688
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,108
The perp didn't do any damage elsewhere

689
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,069
except for the single cut
to the carotid artery.

690
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,112
The weapon would've had a sharp tip,

691
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:09,697
but it's no ordinary knife.

692
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:10,990
He's a professional.

693
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:14,577
It was a screw-like knife
about ten centimeters long.

694
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,038
Like a screwdriver?

695
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,956
No, it was something different.

696
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,466
What do you think this is?

697
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,137
Take a look.

698
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,690
Hey, that stings!

699
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:47,485
I'm sorry, Captain.

700
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:51,072
Don't be.
Things happen when catching bad guys.

701
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:55,535
Dae-yong, that bastard!
He has no professional decency…

702
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,415
Do I regret it?

703
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,833
No, not at all.

704
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:06,713
I'm merely relieved
that my personal sacrifice was enough

705
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,091
to apprehend this group

706
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,760
that tried to exploit the law
for their own gain.

707
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:16,848
The suspects disguised scrap-bound cars
as legitimate through forgery.

708
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,475
Some of the exports
were vehicles they stole themselves.

709
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,187
Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol,
who led this operation…

710
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,275
He's letting the whole world know.

711
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,736
I bet that bastard is watching this.

712
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,612
According to the ongoing investigation,

713
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,406
illegal weapons
such as Russian-made rifles,

714
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,367
swords, and crossbows,
as well as drugs and jewelry,

715
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:39,162
were discovered
in the vehicles they smuggled,

716
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,913
which have left authorities in shock.

717
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,210
That's a pretty wide range.
What's the total value?

718
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:48,629
I believe this is connected
to both the Russian mafia

719
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,048
and a drug operation
run by an armed Filipino group.

720
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:54,135
This goes beyond simple smuggling.
It's on a whole different scale.

721
00:50:58,931 --> 00:50:59,849
Hey.

722
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:00,975
It's not there either?

723
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,727
Okay.

724
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,815
They didn't find Min Ju-yeong's car
in the last warehouse.

725
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,860
Do you think the bald eagle lied?

726
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:14,822
No, not a single ship has left
overseas yesterday or today.

727
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,657
I'm sure it's still in the country.

728
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:20,787
Here, Captain.

729
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,456
To export used cars,

730
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,666
you need to apply
for their registration cancellation.

731
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,461
But most of the cars
Monkey's gang tried to export

732
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:31,422
were unregistered or stolen,
making the paperwork tricky.

733
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,925
So they need to alter
the export approval documents,

734
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,219
but it's nearly impossible
without help from an insider.

735
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,472
Good work.

736
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,434
Mr. Lee Jin-su handled export declarations
at the Korea Customs Service.

737
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,522
The one who handled them before him

738
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:48,606
was this person.

739
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,610
Hold on. Let's take a look.

740
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,823
PERSONNEL FILE
NAME: MIN JU-YEONG

741
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,200
So the reason Min Ju-yeong

742
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,119
killed Lee Jin-su was…

743
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,704
Because Lee Jin-su realized

744
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,165
that this bastard was dirty.

745
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,292
LEE JIN-SU

746
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:12,213
CHEONGIL SHIPPING'S IMPORT/EXPORT

747
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,841
Confiscated goods, their management,
and smuggling enforcement

748
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,426
all fall under Min Ju-yeong's duties.

749
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,972
So he's not a regular
corrupt civil servant.

750
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,474
He's deeply involved in every case.

751
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,352
An ordinary civil servant
can't handle all this.

752
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:29,981
He's a rotten bastard through and through.

753
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:41,951
Here you are.

754
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,328
Did you watch the news?

755
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:46,080
I did.

756
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,540
It's a mess.

757
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,959
The Audit Office will be summoning

758
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,712
tons of people pretty soon.

759
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,678
Thanks for volunteering
to go on the business trip.

760
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,723
It was giving me a headache
because nobody wanted to go.

761
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,310
It's my job to help you, sir.

762
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,271
By the way,

763
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,774
the police agency called
and asked about your business trip.

764
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,446
They did?

765
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,075
What did you tell them?

766
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,494
Hold on. What now?

767
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,290
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

768
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,249
It's the police again.

769
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,585
They're really bothering me.

770
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,504
I'll take care of this on my end,

771
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,300
so don't worry about a thing,
and get ready for your trip.

772
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,512
What is it?

773
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:47,224
Sir.

774
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:51,395
Please tell them

775
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:55,483
that I'm going on the trip on your orders,
not voluntarily.

776
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,443
Otherwise, they might keep pestering you.

777
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:58,527
Okay.

778
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,655
I'll figure out what to say,
so don't worry.

779
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,535
What's the matter, Mr. Min?

780
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,913
You don't need to figure out what to say.

781
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,625
Just tell them what I told you.

782
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,085
What did I tell you to tell them?

783
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,714
What are you doing?

784
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,051
Hey, Mr. Min.

785
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,763
You little bastard.

786
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,224
I treated you well,
and now you're crossing the line.

787
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,475
Hey, you little punk.

788
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:33,312
You should know your place, you bastard.

789
00:54:33,396 --> 00:54:35,731
Who do you think you are?

790
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:38,526
What are you doing?

791
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:40,695
Hey.

792
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,574
Be quiet.

793
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,576
Be quiet.

794
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,704
I said be quiet.

795
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:52,540
Sir.

796
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,418
Don't look down. Look at me.

797
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,548
I'm not joking around right now.

798
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,009
I'm being very serious,

799
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,094
so you shouldn't joke around either.

800
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:09,390
Look at me.

801
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,020
I said look at me.

802
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:19,692
Listen carefully.

803
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,319
I'm only going on the business trip

804
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,072
because you ordered me to.

805
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:26,532
Don't say anything else, okay?

806
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,079
Let's move the trip up a few days

807
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,457
so that I leave today.

808
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:38,794
And from now on,

809
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,214
don't put your hands on me.

810
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,578
I've had a small setback.

811
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,997
There's been a change of plans.

812
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:19,376
Contact the Philippines and Russia
and have them arrange the tickets.

813
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:28,010
There are over a thousand containers
going to Libya and Russia this week.

814
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,178
To find smuggled goods,

815
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,139
our only option is to check
each container one by one.

816
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,476
And it'll take time to get
the cargo owner's consent.

817
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,729
We still need to find it
before that bastard escapes.

818
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:40,898
I'm certain that hit-and-run car is here.

819
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,943
In any case, we need to find that car,

820
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,112
get that matching DNA sample,
and catch him.

821
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,780
I'll go to the back. You guys spread out.

822
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:06,590
Hello?

823
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:12,388
Okay.

824
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,182
What is it now?

825
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:18,435
Min Ju-yeong is leaving the country
tonight at seven.

826
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:19,979
It means he's really on edge.

827
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,398
That car is definitely here.

828
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:25,734
I'm exhausted as it is.
Why is this asshole making me work more?

829
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:27,903
Yoon Dong-ju, don't get into trouble!

830
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,446
Where are you going? Yoon Dong-ju!

831
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,364
I'll go with him.

832
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,455
That bastard.

833
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,506
You can't run, you bastard.

834
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,678
What is it now?

835
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,597
I'm Sergeant Kim
from the Insung Police Ageny's SCIT.

836
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,141
We're reinvestigating
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il's case.

837
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,642
We'd appreciate your cooperation

838
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,561
in accompanying us to the agency
for an interview.

839
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,687
It won't take long.

840
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,522
Of course, I'll cooperate.

841
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,902
But I'm going on a business trip.

842
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,321
My flight leaves at seven,
so I'm afraid I can't today.

843
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:14,074
If you don't mind,
I'll cooperate when I return.

844
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:15,910
We do mind.

845
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:18,829
Listen carefully.

846
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:22,917
We can arrest you as a murder suspect
and interrogate you for 24 hours.

847
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,752
I see you studied a lot.

848
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:26,795
I guess my assignment helped.

849
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,548
I might take the bar exam, thanks to you.

850
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:32,885
If you think you can stop me
using legal means…

851
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,305
go ahead and try.

852
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,067
Also,

853
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,320
you should get your facts straight.

854
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:58,077
Mr. Lee Gyeong-il didn't die
because of me.

855
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,578
He died because of you.

856
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:08,671
If you had stayed out of it,
he might still be alive.

857
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:35,572
Hey, let's go.

858
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:00,973
That damn bastard.

859
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,641
What the heck? Where is he going?

860
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,184
Isn't the airport straight ahead?

861
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:05,936
Follow him.

862
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:15,070
-Where did he go?
-Jeez, did he have come up here?

863
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,159
This is the police.
We need your cooperation.

864
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,786
I'm getting a call. One second.

865
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:26,123
Did you find it?

866
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,625
We're on official duty. Please excuse us.

867
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:29,543
We found it.

868
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,591
He vanished.
I think he knows we found the car.

869
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,551
What?

870
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,303
Where are you right now?

871
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,474
So they found it?

872
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,102
All right.

873
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:53,192
So you're hiding
because you're scared, huh?

874
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,238
They're making things more complicated.

875
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:04,953
Wrap up the scene
and hand it over to the NFS.

876
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:07,247
And request a departure ban
against Min Ju-yeong.

877
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:08,165
Yes, sir.

878
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,000
-Senior Officer Ji, let's go.
-Yes, sir.

879
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,212
Yoon Dong-ju, did you find him?

880
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,173
I'm sorry!

881
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:20,427
There you are.

882
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:25,140
I'll make sure Min Ju-yeong
can't get on that plane,

883
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:26,725
so tell them to get an arrest warrant.

884
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:28,477
Yoon Dong-ju!

885
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,439
-Take the radio.
-Thank you.

886
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:47,079
You're done for.

887
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:30,914
Where are you?

888
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:33,375
We're in a residential area
on a hillside road near Seo-dong.

889
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:34,460
We'll head over there.

890
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:36,295
We're in pursuit on a residential road.

891
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,922
Okay, keep your radio on.
I'll go straight to the entrance.

892
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,979
Where are you, Dong-ju?
I don't see Min Ju-yeong.

893
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,151
You'll need to go to the lower part
of the residential area.

894
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,486
I'm going to catch up to you.

895
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,368
Got it.

896
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:30,057
-What the heck? Hey!
-I'm sorry, sir!

897
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:35,896
Hey, you little punk!
You can't just go like that!

898
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,861
Min Ju-yeong spotted.

899
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:27,364
I lost him.

900
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:32,911
Damn it.

901
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,792
I'm sorry.

902
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,025
Come on.

903
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,069
I'm sorry!

904
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,029
What the heck?

905
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,213
He's at the intersection.

906
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:26,715
We're almost there.

907
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:31,178
Come on, kids.

908
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,725
Hello. Are you dropping him off?

909
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:38,852
Where does the kid live? Here?

910
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,855
Okay, let's go.

911
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,472
Steamed Bun!

912
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:20,894
What the hell are you going to do?

913
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,813
Isn't it obvious?

914
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:25,357
To catch the bastard,

915
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:28,443
I have to float like a butterfly…

916
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,613
and sting like a bee.

917
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:35,867
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju!

918
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,161
Dong-ju!

919
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,333
What's the matter with you?

920
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:46,002
Hey, Yoon Dong-ju. Are you okay?

921
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,296
Yoon Dong-ju.

922
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:58,598
Yoon Dong-ju.

923
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:00,434
Yoon Dong-ju!

924
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,603
Are you okay?

925
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,772
Seriously.

926
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,360
Of course.

927
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,362
I'm fine.

928
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:16,450
No, you're not.

929
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,368
I need to call 119.

930
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:24,875
Damn it.

931
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,046
Hello, is this 119?

932
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,798
The address here is…

933
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,175
Damn it.

934
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:34,885
Hey.

935
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:37,554
Hey!

936
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,145
Special Act on Traffic Accidents.

937
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,982
Violation of school zones,

938
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,067
and a casualty accident.

939
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:55,530
You're not getting on a plane today.
Want to know why?

940
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,909
Because I won't agree to a settlement.

941
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,954
You damn asshole!

942
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,050
Hey.

943
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,594
Hey.

944
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:23,099
He keeps laughing.
Please get here quickly.

945
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,144
You're crazy.

946
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:27,854
What's so funny?

947
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,318
You asshole!

948
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,321
That bastard is going to stall
until it blows over.

949
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,115
Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

950
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:24,369
Senior Officer Ji, take care of Dong-ju.

951
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,913
He doesn't listen to others,
but he listens to you.

952
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,750
I'm here to tell you something, Han-na.

953
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,962
There's definitely someone backing him.

954
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,339
Run away as best as you can. Good luck.

955
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,676
This is a synthetic drug called Candy.

956
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,928
I think it made its way
into Korea recently.

957
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,306
The manufacturer of Candy

958
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:45,390
is Drug Demon.

959
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,058
-Hey, Dung-ju!
-Hey!

960
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:48,935
In this day and age,

961
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:52,772
how often do you see a man
willing to sacrifice himself

962
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,316
for the woman he loves?

963
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:01,031
