1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,098
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,808
RETENTION RIGHTS BEING EXERCISED

4
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,365
I'm stepping out for a bit.

5
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,116
I'll bring Dong-ju
a change of clothes too.

6
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:57,618
Do you need anything?

7
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,750
Jong-hyeon.

8
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,719
I like Dong-ju a lot.

9
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,184
I'm sorry, Jong-hyeon.

10
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,190
Don't say you're sorry.

11
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,652
It makes it feel like I really lost.

12
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,405
I'll be back.

13
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,664
POLICE IN FULL PURSUIT
OF FUGITIVE OFFICER YOON

14
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,375
What's going on? Where's the commissioner?

15
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,253
He took off for Seoul yesterday
to attend a seminar.

16
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,797
-No contact with him since.
-What about Min Ju-yeong?

17
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,923
We're looking,

18
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,342
but we can't track him down.

19
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,262
What about the senior superintendent?
I can't reach him either.

20
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,764
He went on a business trip
to the US a few days ago.

21
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,433
I think he'll be there for a while.

22
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,686
So there's no one to help us.

23
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,688
Is Yoon Dong-ju okay?

24
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,064
Where is he right now?

25
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,192
We moved him to a safe place,
but he isn't doing well.

26
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,069
Captain.

27
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,882
Yes, Captain.

28
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,677
Captain!

29
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,512
Hey.

30
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,016
DO NOT ENTER
ONGOING INVESTIGATION

31
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,185
This is a total mess.

32
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,270
The whole jurisdiction is falling apart,

33
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,272
but the damn commissioner
is covering his own ass.

34
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,899
Just like Min Ju-yeong planned it.

35
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,362
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

36
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,899
How've you been?

37
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:39,947
Where are you going?

38
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,372
Where do you think you're going?

39
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,882
You bastard.

40
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,677
You had to run your damn mouth.

41
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,897
That mouth of yours
is what got you into trouble.

42
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,029
We can't do anything
because of that damn bastard.

43
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,531
The police are a joke now.

44
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,574
Damn it!

45
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,494
He wouldn't be so bold
unless the rumor were true.

46
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,499
Welcome, sir.

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,628
This is the SPO's chief
of the Criminal Department.

48
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,132
I just met with the chief
of the Criminal Department.

49
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,135
Golden Bunny will be transferred
to the SPO in Seoul by tomorrow.

50
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:44,928
Please take a seat.

51
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,724
There's a rumor that the commissioner
and the SPO are forming a new SCIT.

52
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,319
SERGEANT KIM JONG-HYEON

53
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,325
-The person you are calling--
-He's not answering.

54
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,993
What the hell are these bastards up to?

55
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,746
They're trying to cover up everything.

56
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,958
Just in case, let's move our files
that are at the pawnshop.

57
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,461
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

58
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,004
What happened here?

59
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,093
Hey!

60
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,303
Hey, wake up!

61
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,013
Hey.

62
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,681
He's already dead.

63
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,725
Pawnshop.

64
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,519
Answer the damn phone, Pawnshop!

65
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,647
I'm right here, punk.

66
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,274
I stumbled into the wrong place, right?

67
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,235
-What happened here?
-What the hell happened?

68
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,572
Oh, goodness.

69
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,159
What about the bald eagle?

70
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,702
-Gwang-se?
-Gwang-se!

71
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:51,870
-Look for a bright spot.
-Gwang-se.

72
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,164
-Hey, Gwang-se!
-Look for the shiny guy!

73
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,041
-Gwang-se!
-Hold on!

74
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,300
It's here.

75
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,511
Our food is here. Go get it.

76
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,725
Jjamppong is the best on a rainy day.

77
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,944
Hello.

78
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,458
Please don't come near here.

79
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,009
RUSSIAN MAFIA GANGS AND A KOREAN SMUGGLER

80
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:48,927
Hey.

81
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,271
Who are you?

82
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,114
Why didn't you come sooner?

83
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,493
Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?

84
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,914
If I go to the hospital
and those guys see me,

85
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,666
they'll definitely kill me.

86
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,586
Sergeant Kim, call the police.

87
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,713
Your shiny head deflected the bullet.

88
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,882
-You won't die. You were lucky.
-Hello?

89
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,718
This is Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.
I'm at the Insung Pawnshop.

90
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,928
We need backup.

91
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:37,142
You're not going to die.
You'll live to see all your hair fall out.

92
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,228
Captain, something's off.

93
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,354
What do you mean?

94
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,815
If their plan
was to kill him from the start,

95
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,734
they wouldn't have gone this far.

96
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,034
You're right.

97
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,827
It wasn't a quick kill attempt.

98
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,664
Did you see anything else?

99
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,706
Well…

100
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,542
Sergei said…

101
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,713
It's okay.

102
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,756
Vlad…

103
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,217
Vlad…

104
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,596
Leo Vladimirovich Svarsky.

105
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,973
Svarsky.

106
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,434
Vladimir Ilyich Svarsky.

107
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,478
Hang on.

108
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,189
Leo Vladimirovich Svarsky?

109
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,069
Russians have names
derived from their father's name.

110
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,195
If that's the case,

111
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,489
they're father and son.

112
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,199
After he said that,

113
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,952
the guy just shot up the whole place.

114
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,090
What?

115
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,764
Why are you

116
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,725
only now

117
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,102
telling me that?

118
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,775
That means Sergei passed on a clue.

119
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,320
Those damn bastards.

120
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,904
Don't be scared, okay?

121
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,663
SERGEI KIRILLOVICH VRONSKY

122
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,165
HAN SANG-BIN, 60
OH DOLLAR'S CONFIDANT

123
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,208
1 OFFICER DIES
INVESTIGATING A RUSSIAN MAFIA SHOOTING

124
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,293
SERGEANT JI HO-CHEOL'S DEATH

125
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,923
Hey, this is too scary for me.

126
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,343
I have a chronic heart condition,

127
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,635
so please leave.

128
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,305
I won't charge you for using the place,
so please leave!

129
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,016
You're the biggest curse in my life!

130
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,309
Isn't this the file from before?

131
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,645
OH DOLLAR'S CONTRABAND FROM 2008

132
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,940
I think Han-na has been investigating
this case on her own.

133
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,525
OH DOLLAR
OH BONG-CHAN, 8 PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS

134
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,779
Senior Officer Ji dug this deep into it?

135
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,464
Did you find her?

136
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:17,302
I confirmed that she left by car,
but I don't know where she went.

137
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,180
I can't get in touch with her.

138
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:24,059
Hurry up and find her.

139
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,573
Hey, Mr. Min.

140
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,825
How did it go?

141
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,912
We packed up the goods,
but the trucks haven't arrived.

142
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,707
That lazy-ass bastard is way too slow.

143
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,878
Just move the goods
as soon as they arrive.

144
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,966
But won't she lose it
when she finds out they're gone?

145
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,051
She's a little busy today.

146
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,429
Something came up, you see.

147
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,764
SEONGIL INN

148
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,865
What made you tell her?

149
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,784
The deal is done,
so I have to keep my promise.

150
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:24,995
What about Yoon Dong-ju?

151
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,413
We're looking for the little mutt.

152
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,124
We're combing through Insung,
so we'll find him soon.

153
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,501
What should I do when I find him?

154
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,503
Should I bring him in alive?

155
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,464
What for? Don't bother.

156
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,048
Just…

157
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,136
kill him, nice and neat.

158
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,100
Did you really think
everything would be over

159
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,269
after the count and the 12th round?

160
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,645
It's been fun.

161
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,191
Enjoy your trip to the afterlife.

162
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,696
Yoon Dong-ju.

163
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,406
I'm right here.

164
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,533
Yoon Dong-ju. Look at me.

165
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,701
Dong-ju.

166
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,871
It's okay, Dong-ju.

167
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,956
It's fine.

168
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,662
I thought…

169
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,165
I'd never see you again.

170
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,671
I'm so glad I'm able to…

171
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,218
see you again.

172
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,183
Don't smile.

173
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,395
You look silly.

174
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,988
I wish

175
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,241
I could look at your face for longer…

176
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,745
but I'm sleepy.

177
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,541
It's because of the medicine.

178
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,085
Go back to sleep.

179
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,087
I'll be right here.

180
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,022
Who are you?

181
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,234
Are you my sister?

182
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,000
You found my hairpin for me.

183
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,169
Thank you.

184
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,922
But…

185
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,008
who are you?

186
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,180
You shouldn't be living like this

187
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:14,974
after sending me off that way.

188
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,643
Why did you end up like this?

189
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,895
You sent me to that hellhole

190
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,105
and promised to come.

191
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,148
You said you'd come and get me.

192
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,195
Do you know what my life was like?

193
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,657
At the very least,

194
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,992
you shouldn't have forgotten me.

195
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,703
I came here to kill you,

196
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,246
but you don't even recognize me.

197
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,042
Why are you doing this to me?

198
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,836
Take a good look at me.

199
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,423
You swore you'd remember my eyes,
no matter how much I changed.

200
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,133
Look at me.

201
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,509
I said look at me.

202
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,885
Look me in the eye!

203
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,187
Please give me more candy.

204
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,106
You promised to give me candy

205
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,942
if I waited here quietly.

206
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,821
So give me some candy now!

207
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,953
Who told you that?

208
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,872
Who said that

209
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,040
to you?

210
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,587

that they caused such disruptions
in an attempt to catch

214
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,103
Officer Yoon Dong-ju
who's currently wanted.

215
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,898

Officer Oh?

220
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,504
You asked me to let you know

221
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,632
if Senior Officer Ji ever came
to check out her firearms.

222
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,972
You must be going to the airport
for support duty again.

223
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,682
You only need one gun, right?

224
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,892
No, I'll take them all.

225
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,019
All of my firearms and ammo.

226
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,813
All of that ammo?

227
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,606
Yes.

228
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,984
Some pest birds are flying around,
so I want to catch them.

Your call cannot be connected…

234
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:52,775
Open the door yourself.

235
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,569
Your legs must hurt.

236
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,070
Where's Senior Officer Ji?

237
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,740
Oh, my goodness. What in the world?

238
00:19:58,823 --> 00:19:59,908
Officer Yoon.

239
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,534
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, no.

240
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,745
I was told good fortune was coming,
but it's one bad thing after another.

241
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,664
-Jeez.
-We need to destroy that bastard.

242
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,624
What's wrong?

243
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,760
Hurry up!

244
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,888
I said hurry up!

245
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,648
Did Senior Officer Ji Han-na
go there to provide support?

246
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,024
You haven't heard from her?

247
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,109
Okay.

248
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,570
She's not at the airport.

249
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,572
Senior Inspector Kang and Dae-yong
don't know either.

250
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,744
What was Han-na
investigating most recently?

251
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,545

David Oh.

261
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,041
I think that's Oh Dollar's son.

262
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,667
Oh Dollar's son?

263
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,336
I heard he moved to the US
after Oh Dollar died.

264
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,588
It's him.

265
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,883
He liked dealing in dollars,
so he gave his son an international name.

I think

271
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,565
I know where Han-na went.

272
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,185
I'll go to the agency first
and request backup.

273
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,603
Call me if anything happens.

274
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,729
-Be careful.
-Okay.

275
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,357
And you two stay right here

-Okay, got it.
-See you.

00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,361
Wait, did he just order us?

278
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,196
Who does he think he is?

279
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,914
Hey, Mr. Min!

280
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,985
Hey.

281
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,027
Hey!

282
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,738
You stupid bitch!

283
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,493
Goddammit.

284
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,040
Open the door!

285
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,709
Open it!

286
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,004
You bitch.

287
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,423
Come here.

288
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:27,967
Come here.

289
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,890
Did you see your older sister?

290
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,517
How did it feel to see her again?

291
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,857
Given her state,
I'm not sure she recognized you.

292
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,276
-Hey!
-Get back!

293
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,653
Sit down!

294
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,405
Don't waste your energy.

295
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,158
What's wrong?

296
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,412
I just let her have a taste of the goods
her younger sister made.

297
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,165
Why are you being so sentimental?

298
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:03,878
She sent you in her place
to live with junkies in the US.

299
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,379
You wanted her dead anyway.

300
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,798
No one kills her but me!

301
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:08,925
Who do you think you are?

302
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,635
Why the hell would you do that?

303
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,429
Why?

304
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:16,432
Don't act like you don't know.

305
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,898
Doesn't this look familiar?

306
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:27,777
Hold out for ten minutes.

307
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,116
What's with the good-girl act?
That's not who you are.

308
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,534
You saved someone.

309
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,579
You refuse to sell drugs to kids or women.

310
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,164
You make drugs but don't take them.

311
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,290
You're being fake.

312
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,168
Good for you for always being the same.

313
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,676
You quit using about ten years ago, right?

314
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,345
Take one and forget everything.

315
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,471
-Lift your head up.
-Open wide.

316
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,306
Open your mouth.

317
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,474
Open it!

318
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,443
Now swallow it.

319
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,656
This is stronger than what you made.

320
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,658
We upgraded your recipe.

321
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,293
Hey, you shouldn't spit out
something that expensive.

322
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,585
What a waste.

323
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,842
Come on.

324
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,512
If you're a bitch, then live up to it.

325
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,726
Just look at you.

326
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:49,775
Hello?

327
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,651
Mr. Min.

328
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,362
Mr. Min, are you okay?

329
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,950
Who the hell was that?

330
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,371
What are you doing?
Go find the rat who did this!

331
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,838
-Let's go!
-You all right, Mr. Min?

332
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,757
Come on. We need to get you inside.

333
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,362
Where are they all going?

334
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,197
Hey, stop!

335
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,032
Wait. Stop!

336
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,284
Help us! We need your help!

337
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,836
Dae-yong, help us.

338
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,421
Where are all of you going?

339
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,797
The Victory Hotel.

340
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,676
The Insung Metropolitan Police Agency,
Insung District Prosecutors' Office,

341
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,429
and Supreme Prosecutors' Office
have announced

342
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,598
they will form a special joint task force
to investigate and identify the source

343
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,434
of recently discovered cash.

344
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,187
Dang it.

345
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,440
Everyone who's anyone is here right now.

346
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,483
How many officers remain at the agency?

347
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,571
Even if there were any left,
nobody would help.

348
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,908
Simply mentioning the bastard
is enough to trigger an audit,

349
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,618
and the press won't react to it.

350
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,120
They've lost their damn minds.

351
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,123
They're kissing his ass
to cover their own!

352
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,125
By the way, about Senior Officer Ji,

353
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,711
one of my guys
saw her this morning at the station.

354
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,589
I apologize for the inconvenience,
but for security purposes,

355
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,884
we'll be collecting everyone's phones.

356
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,094
There are many reporters,
so we must be careful.

357
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,231
There she is. Get her!

358
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,025
Get her! Come on!

359
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,634
Mr. Min, are you okay?

360
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,142
How did it go?

361
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:56,397
You damn idiots. You can't catch one girl?

362
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,441
Who cares if she has a gun?

363
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,485
Bring her here now.

364
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,698
Mr. Min, you head up first.

365
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,268
Where's Min Ju-yeong?

366
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,188
You bitch!

367
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,222
The 20th floor.

368
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,516
Or the penthouse.

369
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,768
Over there.

370
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,818
Damn it, where is she?

371
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,569
Find her.

372
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,570
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

373
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:35,931
Over there!

374
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,742
Kill that bitch!

375
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,877
You damn bitch!

376
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,264
THE CENTER OF THE WORLD AND FUTURE
GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY

377
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,683
Don't just stand there! Kill that bitch!

378
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:56,905
Did you get her?

379
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,311
Fucking hell.

380
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,646
That crazy bitch!

381
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,200
-Hey!
-Who are you?

382
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,453
-What the hell?
-We have an intruder.

383
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:18,528
Come at me.

384
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:26,638
"WATERFALL"

385
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,425
You came to kill me with just this?

386
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,142
I'd be dead
if that bullet had hit its mark.

387
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:17,939
But it seems like you've lost your touch,
Shooting Fairy.

388
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:23,111
Or maybe you can't shoot moving targets.

389
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,240
Guess you're right.

390
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,659
So you'd better keep running
until the end.

391
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,745
If you stop, you're dead.

392
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,915
Why is everyone
so hell-bent on killing me?

393
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,209
Because you're a bad guy.

394
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:41,004
Staging the murder of
Korea Customs Service Officer Lee Jin-su

395
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,756
as a car accident.

396
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,342
Forcing a confession
from Mr. Lee Gyeong-il

397
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,718
and soliciting his murder.

398
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:48,929
Soliciting the murder
of a correctional officer as a cover-up.

399
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,890
Smuggling vehicles and illegal firearms.

400
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,475
Manufacturing and distributing drugs.

401
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,268
Bribery and obstruction
of official duties.

402
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,353
Now we can add

403
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,231
an attempted murder of an officer.

404
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,152
Isn't it okay to just kill a guy so vile?

405
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,534
I don't remember any of that.

406
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:24,840
Actually, I do.

407
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,802
I crushed Lee Jin-su with my car.

408
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,848
I solicited murder.

409
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,644
I manufactured and distributed drugs.

410
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,066
Do you have any solid evidence
I did all of that?

411
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,026
Or did you think

412
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,988
you could catch me if you had evidence?

413
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,663
You can bark and growl all you want.

414
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,874
But no one will ever know…

415
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,877
who I really am…

416
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:06,882
or what I've done.

417
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,093
They'll know now.

418
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,929
They'll know who you are

419
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,640
and who owns that money.

420
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,478
Please.

421
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,898
You just have to go live.

422
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,319
So that the world can know
who that bastard really is.

423
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,698
Say hello, Mr. Min Ju-yeong.

424
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,242
Everyone's watching live.

425
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,585
INTRODUCING NEW BODY CAMERAS
TO SAFEGUARD INSUNG CITIZENS

426
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,797
THIS IS THE UGLY TRUTH OF INSUNG.
PLEASE HELP, SHE'S FIGHTING ALONE.

427
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,216
Shouldn't we provide backup?

428
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:50,550
Come on, nobody will do that.

429
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,510
Hey, Jae-hong. What's this about?

430
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:53,929
Does this have to do with the SCIT?

431
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,681
URGENT! UNCOVERING THE MASTERMIND
BEHIND INSUNG'S CRIMES

432
00:41:58,725 --> 00:41:59,643
Is this a recording?

433
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,312
-No, it's streaming live right now.
-That's insane.

434
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,105
This bastard shot a cop?

435
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,858
Isn't everyone else at the Victory Hotel?
Shouldn't we provide backup?

436
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:09,110
Who is this? He looks pretty normal.

437
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,487
He's not an ex-convict, is he?

438
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,364
Isn't this Senior Officer Ji Han-na?

439
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,783
She was dying to get out there and now…

440
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,201
But this looks too dangerous.

441
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,912
Captain, have you seen…

442
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,664
Captain?

443
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,832
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up and share this.

444
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,756
EVERYONE, PLEASE WATCH THIS…

445
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:30,715
LIVE CHAT

446
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,218
Do these people know about this?

447
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,180
Publicly, we'll present a strong response

448
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:40,475
through the special joint task force
and control the media narrative--

449
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,354
If this keeps up,
we can't cover for Insung anymore.

450
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:45,772
I understand.

451
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,233
-That's why I'm telling you--
-A comment, please, Commissioner!

452
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,694
What are you doing behind locked doors?

453
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,404
-What's going on?
-Seriously!

454
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,157
-Do you even know what's going on?
-Hey, bring me my phone.

455
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,577
Hey, give me mine.

456
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:05,375
What's this all about?

457
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:10,297
PROSECUTION-POLICE JOINT TASK FORCE
HOLDS EMERGENCY PRIVATE MEETING

458
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,090
I went to so many convenience stores to--

459
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:16,469
Why?

460
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:25,895
So what's the deal?

461
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,028
PROSECUTORS AND POLICE BLOCK PRESS ACCESS
MEETING HELD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

462
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,769
You crazy bitch.

463
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:10,231
Mr. Min, she's really something else.

464
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,443
My clothes are ruined because of you.
I'm covered in powder.

465
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,114
Boss.

466
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:20,533
Damn it.

467
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,659
Mr. Min.

468
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,044
Starting from Yoon Dong-ju…

469
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,588
You guys are such a pain in the ass.

470
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:36,758
Please take care of the goods.

471
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,386
Go downstairs and get the trucks ready.

472
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,512
Yes, sir.

473
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:44,808
Hey. Don't you dare move.

474
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,018
Let's go.

475
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,702
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

476
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,666
Why are you taking so many painkillers?

477
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,084
I have to go.

478
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,794
No, you don't.

479
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,170
Hey, Dung-ju.

480
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,423
Dung-ju, you can't go out in that shape.

481
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:20,009
-Officer Yoon, you might die.
-You'll just be a burden.

482
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:27,851
Officer Yoon!

483
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,579
I'm exhausted.

484
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,372
Should we wrap this up?

485
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,332
Come on.

486
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,461
This is the end of the line.

487
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:58,548
I'll give you an unforgettable experience.

488
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,657
Who the hell are you?

489
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:36,044
PAWNSHOP

490
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:39,714
What's going on?

491
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,844
We're outnumbered!

492
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:47,597
-They're fighting like crazy!
-Help us!

493
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:51,476
That's right! Get him!

494
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,560
Get him!

495
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,064
Good job!

496
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,150
Where are you going?

497
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:01,903
-Officer Yoon!
-What are you saying?

498
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,462
Hey!

499
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,134
You punks.

500
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,691
Go upstairs! Hurry!

501
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,362
That's dangerous!

502
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:18,771
Bye now.

503
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:25,028
If you pull that trigger, you'll die too.

504
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,996
Everyone's after me today.

505
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,914
But it seems

506
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:39,000
you're aiming at the wrong person.

507
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,753
No, it was always aimed at you.

508
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:50,136
I know who killed your father.

509
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,263
What?

510
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:56,100
Oh Dollar didn't kill your father.

511
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,895
I know who killed your father.

512
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,525
Do you want my help?

513
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,654
Who was it?

514
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:12,950
Oh Dollar.

515
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:22,502
The man who killed your father
gave you that gun.

516
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,392
Hey. Go.

517
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,043
You're forgetting your place,
you Black Cat bastard!

518
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,962
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

519
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:06,963
You asshole!

520
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,526
Fuck!

521
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,195
Mr. Min!

522
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:33,865
You okay?

523
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:36,492
Damn it.

524
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:39,537
I'm heading down.

525
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,960
There's one more left.

526
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,922
What took you so long to get here?

527
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:52,216
Jeez, it's been a while
since I've used my fists.

528
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,594
This sound isn't coming from my mouth.

529
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,472
It's coming from my foot.

530
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,765
Where the hell is Dong-ju?

531
00:50:58,848 --> 00:50:59,724
Dong-ju?

532
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,642
He helped out a bit before leaving.

533
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,269
Where did he go?

534
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:11,402
Hey.

535
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:13,321
Move.

536
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:21,954
Hey, make way.

537
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:23,664
Move.

538
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:35,885
What the heck?

539
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,053
Who is that?

540
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,819
What the hell?

541
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,279
You'd better bite down,
or this will knock your jaw loose.

542
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,329
-Hey, look!
-Quick! Get a shot of that!

543
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:32,108
Are you okay? What the hell did you do?

544
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,150
You'll get killed here!

545
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,027
Everyone needs to know who the bad guy is.

546
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,237
Hurry up and get in.

547
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,698
-Hurry up!
-Come on!

548
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,907
Who was that?

549
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,877
Move out!

550
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,847
Why are you helping me?

551
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:11,480
I'm merely returning kindness,
though it's belated.

552
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,568
Where's your father?
Why did you come alone?

553
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,321
-You little bastard.
-What's going on here?

554
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,197
Who the hell are you?

555
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:31,834
He must be a cop. Run!

556
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,388
It's okay.

557
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:47,725
What's your name?

558
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,353
Leo.

559
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:52,563
How old are you?

560
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:57,276
I'm 18.

561
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:00,571
Give that to me.

562
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,661
This doesn't look right for you.

563
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,248
Maybe

564
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,626
this is God's way…

565
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,673
of finally letting me make amends.

566
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,436
Let's get you up.

567
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,709
I didn't hurt you too badly, did I?

568
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:55,876
You son of a bitch!

569
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,429
Why can't you gentlemen calm down?

570
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,901
If you go down the hallway,
you'll see an exit.

571
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,695
My men will be there.

572
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,325
Take this.

573
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:30,536
It belonged to your father.

574
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,144
Hey, look who it is.

575
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,521
Where are you taking the elevator to?

576
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:59,565
I need to take it. Get off.

577
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,525
I said get off!

578
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,446
What are you waiting for?

579
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:07,990
Get back here!

580
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,261
Is there anything you want?

581
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,596
I want a digital camera.

582
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:32,640
A digital camera?

583
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,058
One that records too.

584
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,381
Where the hell is it?

585
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:24,024
-Captain, over there.
-Okay.

586
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,906
Captain, watch the truck!

587
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:33,075
Get out of the damn car!

588
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,204
-Ram into them!
-Out of the way!

589
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:38,581
Just ram into them!

590
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,333
Watch out, Captain!

591
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,880
Hold on tight! Oh, you're all set.

592
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:51,802
There's nowhere to go.

593
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:56,307
No turning back! Get out of my way!

594
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,224
Out of my way!

595
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:02,813
What's this?

596
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,406
Have they lost their minds?

597
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,579
Let's go up.

598
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,042
Go upstairs and get the money.

599
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,762
Yoon Dong…

600
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,430
-Who did you say it was?
-Yoon Dong…

601
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,515
Who was it? Tell me.

602
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,642
Yoon…

603
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,727
Jeez, take good care of yourself.

604
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,229
Take him away.

605
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,237
RESTRICTED NUMBER

606
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,363
The person you are calling…

607
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,381
It's so damn loud.

608
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:22,977
Hey.

609
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,646
Think you can manage?

610
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,733
Once you start a fight,
you have to see it through.

611
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,735
See you later.

612
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,199
I didn't mean he should take off.

613
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:39,493
The moment you step into the ring,

614
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,246
there's no turning back.

615
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,211
Once you're in,

616
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:51,714
you've got to go all the way.

617
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,552
Dong-ju, they're all here!

618
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:57,636
Over here!

619
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,160
Give it your all and move forward.

620
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,299
Thirty seconds.

621
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:38,427
Load.

622
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:41,930
Start.

623
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:57,696
It's time to pull the trigger…

624
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:00,949
and break the silence.

625
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:47,788
Take this.

626
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,081
It belonged to your father.

627
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:50,958
Min Ju-yeong!

628
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,751
Did you come alone?

629
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:55,504
-He's not one to die that easily.
-You bastard!

630
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,131
Han-na.

631
01:01:58,132 --> 01:01:59,883
Han-na, get it together. Ji Han-na!

632
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:01,135
Shut the hell up!

633
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,303
Your trucks came too damn late.

634
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,432
Someone told Min Ju-yeong
that I came here.

635
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:08,767
Min Ju-yeong won't give up the Candy.

636
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,645
Just out of curiosity,

637
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,690
when did you start hating me?

638
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:16,275
From the beginning.

639
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:17,985
Why?

640
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,653
Your smile bothered me.

641
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,281
No matter how battered and broken he is…

642
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:26,535
a king never dies…

643
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,580
until he's crushed

644
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,458
his opponent.

645
