1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,804
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,973
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,201
The third round has begun.

4
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,203
Yoon Dong-ju needs to push a bit harder.

5
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,455
The gold medal is just within reach.

6
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,708
He needs to focus
and put his weight behind every punch.

7
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,128
Right hook!

8
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,297
He's got to keep pressing in!

9
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,633
Yoon Dong-ju is doing a great job.

10
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,469
He and his opponent are exchanging blows.

11
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,013
He tagged him with that left hook.

12
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,140
Yoon Dong-ju is putting up a great fight.

13
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,102
His opponent targets his right side
and then moves in for the clinch.

14
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,189
Yoon Dong-ju needs to hang in there.

15
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:50,820
We're underway again.

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,907
He lands a left hook.
Yoon Dong-ju needs to push through!

17
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,951
He has to keep moving
and not take these hits!

18
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,543
It's too late to dodge
if you wait to see the fist.

19
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,921
A punch doesn't start with the fist.

20
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,676
It starts with the shoulder.

21
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,845
Now aim for an opening…

22
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,056
outside the line of sight…

23
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,476
of your opponent.

24
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,979
The person you are calling
cannot be reached.

25
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,063
You will be directed to…

26
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,773
DUNG-JU

27
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:15,779
WARNING
DO NOT TOUCH, DOG WILL BITE

28
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,741
Han-na, I'll call you in a bit.

29
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,668
VICTORY GYM

30
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,345
The flower fell.

31
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,889
And there are only four leaves left.

32
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,686
Just like me.

33
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:39,530
BRAVE CITIZEN IS THE SUSPECT?
TWIST AFTER ILLEGAL BUSINESS BUST

34
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,698
TURD DUNG-JU

35
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,993
The phone is turned off…

36
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,954
He won't answer his phone.

37
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,541
He hasn't come home for days.
What in the world is he doing out there?

38
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,338
GWANG-SE

39
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,717
The number you have dialed
is no longer in service…

40
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,807
-What is it?
-What the heck?

41
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,267
EMERGENCY ALERT
LOOKING FOR LEE GWANG-SE

42
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,936
-What's going on?
-Isn't it that guy over there?

43
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,980
-It looks just like him.
-It does.

44
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,356
-Right?
-You're right.

45
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,483
-It's him.
-I think it's him.

46
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,444
He matches the description.

47
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,653
MALE, 40S, CHUBBY, BALD EAGLE TATTOO

48
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:21,905
-It says the guy has a tattoo.
-A tattoo?

49
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,407
-Isn't that it?
-Is that an eagle?

50
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,491
No, it's not.

51
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,286
-It's not?
-No, please don't mind me. Bon appétit!

52
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,200
This is a shame. You had a great team.

53
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,284
Hello, sir.

54
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,705
-Did you get discharged?
-Yes.

55
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,540
Good to see you're doing better.

56
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,502
All your teammates
were assigned to different teams.

57
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,879
What's happening to you?

58
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,756
I'm not sure.

59
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:25,552
I don't know.

60
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,348
FORENSIC

61
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,516
Oh, right.

62
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,351
Do you have some time?

63
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,936
I need to show you something.

64
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:47,950
AUTOPSY REPORT
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

65
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,410
3 BODIES FOUND IN TOTAL

66
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:54,331
1 IDENTIFIED, 2 UNIDENTIFIED

67
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,335
Is it okay for you to show me this?

68
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,423
I can tell something is off about a case
just by looking at the bodies.

69
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,093
And I know who'll take an interest in it.

70
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,513
Ask the NFS for more details.

71
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,473
All the files have been sent to them.

72
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,892
Okay.

73
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,613
I'm so stressed.
No wonder I'm losing hair.

74
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,367
-Hey.
-Oh, jeez!

75
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,452
A comb-over won't make a difference.

76
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,371
Detective.

77
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,956
You did this, didn't you?

78
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,499
Isn't this a waste
of government resources?

79
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,002
Are you allowed
to use your authority like this?

80
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,380
This is a waste of taxpayer money.
Haven't you considered that?

81
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,215
Whatever. You don't even pay taxes.

82
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,092
You shouldn't have changed your number.

83
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,304
Why are you looking for me?
What is it this time?

84
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,183
You know where Dong-ju is, don't you?

85
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,521
How should I know?

86
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,525
-Goodness, that man's hair…
-Who? What about it?

87
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,031
-It's already unlocked.
-Damn it.

88
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,200
-Let's see here.
-I'm so stressed.

89
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,994
"Dragon PC Café,"
and "Gyelim Day Labor Agency."

90
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,830
These are all the places
where Dong-ju caused trouble.

91
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,041
You're the only one
who can give him this information.

92
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,542
Where's Dong-ju now?

93
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,547
Oh, my, hello.

94
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,635
Is Senior Officer Ji not here?

95
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,347
She's out of the office
to verify some files.

96
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,724
Out for work or whatever. Who knows?

97
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,310
It's hard to work with kids these days.

98
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,064
Anyway, how are you feeling?

99
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,691
I've never met someone who's been shot.

100
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,736
-Was it your side?
-I'm fine now.

101
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,820
-You sure?
-Yes.

102
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:49,863
-Good day.
-Okay.

103
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,365
Or was it his arm?

104
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,951
RECORDS ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

105
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,539
Excuse me.

106
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,457
Yes?

107
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,668
Do you know where she went?

108
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,294
INIL DINER

109
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,464
Oh Bong-chan?

110
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,050
Do you mean Oh Dollar,
the smuggler from way back when?

111
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,176
Yes.

112
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,012
You were the detective
in charge of the case back then.

113
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,683
I suppose, but not really.

114
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,686
Excuse me? What do you mean?

115
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,983
That was my first case
when I got transferred.

116
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,527
But I didn't do much.

117
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,322
They obviously got into an altercation
with each other and died.

118
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,408
What else is there to investigate?

119
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,286
Let's wrap things up here and go.

120
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,497
The higher-ups did the investigation.

121
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,125
All I did was sign the papers.

122
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:48,255
Then, by any chance, is there someone
who might be familiar with the case?

123
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,883
Goodness, it's been so long.

124
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,261
My senior colleagues from back then
have passed away.

125
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,347
Wait.

126
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,477
-You know what?
-What?

127
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,229
There's no food.

128
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,731
-Ma'am, can we get--
-Grilled hagfish.

129
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,817
A large order of grilled hagfish, please.

130
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,487
You sure know how to treat someone right.

131
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:18,702
There's a place called Hyedong Oil.

132
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,705
You'll find a thug that sells ship fuel.

133
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,042
HYEDONG OIL

134
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,501
-Is this the place?
-Yes.

135
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,549
Be careful.

136
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,720
Officer Yoon stirred up the place,
so everyone is pretty riled up.

137
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,430
-You're not coming?
-Jeez, no.

138
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,391
It'll be a real pain if they see me.

139
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,602
-So I'm not--
-Run!

140
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,444
Keep still!

141
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,321
What was that?

142
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,908
Damn, the shit already hit the fan.

143
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,619
I'll see you later.
Good luck meeting with him!

144
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,788
What the hell do you mean?

145
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,459
Damn it, now everyone knows my hideout.

146
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,297
So you're looking for
a lady police officer?

147
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,132
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,803
Can I get a large order of flounder?

149
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,514
-Make it an extra large, please.
-An extra large, please.

150
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,182
HYEDONG OIL

151
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,947
-Hey, Gwang-se. Where's your loyalty?
-Move!

152
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,031
Hey!

153
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,991
I guess you don't have any.
Wait, you punk!

154
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,287
-Who are they?
-The guys Officer Yoon stirred up.

155
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,872
If they catch us, we're dead!

156
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,083
-That idiot!
-Get them!

157
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,380
Dae-yong, get over here!
We're in big trouble!

158
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:55,882
Get your ass over here!

159
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:56,842
Let go of me!

160
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,801
No, not you!

161
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,177
Come quickly!

162
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,222
My location is…

163
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,518
Hyedong Oil in Jinam-dong!

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,563
We're about to die here!

165
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,565
Hey, kill them.

166
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,326
Are you okay?

167
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,120
Dong-ju!

168
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,496
Yoon Dong-ju.

169
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,917
You're the bastard from earlier.
Who the hell are you?

170
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,211
-Rude little bastards.
-I got you now.

171
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,880
Hey, kill them!

172
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,132
Move.

173
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,886
-Senior Officer Ji!
-Ma'am!

174
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,973
You rude little punk.

175
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,341
Why did you get discharged already?

176
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,842
You had a few more days left.

177
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,678
I just wanted to get out.

178
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,557
Why are you here anyway?

179
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,058
Are you investigating something?

180
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,020
It's nothing.

181
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,065
There was a reference statement
missing from a file.

182
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,316
Don't worry about it.

183
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,701
This is Yoon Dong-ju's doing, right?

184
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,245
And the wholesale supermarket
and club incidents?

185
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,414
I don't know. Just pretend you don't know.

186
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,416
Fine by me.
It'll improve my performance record.

187
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,711
But be careful.
Things at the agency are bad.

188
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,963
What about the Russian mafia
who shot Sergeant Kim?

189
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,673
We've put out an APB,

190
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,967
but the other agencies aren't cooperating,

191
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,468
so it's hard to track him down.

192
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,345
The good news is

193
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,639
there's no sign he stowed away
or left the country yet,

194
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,600
and the cargo ship is still docked here.

195
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,811
He's waiting for things to quiet down.

196
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,491
Are you going to sit there
and not say a word?

197
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:11,870
You little bastard!

198
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,581
I ought to take this smoke vent
and shove it in your mouth!

199
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,255
You idiot.

200
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,008
Do you think beating up some thugs
will make any difference?

201
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,719
Nothing happened even when we had
officers getting stabbed and shot.

202
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,139
No matter what you do,
the higher-ups will just cover it all up!

203
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,351
Digging into a cold case
will only lead to trouble.

204
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,063
If it's gone cold,
we'll make it hot again.

205
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,106
What?

206
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,150
We've been looking at this the wrong way.

207
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,527
We have to watch the shoulder
instead of the fist.

208
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,072
We should've thought of

209
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,783
the source of his power.

210
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,369
What do you mean?

211
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,079
An ordinary civil servant

212
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,205
mobilizes the local gang,

213
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,332
the Korean Chinese gang,
and even the Russian mafia.

214
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,919
The power to control the mayor
and cover things up

215
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,129
comes from money.

216
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:04,756
It's money.

217
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,549
That's the source of his power.

218
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,427
Used cars, drugs,
and firearms trafficking.

219
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:13,014
Including earnings from other businesses,
a rough estimate of his total revenue

220
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,100
is over several hundred billion won.

221
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,853
Where did all that money go?

222
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:22,732
Is that the reason you've been taking down
everyone wearing gold watches?

223
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,900
Yes.

224
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,026
By yourself?

225
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,657
Any leads?

226
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,536
Does anyone know where he hid the money?

227
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,080
No.

228
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,040
I haven't had any luck so far.

229
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,752
It's not like we can ask
Min Ju-yeong for the location.

230
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,922
At this point, it seems impossible.

231
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,466
It's not entirely impossible.

232
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,514
Three bodies were found inside a container

233
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,683
on the Russian cargo ship.

234
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,437
One was a Japanese international student.

235
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,524
The other two were dead for too long
to get a positive ID.

236
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,861
But one of them was missing
their two front teeth.

237
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,030
No front teeth? Could it be Silver Bunny?

238
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,702
I'm not sure, but it's very likely.

239
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,621
If we can confirm this,
Golden Bunny might talk.

240
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,417
Let's wait for the NFS results for now.

241
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,919
We'll figure out
what to do afterward and--

242
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,131
-Here are your two extra bowls of rice.
-We didn't order that.

243
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,341
Over here, ma'am.

244
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,553
Enjoy your meal. Oh, this is hot.

245
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,986
I'm going to take off first
to deal with this punk.

246
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,070
You're driving.

247
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,282
-At least let me finish my meal.
-Earn your keep!

248
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,290
So…

249
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,501
How's your ankle?

250
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,545
I still need to get treatment,

251
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,131
but I can walk on it.

252
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,889
I'll drop you off. Get in.

253
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,601
I'm good. I can walk on my own two legs.

254
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:22,811
I'm walking too.

255
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,437
See you later.

256
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,654
Get home safely.

257
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,949
See you.

258
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,843
Why did you come here?

259
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,303
Do you even need to ask?

260
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:01,808
Are we going up there?

261
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:07,939
I'll walk you home.

262
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:10,608
No.

263
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,693
VICTORY GYM

264
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,853
What are you doing in there?

265
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,116
Let's spar.

266
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,288
You said you'd teach me.

267
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,292
Next time.

268
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,962
You can get hurt if you're unprepared.
Step down.

269
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,594
Come on.

270
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:30,980
Hey.

271
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,777
Why do you keep avoiding me?

272
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,862
What?

273
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,574
Why do you keep avoiding me?

274
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,663
I have no choice but to avoid you.

275
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:49,999
It was me.

276
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,835
I started this whole thing alone, so--

277
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,546
That's it? That was your reason?

278
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,841
Still, how could you not tell me?

279
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,845
I waited for you.

280
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,889
You really…

281
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,393
You really deserve a beating.

282
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,062
Seriously.

283
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,732
Why go off on your own?

284
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,402
What can you do all by yourself?

285
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,863
Why risk yourself all alone?

286
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,284
Stop it.

287
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,662
You'll wear yourself out.

288
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,281
I said stop.

289
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,701
Once I start,

290
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,328
I won't hold back anymore.

291
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,076
INSUNG CITY GOLDENGATE CENTRAL CITY
CONSTRUCTION SITE

292
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,704
Please wait until things settle down.

293
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:34,914
I'm taking care of it.

294
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,170
Once the Candy is restocked,
I'll cover your losses to date.

295
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:44,423
Mr. Oh, handle the businesses
for the time being.

296
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,008
Excuse me?

297
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,719
-You want me to do it?
-What did you say?

298
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,889
Why is this dumb bastard in charge?

299
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,182
I said "for the time being."

300
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,980
If that's what you want,
I'll do it for the time being.

301
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,194
-Excuse me.
-Hey, where do you think you're going?

302
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,029
Hey!

303
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,574
Mr. Min.

304
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,742
We're being patient here.

305
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,663
Stop messing around with the cop
and focus on conducting business.

306
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,706
Of course.

307
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,292
Speaking of, I have a favor to ask of you.

308
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,219
I need someone to distribute this.

309
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,140
Are you saying
you want to sell that in Insung?

310
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,067
My guys will sell to anyone,
regardless of age.

311
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,696
But what if Drugmon finds out?

312
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,281
It's a breach of contract.

313
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,332
This business is solely between us.

314
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,376
Nobody else will know.

315
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,888
Take it easy and sit down.

316
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,271
Don't overdo it, or you'll pass out.

317
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,231
Chocolate?

318
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,737
I don't plan on staying in Korea for long.

319
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,572
When do you depart?

320
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,783
On Friday.

321
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,077
Want to come with me after this is over?

322
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,539
Will your mama like me?

323
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,957
Of course.

324
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,959
I chose you.

325
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,133
No chance.

326
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,762
Sorry, but I don't have time for you.

327
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:39,765
Because of the person you're looking for?

328
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:41,767
Yeah.

329
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,436
Who exactly are you looking for?

330
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:47,690
Someone whom I miss…

331
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,778
but also want to kill.

332
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,364
It's a relief that she's going to the US.

333
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:59,952
But the parents
seem to have a drug problem.

334
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,079
I mean, every family has problems.

335
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,458
But the real problem is that she might
refuse to leave her younger sister.

336
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,336
We just need to send her off.

337
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,420
What is it?

338
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,048
Go ahead and wait for me.

339
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,761
I promise to come and get you.

340
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:23,976
Okay, then.

341
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:29,065
Hold on to this hairpin for me
until I see you again, okay?

342
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:30,775
Promise me.

343
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,278
Okay, I promise.

344
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,197
I mean it.

345
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,080
She sent me to the US…

346
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,916
in her place.

347
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,691
Everything disappeared.

348
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,777
My life.

349
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,613
And even my name.

350
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,784
She's the only one who remembers who I am.

351
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,003
Hello?

352
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,255
Have you eaten yet?

353
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,677
If not, should we eat together?

354
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,819
Can I order this too?

355
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,447
An assorted platter, please.

356
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,868
Sure. Eat as much as you want.

357
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,581
Man, it's great having a friend
who can treat you to such expensive meals.

358
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,208
We should stay in touch more.

359
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,296
People come here for oyster and rice soup,
but the other dishes are good too.

360
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,132
I'm exploring good restaurants
to eat at these days.

361
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,384
This place is going on my list.

362
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,396
You seem to be in a different mood.

363
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,149
You think so?

364
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,904
You must be hungry
after stirring up trouble everywhere.

365
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,577
Darn it.

366
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,206
You got me.

367
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,680
How do you manage to work so diligently?

368
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,351
It's rather touching to see.

369
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,104
Everyone lives like me.

370
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,149
They do honest and diligent work,

371
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,735
putting in sweat and effort…

372
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,737
unlike you.

373
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,364
I work hard

374
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,449
and put in effort too.

375
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,410
But without breaking a sweat.

376
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,872
That's enough fun and games.

377
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,291
If you keep acting up,

378
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,544
you might die.

379
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:38,671
I mean it.

380
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,589
It doesn't matter.

381
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,634
The count has started.

382
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,596
I used to struggle
and live the way you do…

383
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,433
but it didn't change anything.

Yes, sir.

Who the hell are you?

390
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,574
That's enough.

00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,044
Aren't you the Hanguk University student

392
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,672
working part-time at customs?

393
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,758
I like the look in your eyes, kid.

00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,885
What are you studying for?

395
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:55,849
To be a Grade 5 civil servant.

396
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,434
What will you do once you've become one?

397
00:32:58,102 --> 00:32:59,228
Make money, of course.

398
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,522
Make money?

399
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,400
You want to study your ass off
for a mere 9-to-5 job?

400
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:07,194
You might be book-smart,

401
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,363
but you have no idea
how to make money, do you?

402
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,782
You saw all that, right?

403
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,621
That's how you make money.

404
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,633
That costs more
than what you make in a year.

405
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,262
Consider it a consolation
for working hard to cover tuition.

406
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,945

Are you sure it's my brother?

Yes.

423
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,742
His two front teeth were forcibly removed.

424
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,703
We compared them
to your brother's dental records,

425
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,081
and the DNA test results are a match.

426
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,583
This is from the NFS.

427
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,463
What did you do to my brother?

428
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,881
He's still alive.

429
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,262

Mr. Lee Sang-gon.

431
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:43,433
Just how much money
does Min Ju-yeong have?

432
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,104
-Several hundred billion won?
-Several hundred billion?

433
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,983
You guys really have no idea, do you?

434
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:54,111
Min Ju-yeong
is on a whole different scale.

435
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,113
He's beyond all your wildest imaginations.

436
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,532
Just how much are we talking about here?

437
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,286
You know what he said
when we first started working together?

438
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,596
How much would it be
if this space were filled?

439
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,264
Excuse me?

440
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,602
It only took me two years
to realize he wasn't joking.

441
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,146
I'm sure you guys are well aware

442
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,566
that common sense
doesn't apply to that bastard.

443
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,069
He doesn't count money.

444
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,863
He weighs it.

445
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,157
By the ton, at that.

446
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,640
The entire city of Insung is controlled
by that bastard's money.

447
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,434
His money is everywhere.

448
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,020
It spreads like blood,

449
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:14,399
flowing from the bottom
all the way to the top.

450
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,926
It's the reason why
you can't catch Min Ju-yeong,

451
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,096
no matter how hard you try.

00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,619

454
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,663
Everyone, please say hello.

455
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,499
-This is the police commissioner.
-Hello.

456
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,338
I see the departmental chief prosecutor
is here too.

457
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,341
-It's all thanks to you.
-That's enough.

458
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,093
Let's take a seat.

459
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,470
Min Ju-yeong

460
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,515
is Insung itself.

461
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,357
That's insane.
So how much money does he actually have?

462
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,651
That's not the issue.

463
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,737
The issue is how we're going to find it.

464
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,156
Golden Bunny said

465
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,159
there was a well-known smuggler
named Oh Dollar.

466
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,452
Oh Dollar.

467
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:55,333
And Oh Dollar had a Russian henchman.

468
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,878
One of the Russians
who worked for Oh Dollar

469
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,172
now works for Min Ju-yeong.

470
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,965
His name is Sergei.

471
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,219
He'll know
where Min Ju-yeong hid the money.

472
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,138
-Sergei?
-Sergei what?

473
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:09,389
That's all we got.

474
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,641
Golden Bunny only knew what he went by.

475
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,144
He didn't know Sergei's exact name or age.

476
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:18,065
The only thing he mentioned
was that he had a rather prominent nose.

477
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,444
If you call out the name Sergei in Moscow,
everyone will turn their heads,

478
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,696
and they'll all match that description.

479
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,365
Things would be easier
if he had a petite nose.

480
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:31,495
I have the list of references
from the Oh Dollar murder case.

481
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,413
I remember seeing
a man named Sergei on it.

482
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,375
Here. It's this person.

483
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,503
Sergei Kirillovich Vronsky.

484
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,549
Wait a minute. Why do you have this list?

485
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,760
Did you put it together?

486
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,806
I was organizing old case files
in the records room,

487
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,184
and I've been gathering similar cases
involving smuggling or the Russian mafia.

488
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,021
SERGEI KIRILLOVICH VRONSKY

489
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,065
Wait.

490
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,483
I've seen this guy before.

491
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,571
Seobu Station has jurisdiction
over that wholesale supermarket.

492
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,866
If Senior Inspector Kang
can get us the parking lot CCTV footage,

493
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,284
we can get the plate number.

494
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,375
Oh, I almost forgot.
Min Ju-yeong called me today.

495
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,128
-He asked to meet up.
-What did he say?

496
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,964
Not much. He probably feels cornered.

497
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,634
By the way,

498
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,095
is it just going to be us?

499
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,097
What about Senior Officer Shin?

500
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,599
Right. What about Jae-hong?

501
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:37,769
I'll reach out to him.

502
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,230
But it'll be just us for now.

503
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,440
-Just us?
-Us?

504
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,255
Hey, you in the jacket.

505
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,841
Bring me some water.

506
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,305
-Me?
-Yeah, you punk.

507
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,932
Don't just stand there.

508
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,309
Go get some water.

509
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,773
Didn't you hear me?

510
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,442
I said go get some water.

511
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,736
-Are you crazy?
-He says he wants some water.

512
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:31,239
-Excuse me?
-He wants water.

513
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,491
Yes, of course.

514
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,177
Captain.

515
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,261
Yeah?

516
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,432
What's going on with Jae-hong?

517
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,937
I heard he was cut from promotion review
because of the disciplinary action.

518
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,481
I called him,

519
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,776
but I couldn't bring myself
to ask him to join us.

520
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,112
Jae-hong works rotating shifts
and has applied for overtime.

521
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,739
And it seems he works part-time at night.

522
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,117
I don't know for sure
because he won't answer my questions,

523
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,870
but he's risking disciplinary action
for a secret side job,

524
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,789
so things must be tough at home.

525
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,708
He's got four kids. That can't be easy.

526
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,628
Sir, we're almost there.

527
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,046
Sir?

528
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,134
KI BANK
YOUR LOAN REPAYMENT IS DUE…

529
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,443
It's been a while.

530
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:51,695
Why are you here?

531
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,866
Everyone seems busy.

532
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,245
I should've stopped by.
Guess I'm the only one missing.

533
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,040
I heard about your situation.

534
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,503
-If you need my help--
-It's okay.

535
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,713
Don't worry about me.

536
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,509
About your promotion…

537
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,805
I know I'm partly to blame
for why it didn't happen.

538
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,308
Jeez, come on.

539
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,601
That was ages ago.

540
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,061
You did what you had to do.

541
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,439
I'm still sorry.

542
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,860
I should've apologized sooner.

543
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,945
I don't want your apology.

544
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,655
Sorry?

545
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:37,949
How should I put this?

546
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:43,038
I think I need someone to be angry at
to feel a little better.

547
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,915
Thanks for the concern.

548
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,085
Tell the others that I'm sorry. See you.

549
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,638
CITIZEN-FOCUSED INSUNG SEOBU POLICE

550
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,687
VEHICLE/CCTV SEARCH REPORT

551
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,606
The owner is the Russian guy
you mentioned,

552
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,566
and he's often spotted in Texas Town.

553
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,694
What are you up to this time?

554
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,004
Captain, 4889 is over there.

555
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,256
47G 4889

556
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,348
The engine's still hot. He just got here.

557
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,350
-It's an electric car.
-What?

558
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,855
Let's split up and look for him.

559
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,524
Sergeant Kim and I will stay down here.

560
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,484
You and Senior Officer Ji go upstairs.

561
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,781
I'll go with him.

562
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,575
I'll go upstairs.

563
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,452
Let's go.

564
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,797
Don't overdo it. Let me go in first.

565
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,133
Why? Are you going to protect me?

566
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,552
You can't wind up in the hospital again.

567
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,139
Don't treat me like I'm injured.
It's not that bad.

568
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,394
Hey, owner of 4889.

569
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:35,984
Hey!

570
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,030
You little bastard.

571
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,711
Hey, stop!

572
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,713
I said stop, you bastard!

573
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,381
-Hey!
-Isn't that Yoon Dong-ju?

574
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,636
Isn't that Jong-hyeon?

575
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:13,730
Kim Jong-hyeon!

576
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,822
He's the best.

577
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:28,369
Don't overdo it. You'll hurt yourself.

578
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,666
Get out, Sergei.

579
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,544
You're Sergei, right?

580
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,007
Do you know who Oh Dollar is?

581
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,260
What's going on? Who are you?

582
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,599
What did he just say?
Don't you know how to speak Korean?

583
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,977
Are you cops?

584
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:53,895
You fool.

585
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:57,440
-Hey, fool.
-Fool?

586
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:02,737
Han-na, do you speak Russian?

587
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:04,781
A little bit.

588
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:10,703
Who the hell are you?

589
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,248
What?

590
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,791
What the hell?

591
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,503
Idiot.

592
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,046
Fuck off.

593
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,006
You little brat. How old are you?

594
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:26,678
Watch your language, lady.
Where did you learn Russian anyway?

595
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,762
Hold on.

596
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,848
Senior Officer Ji,
did you just curse at him in Russian?

597
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,143
Oh, they were curse words?

598
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:42,735
You know, at times you seem totally fine,
but then you get really weird.

599
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,487
Do you understand Russian?

600
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:48,366
Yeah, I went up against a lot of Russians
in international competitions.

601
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,243
I picked up some then. Let me see.

602
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:54,080
We have a question.

603
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,290
How should I phrase this?

604
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,209
Oh Bong-chan. Oh Dollar. You know him?

605
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,295
What are you saying?
Your pronunciation is crap.

606
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,046
I can't understand anything.

607
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,923
Oh? How should I know?

608
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,926
He's speaking too quickly.

609
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,970
Too fast.

610
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,347
Slowly, please.

611
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,100
This one stutters,

612
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,977
this one curses,

613
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,021
and this one is wearing weird glasses.

614
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,024
You're all crazy.

615
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:23,151
This won't do. His accent is too strong.

616
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,445
Let's get a Russian interpreter.

617
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,071
There are different accents in Russian?

618
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,073
Of course, it's a huge country.

619
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:31,409
Let's take him in for now.

620
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,328
I'll find an interpreter right away.

621
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,542
Looks like we won't need an interpreter.

622
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:40,501
Oh, my.

623
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,338
-This is a nice phone.
-Give it back to me!

624
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,466
Fuck, it got scratched.

625
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:47,925
I'm still paying it off.

626
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,555
Your Korean is really good.

627
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,355
You even exchange text messages in Korean.

628
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,358
I knew it, you lying Pinocchio.

629
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,776
Hey, you owe me a new phone!

630
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:10,281
-I said stop laughing.
-Oh, jeez.

631
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,033
Hey, so you're Sergei.

632
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:23,586
You act like the fridge is yours.
I'm keeping count, you know.

633
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,300
This is so refreshing!

634
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,428
I'm going to enjoy this slowly.

635
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:36,057
I said I don't know anything.
You've been asking me for hours.

636
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:38,434
If you keep lying,

637
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,688
your nose will only get bigger.

638
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:45,108
Hey, aren't you cops?
Are cops allowed to do this?

639
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,318
I'm starving, but you won't even feed me.

640
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:49,320
I'm a Russian citizen.

641
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:51,614
This could become a diplomatic issue.

642
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:52,573
His Korean is excellent.

643
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:56,160
-Exactly. Hurry it up so we can eat.
-I told you we couldn't reason with him.

644
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,453
I ought to just…

645
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:00,623
Why don't we let him go?

646
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,043
What? What are you talking about?

647
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,046
At least someone here speaks some sense.

648
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,007
Speaks some sense, my ass.
Why release him after all that trouble?

649
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,678
I'm going now, okay?

650
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,304
You're not going anywhere.

651
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:16,472
He said I could go.

652
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,682
Go ahead.

653
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:19,767
Captain.

654
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:22,979
But there's something you should know.

655
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,940
You won't last a day
if you walk out that door.

656
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:31,070
You'll also end up like this.

657
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,238
THREE BODIES FOUND ON THE VICTORY

658
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,117
You could bleed out
after your teeth are ripped out,

659
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,618
die from a bullet to the head,

660
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:41,414
or die from organ failure
after a savage beating.

661
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,749
So many died already.

662
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,169
But I didn't say anything.

663
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,796
Who'd believe you?

664
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,091
Who gets released without consequences
after getting arrested?

665
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:54,469
Right. Nobody would believe it.

666
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,138
Min Ju-yeong

667
00:50:57,764 --> 00:51:00,224
especially would never buy it.

668
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,646
Do you want to die in a gutter
or have some ox bone soup here?

669
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,190
It's your choice.

670
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:10,109
We're the only people
who can keep you alive.

671
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,949
Didn't you say you're a certified player
or something? Hurry up.

672
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:20,119
A real pro doesn't rush things.

673
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,662
The sun will be up at this rate.

674
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,376
Are you sure this is it?

675
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,045
This is all I know.

676
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,838
I swear.

677
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:33,508
So 21 locations in total.

678
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,801
-Did I get it right?
-Yeah.

679
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:36,636
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

680
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,304
-You're positive?
-I'm positive.

681
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,015
Okay. Go ahead and eat.

682
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,518
These are the locations Sergei provided

683
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,812
and Oh Bong-chan's land
registered under others' names.

684
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,689
There are 53 locations in total.

685
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:52,109
So the container filled with cash
could be in any one of these places.

686
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,238
We must find it before he catches on.

687
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,156
It's a race against time now.

688
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:01,786
We're bound to attract his attention
if we snoop around too blatantly.

689
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,664
Let's carry on as usual
so he doesn't catch on,

690
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,083
as if nothing's going on.

691
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,230
I lost my appetite
after being on my feet all day long.

692
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:32,608
It tastes good to me.

693
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,323
Hey, this place is great.

694
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,076
-Right? Have some meat too.
-Eat up.

695
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,455
Eat up while you can.

696
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,165
We won't be able to for a while.

697
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,294
It's time to act on
what we discussed yesterday.

698
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:56,799
Cheers!

699
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:07,643
-Let's check it out.
-Okay.

700
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,150
250-9, DEOKCHANG-DONG, GANGI-GU, INSUNG

701
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,443
There's nothing to see here.

702
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,573
1183, MOUNTAIN, CHANGJIN 2-DONG,
GANGMYEON-GU, INSUNG

703
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,160
One, two…

704
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:27,455
I know it's there. I saw it in my dream.

705
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,290
155, MOUNTAIN,
BANSANG-DONG, GIWON-GU, INSUNG

706
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,384
253-5, SAMRIN-DONG, JEONG-GU, INSUNG

707
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:43,304
OH BONG-CHAN'S PROXY LAND LIST

708
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,025
Sir?

709
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,999
At first, I thought you were really cold.

710
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,793
But I was surprised

711
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,295
by your gracious response
to such a misunderstanding.

712
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,301
That's when I realized
you're nothing like I originally thought.

713
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,262
Where could you be?

714
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,015
Did something urgent come up?

715
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,352
No. Please eat.

716
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,401
1632, YANGSAN-DONG, HADO-GU, INSUNG

717
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,237
Take a picture for me.

718
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,156
Step down.

719
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,718
Hippety-hop,
on my way to find the treasure.

720
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,139
It's not there, is it?

721
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,890
It's not.

722
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:20,735
Let's go.

723
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:21,944
Let's take one together.

724
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,076
You have to smile in photos.

725
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,245
Smile. One, two, three.

726
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,043
LOAN ASSISTANCE FOR ATHLETES

727
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,088
Here.

728
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:45,342
May I ask when I might receive a response?

729
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,970
With so many applicants,
the document review might take a while.

730
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,972
I'll get in touch once it's finished.

731
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,564
PRIDE OF KOREAN ATHLETES
NATIONAL ATHLETE AVENGERS

732
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,982
INSUNG POLICE AGENCY FORMS
SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM

733
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,754
What does this lunatic want?

734
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,716
Did you look into it?

735
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,015
Who took Silver Bunny's autopsy report?

736
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:58,999
Where could you be?

737
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,002
Do something bad, and I'll eat you up.

738
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:03,879
Hippety-hop,
on my way to find the treasure.

739
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:06,590
Where could you be? Maybe here? Click!

740
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,259
Webs, incoming!

741
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,970
In the name of justice,
your wrongs won't go unpunished!

742
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,222
Hey, I see you.

743
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,558
Eat eggs. They're good for you.

744
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,810
Target found. Bang!

745
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:20,354
Last one.

746
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,514
KO.

747
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,726
You might die.

748
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,020
It doesn't matter.

749
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,814
The count has started.

750
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,666
The mystery of hidden cash in containers
continues to unfold.

751
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:49,253
Yesterday, more cash was discovered
in yet another container.

752
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,964
Who could be hiding
such large amounts of money?

753
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,884
Insung will get messy,
like the sweet and sour pork I'm chewing.

754
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,011
It's going to blow up.

755
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,721
This is nuclear bomb-level news.

756
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,557
The Korean National Police Agency
and the SPO are also monitoring it.

757
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,100
-The case got hot.
-Of course!

758
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,644
It's so hot that even the mayor,
prosecution, or the commissioner

759
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:06,937
can't cover things up.

760
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,815
It's so hot that they can't touch it!

761
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,608
We have to make it hotter.

762
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:13,610
It has to get boiling hot.

763
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,448
-It's so hot!
-Super hot!

764
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,117
Is it good?

765
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:23,787
Look who knows how to smile.

766
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,499
How sloppy. Are you a kid?

767
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,336
Smile big and show your teeth.

768
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,677
Gosh, this jjajangmyeon is hot and spicy!

769
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:40,888
It really is.

770
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,639
Captain, wipe your mouth.

771
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,309
-Wipe it for me.
-Here.

772
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:27,935
This is totally crazy.
It'll take all day to count the money.

773
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,354
Don't mess with her.

774
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,688
Remember what I said.

775
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,982
-Take a seat.
-Hey.

776
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:36,360
I'll turn up the noise for him.

777
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,612
Why all this fuss over a dead kid?

778
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,572
Where the hell are you going?

779
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:44,243
This has a strange power.

780
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:46,745
Is there something
you want me to do in return?

781
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:47,830
Thanks.

782
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:51,542
I've always been thoughtful.

783
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:55,587
I'm sorry for underestimating you.

784
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,173
Let me apologize.

785
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,427
I'll push you

786
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,388
further into a corner.

787
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:05,848
Okay.

788
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,349
I'll look forward to it.

789
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,268
Senior Officer Shin.

790
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,856
Shin Jae-hong!
