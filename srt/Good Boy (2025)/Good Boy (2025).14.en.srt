1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,056
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

3
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,199
Take this.

4
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,909
It belonged to your father.

5
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,840
The man who killed your father
gave you that gun.

6
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,469
Min Ju-yeong!

7
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,012
You son of a bitch!

8
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,017
Why did you do it?

9
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,103
Why the hell did you do it?

10
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,444
Tell me.

11
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,071
Tell me!

12
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,042
You brought it onto yourself.

13
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,336
This is on you.

14
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,511
They obviously got into an altercation
with each other and died.

15
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,513
What else is there to investigate?

16
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,557
Let's wrap things up here and go.

17
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,145
I know who killed your father.

18
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:34,525
Do you want my help?

19
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,238
Who was it?

20
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,201
Oh Dollar.

21
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,883
I'll help you get revenge for your father.

22
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,804
There was a cop who covered
for your father's murderer, Oh Dollar.

23
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,724
If you want revenge,

24
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,935
you need to take him out first.

25
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,844
This doesn't look right for you.

26
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,207
No matter how battered and broken he is…

27
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,919
a king never dies…

28
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,880
until he's crushed

29
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,591
his opponent.

30
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,302
You bastard!

31
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,608
You son of a bitch!

32
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,944
Did you come to save the girl?

33
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,038
You bastard!

34
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,091
I have to hand it to you.

35
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,802
You lose every time,
but you still come back.

36
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,345
I'm not here for you.

37
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,688
You son of a bitch.

38
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,297
He's over here!

39
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,715
Come here!

40
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,605
You bastard!

41
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,809
You asshole!

42
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,375
Are you calm now, sir?

43
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,556
Apologize! You're scared, aren't you?

44
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,683
I told you not to come near me!

45
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,310
Rude little punks.

46
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,811
Hey!

47
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,954
I won.

48
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,998
Dung-ju, I won!

49
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,791
I…

50
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,794
I'm so sick of this.

51
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,130
Just stop already!

52
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,638
Final move!

53
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,512
It's so damn loud.

54
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,103
MAYOR

55
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,649
Riot police here. How should we proceed?

56
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,155
The reporters followed us here,
so standing by isn't exactly an option.

57
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:40,575
Understood, sir.

58
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,331
What are you doing?
Stop them from going in!

59
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,874
Hurry up and block them!

60
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,223
Wake up.

61
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,599
Wake up!

62
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,268
Please wake up!

63
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,816
Will you tell me now?

64
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,278
Your real name.

65
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:18,822
Mi-hyang.

66
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,782
Yoon Mi-hyang.

67
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,161
How old-fashioned.

68
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,086
I'll remember it.

69
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,673
Goodbye…

70
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,759
my love.

71
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,846
I thought you were a fencer.

72
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,974
How can you be so afraid of blades?

73
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,740
Hey.

74
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,243
Did you come alone?

75
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,078
I don't see the little mutt.

76
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,205
Did he drop dead already?

77
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,583
He's not one to die that easily.

78
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,668
That's good to hear.

79
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,504
Because I'm going to
slit the little mutt's throat myself.

80
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,299
Don't underestimate him.

81
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,052
I hate to admit this,

82
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,598
but he'll exceed your expectations
in every way possible.

83
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,309
I underestimated him,

84
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,645
and it cost me everything.

85
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,611
I don't like Yoon Dong-ju.

86
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,282
But do you know what I hate more?

87
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,992
What?

88
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,035
I hate losing to anyone.

89
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,748
I fought tooth and nail to win.

90
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,125
What are you mumbling about?

91
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,169
If I don't step up now,
I'll look like a loser.

92
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,797
Have you lost your mind?

93
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,716
So I'm not going to run anymore.

94
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,307
Let's see this through.

95
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,142
You want to go again?

96
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,370
Hey! Let's stop.

97
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,539
Aren't you a cop?

98
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,834
Cops shouldn't hit people, should they?

99
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,210
Am I wrong?

100
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,380
You came to save the girl,
so why are you taking it out on me?

101
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,132
You persistent little bastard!

102
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,331
-Shit.
-Damn it.

103
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,857
Han-na!

104
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,113
Hey.

105
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,284
You got quite the makeover
since I last saw you.

106
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,411
You're not dead yet.

107
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,538
Of course, I'm not!

108
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,499
I won't die.

109
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,169
Not until I throw your ass in jail.

110
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,767
You…

111
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,893
You bitch!

112
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:09,894
Die.

113
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,233
Are you insane?

114
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,943
Farewell, you crazy bastard.

115
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,129
Oh, shit.

116
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
Han-na.

117
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:03,990
Are you okay?

118
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,324
Han-na.

119
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,409
Ji Han-na!

120
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,911
Han-na, get it together. Ji Han-na!

121
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:09,954
Ji Han-na!

122
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,083
Be quiet. My ears hurt.

123
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,714
Are you really okay?

124
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,637
You shouldn't have come
to this dangerous place all alone.

125
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:56,709
Yoon Dong-ju.

126
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:57,919
Are you feeling okay?

127
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,591
Are you okay?

128
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:04,634
You're bleeding.

129
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,431
What about Min Ju-yeong?
Have you seen him?

130
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,241
She's still alive.

131
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,076
We should call an ambulance.

132
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,159
Keep still.

133
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,853
National team athletes
and cops are the same.

134
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,230
We can't go a day without getting hurt.

135
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,320
The riot police and firefighters
searched the whole building,

136
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,822
but they didn't find Min Ju-yeong.

137
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:52,825
I checked the transport vehicles
and didn't find him there either.

138
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,076
I think he slipped out already.

139
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,330
I'm sure there are
lots of informants here in his pocket.

140
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,956
I bet they're busy covering for him.

141
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,209
That's why we need to find him.

142
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,294
"We"?

143
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,464
You're a fugitive. Don't you dare.

144
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,506
Just keep still!

145
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,175
Hold on.

146
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,261
How can we get this punk out of here?

147
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,555
Informant?

148
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:16,682
What is it?

149
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,605
Someone told Min Ju-yeong
that I came here.

150
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,524
His phone.

151
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,696
If we pull up his last call history,
we'll find the informant.

152
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:37,912
SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY
ON THIS CONSTRUCTION SITE

153
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:42,875
There was so much trash
inside the building.

154
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,507
Okay, jeez.

155
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,348
Gosh, I'm so dizzy.

156
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,225
-I feel so lightheaded.
-Captain!

157
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,731
Did you find it?

158
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,902
Please get up if you found it.

159
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,447
Here, get up.

160
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,325
Jeez, this is brutal.

161
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,579
Do you think
the data would be recoverable?

162
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,248
Probably, as long as the SIM card is okay.

163
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,041
I'll send it to the forensics chief.

164
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,251
What are they talking about?

165
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,380
Captain.

166
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,105
What's going on?

167
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,529
Commissioner.

168
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:58,159
What happened to your jaw, sir?

169
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,327
Yoon…

170
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,458
Where's Yoon Do-ju?

171
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,960
What did you say, sir?

172
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,087
Yoon Dong-ju, you bastard!

173
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,423
Oh, Yoon Dong-ju.

174
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,093
-I'm not sure.
-"I'm not sure"?

175
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:17,178
Damn it.

176
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,763
You know damn well but won't say it!

177
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,061
You bastards.

178
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,313
-I should've broken his jaw clean.
-All of you.

179
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,690
Say goodbye to your police careers.

180
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:33,069
Especially you, you little punk!

181
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,447
Don't you dare take a step

182
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,948
and stand at attention!

183
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,004
A new drug was being produced,

184
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,840
-causing widespread shock.
-Damn it, we're screwed.

185
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,967
-The operation was carried out
-What the hell is going on?

186
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,553
-under the command of the commissioner
-Goddammit.

187
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,222
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency.

188
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,642
Hey.

189
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,486
What's going on? Have you seen the news?

190
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:20,157
Tell me what's going on.
The news is blowing up.

191
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,826
Where's Mr. Min?

192
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,495
And what's wrong with your face?
Did you get beaten up again?

193
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,538
Shut the hell up!

194
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,374
Your trucks came too damn late.

195
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,167
Do you know how much drug
we had to give up?

196
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,007
Damn it.

197
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,434
Boss.

198
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,644
What happened? Did you look into it?

199
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,271
I can't get in touch with anyone,

200
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,897
and nobody has seen Mr. Min.

201
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,528
What kind of ridiculous situation is this?

202
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,615
What should we do about those goods?

203
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,456
Even if we slash the price,
it's still worth a fortune.

204
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,294
If we add the goods we've already moved…

205
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,965
We can't reach Mr. Min.

206
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,635
That Black Cat bastard died,
so we have no buyer.

207
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,512
And the bitch
who made the drugs croaked too.

208
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,140
So now there's only one person left…

209
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,727
who knows that the goods are here.

210
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,151
Hey, what about the goods?

211
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,070
Okay, got it.

212
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,406
One more thing.
How many guys can you round up right now?

213
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,744
Gather every last one you can find.

214
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,246
I'll call you back.

215
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,681
You want to go out?

216
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,147
What was that?

217
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,692
You've got to be kidding me.

218
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,824
Don't mess with me, punk.

219
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:28,577
I'm a heavyweight champion.

220
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:29,745
Got it?

221
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,767
-I love fingerprint door locks.
-The door is open.

222
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,061
Jeong-a.

223
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,145
Dad!

224
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,649
Were you worried about me
after watching the news?

225
00:30:58,732 --> 00:30:59,817
What are you talking about?

226
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,777
I bought braised chicken!

227
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,529
Braised chicken?

228
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,240
Nice. This is great.

229
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,908
Of course, it's great for you.

230
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:10,953
All you did today
was stay home and lounge around.

231
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,121
Hey, come in already.

232
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,290
We've been through a lot today,
so we've earned a snack.

233
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,292
Hi, Jeong-a.

234
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,335
You met them before. Say hello.

235
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,379
These are my colleagues.

236
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,797
And this is my daughter, Go Jeong-a.

237
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,800
Excuse me.

238
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,555
Hi.

239
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,934
Take the braised chicken with you!

240
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,102
Cheers.

241
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,104
-Good work today.
-Good work.

242
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,406
Have it with some mukeunji, aged kimchi.
It's amazing.

243
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,034
I had it with Jeong-a before,
and I've been craving it ever since.

244
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,870
Wrap it in some mukeunji.

245
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,250
It's so good.

246
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,128
-It really is good.
-Is it?

247
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,006
I like the rosé one better.
It's more mild and tasty.

248
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,012
Is it good?

249
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,017
Senior Officer Ji, I'm disappointed.

250
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,645
If something like that
had happened to your father,

251
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,314
you should've given us a heads-up.

252
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,858
Instead, you struggled all by yourself.

253
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,527
I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed.

254
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,904
I'm sorry.

255
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,490
It's been difficult for her already.
Leave her alone.

256
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,325
We need to beat up that bastard instead.

257
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,202
-Stop beating up people.
-Eat up.

258
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,247
Stay right here at home
until you're off the wanted list.

259
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,666
Don't you dare try anything.

260
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,502
What's the plan now?

261
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,170
We have to catch him.

262
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,755
Of course.

263
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,091
The special joint task force
is in charge of the case,

264
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,051
so we probably can't step in.

265
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,511
And we likely won't get any support.

266
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,514
Then it'll be us, the RIU,

267
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,475
and Seobu Station's Senior Inspector Kang.

268
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,104
Probably not Senior Inspector Kang.

269
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,065
He received disciplinary action,
so his hands are tied.

270
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:09,988
Then it's just us and the RIU.

271
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,073
That's not bad.

272
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:14,743
Stop eating!
I'm saying something important!

273
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,998
There you go again.

274
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,085
I told you not to do that.
Where did you pick up that weird habit?

275
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:26,046
-Isn't that Lamaze breathing?
-Llama?

276
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,048
It's a breathing method

277
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,467
that helps calm the body and mind.

278
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:33,303
My wife practiced it a lot
when she was pregnant.

279
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:50,696
Don't tell me you…

280
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,580
Hey, Jeong-a!

281
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,415
Go Jeong-a, open the door!

282
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,792
Let's talk. Open the door.

283
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,462
Is this why you fought with your mom
and came to Korea?

284
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:08,422
Open the door, Go Jeong-a!

285
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,924
The captain will be okay, right?

286
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,469
I shouldn't have brought up
Lamaze breathing.

287
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,553
Don't worry about it.

288
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,350
By the way,
shouldn't all of you go to the hospital?

289
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:22,978
I'm okay.

290
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,815
We're okay too.

291
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,400
Then let's go home.

292
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,944
I really can't wait to go home today.

293
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,404
Sounds good.

294
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,156
I'll drop you off on my way home.

295
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,282
That sounds great.

296
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,825
What about you two?

297
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,120
Get home safely. We'll get going first.

298
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:43,457
Hold on.

299
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,417
-Group hug.
-Let's just go.

300
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,877
Oh, okay.

301
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,961
See you.

302
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,826
Honey, I'm home.

303
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,203
You must've been worried.

304
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:34,675
Did I ever tell you?

305
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,930
I've been so ashamed of that bronze medal.

306
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,433
It felt like proof
that I hadn't done my best

307
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,103
both at the game and in my life.

308
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,439
That's why I could never
confidently show it to our kids.

309
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,445
Hey.

310
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:59,074
The kids and I have never once
been ashamed of you.

311
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,910
Do you know how happy the kids were
to see you on the news?

312
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,038
Whatever decision you make,

313
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,583
the kids and I will always support you.

314
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,921
Why are you crying?

315
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,590
Does it not hurt?

316
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,508
Hold on.

317
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,679
This should do.

318
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,142
-Yoon Dong-ju.
-Yeah?

319
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,437
You were unconscious for two days.

320
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,610
You must've been worried.

321
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,864
Let's go to the hospital.
I'll find one for you.

322
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,616
I'm totally fine.

323
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,076
I actually feel rejuvenated
after the good long sleep.

324
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:48,540
I want you

325
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,919
to take better care of yourself.

326
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,674
Don't hold it in when it really hurts.

327
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,181
Okay, okay.

328
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,393
But for now, you come first.

329
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,900
Don't overdo it. It's not that serious.

330
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,861
No. You'll end up with a scar
if you don't take care of it.

331
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,529
Leave it to me.

332
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,907
I'm an expert when it comes to this.

333
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,662
Actually, you should go
to the hospital tomorrow.

334
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,164
Okay.

335
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:31,500
Here.

336
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:40,592
All done.

337
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,762
How are you so good at this?

338
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,393
I don't know

339
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,979
if I told you this.

340
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,693
But I got hit a lot as a kid.

341
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,738
Whenever my dad got drunk,

342
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:04,741
he would hit me and my mom.

343
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,829
First aid was the only thing
I could do for her afterward.

344
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,249
I'd apply ointment to her wounds…

345
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:17,838
and blow on them.

346
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,132
That's why I'm used to it.

347
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,726
What is this for?

348
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,021
Nothing special. I'm just proud of you.

349
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,733
Then give me a prize.

350
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,319
Go change your clothes.

351
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,864
What for? It's not staying on long anyway.

352
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,116
What?

353
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,244
My gosh. Hey.

354
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,332
-Han-na! It's me!
-Hey, move.

355
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,666
Are you home?

356
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,627
What was the passcode again?

357
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,839
Why won't this open?
What am I going to do?

358
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,008
-No, not here.
-Then where?

359
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,635
Go to the bathroom.

360
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,429
Calm down and focus, Gyeong-suk.
You can do this.

361
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,973
I'm a mother! Han-na!

362
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,559
My goodness, Han-na!

363
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,769
My precious girl.

364
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,980
Why won't this open?

365
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:03,193
My goodness. Did you change the passcode?

366
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,279
Are you okay? Let me take a look at you.

367
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,867
Thank the heavens you're okay.

368
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,786
-I'm fine.
-Let me look at you.

369
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,872
What happened to your face?

370
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,207
It's just a scratch.

371
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:18,834
Why did you come?

372
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,462
The news got my heart racing.
How could I not rush over here?

373
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,381
And why didn't you answer your phone?

374
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,925
You scared me half to death!

375
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,928
Did you get hurt anywhere else?

376
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,638
-No, not at all.
-What happened here?

377
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,474
I'm fine, so calm down.

378
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,726
How can you be fine?

379
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,562
My poor baby.

380
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,814
Goodness.

381
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,859
Why is your face so hot?

382
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,486
What are you talking about?
It feels the same as usual.

383
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,489
Hold on. Oh, my goodness.

384
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:55,287
What is it? Where does it hurt?

385
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,914
It's just a headache.
Yeah, actually, I'm aching all over.

386
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,875
Where? Where does it hurt?

387
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,084
-Oh, dear.
-My room.

388
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:04,671
-Help me to my room.
-Okay, hold on tight and lean on me.

389
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:09,551
What's your father doing in heaven?
Why isn't he protecting you?

390
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,346
My word, this is just unbelievable!

391
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,814
Darn it.

392
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,326
-Are you coming from her place?
-Hello.

393
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,453
Where are you going?

394
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,372
DUNG-JU

395
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,900
FRONT DOOR

396
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,568
CALL

397
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,279
Sergeant Kim Jong-hyeon.

398
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,907
Sergeant Kim.

399
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,950
I mean, Jong-hyeon.

400
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,953
Jong-hyeon, can you please open the door?

401
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,164
Jong-hyeon.

402
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,960
The door is open.

403
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,462
Were you at a sauna?

404
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,257
Don't smile like that.

405
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,847
Thank you for having me.

406
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:40,558
The door is locked.

407
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,857
SÃO PAULO 2018
KIM JONG-HYEON WINS SILVER

408
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,318
Are you moving?

409
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,404
Want some help?

410
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,204
Mind your own business,
and stop acting like we're friends.

411
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,776
Just out of curiosity,

412
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,030
when did you start hating me?

413
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,614
From the beginning.

414
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,284
Why?

415
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,829
Your smile bothered me.

416
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:45,749
Yoon Dong-ju?

417
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,334
Yeah. Do you know him?

418
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,669
The crazy boxer kid
who made the national team.

419
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:53,048
He's bought the superstition
that 100 laps here will get you the gold.

420
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,926
He's been at it every day
for a full week now.

421
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,262
Everyone collapses at 94 laps.

422
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,431
But I think he'll make it today.

423
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:03,308
He's already at 99 laps.

424
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,934
VICTORY GYM

425
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,773
Look at him sweating. Go, Yoon Dong-ju!

426
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,776
-You're almost there!
-You got this!

427
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:14,778
Looking good, Yoon Dong-ju!

428
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,213
SOAR TOWARD VICTORY

429
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,590
-See you.
-Okay.

430
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:39,803
Jeez, he's amazing.
He sure does know how to run.

431
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,947
I didn't like your smile,
and I still don't.

432
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,910
I don't like you either.

433
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,871
Go to sleep.

434
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,636
Good night.

435
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,723
Still no sign of Min Ju-yeong?

436
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:07,682
None.

437
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,725
The roadside CCTVs

438
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,770
caught the Russian mafia
and the Korean Chinese guys escaping,

439
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:15,356
but not Min Ju-yeong.

440
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:19,611
This is the only road
that leads to Goldengate Central.

441
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,740
Seeing how he's left no trail whatsoever,

442
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,034
someone inside the agency
must've helped him.

443
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:29,704
We need to find that informant.
What a headache.

444
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,625
Anyway, we seized a truck yesterday.

445
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,418
It belongs to Mr. Oh Jong-gu
of J9 Security.

446
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,588
The rest of the trucks
were caught on CCTVs,

447
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,507
but we can't make out the plates.

448
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,175
I think they were used to move Candy.

449
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,303
Thank you. Please send us these photos.

450
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,680
-We'll take on Oh Jong-gu.
-All right.

451
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,520
By the way, what's wrong with him?

452
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,278
Were you up all night
because of what happened?

453
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:05,657
You mean Jeong-a?

454
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:08,535
She says she's not pregnant.

455
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:14,040
What a relief. I was really worried.

456
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,709
It's my wife who's pregnant.

457
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,586
Oh, your wife is… What?

458
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,714
Congratulations!

459
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:25,343
I didn't know you still had it in you.

460
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:26,844
What's your secret?

461
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,767
I had a vasectomy.

462
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,186
It's permanent.

463
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:40,441
But that means your wife had an affair…

464
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,073
The wind's not the only thing stirring.

465
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,535
My marriage!

466
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,536
Let's get going.

467
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,162
Sergeant Kim, I'll go with you.

468
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,331
Why won't this open? Sergeant Kim!

469
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:57,166
Sergeant Kim, I don't want to be here!

470
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,669
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

471
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,462
You came right on time.

472
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:09,053
Thank you for lending me your car.

473
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,513
That's it?

474
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:14,309
No. Thank you for everything you did.

475
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,020
Why do I have to help you?

476
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,688
Ask someone else.

477
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,106
There's no one else I can ask.

478
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:23,151
You're the only one at the agency
who talks to me.

479
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,819
So what?

480
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,904
Why do I have to do this favor for you?

481
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,531
Because you like me.

482
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:31,159
Me? You must be mistaken.

483
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,328
Even so, I'm still asking you.

484
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,039
You're the only one I can trust.

485
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,626
And I'm sorry I've put you in trouble.

486
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,169
It's okay.

487
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,964
I'll just spend the next three months
lounging around at home.

488
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,722
Leaving like this felt unfair,
so I snuck this out.

489
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,936
It's the list of people who attended
the special joint task launch ceremony.

490
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,522
I thought it might help the investigation.

491
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:03,983
Why are you being so nice to me?

492
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:08,905
You said that I liked you, remember?

493
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,743
And you're right. I do like you.

494
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,912
I was also jealous.

495
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:21,000
Back in the day,
I wanted to go out in the field like you.

496
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,796
So I'm living vicariously through you.

497
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,089
Jeez.

498
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:29,967
It's like I'm fangirling

499
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,928
over a protagonist in a drama
or something!

500
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:40,520
J9 SECURITY

501
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,938
Damn it.

502
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,481
He cleared out and took off already.

503
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:53,866
Is he here?

504
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:55,952
He hasn't used the office in a while.

505
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:57,620
The power's shut off too.

506
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,622
These damn bastards.

507
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,381
These aren't the trucks.
The plate numbers are different.

508
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:09,882
The truck beds look different too.

509
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,510
Captain, I talked to the district office,

510
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,137
and they said there's a junkyard

511
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,305
authorized to handle scrapping
and replacing freight trucks.

512
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:20,143
I think Oh's fleet was using plates
illegally deregistered from there.

513
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,104
Let's head there then.

514
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,694
You want it, huh? You want it?

515
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,779
Mr. Lee Yong-ju.

516
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:33,698
-What the hell?
-Oh, my!

517
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,034
Wait.

518
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,537
He took the train.

519
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,581
She's Oh Jong-gu's bookkeeper.

520
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,626
Who are they? Your dad and older brother?

521
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,298
They're cops.

522
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,718
Damn it.

523
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,470
Oh, jeez.

524
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,647
Where do you think you're going?

525
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:19,994
Put the knife down.

526
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,420
You sold freight truck plates
to Mr. Oh Jong-gu, right?

527
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,047
We need the plate numbers.

528
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,757
How can I possibly remember that?

529
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,841
I have many clients.

530
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:37,637
I've probably put on
hundreds of truck plates by now.

531
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,181
Just arrest me.

532
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,682
I'll pay a fine and be done with it.

533
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,643
Why bother coming here over nothing?

534
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,353
I said arrest me!

535
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,270
Arrest--

536
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,398
Hang on.

537
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,526
You have a daughter.

538
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,071
-Yes.
-You're married?

539
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:56,697
Yes.

540
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,075
You're a married man

541
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,660
and had an…

542
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,622
-An affair here?
-He's going to lose it.

543
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:07,458
Excuse me. I have that information.

544
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:14,423
This is the management log
of the truck fleet Mr. Oh manages himself.

545
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,927
There are 15 illegal vehicles in total.

546
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,889
Seven vehicles were used

547
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,558
to move the Candy.

548
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,477
Where the hell is Oh Jong-gu?

549
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,771
Min Ju-yeong won't give up the Candy.

550
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,314
If we follow it,

551
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,942
we can catch both Oh Jong-gu
and Min Ju-yeong.

552
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:36,529
Let's look at the CCTV footage
and check out each truck.

553
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:40,116
Right, let's put in the legwork
and find him.

554
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,535
-I'll take photos of this.
-Okay.

555
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,079
All right.

556
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,998
Let's split into two teams
and get moving.

557
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,916
You be on standby here.

558
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:50,710
Why?

559
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:53,296
Do you really have to ask?
You're still wanted.

560
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,090
It'll be a headache if anyone notices you.

561
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,344
I mean, with my looks,

562
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,306
I get noticed even if I sit still.

563
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:05,641
I'll be discreet.

564
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,268
Discreet, my ass.

565
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,520
You stay here
and keep me posted on the situation.

566
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:11,272
-I don't want to--
-I'll go with Dong-ju.

567
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,901
-It's more dangerous to leave him alone.
-You think so?

568
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,320
I guess you're right.

569
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,155
Okay, then take him with you.

570
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,408
Might as well have you with him
if he gets into trouble.

571
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:24,118
Get into trouble? I'm not a kid.

572
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,369
You're worse than a kid!

573
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,204
You damn wanted fugitive.

574
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,040
Quit complaining
and go before I change my mind.

575
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:30,499
Get going, you punk.

576
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,171
Hang on.

577
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,757
I just noticed that you're not
wearing glasses, Sergeant Kim.

578
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,259
You look more handsome without them.

579
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:43,095
-You'll be as handsome as me soon.
-He's right. You look good.

580
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,432
As if. He looks the same.
Hurry up already.

581
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,600
You're both handsome!

582
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:49,518
Why are you coming after me?

583
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,611
I got my license plate from there too.

584
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,404
I've never even met Oh Jong-gu!

585
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:02,365
Why did you run if you didn't know?

586
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,408
Because you said you were cops!

587
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:06,077
Let's check your plate.

588
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,747
I got scammed into buying this
a few days ago.

589
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:11,540
I'm the victim here.

590
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,961
-Jeez.
-Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

591
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:20,925
What did he say?

592
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:24,095
He said he got scammed
into buying the plate a few days ago.

593
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,058
If you're tired, stay here and rest.

594
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,601
I'll check out the remaining places.

595
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,436
Who said I was tired?

596
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:35,147
My stamina is unbreakable,
unlike someone I know.

597
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,902
Just stay here
instead of getting in my way later.

598
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,155
I don't get it.

599
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:46,534
If you hate me so much,
why did you say you'd take me?

600
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,037
Because it's getting to me.

601
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:51,539
What is?

602
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,209
Me and Han-na being together?

603
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:57,253
Yeah.

604
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,012
Jeez.

605
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,848
Just when I start liking him,
he makes me hate him.

606
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:30,036
Yes, Chief?

607
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:31,954
INSUNG JEIL ELECTRONICS

608
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:34,874
There are too many people at the agency,
so I worked from here.

609
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:36,625
I know the owner here, so it's safe.

610
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:38,794
All right.

611
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,091
Hello.

612
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:49,096
There was a lot of damage,
but I managed to recover half the data.

613
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,264
Thank you.

614
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,145
What was the last incoming number?

615
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:59,648
Four, seven, two, three?

616
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,735
Four, seven, two, three…

617
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,487
What is it? Do you know it?

618
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,910
LEE JONG-HUN

619
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:16,123
-The person you are calling…
-Lee Jong-hun?

620
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,709
-…cannot be reached.
-Who is that again?

621
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,045
You will be directed to voicemail…

622
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,588
The RIU's rookie.

623
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:29,804
Hold on. Now it makes sense.

624
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:32,014
The day Dong-ju was kidnapped,

625
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,183
we only informed the RIU
of the operation area.

626
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,976
It was odd how Oh Jong-gu showed up there.

627
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,730
Do you think letting Drugmon take his gun

628
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:41,273
was also a calculated move?

629
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,192
There's no way to tell when this started.

630
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,027
So he's the informant.

631
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:47,863
Come to think of it,
the day Drugmon escaped,

632
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:49,657
the person in charge

633
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:53,202
happened to be the RIU's rookie.

634
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:56,705
She disappeared
while I was in the bathroom.

635
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,296
-Hey, Dae-yong.
-Yes?

636
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,507
-Are you with the rookie?
-Our rookie?

637
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,969
He's on probation for letting Drugmon
take his gun during transport.

638
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,679
Why do you ask?

639
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,475
All right. We found our informant.

640
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,561
Now we just need to catch Min Ju-yeong.

641
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,481
Man, what a sight.
They sent a ton of manpower.

642
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,986
Over 500 men have been dispatched
under the commissioner's special orders.

643
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,656
I hear the commissioner
is basically living at the agency.

644
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:34,201
What's gotten into him?
He can't seem to make up his mind.

645
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,995
He switched gears pretty quickly.

646
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:38,455
He's struggling
now that the tables have turned.

647
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,083
Anyway, where the hell
is Min Ju-yeong hiding?

648
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,669
How can there be no trace of him
with all those people searching?

649
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:44,753
Damn bastard.

650
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,100
Hey, Dae-yong. Did you find the rookie?

651
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,866
It can't be you, Jong-hun!

652
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:14,950
This can't be real!

653
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,036
-Hey.
-Damn it, you bastard!

654
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,537
What the hell happened?

655
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,830
I don't know.

656
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,749
We came after receiving a report too.

657
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:25,127
Jong-hun would never do such a thing.
Something's not right.

658
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,464
-Goddammit.
-Jong-hun!

659
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,105
When Min Ju-yeong
slipped away from Goldengate,

660
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:47,399
it would've been hard to leave undetected.

661
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:51,070
But there were cops
and firefighters everywhere.

662
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,782
How did he escape?

663
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:05,125
Over 500 men have been dispatched
under the commissioner's special orders.

664
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:08,337
What's gotten into him?
He can't seem to make up his mind.

665
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,090
I hear the commissioner
is basically living at the agency.

666
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:16,762
That damn coward.

667
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:20,683
I think I know

668
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,476
where Min Ju-yeong is.

669
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:25,604
Bastards like him

670
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:28,482
instinctively hide in the safest place
when they sense danger,

671
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,568
latching themselves
onto the strongest person

672
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:33,612
among those around them.

673
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:38,033
Has the mayor called?

674
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:39,660
Yes, sir.

675
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,496
He's going to send someone soon.

676
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,752
Would you like a cup of tea?

677
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,629
I have excellent green tea.

678
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,596
SAFE INSUNG, HAPPY CITIZENS

679
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,973
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

680
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:07,855
You can't enter.

681
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:10,024
Move.

682
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,569
Seriously, what the hell?

683
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:14,653
Get the hell off me.

684
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:16,322
Why are you blocking me?

685
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,033
-Hold onto him.
-What are you doing?

686
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,826
Let go. Didn't you hear me?

687
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,078
Why the hell are you blocking me?

688
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,163
Who the hell are you?

689
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:26,165
Block access properly!

690
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,624
What the hell are you saying?

691
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,460
Why are you stopping me?

692
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,340
What are you people doing?

693
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:35,966
Get out of my way.

694
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,135
Whose orders are you following?

695
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:39,970
Move.

696
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:41,430
You'll face legal consequences for this.

697
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,225
Let go.

698
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,352
-Watch it.
-I'm not kidding.

699
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,520
-Come at me!
-You could get hurt.

700
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:52,649
Let go, damn it.

701
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:00,949
Hey.

702
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,370
So this is where you were hiding,
you damn coward.

703
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:05,454
Commissioner!

704
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,250
Lower your guns!

705
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:11,710
Hey, what are you doing?

706
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:13,796
Put the gun down.

707
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:21,136
Hey, lower your guns.
He's just going downstairs.

708
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,221
Lower them!

709
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:36,693
Hey, Ji Han-na!

710
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,279
Lower your gun!

711
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,616
Ji Han-na, I said lower your gun!

712
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,660
Are you trying to get me killed?

713
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:01,093
Commissioner!

714
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,263
Commissioner!

715
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,433
-You heard gunshots, right?
-You can't do this.

716
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:08,600
We all need to go upstairs.

717
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:10,769
One, two, three. Let's go!

718
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:11,854
Move!

719
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:17,609
Are you okay, sir?

720
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,197
Don't touch me!

721
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,704
Sergeant Kim!

722
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,082
Move him slowly!

723
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,252
Hey, be careful!

724
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:36,837
What happened to him?

725
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,548
Senior Officer Ji Han-na shot him.

726
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,591
Just go!

727
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,343
Hurry up. No, go slowly!

728
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:46,930
-Hurry!
-She shot him?

729
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,765
I see.

730
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:51,768
-She had her reasons.
-Sure, it couldn't be helped.

731
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:54,188
I see.

732
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,864
Hey, where do you think you're going?

733
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:09,786
Do you have insurance?

734
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,540
If not, I can introduce you to someone.

735
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,752
I'm about to break a lot of your bones.

736
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:32,309
You've been through hell,
but you seem to be holding up fine.

737
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:33,936
You underestimated me.

738
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,271
Shut up and stand up.

739
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,777
You're the one
who did the underestimating.

740
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,272
Dong-ju!

741
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:33,662
Hey, were you going somewhere?

742
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,133
I thought you took off,

743
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:47,968
but here you are.

744
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:51,221
Why would I when you're right here?

745
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,649
Jeez.

746
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,652
Just give up already.

747
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,531
I'm getting tired of this.

748
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,760
Jeez.

749
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,554
Seriously.

750
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,270
Hold on.

751
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,106
Don't tell me you can't see.

752
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,441
Stop talking bullshit.

753
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:57,162
Hey.

754
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:05,921
I was right.

755
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:09,424
This bastard can't see anything.

756
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:14,096
Didn't I tell you
to watch your blood pressure?

757
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:19,059
Serves you right for not taking
your coach's words seriously.

758
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:23,146
How do you expect to fight me
in that state?

759
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:18,744
Jong-hyeon!

760
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:20,620
Yoon Dong-ju!

761
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,665
Stop!

762
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:28,587
Sir, we have a shitstorm at our hands.
Are you not going to do anything?

763
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,088
I don't think it was our rookie.

764
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:31,798
So there's another rat.

765
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,425
That rat is on our team.

766
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,219
I can't get involved.

767
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,138
Money isn't the only thing
in his arsenal, huh?

768
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:39,556
If it's not money…

769
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,641
Let's just ask one person.

770
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:44,144
He'll make a move first.

771
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:47,689
Min Ju-yeong will head toward Gumyeon-dong
through the Gumyeon Intersection.

772
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,650
I guess I meant a lot to you.

773
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,111
How long are you going to pretend
that you're fine in front of me?

774
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:54,279
You can look forward to it.

775
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,072
Han-na, are you on your way?

776
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,867
Today is going to be a very memorable day.

777
