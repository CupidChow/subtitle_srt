[Episode 15]

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,200
Not here.

4
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,720
Go check over there.

5
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,840
That way.

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,700
She's not here.

7
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,410
Look over there.

8
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,400
Here.

9
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
What's wrong?

10
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,710
There are many puppets in the yard.

11
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,970
They didn't notice me.

12
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,280
Don't go out.

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,050
You're all here.

14
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,610
Constable Li, can you walk?

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,430
Yes.

16
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,829
We can't stay here.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
Feng Wuniang has escaped.

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,970
Let's go down the mountain now.

19
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,750
Be careful.

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
The innkeeper is missing.

21
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,180
Put it down.

22
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,310
I'll go back to look for him.

23
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,510
Don't bother.

24
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,300
He's Wuniang's father.

25
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,630
She won't hurt him.

26
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,270
What's wrong?

27
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,380
Am I wrong?

28
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,630
Let's go.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,680
No.

30
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,579
You're right.

31
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,800
Banxia,

32
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,910
I drew a self-protection seal

33
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,120
on your palm.

34
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,760
Why is it gone?

35
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,180
Go ahead, you guys.

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,470
Wuniang!

37
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,630
Wuniang!

38
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,450
Wuniang!

39
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,220
Wuniang!

40
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,190
Wuniang.

41
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,000
Wuniang.

42
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,680
Wuniang!

43
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,310
Wuniang.

44
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,310
Wu…

45
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,900
Wuniang.

46
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,690
Did you

47
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,920
kill that guy?

48
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,430
No.

49
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
Why do you look like

50
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,800
you wish I had killed him?

51
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,120
Fine.

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,830
I'll kill someone

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,560
to fulfill your wish!

54
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,310
Father.

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,190
Do you know me at all?

56
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,510
Father.

57
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
You found it out eventually.

58
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,920
You are…

59
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,120
It's me, Father.

60
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,760
Can't you recognize me?

61
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,980
I've become prettier, haven't I?

62
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,910
After collecting body parts for so many years,

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,770
I finally got

64
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,040
a perfect body.

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,360
That has not been easy.

66
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,920
Why did you break it?

67
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,540
Let me show you more clearly.

68
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,100
Why did you

69
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,590
kill so many people?

70
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,450
What's wrong with that?

71
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,890
They were all innocent people!

72
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,720
I…

73
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,760
Are you going to hit me again?

74
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm the innocent one.

75
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,040
You created me,

76
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,040
but you don't like me.

77
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
There's revulsion in your eyes

78
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
when you look at me.

79
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,240
Do you hate me?

80
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,630
Do you hate me for keeping you from going home?

81
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,390
Wuniang.

82
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,520
I've kept you here

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,870
to protect you.

84
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,480
I don't want you

85
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,950
to be judged by others.

86
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,070
I want you to live a happy life.

87
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,510
Do you really

88
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,750
want me happy?

89
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,870
You keep telling everyone that I'm sick

90
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,070
and have bad manners.

91
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,360
You never approved of me.

92
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,159
I can be better.

93
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,390
I have so many eyes,

94
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,270
noses, and mouths.

95
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,560
But why?

96
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,190
Why can I never

97
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,870
piece together

98
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,420
the kind of daughter you want?

99
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,030
Dear,

100
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,310
let me get you out of here.

101
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,470
You can go wherever you want.

102
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,510
In the future, I'll let you

103
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,470
do whatever you want.

104
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
Just don't hurt anyone again.

105
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,750
Okay?

106
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,600
You're no longer my father.

107
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,310
From now on, we have nothing

108
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,510
to do with each other.

109
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,090
I'm going to find my own life.

110
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,340
Banxia.

111
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,190
Banxia.

112
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,580
Banxia.

113
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,750
Xuanye, I'm here.

114
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,000
Xuanye.

115
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,210
She stole my sheath.

116
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:25,910
You turned

117
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,120
into me first.

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,340
She's the fake one.

119
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,360
She's so cunning.

120
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,420
Don't believe her.

121
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,510
Xuanye.

122
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,670
You made the wrong choice.

123
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,290
I'm much better than her.

124
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,420
You stupid woman.

125
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,630
Only you had to die,

126
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,560
but you wouldn't stop struggling.

127
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,390
Now,

128
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,920
both of you have to die here.

129
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,150
Don't be so sure.

130
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,950
We don't know

131
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,570
who will die here today.

132
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,160
Mr. Jiu.

133
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
I don't want to be hard on you.

134
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,760
I even think

135
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,460
we're a good match.

136
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,570
You're handsome,

137
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,650
and I'm pretty.

138
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,930
Why don't you

139
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,110
give it a second thought?

140
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,630
What is real?

141
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,480
What is fake?

142
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,340
Let me accompany you on her behalf.

143
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,920
I can do everything she can.

144
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,750
If one day,

145
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
you get sick of this face

146
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,210
and get bored of this girl,

147
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
I can change into another person

148
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,120
for you.

149
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,370
Isn't that good?

150
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,530
Fake is fake.

151
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,940
Stop dreaming.

152
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,130
Since that's the case,

153
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,090
why are you obsessed

154
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,240
with the Fubai Wine?

155
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,970
Are you surprised?

156
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,720
I know everything

157
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
that's happened in this inn.

158
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,630
Good wine makes the drinker drunk quickly,

159
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,040
but some people just can't stop drinking it.

160
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,800
You knew

161
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,300
it was all just an illusion

162
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,630
but still wouldn't let go

163
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,750
of that warmth.

164
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,000
Mr. Jiu.

165
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,190
Which is better,

166
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,750
reality or illusion?

167
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,580
What you want is simple.

168
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,730
I can give it to you.

169
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,870
All I want

170
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,670
is a home too.

171
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,000
I can be your family.

172
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,200
Isn't that much better

173
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,510
than the Fubai Wine?

174
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,320
Family can never be replaced.

175
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,570
Fake things can never be real.

176
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,390
You don't know

177
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,590
what family is at all.

178
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,480
Wuniang,

179
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,390
your body is fake,

180
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,060
and your heart is vicious.

181
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,320
You can only be a monster your whole life!

182
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,000
Shut up!

183
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,080
Once you die,

184
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,470
I'll be real!

185
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,950
What is real?

186
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,280
I'll answer you now.

187
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,670
For you,

188
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,030
the pretty body

189
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,890
my sword pierced through is fake.

190
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,270
Inside this body,

191
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,450
that rotten

192
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
and twisted heart

193
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,320
is real.

194
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,370
You talk too much.

195
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,830
Today, I'll use your blood

196
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,640
to celebrate my rebirth!

197
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,320
Fire!

198
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,630
Why are you helping her?

199
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,360
She's my daughter!

200
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,080
Please don't hurt her.

201
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,720
Please.

202
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,680
Let me take her away.

203
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,900
Don't hurt her, will you?

204
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,670
Thank you.

205
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:06,750
Dear,

206
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,589
it's all my fault.

207
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,240
You're right.

208
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,869
I shouldn't have

209
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,230
kept you here all alone.

210
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,510
I should've taken you home.

211
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,640
I was wrong.

212
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,440
I was wrong.

213
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,510
Can you forgive me?

214
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,830
I'll take you home now

215
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,450
to visit your grandparents,

216
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,160
uncles, and aunts.

217
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,390
We'll plant orange trees,

218
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,750
and you can have a big yellow dog.

219
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,970
I'll stay with you forever.

220
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,070
Okay?

221
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,270
Okay.

222
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,680
Father.

223
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
My dream will finally come true.

224
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,960
Yes.

225
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes.

226
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,770
All I need to do now is get rid of them.

227
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,920
You can't kill anyone anymore!

228
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,960
Dear,

229
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,400
you can't kill anyone anymore.

230
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,440
You lied to me.

231
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,750
Wuniang!

232
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,500
I'll keep you company!

233
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,920
Why did you stop me?

234
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,910
Why did you stop me?

235
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,590
Wuniang.

236
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,990
I'll keep you company.

237
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,810
I'll keep you company.

238
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,510
Wuniang.

239
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,350
What is Nine Lives doing?

240
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,620
Is he trying to save Feng Tian?

241
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,270
This should be

242
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,920
Nine Lives' last life.

243
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,190
Is it worth it?

244
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,470
In order to save Feng Tian,

245
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,680
the Cat Demon sacrificed his own life.

246
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,880
Maybe

247
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,050
he thought it was worth it.

248
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:36,930
Where am I?

249
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,830
I didn't die?

250
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,000
It's because

251
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,910
he didn't want you to die.

252
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,700
In this world,

253
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,880
some people think they're insignificant

254
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,820
and pity themselves for that.

255
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,140
But they don't realize

256
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,460
that someone who truly cares for them

257
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,980
will give up their life

258
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,440
to keep them safe.

259
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,880
Why?

260
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,260
Some creatures

261
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,020
will spend their whole life repaying someone's kindness

262
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,330
and even die for it.

263
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,420
I remember now.

264
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,070
We were suffering

265
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,730
from a great plague that year.

266
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,830
My sheep died.

267
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
There was no food left in Guima Fort.

268
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,880
I was so hungry that day.

269
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,360
Why are you looking at me?

270
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,160
Stop looking.

271
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,250
Stop looking at me.

272
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
I didn't eat it.

273
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,310
Maybe because

274
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,070
I thought that cat was too thin

275
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,590
and eating it wouldn't last me for too long.

276
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,350
That's the last piece

277
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,160
of ham I have left.

278
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,080
I've given you half.

279
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,460
Take your time.

280
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,000
Enjoy it.

281
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,820
On the other side of the desert

282
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
is the Central Plain.

283
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,030
My home is there.

284
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,170
I wonder

285
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,600
how my parents are doing.

286
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,910
I hope they've been good.

287
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,440
Little kitten,

288
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,300
I think you can understand me.

289
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,900
With you here,

290
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm not alone.

291
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,110
How about I

292
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,970
give you a name?

293
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,550
I'll call you…

294
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,160
Nine Lives.

295
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,250
Nine Lives.

296
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,160
Nine Lives!

297
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,550
At first,

298
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,030
we were together all the time.

299
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,590
Then one day,

300
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,060
a strange man showed up.

301
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,720
Seeing that I lived all alone,

302
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,670
he pitied me

303
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,440
and taught me

304
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,640
how to make puppets.

305
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,810
Then I made Wuniang and Qingshan.

306
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,790
One day,

307
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,020
I suddenly found

308
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,670
that they developed minds of their own.

309
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,730
It's like

310
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,820
they had become real humans.

311
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,390
After that,

312
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,580
I never saw Nine Lives again.

313
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,070
I thought...

314
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,830
I thought he left.

315
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,460
He didn't leave.

316
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:08,930
He was always

317
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,010
by your side.

318
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,760
It's just that your attention

319
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,310
was somewhere else,

320
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,010
so you couldn't see him.

321
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,880
You came back here

322
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,240
and built this inn.

323
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
He followed you back.

324
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,110
He wanted to get close to you,

325
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,640
but Wuniang drove him away.

326
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Having nowhere to go,

327
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,310
he went to hide in the woods.

328
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,160
Although he later got primordial spirit

329
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,490
and became self-aware,

330
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,070
he didn't get to transform into human shape.

331
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,070
He couldn't talk,

332
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,680
so he was unable to tell you what happened.

333
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,590
Seeing you so depressed,

334
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,160
he wanted to help you,

335
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,570
so he caused a stir by selling his lives

336
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,860
and drew us to the Reunion Inn.

337
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,960
His goal

338
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,590
was to get us

339
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,140
to take you away from here.

340
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,370
Selling his lives?

341
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,630
He was a Cat Demon

342
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,160
and had nine lives.

343
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,070
Then why…

344
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,170
A lot has happened.

345
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,110
He used them up.

346
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,290
He gave his last life

347
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,820
to you.

348
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,000
He sacrificed his lives

349
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,400
to lure us here

350
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,430
so that you could leave

351
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,360
the Reunion Inn.

352
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,480
So,

353
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,440
don't let all his efforts

354
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,630
be in vain.

355
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,070
The Reunion Inn.

356
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,070
I thought

357
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,110
we'd stay here

358
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,510
for the rest of our lives.

359
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,750
I thought I gave Wuniang

360
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,680
and Qingshan a home.

361
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,680
But this place…

362
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,830
actually became

363
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,620
a cage for us.

364
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,110
I didn't want to accept

365
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,790
the fact that Wuniang had changed.

366
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,070
It's my fault that it ended up like this.

367
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,240
Mr. Feng Tian,

368
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,750
Nine Lives wished

369
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,290
that you could pull yourself together.

370
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,140
He never forgot

371
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,870
your kindness to him.

372
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,370
It's not wrong to love,

373
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,130
but you shouldn't let love blind you.

374
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,000
Xuanye,

375
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,000
when did you know

376
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,920
there were other demons

377
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,420
in the inn besides the Cat Demon?

378
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,220
When you gave me the wooden bead.

379
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,550
I saw something strange

380
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,000
in the pool.

381
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,880
You found it out so early.

382
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,080
So you planned ahead,

383
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,000
secretly contacted Youhuang

384
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,070
and Nive Lives,

385
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,930
and then let me help you

386
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,620
lure Wuniang into exposing herself, right?

387
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,950
Banxia,

388
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,400
I need to appear weak

389
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,350
to lure the demon out.

390
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,500
Thank you.

391
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,530
You're good at acting.

392
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,650
I wasn't acting.

393
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,810
I was really scared.

394
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,700
How did you

395
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,870
convince Yanqiu?

396
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,150
Actually, the Fubai Wine

397
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,400
won't make the drinker completely delirious.

398
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
As long as you have a strong mind,

399
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,910
you can still tell reality from illusion.

400
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,900
Your cousin was wallowing in grief

401
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,030
and wouldn't move on

402
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,040
because

403
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,160
there was nothing more important

404
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,000
to buck him up.

405
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,480
Banxia is in danger. Help us.

406
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,230
I see.

407
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,250
Wuniang said

408
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
you didn't drink the Fubai Wine.

409
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,760
So you lied to her?

410
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,640
You said

411
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,450
you drank that wine every day.

412
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,010
It was also a lie, wasn't it?

413
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,920
All right. The rain has stopped.

414
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,780
Let's go to that Hoto noodle shop.

415
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,480
Let's go.

416
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,960
Thank you.

417
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:24,350
[Wu's Hoto Noodles]

418
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,620
Here we are.

419
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,260
Physician Jiu.

420
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,330
Please come in.

421
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:34,860
Welcome.

422
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,000
Physician Jiu.

423
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,860
What would you like to have today?

424
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,350
Two bowls of Hoto noodles, one plate of stuffed lotus root with sticky rice,

425
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,510
one plate of perilla,

426
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,880
one plate of burdock root,

427
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,010
and two plates of spicy pickled melon.

428
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,140
Would you like anything else?

429
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,440
No. That's quite a lot.

430
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,160
That's all.

431
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,160
We're hungry. Please hurry.

432
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,920
Okay.

433
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,540
Physician Jiu,

434
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,550
this is the first time

435
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,990
you've brought a girl to my restaurant.

436
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,310
Miss,

437
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,880
how old are you?

438
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,260
Where are you from?

439
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm from Nanyang.

440
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,180
I just moved to Guangping.

441
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,850
So you're new here.

442
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Where do you live?

443
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,880
I live on Sifang Street.

444
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,640
The house on the south end.

445
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,070
That…

446
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,110
That's next to Ganshan Clinic.

447
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,960
Miss,

448
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,510
are you engaged?

449
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,640
Mr. Wu.

450
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,480
Go prepare the food.

451
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,610
Wait a moment.

452
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,200
You're quite familiar with him.

453
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,810
Do you come here often?

454
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,730
I treated his wife once.

455
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,920
We've known each other for a long time.

456
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,360
Here, have some water.

457
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,790
So what is that?

458
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,550
It's a magic tool for self-protection.

459
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,960
A magic tool?

460
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,440
It can keep me safe.

461
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,680
Is it related to demons?

462
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,800
My dad didn't mention that.

463
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,920
Won't your sleeve

464
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,510
wipe it off?

465
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,960
It's a tattoo. It can't be wiped off.

466
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,560
Here come your Hoto noodles.

467
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
That's a big portion.

468
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,550
Big?

469
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,310
We've been selling noodles here for a long time.

470
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,640
They're very delicious.

471
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,290
Maybe

472
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,540
you'll ask for more.

473
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,770
What is this?

474
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,030
We didn't order it.

475
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,510
This is the honey cake.

476
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,570
A gift from my boss.

477
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,070
He said the honey cake

478
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,310
is made with honey and sesame oil.

479
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,110
It carries a lovely meaning.

480
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,070
After eating it,

481
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,920
you'll surely stay together forever

482
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,250
and be as sweet as honey.

483
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,200
Please enjoy.

484
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,770
Don't listen to him.

485
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,230
Try it.

486
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,720
Do you want to try it?

487
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,240
Okay.

488
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,580
Do you know

489
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,880
how my dad found Nine Lives?

490
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,270
I guess

491
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,560
he found Chi Wangchuan

492
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:57,810
and happened

493
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,240
to hear that Nine Lives was selling his lives.

494
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,590
So he planned to use Nine Lives

495
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,120
to get rid of Chi Wangchuan.

496
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,090
But Chi Wangchuan

497
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,180
found out his plan.

498
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,070
Don't worry.

499
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,280
We'll find more clues.

500
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,210
With you helping me, I'm not worried.

501
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,159
What's wrong?

502
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,880
I stepped in a puddle just now.

503
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,590
My socks got wet.

504
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,780
I can carry you.

505
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,170
Thanks, but I can walk myself.

506
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,630
You must be tired from the long journey.

507
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,550
Let me carry you.

508
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,510
Xuanye,

509
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,070
do you like to drink?

510
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,520
If you do,

511
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,450
I'll make

512
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,210
refreshing fruit wine for you.

513
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,880
It won't give you a headache.

514
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,000
Okay.

515
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,660
Then it's a deal.

516
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,450
When you want a drink,

517
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,230
come to me.

518
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,900
Don't drink alone.

519
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,240
You ate a lot tonight.

520
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,650
Don't go to bed too early.

521
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,110
You may have indigestion.

522
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,320
Xuanye,

523
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,410
can you

524
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,100
draw another seal for me?

525
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,400
I need it to feel secure.

526
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,590
That self-protection seal is for saving your life.

527
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,440
If you use it too often,

528
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,840
it'll drain your energy.

529
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,230
So,

530
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,510
unless it's absolutely necessary,

531
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,570
you must not use it.

532
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,500
Understand?

533
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,360
Yes.

534
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,840
I was very careful

535
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,970
every time I used it.

536
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,670
It's done.

537
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,480
Why are your hands so cold?

538
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,690
Are you feeling unwell?

539
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,700
No.

540
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,470
It rained just now.

541
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,840
It'll be cold at night.

542
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,630
Find yourself

543
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,670
a thick blanket.

544
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,420
I will.

545
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,320
I'll go back now.

546
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,760
Why is there grey hair again?

547
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,030
Xuanye.

548
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,780
Why didn't you go eat after coming back?

549
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,720
Did you practice martial arts

550
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,580
until midnight last night again?

551
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,960
I didn't sleep well because of the noise you made.

552
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,220
I even dreamed of fighting with someone.

553
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,510
Xuanye,

554
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,400
trust me.

555
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,230
Feed the Moon Bugs with sheep lung soup

556
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,960
every month,

557
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,750
and they'll grow big and plump for sure.

558
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Even a 1000-year-old demon

559
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,140
can be daunted by them.

560
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,670
Xuanye, come and play cards with us.

561
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,600
Come on, Xuanye.

562
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,570
You always have the winning hand. No one wants to play with you.

563
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,150
What a sore loser. We can play again!

564
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,150
Let's play again.

565
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,440
You brat.

566
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,200
All you know is drinking.

567
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,060
Have you mastered the Bahuang Fist I taught you?

568
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,070
I knew you'd forget it.

569
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,290
Let me teach you again.

570
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,590
Watch carefully.

00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,380
♫With a sigh, we bid farewell♫

579
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,380
♫Keeping you company, and seeing you off on a long journey♫

580
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,680
♫You're the same as before♫

581
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,630
♫And I'm still following closely behind♫

582
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,400
♫Remember it day and night♫

583
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,050
♫One side is the past♫

584
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,380
♫Where you lingered♫

585
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,880
♫The other is the unforgettable♫

586
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,880
♫Dream of mine♫

587
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,480
[Memorial Tablet of My Brother, Jiu Xi]

588
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,600
[Memorial Tablet of My Father, Jiu Cangming]

589
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,600
[Memorial Tablet of My Mother, Hong Ning]

590
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,290
♫A fallen leaf, a drop of wine♫

591
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,400
♫Each drop into my heart♫

592
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:54,570
♫A moment of memory, an illusion♫

593
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,340
♫A segment of reminiscence engraved for a lifetime♫

594
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,670
Xuanye.

595
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,440
Xuanye, are you home?

596
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,960
Xuanye.

597
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,340
Xuanye.

598
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
I knew you'd come back today.

599
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,920
Where did you go?

600
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,130
I went to Wen Jian's place.

601
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,060
His wife

602
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,340
is so bad at cooking.

603
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,720
I didn't eat enough.

604
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
You can't be picky about free meals.

605
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,250
Xuanye, give me money.

606
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,580
I want to buy radishes.

607
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,790
I don't have money.

608
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,590
You're lying.

609
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,580
The Cat Demon gave you

610
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,720
a big box of silver.

611
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,480
I saw it.

612
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,500
You saw it?

613
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,470
Then go find it yourself.

614
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,550
So many checks.

615
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,230
One,

616
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,440
two,

617
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,840
three, four,

618
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,070
five.

619
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,880
Seven, eight, nine.
