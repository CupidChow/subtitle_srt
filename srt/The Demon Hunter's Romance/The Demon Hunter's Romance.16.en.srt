Is this expensive?

9
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,170
It's not, just one tael.

and the troupe's business hasn't been good.

That unscrupulous Manager He

23
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,560
gave up the lease of the courtyard

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,750
and told us to find our own place to stay.

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,030
This is just inhuman.

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,470
If by the end of the month,

No need. I'm sure I can find a place.

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,340
Besides, there are four of us living together.

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,670
It would be inappropriate if I left alone.

I recognized you from behind.

Why are you here too?

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,260
I just went to Fa'en Temple with a friend.

40

A fish is biting.

41
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,160
Why did you throw it back?

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,280
That fish is too stupid.

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Eating it would be bad for the brain.

44
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,079
Where have you been these past few days?

45
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,810
I haven't seen you around much.

46
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,800
I've been thinking about your father's matter,

47
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,440
and I made a trip to

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,010

49
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,220
That place is where Chi Wangchuan

50

settled five years ago.

51
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,750
Actually, Chi Wangchuan

52
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,400
was entrusted by another demon

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,660
to kidnap your father.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,410
So by following Chi Wangchuan's lead,

55
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,550
we should be able to find some clues.

56
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,300
Did you find anything?

I have some leads.

Why does this fish look

59
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,060

190
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,480
No, no.

191
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,550
Of course not.

192
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,120
It's settled then.

193
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,790
I'll go make the reservation right away.

194
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,510
When the time comes,

195
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,270
we'll respectfully await your arrival, Commissioner.

196
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:03,800
Alright.

197
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,000
Chief Constable Chu, if you don't have any other plans,

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
why don't you join us as well?

199
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,940
I...

200
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,360
You're going to suffer.

201
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,790
Why did you book a private room?

202
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,050
It's small and stuffy.

203
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,130
Isn't this great? We can even watch the dance performance.

204
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,240
Commissioner is coming today.

205
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,840
We have to show some respect.

206
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,980
This is quite rare.

207
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,840
Not really.

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,730
It's because Youhuang is back.

209
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,440
Has Deyue Restaurant been renovated?

210
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,870
Why does it look

211
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,200
different from before?

212
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,750
You've been gone for years.

213
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,250
Many things have changed.

214
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,270
Youhuang.

215
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,720
But some things

216
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,200
haven't changed at all.

217
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,380
Come on, Youhuang.

218
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,840
Why hasn't Commissioner Sima arrived yet?

219
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,640
She should be here soon, I guess.

220
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,240
Come on.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,730
If you ask me,

222
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,600
now that you're back this time,

223
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
you shouldn't leave again.

224
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
Guangping certainly can't compare with Shendu.

225
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,440
Commissioner Sima's elder brother,

226
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,150
needless to say,

227
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,750
is now the Junior Tutor to the Crown Prince.

228
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,880
He's highly valued.

229
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,270
Not to mention her father.

230
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,870
He's the current Grand Secretary, a first-rank minister.

231
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,710
Besides, her maternal grandfather

232
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,000
holds the title of Marquis.

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,060
Her mother is the Empress Dowager's niece.

234
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,610
Bro, if you ask me,

235
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,750
no matter which one of them

236
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,120
puts in a good word for you,

237
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
you'd soar to great heights

238
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,750
and achieve success effortlessly.

239
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,970
Hey.

240
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,300
Did you hear

241
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,260
what I just said?

242
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,480
No matter what you say, it's in vain.

243
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,910
If he were willing to listen to you,

244
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,670
he wouldn't have gone to Guangping in the first place.

245
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,510
He would have already been

246
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,870
the Sima family's son-in-law.

247
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,000
He's just stubborn.

248
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,670
Commissioner Sima has also been

249
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,200
highly valued these years.

250
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,440
She's got a bright future ahead.

251
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,600
Yet he acts as if marrying her

252
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
would be some huge loss for him.

253
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Right? You see...

254
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,080
Those who wanted to marry her back then

255
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,790
have probably changed graves

256
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,990
several times by now.

257
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,840
If you're so enthusiastic about it, why don't you marry her yourself?

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,150
You think I don't want to?

259
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,950
The problem is

260
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,630
she's way out of my league.

261
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,060
You talk too much, buddy.

262
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,630
What did I say?

263
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,000
It would be ridiculous if you were worthy of her.

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,730
What are you chatting about? It's so lively here.

265
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,940
-Commissioner.
-Commissioner.

266
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,720
We're not at the government office now.

267
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
There's no need to be so formal.

268
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,620
Please sit.

269
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,250
You didn't order any wine?

270
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,240
Boss.

271
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,340
Bring my "Intoxicating Thousand Mountains" here.

272
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,970
Got it.

273
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,690
Please sit.

274
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,680
I know my presence might dampen your mood.

275
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,540
I'll just have three glasses of wine and then leave.

276
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,320
Commissioner, please don't say that.

277
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
That's nonsense.

278
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,420
Exactly.

279
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,120
It's rare for you to grace us with your presence, Commissioner.

280
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,270
How could you leave so soon?

281
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,320
Yes. Right.

282
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,250
Alright.

283
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,630
This first toast

284
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,050
is to His Majesty.

285
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,000
If it weren't for His Majesty,

286
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
we wouldn't be living in this glorious era of prosperity.

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,450
Nor would we have

288
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,160
such bright futures ahead.

289
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,500
To His Majesty!

290
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,630
This second toast

291
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,450
is to you, Chief Constable Yue.

292
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,200
Since I, Lingying, am a woman,

293
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,930
I've often received your care.

294
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,370
Now that you're moving to a new place,

295
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,630
I'm also happy for you.

296
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,910
I haven't moved yet. Not yet.

297
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,630
But with your kind words, Commissioner,

298
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,960
I'll surely move as soon as possible.

299
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
When the time comes,

300
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,030
I'll have to trouble you all, guys.

301
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,550
Cheers.

302
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,660
Cheers!

303
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,070
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

304
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,200
This third toast

305
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,760
is to you, Chief Constable Chu.

306
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,000
I heard that in Guangping,

307
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,030
you've been thriving

308
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,780
and are highly valued by your superior.

309
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,150
That Lord Geng, Geng Zhen,

310
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,150
is the Noble Consort's younger brother.

311
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,030
Young and talented,

312
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,120
he's bound to become a marquis or minister sooner or later.

313
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
When you left me back then, Youhuang,

314
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,920
I was indeed upset for a few days.

315
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,200
I thought it was because I wasn't worthy of you.

316
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,130
Little did I know

317
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,540
you were leaving to serve a worthy lord from afar.

318
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,470
You've got a good eye.

319
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,480
Wish you

320
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,230
a bright future, Chief Constable Chu.

321
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,080
May you achieve great success soon.

322
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,810
Thanks a lot.

323
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,590
I've had my three glasses of wine.

324
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,580
I'll take my leave now.

325
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,640
See you, everyone.

326
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,750
Oh, right.

327
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,840
You are all Chief Constable Chu's

328
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,500
good friends, like brothers.

329
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm sure you're of one mind with him

330
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,060
and of similar character.

331
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,440
I hope that when he achieves success in the future,

332
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,970
he'll remember these good times

333
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,100
of drinking and chatting with you all.

334
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,680
Go. She's leaving.

335
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,680
Hold on, Commissioner.

336
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,490
Commissioner.

337
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,550
It's late at night.

338
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,970
It's not safe for you to walk alone.

339
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,670
I'll have Youhuang escort you.

340
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,840
Why are you pulling me?

341
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
Didn't you see Commissioner

342
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,910
is dressed in a woman's outfit today?

343
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,510
Looking so pretty,

344
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,440
what if she encounters some bad guys?

345
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,030
Right, guys?

346
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,500
Exactly.

347
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,430
P-Pull him over.

348
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,000
Pull him over.

349
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,480
Right.

350
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,670
Go, go quickly.

351
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,270
Hurry up, you.

352
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,240
Get going, you.

353
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,720
Let's go.

354
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,360
Are you angry?

355
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,290
I wouldn't dare.

356
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,090
You wouldn't dare?

357
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,280
Chief Constable Chu.

358
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,840
Although you were a scoundrel before,

359
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,550
at least you were

360
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,480
someone who dared to take responsibility for your actions.

361
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,920
Why is it that after only six years,

362
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,670
you've become so

363
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,000
hypocritical, slick, and worldly-wise?

364
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,390
I don't know what I've done

365
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,600
to offend you, Commissioner Sima.

366
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,270
You don't know?

367
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,840
I don't.

368
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,240
Six years ago,

369
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
you publicly broke off our engagement and left me.

370
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,130
You left Shendu,

371
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,390
leaving me here alone

372
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,510
to become the laughingstock of the entire city.

373
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,370
What kind of engagement was that?

374
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,940
At that time, my elder brother was kidnapped by bandits.

375
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,820
I vowed that

376
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,000
I would marry whoever saved him.

377
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,270
You saved him,

378
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,960
so naturally, you were my husband-to-be.

379
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,030
But I didn't know about that at the time.

380
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,720
My family, the Simas, publicly offered a reward.

381
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,319
The whole city knew about it.

382
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,270
How could you not know?

383
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,470
I simply didn't know.

384
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,150
I'm a constable.

385
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,270
It's a constable's duty to catch bandits.

386
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,000
Why would I need you to offer yourself to marry me?

387
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,540
Why do you despise me?

388
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,130
I don't despise you.

389
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,030
Then why did you break off our engagement?

390
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,580
I didn't know you at that time.

391
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,650
I kindly rescued your brother,

392
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,720
yet your grandfather

393
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
brought your cousins

394
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,550
to my house to force the marriage.

395
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,410
I didn't agree,

396
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,650
and then your uncle

397
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,240
went to the Court of Judicial Review and asked my superior

398
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,100
to pressure me,

399
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,880
making my entire family have to

400
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,590
leave Shendu in the middle of the night.

401
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,440
I haven't even settled this score with you yet,

402
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,550
and you're the one feeling wronged?

403
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,790
It was just a marriage proposal.

404
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,270
Did you really have to move in the middle of the night?

405
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,880
Besides,

406
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,310
am I some kind of monster?

407
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,110
Am I really that unworthy of you?

408
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,210
I'm the one who's unworthy of you.

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,550
The marriage between a man and woman

410
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,750
is a major life event.

411
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
First, there should be mutual affection,

412
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,310
and second, the two families should be of equal status.

413
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,030
Commissioner Sima, you're from a wealthy and prestigious family,

414
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,750
while I come from a humble background.

415
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,010
Besides, before that,

416
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,550
we had never even met.

417
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,510
What kind of delusion

418
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,310
made you think

419
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,320
that we were a good match?

420
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,950
Pedantic.

421
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,590
My father also came from a humble background,

422
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,680
but he married my mother.

423
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,880
They've been living in harmony,

424
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,920
and now he's a first-rank official.

425
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,350
How come when it comes to you,

426
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,810
there are so many excuses?

427
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,270
Your father is a top scholar.

428
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,600
How can I compare to him?

429
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,150
I'm not an ambitious person.

430
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,680
I can't spend my whole life

431
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,750
climbing the ranks of officialdom

432
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,720
and seeking wealth and status just to be a good match for you.

433
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,400
I just want to be a good constable,

434
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,480
catching criminals and protecting the people.

435
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,640
Being a constable is good.

436
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,440
Aren't I a constable myself too?

437
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,590
No one's forcing you to become a high-ranking official.

438
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,240
If I were after

439
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,640
wealth and status,

440
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,920
I'd go straight to the list of eligible bachelors

441
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,960
and pick a husband from there.

442
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Why would I have chosen you?

443
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,100
Sima Lingying.

444
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,020
Your family background is illustrious,

445
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,480
while I'm just a commoner.

446
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,990
We're not even on the same level.

447
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,720
How could we spend the rest of our lives together?

448
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,030
Even though I left

449
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,920
in a rush and

450
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,550
wasn't considerate about your feelings,

451
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,070
it's been six years.

452
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,670
Can we stop dwelling on this?

453
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,390
Let's reconcile and move on.

454
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,000
You-

455
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,440
Stop!

456
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,030
Are you alright?

457
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:40,960
Don't-

458
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,610
What happened?

459
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,310
Is that person okay?

460
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,240
What's going on?

461
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,830
Demon!

462
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,810
Demon!

463
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,920
Demon!

464
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,440
Xuanye.

465
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,320
I know why you want to go to

466
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,580
the Underground City.

467
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,090
There are demons in the Underground City.

468
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,050
You learned about

469
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,950
Chi Wangchuan's connection

470
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,880
to the Underground City when you were in Shaozhou Prefecture.

471
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,920
So you guess

472
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,200
the demon that kidnapped Banxia's father

473
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,970
lives there.

474
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,350
That's why you want to go find it.

475
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But your father wouldn't let you go.

476
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,880
I don't have any evidence right now.

477
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
It's just a guess.

478
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,170
The demon that can command Chi Wangchuan

479
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:39,760
must have

480
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,390
exceptional demonic power.

481
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,960
If such a demon

482
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
wanted to capture someone,

483
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
why didn't it do it itself?

484
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,250
I know there are

485
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,880
several demons

486
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,620
that have cultivated for over 100 years

487
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,070
and don't like to go out much living in the Underground City.

488
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,530
It's the flood season now.

489
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,720
All the paths in and out of the Underground City

490
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,510
are flooded.

491
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,610
We can't get in.

492
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,330
We have to wait longer.

493
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:00,830
No way.

494
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,950
Even if the water recedes, you still can't go.

495
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,000
Your father said

496
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,530
if you dared to go there,

497
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,030
he'd break your legs.

498
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,440
My Lady.

499
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,310
My Lady?

500
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,510
My Lady,

501
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,880
why didn't you respond?

502
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,750
What's this?

503
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,080
Come here.

504
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,290
Stop looking around.

505
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,510
What is this?

506
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,210
You treasure it so much?

507
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,750
This is a gift from Physician Jiu.

508
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,070
It's just a paper crane, isn't it?

509
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Why did Physician Jiu give you this?

510
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,750
How would I know?

511
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,590
But...

512
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,070
I made a wild guess.

513
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,720
So... What is your guess?

514
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,940
Didn't those ancients

515
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,110
all like

516
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,110
to express emotions through birds?

517
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,100
Think about it,

518
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,480
"Cooing And Wooing", "The Swallow", and "Mandarin Ducks"

519
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,030
from the Book of Songs

520
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,550
are all poems about love.

521
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,680
"Merrily the ospreys cry,
on the islet in the stream."

522
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,120
"Gentle and graceful is the girl, a fit wife for the gentleman."

523
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,390
There's more.

524
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,280
There's also

525
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,920
"A pair of swallows fly..."

526
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,510
My Lady.

527
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,150
I understand now.

528
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,050
What do you understand?

529
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,160
I understand

530
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,890
what you want me to understand.

531
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,200
What do I want you to understand?

532
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,240
Don't you want me to say

533
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,790
that Physician Jiu gave you this paper crane

534
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,920
to express his longing for you?

535
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,070
I... I didn't say that.

536
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,240
He might not think that way either.

537
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,270
It seems you really wish

538
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,510
that's what he meant.

539
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,680
My Lady,

540
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,610
you're done for.

541
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,590
Since you came back from

542
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,070
Reunion Inn this time,

543
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,960
I've noticed

544
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,880
that your heart

545
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,550
is firmly tied to

546
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,410
Physician Jiu.

547
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,510
If Master

548
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,860
weren't still missing,

549
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,680
you would have already torn down that wall

550
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,080
and joined with him next door as one family.

551
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

552
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,170
I don't have such thoughts.

553
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,180
You've made it so obvious.

554
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Even a blind person could see it.

555
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,240
My Lady.

556
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,300
There are words on this paper.

557
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,990
Physician Jiu has written you a letter.

558
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,130
Careful, careful.

559
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,790
Tang Ruyun?

560
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,880
My mother?

561
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,620
Tang Ruyun is your mother?

562
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,700
Are you sure

563
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
this letter was written by your mother?

564
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,310
That's right.

565
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,130
I recognize my mother's handwriting.

566
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,590
But my mother

567
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,990
passed away 12 years ago.

568
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,980
That year, I was kidnapped,

569
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,240
and after I returned, I could see demons.

570
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,350
My parents thought

571
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,600
I had contracted some illness,

572
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,110
so they took me by boat to the capital to seek medical treatment.

573
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,510
We encountered a storm on the way,

574
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,200
and my mother accidentally fell into the water.

575
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,860
After that, she went missing.

576
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,750
We all thought she had died.

577
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,340
But look.

578
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,470
It's dated the Year of the Water Rat.

579
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,430
Wasn't that three years ago?

580
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,890
Could my mother still be alive?

581
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,830
Could it be

582
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,240
it was written in the last Year of the Water Rat?

583
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,350
The last Year of the Water Rat

584
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,440
was 63 years ago.

585
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,690
Her mother wasn't even born then.

586
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,000
It must be so.

587
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,820
My mother must still be alive.

588
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,000
No wonder

589
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,310
three years ago, my father suddenly

590
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,170
sold several of our family shops,

591
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,200
and he was away from home

592
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,330
for most of the year.

593
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,030
I always thought

594
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,750
he was traveling for pleasure.

595
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,550
I never thought he was out searching for my mother.

596
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,760
But I don't understand

597
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,110
why this letter

598
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,910
was in the Cat Demon's money box.

599
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,440
The Cat Demon exchanged lives with your father.

600
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,040
It took your father's money,

601
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,720
and then it gave all the money it collected

602
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,400
to me.

603
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,070
Perhaps it obtained

604
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,110
this letter from your father

605
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,440
at that time.

606
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,560
It mistook it for a banknote

607
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,180
and put it in the money box.

608
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,750
My mother is still alive.

609
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,400
Could my father's disappearance

610
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,860
be related to this as well?

611
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,170
It says Enlightenment Bookstore here,

612
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,610
where my mother wrote this letter.

613
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,610
So if we can find

614
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,820
this Enlightenment Bookstore,

615
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,150
we can find out their whereabouts, right?

616
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,280
I don't know about Enlightenment Bookstore,

617
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,680
but I recognize this

618
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,470
Dongming grass mark.

619
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,660
Dongming grass?

620
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,730
My Lord, you recognize it?

621
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,160
This is the symbol of Guangping Underground City.

622
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,480
You've lived in Guangping for a long time.

623
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Don't you know about it?

624
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,680
I've only heard of it,

625
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,660
but I've never been there.

626
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,210
This is the pass token for the Underground City.

627
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,610
Dongming grass

628
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,680
grows in Guangping Underground City.

629
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,480
It's said that

630
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,850
there are demons living in the Underground City.

631
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,720
Therefore, the merchants there use grass

632
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,520
as lamp wicks,

633
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,730
placing them on the ceiling

634
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,070
to reveal the demons

635
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,370
and trade with them.

636
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,550
Over time,

637
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,880
Dongming grass became

638
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,070
the symbol of the Underground City.

639
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,320
My Lord, have you ever been to the Underground City?

640
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,870
I have.

641
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,190
Two years ago,

642
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,260
when Lord Xin'an went missing,

643
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,600
I was ordered by His Majesty

644
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,530
to go there and search for him once.

645
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,650
If that's the case,

646
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,070
the paper demon

647
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,390
came from the Underground City?

648
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,720
My Lord, you don't seem surprised

649
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,520
that demons exist in this world.

650
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,680
The Court of Judicial Review of Shendu

651
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,310
oversees all major criminal cases in the realm.

652
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,750
You don't really think

653
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,960
Guangping is the only place that has had demon troubles, do you?

654
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,000
In this vast world,

655
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,510
the existence of demons is not surprising.

656
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,140
Where are you going later?

657
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,000
Packing my bags and getting ready to leave.

658
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,590
No rush.

659
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,920
Come with me to my house.

660
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,010
Your house?

661
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,480
Yes, my mother wants to see you.

662
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,000
Why does your mother want to see me?

663
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,880
How would I know?

664
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,680
Go and ask her in person,

665
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,830
then you'll find out.

666
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,440
I'm not going.

667
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,970
You dare?

668
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,970
When an elder summons, you can't refuse lightly.

669
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,820
Let me tell you, Chu Youhuang.

670
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,270
It doesn't matter if you don't respect me.

671
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,030
But if you dare not respect my mother,

672
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,550
guess if

673
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,160
you'll live to see

674
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,090
tomorrow's sun.

675
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,440
My mother is the kind of person who dares

676
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,570
to smash teacups in the imperial hall.

677
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,790
You're using your mother to pressure me again.

678
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,880
Go back, get changed,

679
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
and wash up properly.

680
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,690
Later,

681
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,920
I'll have someone pick you up at the inn.

682
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,070
My Lady.

683
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,610
Chi Xue has something to discuss with you.

684
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,160
Banxia.

685
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,310
I'll accompany you to the Underground City.

686
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,240
Xuanye can't go.

687
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,860
Did something happen?

688
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,750
His father said before that

689
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,330
no matter what,

690
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,460
he must not go to the Underground City.

691
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,350
Why is that?

692
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,480
Well...

693
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,090
The Underground...

694
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,720
I don't know either.

695
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,560
Anyway, his father said that

696
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,290
absolutely, absolutely,

697
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,350
under no circumstances should he

698
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,210
set foot in the Underground City.

699
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,480
[Bamboo Sound]

700
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,110
My Lady.

701
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,080
What should we do now?

702
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,030
What is that ridiculous rule

703
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,630
Physician Jiu's father set?

704
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,440
Why isn't he allowed to go to the Underground City?

705
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,100
There might be other reasons.

706
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,730
What reason could there be?

707
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,790
Anyway,

708
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,360
we need to prepare for both possibilities.

709
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,000
This rule was set by Xuanye's father

710
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
for Xuanye.

711
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,880
He can't disobey it easily.

712
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,750
And we certainly can't

713
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,900
make him go against his father's orders

714
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,160
due to our own affairs.

715
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,180
But now that we've obtained

716
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,140
new clues,

717
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,960
I must go to Underground City

718
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,550
no matter what.

719
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,720
But I've heard

720
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,480
there are not only demons there.

721
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,070
There are also some

722
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,480
shady businesses.

723
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,160
It's hard to tell good from bad, a mix of all sorts.

724
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,500
Chi Xue might not be able to handle it.

725
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,260
We need to think of another solution.

726
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
What is that other solution?

727
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,050
A master, a Taoist priest,

728
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,310
or someone like Xuanye,

729
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,730
a skillful demon hunter.

730
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,670
But that Master Kongtongzi

731
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,350
from last time died.

732
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,160
Where are we supposed to find a new one?

733
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,430
If we can't find one, we'll go by ourselves.

734
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,640
No matter what,

735
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,880
as soon as the water recedes,

736
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,310
we'll set off immediately.

737
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,310
Nuts!

738
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,830
Big, delicious, and crunchy nuts!

739
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,510
Nuts!

740
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,750
Big, delicious, and crunchy nuts!

741
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,920
Nuts!

742
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,310
Sir.

743
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,830
Boss, can I try these?

744
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,510
Of course you can.

745
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,380
Please have a seat, sir.

746
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,240
I'll bring them to you right away.

747
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,980
Sir, have a taste first. You can buy some if you like them.

748
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,350
Boss, I'll take both of these.

749
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,010
No problem.

750
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,970
Freshly picked apples!

751
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,510
Apples!

752
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,510
Master.

753
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,500
Sir, your nuts are ready.

754
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,920
Thank you.

755
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,160
Have a nice day, sir.

756
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,410
Nuts, delicious nuts!

757
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,030
Chi Xue.

758
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,000
What happened?

759
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,810
Did you get into a fight?

760
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,960
No.

761
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,360
They attacked me first.

762
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,640
Who are they?

763
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,840
I don't know them either.

764
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,190
Are they demon hunters or martial artists?

765
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,720
I'm not sure.

766
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,480
It's okay.

767
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,350
Anyway, if we ever meet again,

768
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,720
they won't be able to catch me.

769
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,920
I'll go wash my hands.

770
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:02,750
[Ganshan Clinic]

771
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,230
Are you the owner?

772
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,810
Are you here to see a doctor or pick up medicine?

773
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,840
I'm not sick.

774
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,690
So you're here to pick up medicine.

775
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,929
I'm not here for medicine.

776
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,170
I'm here to hunt demons.

777
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,710
Please hold on, Sir!

778
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,310
Have mercy!

779
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,250
It seems we've been presumptuous.

780
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,360
We thought this clinic

781
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,700
had been occupied by demons.

782
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,030
We didn't expect to meet

783
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
a skilled disciple from the Eight Pillar Sect.

784
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,240
I am Jiang Shangyun.

785
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,900
This is my apprentice, Xue Qiao.

786
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,680
He's also a demon hunter.

787
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,510
We've long heard that the Eight Pillar Sect

788
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,000
possesses the technique of demon control,

789
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,150
and the disciples of your sect

790
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,080
can subdue demons for your own use.

791
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,360
Now that we've seen it ourselves today, it's truly extraordinary.

792
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,960
Xuanye.

793
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,600
They're the ones who hit me.

794
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,280
Apologize.

795
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,070
Of course we will.

796
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,000
It was just a misunderstanding.

797
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,690
Please don't blame us.

798
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,410
Then we won't disturb you any further.

799
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,240
We'll take our leave now.

800
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,230
Xuanye.

801
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,920
Master.

802
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,610
Are we letting them off just like that?

803
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,290
We'll talk about it when we get back.

804
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,150
Soup.

805
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,000
Be careful, it's hot.

806
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,260
I'll go serve the soup.

807
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,540
Who were those two people just now?

808
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,550
They are both demon hunters.

809
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,760
Demon hunters?

810
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,890
They're not frauds

811
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,850
like Master Kongtongzi, are they?

812
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,090
I don't think so.

813
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,800
Wait for me a moment.

814
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,370
This is for you.

815
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,230
What is this?

816
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,310
The pass token for the Underground City.

817
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,230
Are you going with me?

818
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,460
Do you have anyone else in mind?

819
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,630
Then in a few days, when the water recedes,

820
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,710
we can set off.

821
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,210
Is there anything else we need to prepare?

822
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,030
Bring some money.

823
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,400
Xuanye, have some soup.

824
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,290
I'll go back to my room for a moment.

825
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,260
Don't worry, I understand.

826
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,590
Chi Xue.

827
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,400
You told me before

828
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,020
that he'd pay a price

829
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,710
for using Hidden Dragon Case.

830
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,760
Greedy Wolf is gluttonous, and Mountain Shaker is a sleep addict.

831
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,410
That time at the Reunion Inn,

832
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,140
he used the Fire Sword.

833
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,320
What's the backlash of the Fire Sword?

834
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,280
Using the Fire Sword damages one's life preservation.

835
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,410
What does that mean?

836
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,880
Life preservation means lifespan.

837
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,430
Every time he uses it,

838
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,920
his life gets shortened a bit.

839
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,320
If he uses it frequently,

840
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,110
his hair will turn grey faster.

841
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,670
Come in.

842
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,500
What brings you here?

843
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,160
To dye your hair.

844
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,920
It's okay. I'll just pluck them.

845
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,010
There are too many. You can't pluck them all.

846
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,630
Then I'll just leave them be.

847
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,050
Didn't I tell you last time that

848
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,080
having grey hair makes one look unenergetic?

849
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,590
Are you busy?

850
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,960
Not really.

851
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,430
Then let me dye your hair.

852
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,590
What's wrong?

853
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,560
Did Chi Xue

854
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,790
say something to you?

855
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,110
No.

856
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,000
About the Underground City,

857
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,670
you don't need to worry too much.

858
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,130
My father not letting me go

859
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
was completely out of

860
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,550
parental love.

861
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,710
He was worried I might encounter danger.

862
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,920
But every time I hunt demons,

863
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,720
isn't my life always on the line?

864
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,460
If I were afraid of danger,

865
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,070
I might as well

866
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,150
simply live my life as a physician

867
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,480
and put down this sword.

868
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,510
Maybe your father

869
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,670
had other reasons.

870
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,600
What other reasons could there be?

871
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,360
Anyway, this is my business.

872
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,200
You don't have to worry about it.

873
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,380
These grey hairs of yours,

874
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,590
did they grow because you used

875
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,470
the Fire Sword?

876
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,240
I don't think it's a good sword.

877
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,030
It both harms your body

878
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,960
and shortens your life.

879
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,870
No matter how bad it is, it's better than death.

880
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,820
If not for the Hidden Dragon Case that day,

881
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,320
we might not have been able to escape

882
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,030
from the Reunion Inn unscathed.

883
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,030
Then you shouldn't have gone there.

884
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,070
Knowing there's such

885
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,230
an irreversible cost,

886
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,710
why did you still choose to

887
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,880
risk your life?

888
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,120
What should you do if I didn't go?

889
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,930
How should you save Yanqiu?

890
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,650
And how could you

891
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,520
get information about your father's whereabouts

892
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,750
from the Cat Demon?

893
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,570
That's my business.

894
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,560
What does it have to do with you?

895
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,320
Why are you crying?

896
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,900
Who's crying?

897
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,830
Sit still.

898
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,750
I'm dyeing your hair.

899
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,560
What exactly is wrong with you?

900
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,670
I feel terrible.

901
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,880
Ever since I came into your life,

902
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,390
you've been constantly dragged into trouble.

903
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,620
If it weren't for me,

904
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,380
you wouldn't have been injured so badly.

905
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,780
You wouldn't be so tired,

906
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,600
and you wouldn't...

907
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,060
It's all because of me.

908
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,750
It has nothing to do with you.

909
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,540
I'm a demon hunter.

910
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,510
If it weren't you, it would be someone else.

911
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,470
You don't understand.

935
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:38,890
out of my own free will.

936
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,440
♫If I think this world is beautiful♫

937
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,190
♫It's partly because of the moon♫

938
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,800
♫And mostly because I met you♫

939
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,750
♫When life gets hard♫

940
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,320
♫All I wish for is to stay by your side♫

941
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,480
Oh no.

942
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,360
It won't come off.

943
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,710
♫This lingering love♫

944
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,730
♫Is a treasure we both cherish♫

945
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,440
♫When I turn around, you're there♫

946
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,190
♫Right by my side♫

947
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,550
What won't come off?
