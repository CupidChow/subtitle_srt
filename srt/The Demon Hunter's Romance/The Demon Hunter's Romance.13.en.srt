[The Demon Hunter's Romance]

2
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,979
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,350
I've checked the inn's ledger.

4
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,430
It shows that nine days ago,

5
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,950
Gao Sheng had stayed at this inn

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,479
for four consecutive days.

7
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,229
But the innkeeper and his staff

8
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,950
had all told me

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,000
they've never seen this person.

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
This inn is indeed strange.

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,000
The Cat Demon

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,680
that led us here before

13
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,070
appeared again last night.

14
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,310
It led us to the Xin Court.

15
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,350
At that place, we found

16
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,590
Banxia's cousin.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,630
Banxia's cousin?

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,240
Yes.

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,910
He seems to know something,

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,470
but he won't say it.

21
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,079
So, is the culprit

22
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,079
a demon or a human after all?

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,540
Feng Tian said

24
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,400
he was once a border guard,

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,590
guarding the border alone for twenty years.

26
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,960
Would such a person kill?

27
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,520
That's not necessarily true.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,630
Maybe he's lying to you.

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,800
What about that Cat Demon then?

30
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm not sure about

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,870
its intentions yet.

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,470
But I have a feeling

33
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,420
that besides this Cat Demon and Feng Tian,

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,910
there's something else

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,870
hidden in this inn.

36
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,470
It's just that we

37
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,520
haven't discovered it yet.

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,310
Yes, yes, yes.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,680
I feel like

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,910
there's been something

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,840
watching me lately.

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,870
Physician Jiu,

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,430
Youhuang said you have the ability

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,520
to catch demons and monsters.

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,850
Do you have any

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,560
demon-suppressing or evil-repelling items

47
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,960
to give me some courage?

48
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,560
No.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
Come on, find me some.

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,430
Let's go.

51
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,710
Where to?

52
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,710
Didn't you say Banxia's cousin

53
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,680
seems to know something?

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,910
Let's go ask him.

55
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,840
Chief.

56
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,910
Honored guest.

57
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,240
Honored guest,

58
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,590
someone is looking for you in the front courtyard.

59
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,960
Who is it?

60
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,280
Looks like a villager from down the mountain.

61
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,240
He seems quite urgent.

62
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,340
You'd better go check quickly.

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,590
Villager?

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,240
You're looking for me?

65
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,770
Are you Chu Youhuang,

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,590
Chief Constable Chu?

67
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,590
I am. What's the matter?

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,890
I went up the mountain early this morning

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,590
and found a body near the cliff.

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,470
There was this letter on the body.

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,310
The letter mentions

72
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,960
the Reunion Inn and you, Chief Constable Chu.

73
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,910
So I thought I'd come and ask.

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,630
This is the letter I wrote to Lord Geng.

75
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,400
Chief,

76
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,520
something happened to Yan Li.

77
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,500
Where's the body?

78
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,590
It's right by the cliff.

79
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,000
Take us there.

80
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,600
Alright.

81
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,120
Where is it?

82
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,270
It's right there.

83
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,190
Yan Li.

84
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,950
Yan Li.

85
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,159
Yan Li.

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Chief.

87
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,270
This.

88
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,310
Yan Li.

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,360
What happened?

90
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,480
His neck was snapped.

91
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,390
Who did this?

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,270
Daring to attack an official.

93
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,270
It's truly audacious.

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,870
They'd better not let me catch them.

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,270
They'd better not let me catch them.

96
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,310
Chief.

97
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,510
His son just turned one month old.

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,430
They haven't even had the full moon celebration yet.

99
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,000
Enough.

100
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,390
Ji Nu'er.

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,720
The swallow you gave me is really beautiful.

102
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,240
Wuniang.

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,270
Wuniang.

104
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,830
Get out.

105
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,600
Wuniang.

106
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
I need to ask you something.

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,870
You must answer truthfully.

108
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,159
Did you

109
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,310
kill that guy?

110
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,950
No.

111
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,650
I haven't even said who it was yet

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
and you're already saying no?

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,240
No matter who it is,

114
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,430
I didn't kill them.

115
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,160
Father, don't you believe me?

116
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,430
Talking back to me?

117
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,750
If you don't believe me, Father,

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
you might as well turn me in.

119
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,000
Aren't there constables at the shop?

120
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,950
You can hand me over to them.

121
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,720
That would solve it, wouldn't it?

122
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,360
That's not what I meant.

123
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,190
Tell me.

124
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,950
Did you do it?

125
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,750
Why do you look like

126
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,240
you wish I had killed him, Father?

127
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,800
Fine.

128
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,240
I'll kill someone

129
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,070
to fulfill your wish then!

130
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,480
Don't be ridiculous.

131
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,510
Father.

132
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,240
Do you know me at all?

133
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Wuniang.

134
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,159
I just want you to

135
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,870
live a peaceful life.

136
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,630
I won't bring shame to you, that's all.

137
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,310
Wuniang.

138
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,750
Can't you be a bit more obedient?

139
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,120
I just want what's best for you.

140
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,000
Alright.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,750
Yanqiu, it's me, Banxia.

142
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,800
I‘ll head out now.

143
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,159
Yanqiu.

144
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,310
I thought you weren't in your room.

145
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,600
Why didn't you answer

146
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,800
when I knocked earlier?

147
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,750
Arm in arm while we come and go.

148
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,630
Lingering close by your knee below.

149
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,830
Well sung.

150
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,430
Yanqiu.

151
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,510
What are you doing?

152
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,040
Banxia, you're here.

153
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,190
Have a seat.

154
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,800
Let's listen to music together.

155
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,750
Cousin, what are you staring at?

156
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,160
Your sister-in-law.

157
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,320
Yanqiu.

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,390
What on earth are you talking about?

159
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,549
She can't handle it.

160
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,780
She can't bear to hear this.

161
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
Your sister-in-law laughs that you're just a little girl,

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
not used to hearing these tunes

163
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,700
about frontier travel

164
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,080
that are full of panic and chaos.

165
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,840
She wants to sing you

166
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,790
a lighter, more melodious love poem.

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,750
Han Guang: Tall Trees in the South.

168
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,510
Have you heard it before?

169
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,960
♫There are tall trees in the south♫

170
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,000
♫But they offer no rest♫

171
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,200
♫There are beautiful wandering girls by the Han River♫

172
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:27,510
♫But they cannot be pursued♫

173
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,720
♫The Han River is so wide, it cannot be swum across♫

174
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,440
♫The Yangtze flows so long♫

175
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,630
♫It cannot be crossed from any direction♫

176
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,320
Banxia.

177
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,590
Be careful.

178
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,630
How is it?

179
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,440
I'll go get you water to wipe your face.

180
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,070
Come, come.

181
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,840
Keep me company to drink wine

182
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,840
and listening to music.

183
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,780
How did you discover him?

184
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,240
Reporting to Chief Constable Chu,

185
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,100
this place, usually,

186
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,840
has very few people and a lot of firewood.

187
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,480
I...

188
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,390
I came here to chop wood.

189
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,950
Don't leave the village recently.

190
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:27,870
You can go back now.

191
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,740
Yes.

192
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,120
Yan Li's martial skills are quite good.

193
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,960
Even if he couldn't defeat a strong enemy,

194
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,270
he should have been able to escape.

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,750
This criminal's grip strength is incredible.

196
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,960
The flesh on his back

197
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
was completely torn off.

198
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,410
What kind of person

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,750
would do such a thing?

200
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,720
In such remote mountains,

201
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,440
who could know?

202
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,390
Unless...

203
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,510
Yan Li could speak.

204
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,390
You can't go in.

205
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,600
This is my family's inn.

206
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,270
Why can't I enter?

207
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,240
You still can't go in.

208
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,510
Fine, I won't go in then.

209
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
What's the big deal?

210
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,000
How could you do this?

211
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,720
I... I've already come in.

212
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,870
What more do you want?

213
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,510
Banxia, she tricked me.

214
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,390
Oh, Miss Duan is here too.

215
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,080
Why are you here?

216
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,510
I came to bring wine for Mr. Duan.

217
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,800
Didn't I tell you?

218
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,270
Ever since he arrived,

219
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,840
he's been staying in his room all day,

220
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,510
just drinking wine.

221
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,410
Didn't you tell me before

222
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,670
that you hardly ever saw him

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,030
and that you almost forgot about him?

224
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,770
Before, it was the servants taking care of him.

225
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,060
But I heard

226
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,150
that he's your cousin.

227
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,840
So, I came personally.

228
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,240
Wait a moment.

229
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,600
What exactly is this?

230
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,440
This is Fubai Wine.

231
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,870
Haven't you heard of it, Miss Duan?

232
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,960
The guests who come here

233
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
all really like this wine.

234
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,240
They say that after drinking it,

235
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,540
they could see

236
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,260
the person they miss the most.

237
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,320
Miss Duan,

238
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,720
would you like some?

239
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
There was only one assailant.

240
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,550
His foot measures eight inches and two tenths.

241
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,150
About seven feet tall. Male.

242
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,240
He was young.

243
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,290
But he was heavy.

244
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,000
Must be a fat guy.

245
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,600
Not necessarily.

246
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,000
Although he wasn't agile,

247
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
he was physically strong.

248
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,470
If he were fat,

249
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,000
he couldn't have been so quick.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,510
He should be of medium build,

251
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,080
a physically strong man.

252
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,240
He didn't carry any weapons.

253
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,960
Yan Li was skilled in martial arts.

254
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,670
If he could be killed barehanded,

255
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,080
could the assailant be

256
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,240
someone with exceptional martial arts skills?

257
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:27,840
No.

258
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,840
He was stabbed.

259
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,600
But why isn't there

260
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,750
any trace of blood on the ground?

261
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,840
Perhaps it was cleaned up.

262
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,390
Or perhaps he was wearing an armour.

263
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,420
That's why his body was so heavy.

264
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,440
He tore off Yan Li's skin with his bare hands.

265
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,720
This method is too cruel.

266
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,840
He seemed completely unafraid of

267
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,870
Yan Li's resistance.

268
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,320
It was as if he was toying with

269
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,240
a plaything.

270
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,270
This strangulation mark...

271
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,000
He's missing a finger on his right hand.

272
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm just a bit dizzy.

273
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,320
I'll be fine after a short rest.

274
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,050
Please don't worry about it.

275
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,190
That person is in the inn.

276
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,340
I've seen him.

277
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,480
What's this?

278
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:50,990
From now on,

279
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,130
don't bring this kind of wine anymore.

280
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,440
If customers want to drink,

281
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,870
we have no reason not to sell it.

282
00:16:59,130 --> 00:16:59,760
Yanqiu is now

283
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,030
in a daze and unclear every day.

284
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,840
I am his sister.

285
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,270
I have the right to make decisions for him.

286
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,660
If you bring this wine again,

287
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,960
don't blame me for getting angry with you.

288
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,200
Alright, if you don't want it, I won't bring it.

289
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,550
Please don't be angry, Miss Duan.

290
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,310
Take them away quickly.

291
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,680
Miss Duan.

292
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,589
Miss Duan.

293
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,550
Liar.

294
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,070
I was just teasing you.

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,240
You really got angry?

296
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,920
What happened to your neck?

297
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,720
I have something to do.

298
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,030
I'm not playing with you anymore.

299
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,550
Let's go.

300
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
Sir, sir.

301
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,440
Put it down first.

302
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,270
Everything has been taken care of.

303
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,720
It seems the innkeeper

304
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,000
is very concerned about my colleague.

305
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,750
Yes, indeed.

306
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,440
Put it down first.

307
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,990
After all,

308
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,260
it's a human life.

309
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,750
Is that so?

310
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,790
If he were alive,

311
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,480
he would probably thank you in person.

312
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,510
Don't move.

313
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,680
Sir.

314
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,780
This person died outside.

315
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,110
Let's not bring him inside.

316
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,680
There are guests inside after all.

317
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,530
I am the Chief Constable of Guangping City.

318
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,030
I suspect your inn

319
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,830
is connected to the murder

320
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,850
of my colleague.

321
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
From this moment on,

322
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,160
the inn is closed.

323
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

324
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,270
Do you understand?

325
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,680
You can't say that, sir.

326
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,930
The person died outside,

327
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,440
not inside my inn.

328
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,980
What does it have to do with us?

329
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,920
Moreover,

330
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
do you have any evidence?

331
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,200
With evidence, it's called solving a case.

332
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,440
Without evidence, it's called investigating a case.

333
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,350
Any objections?

334
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:24,890
Xuanye,

335
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,270
keep a close eye on things for me.

336
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,440
What's going on here?

337
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,590
I asked you to watch the inn earlier.

338
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,850
Have you seen a man

339
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,440
with only

340
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,550
four fingers on his right hand?

341
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,680
Yes, I have.

342
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,790
I just saw him.

343
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,680
He left with Wuniang.

344
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,550
Where did they go?

345
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,680
Follow me.

346
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,070
Alright.

347
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,790
Thank you, Wuniang.

348
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,200
Sir.

349
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,350
Sir.

350
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,000
It's here.

351
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,930
Dear guests.

352
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,030
Where are you going?

353
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,240
To look for your servant.

354
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,900
If there's anything, just tell me.

355
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,270
Sir.

356
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,960
Sir.

357
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,830
Sir.

358
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,750
It's him.

359
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,270
This...

360
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,960
Mr. Jiu.

361
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,070
I clearly saw it.

362
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,790
Saw what?

363
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,790
He only has four fingers on his right hand.

364
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,640
Wh-what?

365
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,270
You must have seen wrong.

366
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,450
Impossible.

367
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,750
That's strange then.

368
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,680
He clearly has five fingers here.

369
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,510
That's right.

370
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,720
Sir.

371
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,960
What are you trying to do?

372
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
You're scaring her.

373
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,440
If you have any questions, talk to me.

374
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,110
Innkeeper, if you have nothing to hide,

375
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,000
why are you stopping me?

376
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,780
Do you know that harbouring is the same as being an accomplice?

377
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,070
Mr. Jiu,

378
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,960
you and your group

379
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,920
sought to lodge late at night.

380
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,340
I was the one who persuaded Father

381
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,550
to let you stay.

382
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,640
Now you're being so rude to us.

383
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,640
Don't you think your behaviour is inappropriate?

384
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,550
Don't be disrespectful.

385
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,640
Sir,

386
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,880
as you know,

387
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,160
my daughter has been sickly since childhood.

388
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,790
If we have offended you in any way,

389
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,160
please be understanding.

390
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,130
A fox will definitely

391
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,440
show its tail one day.

392
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,270
Innkeeper,

393
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,150
I advise you to

394
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,710
keep a close eye on your people.

395
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,730
Don't wait until one day

396
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,350
something slips up.

397
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,160
Alright.

398
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,640
Please, honoured guest.

399
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,850
Please leave.

400
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,030
Father, what's this?

401
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,810
What's wrong?

402
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,680
Did you do this?

403
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,440
No.

404
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,800
Not you?

405
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,170
Then what happened to his fingers?

406
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,310
Yes.

407
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,670
Quickly tell my father

408
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,720
what happened to your fingers?

409
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,750
Leave.

410
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,960
Get out!

411
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,450
Why is it that every time

412
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,790
something like this happens,

413
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,620
Father always

414
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,330
suspects me first?

415
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,200
I understand now.

416
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,790
Because in Father's heart,

417
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,080
I am such an evil person.

418
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,240
I would do evil things.

419
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
That's why you won't take me home,

420
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,270
won't let me see Grandfather and Grandmother,

421
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,040
and insist on keeping me in such a

422
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,410
godforsaken place

423
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,510
running an inn.

424
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,080
You're afraid I might harm

425
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,160
your family,

426
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,240
aren't you?

427
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,310
That's not true.

428
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,160
Then please, my dear Father,

429
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,110
tell me.

430
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,440
If it's not like that,

431
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,110
then what is it?

432
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,960
You are my family.

433
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,790
Then who would be afraid of their own family?

434
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,210
I'm not afraid of you.

435
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,790
You are.

436
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,270
You've always been afraid of me

437
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,910
and you're getting more and more afraid.

438
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,160
Father,

439
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,550
since you don't like me anyway,

440
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,490
why don't you let me go?

441
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,110
Just like my brother.

442
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,480
Once I leave,

443
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,200
I will never

444
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,310
cause you trouble again.

445
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,830
No.

446
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,210
You can't go anywhere.

447
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,880
It's not safe out there.

448
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,200
This is your home.

449
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,070
Home?

450
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,680
Fine.

451
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,590
Then we'll just stay here.

452
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,830
But if

453
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,750
someone else gets hurt,

454
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,460
Father, don't you dare

455
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,720
blame it on me.

456
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Yanqiu, you're awake.

457
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,640
Banxia.

458
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,800
You're here.

459
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,110
Are you alright?

460
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,880
I'm fine.

461
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,030
Was it because of that wine?

462
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,760
The innkeeper's daughter just came by.

463
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,960
She said the wine is called Fubai Wine.

464
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,570
After drinking it,

465
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,960
you could see the person you miss the most.

466
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,000
So you know everything.

467
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,270
That's right.

468
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,930
The world is truly vast,

469
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,400
full of wonders.

470
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,590
Over the past six months,

471
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,350
I've really broadened my horizons.

472
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,030
Not only have I seen demons,

473
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
but I've also tasted

474
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,350
this Fubai Wine.

475
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,680
Do you know how clear it was?

476
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,640
It wasn't like a normal drunken dream.

477
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,880
It's just like it's real.

478
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,880
She's right in front of me,

479
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
talking to me,

480
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,960
laughing and chatting,

481
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,480
so vivid and lifelike.

482
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,960
It's as if...

483
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,650
It's as if she never

484
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,450
left at all.

485
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,030
Banxia,

486
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,140
do you want to try it?

487
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,160
I'll ask for a bit more.

488
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,260
Just a little,

489
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,880
and you can see your parents.

490
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:17,960
Give it a try.

491
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,030
Yanqiu,

492
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,470
you can't stay here any longer.

493
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,830
Grandmother, Uncle and Aunt

494
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,070
are still at home.

495
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,340
You haven't gone back for so long,

496
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,610
they're very worried about you.

497
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,640
Home?

498
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,830
How can home be as good as here?

499
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,750
Here, I have Manniang with me.

500
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,680
You've already been here

501
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,840
for half a month.

502
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,690
It's all because of this Fubai Wine.

503
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,720
Come to your senses.

504
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,370
Manniang.

505
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,590
Chi Xue.

506
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,510
Chi Xue.

507
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
Why is it here again?

508
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,400
Didn't we come from here?

509
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,510
Is anyone there?

510
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,010
Is anyone there?

511
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,830
Nine Lives.

512
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,510
Banxia.

513
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,160
Xuanye.

514
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,160
What are you looking for?

515
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,960
I thought I just saw Nine Lives.

516
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,660
Let's go back first.

517
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,070
The culprit should be

518
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,440
that servant you mentioned.

519
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,680
Then let's catch him!

520
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,760
Who cares if it's him or not?

521
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,750
Let's bring him in first,

522
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,960
and we'll find out after interrogation.

523
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,410
No matter how tough he is,

524
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,880
he can't be tougher than the torture instruments in prison.

525
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,720
Shopkeeper Feng Tian

526
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,790
won't allow us to make a move.

527
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,060
According to Physician Jiu,

528
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,890
his martial arts skills are impressive.

529
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,750
And that servant,

530
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,070
he's not an ordinary person either.

531
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,310
There's more than one servant in this inn.

532
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,320
There's also that Wuniang.

533
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,400
I always felt she was strange.

534
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,440
Don't forget,

535
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,000
there's also a Cat Demon lurking in the shadows.

536
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,440
So,

537
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,610
if we can't beat them,

538
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,270
let's retreat

539
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,350
and go back to get more help.

540
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,640
Do you think they'll

541
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,550
obediently wait for us

542
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,400
to come back and catch them?

543
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,070
My cousin is still here.

544
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,830
He's addicted to Fubai Wine.

545
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,690
For the time being,

546
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,190
he definitely won't be willing to leave.

547
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,240
Fubai Wine?

548
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,240
I was in such a hurry earlier

549
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,310
that I forgot to tell you.

550
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,400
I found out that this inn

551
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,530
is selling a kind of wine,

552
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,840
called the Fubai Wine.

553
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,370
It's said that after drinking it,

554
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,960
you could see the person you miss the most.

555
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,310
My brother is like this now

556
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,270
because he drank this wine

557
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,240
and became immersed in heartache of

558
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,110
missing my sister-in-law.

559
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,830
That's why he refuses to leave.

560
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,680
We dare not act rashly.

561
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,790
I believe they won't either.

562
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,030
I'll go back first to settle

563
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,960
Yan Li's body.

564
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,790
We'll discuss the rest later.

565
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,640
Xuanye,

566
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,590
I don't think the Cat Demon

567
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,640
is with them.

568
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,310
I got lost in the courtyard earlier,

569
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,610
and it seems the Cat Demon

570
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,630
guided me back.

571
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
Are you sure your cousin

572
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,480
was drinking Fubai Wine?

573
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,160
I'm certain.

574
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,830
You've heard of this wine too?

575
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:56,960
Yanzi,

576
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,570
I've failed you.

577
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,120
You've only been married for a year,

578
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,750
and just had a son.

579
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,360
How can I face

580
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,030
your family?

581
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,640
You're an only child.

582
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,200
It's all my fault.

583
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,880
I should have gone instead.

584
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,550
Let's solve this case quickly

585
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,680
and avenge Yan Li.

586
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,720
Right.

587
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,640
Revenge.

588
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,070
I've finally found you.

589
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,630
Catch.

590
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,280
No fun at all.

591
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,310
Take it away.

592
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,760
You're only giving it to me because you don't want it anymore?

593
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,070
I need to go out for a while.

594
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,139
Protect Banxia well.

595
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,670
Don't leave her side, understand?

596
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,960
Where are you going?

597
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,070
None of your business.

598
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,330
[Xin]

599
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,280
Banxia is very worried about you.

600
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,840
This wine is called Fubai Wine.

601
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,040
It uses abalone shell and cornelian cherry as its guiding ingredients,

602
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,070
supplemented with wheat bran,

603
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
and brewed through fermentation.

604
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,030
The recipe is simple,

605
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,220
but the extraction method varies.

606
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,140
However, once you know

607
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,130
the key,

608
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
it's not difficult to brew.

609
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,960
If you like it,

610
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
I can teach you

611
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,000
the extraction method.

612
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,070
This way, when you return to Nanyang City,

613
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,960
you can brew it yourself.

614
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,590
Why?

615
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,070
You think I'm here to persuade you?

616
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,840
I've been drinking this wine for six years.

617
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,480
What right do I have to persuade you?

618
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,840
Do you know?

619
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,800
When I was young,

620
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,960
I offended an enemy.

621
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,960
I couldn't catch him,

622
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,880
and he escaped.

623
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,670
Later,

624
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,110
he hurt my family,

625
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,960
infecting them with demon poison

626
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,630
and making them lose their minds.

627
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,280
In their heads,

628
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,960
it was left with the desire to kill.

629
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,960
I had no choice

630
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,070
but to kill them all.

631
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,510
My parents, my elder brother,

632
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,230
and the servants in our house,

633
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,300
all died by my hand.

634
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,480
This wine

635
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,760
is indeed a good thing.

636
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,280
All these years,

637
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,190
I've relied on this wine

638
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,960
to get by.

639
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,100
Whenever I feel that

640
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,380
life is unbearable,

641
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,230
whenever I miss my family,

642
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
it could always deceive me,

643
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
making me believe

644
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,510
that nothing has changed.

645
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,660
Every time before I go home,

646
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,400
I always take a few sips

647
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,130
at the doorstep.

648
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,710
Then I push open the door,

649
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
and everyone's there.

650
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,760
You're a bit different from me.

651
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,250
I've long been

652
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,320
a lone wolf.

653
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,770
Life and death are up to fate,

654
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,030
no one cares.

655
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,030
But you're different.

656
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
You still have family,

657
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,510
family waiting for you to return.

658
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,030
In my home,

659
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,510
there's no one left.

660
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,960
Don't wait until

661
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,070
your family is gone.

662
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,540
By then, it will be too late

663
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,510
to regret.

664
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,000
Qiu.

665
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,960
Manniang.

666
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,480
I have to leave.

667
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,030
I'm fine, you don't need to help me.

668
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,000
I can walk on my own.

669
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,000
What's wrong with you all?

670
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
I can walk.

671
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,280
Chi Xue.

672
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,110
Where's Xuanye?

673
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:28,960
I don't know.

674
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,040
Xuanye told me to

675
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,350
protect you without leaving your side for a single moment.

676
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,150
Xuanye.

677
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,440
What's wrong?

678
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,320
I'm different from them.

679
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,150
I know it's not real.

680
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,580
What do you mean?

681
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,480
Father.

682
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,930
Slowly.

683
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,180
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

684
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,840
Drink some water, Father.

685
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,800
Daughter.

686
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,190
Father carved a little wooden doll.

687
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,520
Do you like it?

688
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,280
See if it looks like you.

689
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,840
It does.

690
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,510
It does, doesn't it?

691
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,130
Wuniang likes it.

692
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,290
Wuniang wants to give Father a massage on the back.

693
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:39,830
Alright.

694
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,800
Father, you've worked hard.

695
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,730
Not hard at all.

696
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,740
[Cuixiao Hall]

697
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,690
I've warned you.

698
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,760
Don't get close to him,

699
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,440
nor

700
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,760
appear in front of me.

701
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,960
This is the last time.

702
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,960
If you dare ruin my plans again,

703
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,670
be wary

704
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,480
that I'll take away

705
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,710
the few lives you have left.
