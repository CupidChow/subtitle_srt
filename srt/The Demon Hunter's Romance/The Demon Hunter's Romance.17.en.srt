00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,229
Sir,

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,259
have a seat inside.

6
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,490
Chief Constable Chu, you're so fast.

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
Why are you following me?

8
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,030
What?

9
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,190
Is this road owned by you?

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,810
You can walk it, but I can't?

11
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,310
Fine, follow me all you want.

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,710
I'm not going back

13
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,240
with you to see your mother.

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,500
If you've got the guts,

15
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,640
follow me all the way to Guangping.

16
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,630
Take the order, Chief Constable Chu Youhuang of Guangping.

17
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,560
What order?

18
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
This is Lord Song's personal token.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
This token

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,579
represents His Lordship.

21
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,690
Are you going to take his order like that?

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,740
My Lord, anything you say.

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,910
Lord Song has ordered me to investigate

24
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,590
the case of Lord Xin'an's disappearance.

25
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,960
I've chosen you as my assistant.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
The official dispatch has been issued

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,430
and can reach Guangping in two days.

28
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,090
You don't need to report back.

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,260
You're coming with me now.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,570
Wait, that's not right.

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Lord Xin'an went missing

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
many years ago.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,900
The paper demon

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,800
might be related to this case.

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Moreover,

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
Lord Xin'an is His Majesty's uncle,

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
royal by blood with distinguished status.

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,910
Now that he's missing,

39
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,560
we have to find him at any cost.

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,090
Do you have any objections?

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,610
I wouldn't dare.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,710
Good. If not,

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
let's get moving.

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,340
Where are we going?

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,970
Back to the capital.

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,560
Didn't Lord Xin'an go missing

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,690
in the Underground City of Guangping?

48
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,660
To investigate, we first need leads.

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,150
Lord Xin'an is from Shendu.

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,470
We're heading there now

51
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,800
to visit someone who knows him

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
for more details.

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,150
And who's that?

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,270
My mother.

55
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,710
Master,

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,470
we've been searching for so long

57
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,560
and finally found a rabbit demon

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,590
hiding over there.

59
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,310
Why did we

60
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,370
let it go so easily?

61
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,960
Because of Ganshan Clinic.

62
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,410
We're in the same line of work.

63
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,920
I shouldn't interfere.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,430
A lowly demon

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
isn't worth the fuss.

66
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,360
Why alert them unnecessarily?

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,310

68
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240

Tomorrow,

80
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,800
I'll go to the Underground City.

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,720

This one depicts Yu carving through Mount Longmen.

169

Legend has it that in ancient times,

170
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,360
floods were rampant.

171
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
The ruler then, Yu the Great,

vowed to control the floods,

173
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,440
but Mount Longmen was in his way,

174
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,280
so he led his people

175
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,390
to carve through it to release the floodwaters.

176
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,360
They carved through the eastern and western mountains

177
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,510
and redirected the Yi River.

178
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,550

194
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,030
In a damp place

195
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,910
like this,

196
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
they're still well-preserved.

197
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,600
They don't seem like ancient works.

198
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,320
They're likely

199
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,510
more recent

200
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,600
and probably not done

201
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,180
by the same people who built the city.

202
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,270
Whoever painted them,

203
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,540
they chose stories

204
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,510
about defiance,

205
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,670
refusing to surrender to fate,

206
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,840
and fighting against nature.

207
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,720
That alone

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,100
says a lot about their spirit.

209
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,530
You've got a sharp eye, my friend.

210
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,440

The Underground City may seem ordinary,

213
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,080
but it can bleed people dry.

214
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,120
Since it's your first time here,

215
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,580
you must be extra careful.

216
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,370

220
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,560
We have important matters to attend to,

221
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,490
so I have to pass.

222
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,390
That's a shame.

223
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,240
Thank you for answering all our questions along the way.

386
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,970
I've been starving for days.

387
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,350
You've been in Guangping for so long,

388
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,760
but you've never been to the Underground City?

389
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,070
You grew up in Shendu,

390
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,880
but you've never seen the Twelve Golden Statues?

391
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
I have.

392
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,510
There are no such things.

393
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,340
Then why ask me about them?

394
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,790
I was just asking.

395
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,930
Just because you haven't seen them doesn't mean they don't exist.

396
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,800
Excuse me.

397
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,000
I heard

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,260
you're looking for me?

399
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,430
We're looking for the best

400
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,490
local guide in the Underground City.

401
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,520
That would be me.

402
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,270
Really?

403
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,440
Absolutely!

404
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
You can ask around.

405
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,130
I'm the best

406
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,510
local guide in the Underground City.

407
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,510
My name is Song Qi.

408
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,060
[Song Qi, eloquent and smooth-talking]

409
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,750
I can swear on

410
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,430
my savings at Xiaodongtian.

411
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,610
Do you have any?

412
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,070
Well, whether I have any or not,

413
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
if you want me

414
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,880
to do something for you,

415
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,510
I can definitely get it done.

416
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,880
In the autumn of the sixth year of the Tianxiang Era,

417
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,300
this man came to the Underground City

418
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,310
with an old servant.

419
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,680
Then he disappeared.

420
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,400
He was in his forties,

421
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,680
of noble status,

422
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,030
and generous with his money.

423
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,430
The servant, though old,

424
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,920
was highly skilled in martial arts

425
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
and had plenty of experience in the martial world.

426
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,450
They may have used aliases—

427
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,170
possibly surnamed Bai or Wei.

428
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Here's a deposit.

429
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,300
Within three days,

430
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,270
if you bring us

431
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,510
any information about him,

432
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,910
we'll double the reward.

433
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,220
Wait for my news.

434
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,450
Why do you trust someone like him?

435
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,550
He knows this place.

436
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,480
He's got a better chance of finding him than we do.

437
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,880
Aren't you afraid he'll take the money and run?

438
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,940
If he runs, let him.

439
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,470
It's not like I care about that bit of money.

440
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,160
The way you throw money around—

441
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,360
you really are your mother's daughter.

442
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,590
Thank you

443
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,230
for that heartfelt comment on her.

444
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,220
I'll be sure to pass it along.

445
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,850
No need.

446
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,140
[Wu Qun]

447
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,910
Excuse me,

448
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,410
I'm Ma San,

449
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,270
a local guide in the Underground City.

450
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,070
How can I

451
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,830
help you two?

452
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,510
We're looking for

453
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,040
the best local guide in the Underground City.

454
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,650
That would be me.

455
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,160
In the autumn of the sixth year of the Tianxiang Era,

456
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,590
this man came to the Underground City

457
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,720
with an old servant.

458
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,070
Then he disappeared.

459
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,940
He was of noble status…

460
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,940
My Lady, food's ready.

461
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,650
It's been two whole days already,

462
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,450
and still not a word.

463
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,860
My Lady,

464
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,020
do you think

465
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,550
those two are sincerely

466
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,550
trying to help us?

467
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,490
They asked about

468
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,630
Ganshan Clinic the whole way.

469
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,170
Once we said we didn't know Physician Jiu that well,

470
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,300
their attitude changed immediately.

471
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
But Xuanye told me before

472
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,770
they really are demon hunters.

473
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,460
Yeah, but not all

474
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,190
demon hunters are the same.

475
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,010
Even Kongtongzi claimed

476
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,080
to be one.

477
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,640
I feel like

478
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,790
those two aren't that invested

479
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,590
in helping us.

480
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,660
Then maybe we should try looking ourselves?

481
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,680
Sure.

482
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,580
The Enlightenment Bookstore

483
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,130
is a store.

484
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,880
The Underground City is big,

485
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,800
but if we look shop by shop,

486
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,480
we'll find it eventually.

487
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,490
Come on, eat up.

488
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,690
We'll go right after.

489
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,240
You two are right on time.

490
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,960
In the past couple of days,

491
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,590
you must've met

492
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,050
quite a few people, right?

493
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,290
Am I the first one

494
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,260
to bring you any news?

495
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,270
You are.

496
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,480
You've proven through action

497
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,010
that you truly are the best

498
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,030
local guide in the Underground City.

499
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,790
Madam,

500
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,160
you flatter me.

501
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,310
Actually, the man you're looking for—

502
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,240
I know about him.

503
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,690
In the past few years,

504
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,350
many people have come to the Underground City

505
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,210
to look for him.

506
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,210
But none of them found anything.

507
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,880
Sir, madam,

508
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,140
please look this way.

509
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,280
This place

510
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,200
is the residence

511
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,260
of the great physician, Huangfu Bai.

512
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,990
The person you're looking for

513
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,190
came to the Underground City to see him.

514
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,380
Let me tell you.

515
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,660
Huangfu Bai

516
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,010
is quite eccentric.

517
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,100
He only sees three patients a day.

518
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,550
I spent the past two days

519
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,030
pulling strings

520
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,110
to get you a spot on his schedule,

521
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,510
or I'd have

522
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,240
brought you here much earlier.

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,930
It's right here.

524
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,550
Thank you.

525
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,940
We may need

526
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,680
your help again in the future.

527
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,060
You're welcome.

528
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,880
Let me know if you need anything.

529
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,640
I won't go in with you then.

530
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,340
Take care.

531
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,390
Take care.

532
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,860
We don't even know if this is true or not,

533
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,460
yet you gave him money again.

534
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,110
You don't trust him?

535
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,990
Or you don't trust me?

536
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,250
Mainly, I don't trust you.

538
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,680
Anyone here?

539
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,940
Anyone…

540
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,340
Close the door.

541
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,160
Turn around.

542
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,070
I see two people

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,540
in perfect health

544
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,200
without any illness.

545
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,010
What are you doing here?

546
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,880
Sir, you have a sharp eye.

547
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,170
We're not here for a medical consult.

548
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,030
No matter what you're here for,

549
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,820
the consultation fee is non-refundable.

550
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,580
Of course.

551
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,870
Two years ago,

552
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,830
this man came here with an old servant

553
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,160
to seek your treatment.

554
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,510
Do you remember him?

555
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,540
Who are you guys to him?

556
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,600
To be honest,

557
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,550
we're constables from the Court of Judicial Review.

558
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,160
This man

559
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,190
is the emperor's uncle,

560
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,130
Lord Xin'an.

561
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,510
Two years ago,

562
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,160
he came to the Underground City in disguise

563
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,680
and disappeared soon after.

564
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,940
We're here to find him.

565
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,850
I advise you

566
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,800
to stop looking.

567
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,920
Why?

568
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,860
Even if you find him,

569
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,750
he's probably long dead.

570
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,640
What makes you say that?

571
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,830
He was suffering from a blood-related illness.

572
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,870
When he came to me,

573
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,690
his condition was already beyond saving.

574
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,020
By my estimation, he wouldn't have lived more than 100 days.

575
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I've gone through

576
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,000
a lot of files on Lord Xin'an.

577
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,370
None of them mention

578
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,730
any incurable disease.

579
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,350
The royal palace has skilled physicians.

580
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,480
None of them ever mentioned he was ill.

581
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,670
If those quacks

582
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,870
could've cured him,

583
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,430
he wouldn't have come to me.

584
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,410
Unfortunately,

585
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,590
he came too late.

586
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,730
There was nothing I could do.

587
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,580
Thief!

588
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,540
Thief, don't run!

589
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,730
-Stop!
-Thief!

590
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,440
Stop right there!

591
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,960
Where are you from, little thief?

592
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,600
How dare you break the rules of the Underground City

593
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,720
and steal from others?

594
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,050
Do you have a death wish?

595
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,640
Miss,

596
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,600
is this your money pouch?

597
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,270
Yes, yes.

598
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,130
Thank you, sir.

599
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,550
You're welcome.

600
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,200
But

601
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
carrying this much silver around

602
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
is really dangerous.

603
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,400
Next time,

604
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,950
go to Xiaodongtian first

605
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,480
and exchange your silver

606
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,410
for trade notes.

607
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,880
That way, no one can steal from you, got it?

608
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,310
We're new here

609
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,880
and aren't familiar with the rules.

610
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,110
That's okay.

611
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,660
Just make sure you find someone to show you around, okay?

612
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,720
Miss,

613
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,270
are you here for business,

614
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,590
shopping, or looking for someone?

615
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,680
We're looking for someone.

616
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,540
Then you've met the right person!

617
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,490
I am

618
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,370
Song Qi, a local guide in the Underground City.

619
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,830
I know everything and everyone around here.

620
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,790
No matter who you're looking for,

621
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,830
I can help you.

622
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,840
Really?

623
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,750
Of course.

624
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,520
No, thank you.

625
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,730
We'll look on our own.

626
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,080
Thanks for the offer.

627
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,240
My Lady,

628
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,010
we've made inquiries along two streets,

629
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,930
but no one knows

630
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,400
where the Enlightenment Bookstore is.

631
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,130
The Enlightenment Bookstore?

632
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,550
I haven't heard of that.

633
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,270
But

634
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,830
I can ask around for you.

635
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,510
Really, it's not necessary.

636
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,240
Thank you.

637
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
We can find it ourselves.

638
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,040
Thank you.

639
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,830
I...

640
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,960
Be careful!

641
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,920
What are you looking at?

642
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,790
Didn't you see me coming out?

643
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,250
Why didn't you step aside?

644
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,320
What's that awful smell?

645
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,290
Is it just my nose,

646
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,360
or did you eat

647
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,420
something rotten?

648
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,050
-Are you looking for a beating, punk?
-Feng!

649
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,440
Shan,

650
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,610
he insulted me.

651
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
Don't cause trouble.

652
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,930
Boy,

653
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,720
what do you do?

654
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,680
What I do

655
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,130
is none of your concern.

656
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,010
Here's some advice:

657
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,110
when you speak to someone,

658
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,350
think twice

659
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,530
before acting like you're top dog.

660
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,590
Exactly.

661
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,590
That's not smart.

662
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,810
You'll easily get taken advantage of.

663
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,520
In this world,

664
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,080
the most important thing is knowing your place.

665
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,760
Sometimes,

666
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,310
bowing down to someone

667
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,370
isn't shameful.

668
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,620
Keep daydreaming.

669
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,720
Shan.

670
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,990
What kind of attitude is that?

671
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,450
I'll... I'll beat them up.

672
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,030
Coward.

673
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,000
Master,

674
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,110
those two girls aren't at the inn.

675
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,340
Where could they have gone?

676
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,750
Maybe they didn't see us return

677
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,480
and went to search on their own.

678
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,030
Those two young girls

679
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,850
are completely defenseless.

680
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,050
Will they be alright?

681
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,550
The Underground City has been

682
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,440
cleaned up a lot over the years.

683
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,100
It's not as chaotic as before.

684
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,690
However,

685
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,120
we need to find them as soon as possible.

686
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,720
Master,

687
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,200
are you really going to help her find her parents?

688
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,370
I've taken her money, so I must do the job.

689
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,850
Without her pass token,

690
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,580
we couldn't have entered the Underground City.

691
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,990
I saw it those days.

692
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,680
They were very close to that boy

693
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,070
from the Eight Pillar Sect.

694
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,730
Yet they lied to us, saying they didn't know him.

695
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,630
Disciple,

696
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,590
in the end, we have the same goal.

697
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,560
It was just a misunderstanding.

698
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,450
Don't hold a grudge over it.

699
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,740
I want nothing to do with people

700
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,940
who can't even tell demons from humans.

701
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,350
Run! Run!

702
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,550
Watch out!

703
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
You can't escape.

704
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,310
A demon?

705
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,710
Yes.

706
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,720
Xuanye was right after all.

707
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,270
There are demons in the Underground City.

708
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,330
We ran into one soon after we came out.

709
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,320
But he didn't

710
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,830
seem like a bad person.

711
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,880
He even helped us stop the thief

712
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,480
and get the money pouch back.

713
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,170
Demons can be good or bad.

714
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,300
Think about Chi Xue. He's good.

715
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,430
So what are you afraid of?

716
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,440
Yeah…

717
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,440
what am I even afraid of?

718
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,810
My Lady, be careful!

719
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,130
Are you alright?

720
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,440
It's that idiot who bumped into us.

721
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,540
There's another one with them.

722
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,140
Ignore them.

723
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,830
There's a fight up ahead.

724
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,620
Hurry, hurry!

725
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,160
Wait for me!

726
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,560
There's a fight going on.

727
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,200
There's a fight.

728
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,980
A fight has broken out.

729
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,560
Miss Duan,

730
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,740
do you know him?

731
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,160
Then why did he save you?

732
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,490
And why did you help him?

733
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,820
What about you?

734
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,970
Why did you try to hurt him?

735
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,240
You said you can tell a demon when you see one.

736
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,970
Then you should know what he is.

737
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,090
Has he done anything evil?

738
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,860
A demon is a demon.

739
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,580
What's wrong with being a demon?

740
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,380
Just being a demon doesn't mean he deserves to die.

741
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,520
Ignorant woman.

742
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,920
You've actually sided with a demon!

743
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:38,960
Tell me!

744
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,110
Do you know him?

745
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,830
Where did he run off to?

746
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,240
Disciple.

747
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,030
I don't know!

748
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,880
Tell me!

749
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,610
Physician Jiu.

750
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,550
You again.

751
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,070
Do you want to die?

752
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,680
You people from the Eight Pillar Sect

753
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,540
have lived up to your reputation,

754
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,080
twisting right and wrong

755
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,740
and treating humans and demons the same.

756
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,750
I dare you to say it again.

757
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
We will meet again.

758
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,710
Disciple.

759
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,040
Let's go.

760
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,600
You two wait outside.

761
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,500
You come in with me.

762
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,600
Why did you

763
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,510
come to the Underground City alone?

764
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,440
I didn't come alone.

765
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,639
There were four of us.

766
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,630
You mean

767
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,199
those two just now?

768
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,550
There were some misunderstandings between them and me.

769
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,750
Misunderstandings?

770
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,510
It's my business anyway.

771
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,310
I don't want to explain it to you.

772
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,820
For you…

773
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,630
for you,

774
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,090
I broke my promise to my fa…

775
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,030
What do you take me for?

776
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,240
I've been running around for you

777
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,070
and doing everything I can

778
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,730
to help you find your parents.

779
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,550
What?

780
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,970
You're not even across the river yet,

781
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,170
and you're already burning the bridge?

782
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,150
You found someone more capable than me,

783
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,750
is that it?

784
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,630
I just don't get it.

785
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,410
What did I do wrong?

786
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,120
What did I do

787
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,320
to upset you, My Lady?

788
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,250
Say something.

789
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,840
Why are you being so harsh?

790
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,510
This is

791
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,610
my own business.

792
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,590
Do I have to report to you

793
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,480
wherever I go?

794
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,910
What are we to each other?

795
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,030
So I was just being nosy.

796
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,510
I overstepped.

797
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,460
You have nothing to do with me,

798
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,390
and I have no right to interfere.

799
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,440
I'll leave.

800
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,690
From now on,

801
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,330
I won't help you again.

802
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,440
Why are you grabbing me?

803
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,630
Let go.

804
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,960
You're hurt?

805
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,810
Are you still leaving?

806
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,990
I'll leave after checking your wound.

807
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,470
Sit down.

808
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,840
Stop crying.

809
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,260
You're the one being unreasonable.

810
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,760
How am I being unreasonable?

811
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,970
Your father told you

812
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,320
not to come to the Underground City.

813
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,490
Yet you insisted on coming.

814
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,320
How old are you?

815
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,920
Why didn't you listen to him?

816
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,440
Don't you know why?

817
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,060
The Underground City is very dangerous.

818
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,230
Both you and I

819
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,090
need to be careful.

820
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,110
Got it?

821
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,350
You're telling me to be careful?

822
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,660
You nearly

823
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,810
got into a fight on the street just now.

824
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,660
I was trying to protect you.

825
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,340
It was just a little shove,

826
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,120
that's all.

827
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,810
He was just trying to scare me,

828
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,210
but you drew your sword.

829
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,620
What exactly

830
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,680
happened just now?

831
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,920
Why did those two guys

832
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
try to attack you?

833
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,160
They were trying to hunt that man down.

834
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,630
But he saved me once before.

835
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,760
Moreover,

836
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,710
to help me,

837
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,280
he was chased down.

838
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,960
So I knocked over the wooden barrel

839
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,610
to help him escape.

840
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,150
A man?

841
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,960
A demon.

842
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,260
Why would you help a demon?

843
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,450
What's wrong with that?

844
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,760
Demons' lives matter too.

845
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,030
Besides, he helped me.

846
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,240
Alright.

847
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,070
Make sure to keep the wound dry.

848
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,870
You've been searching for two days now.

849
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,880
Any progress?

850
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,480
What?

851
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,610
The Enlightenment Bookstore.

852
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,360
Then starting tomorrow,

853
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,200
I'll help you look for it.

854
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,530
You…

855
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,790
Wait a moment.

856
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,760
From now on,

857
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,600
no matter what happens,

858
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,780
we'll talk it through first

859
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,080
and then make decisions together.

860
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,800
Got it?

861
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,590
Coming.

862
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,430
What's the matter?

863
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,370
I didn't knock.

864
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,150
He did.

865
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,820
Jiu,

866
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,900
we meet again.

867
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,260
My master wants to see you.

868
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,480
A man suffering from a terminal illness

869
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,190
traveled all the way to the Underground City,

870
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,670
consulted a famous physician,

871
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,630
lost hope,

872
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,270
and disappeared without a trace.

873
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,040
How do you explain that?

874
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,530
There's no explaining it.

875
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,710
So you think

876
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,070
he simply took his own life?

877
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,930
Or maybe he died from the illness.

878
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,400
Either way, he's dead,

879
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,110
nowhere to be found.

880
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,440
It makes perfect sense.

881
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,250
I don't think it adds up.

882
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,500
Think about it.

883
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
Lord Xin'an had a big household.

884
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,560
He had four sons

885
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,590
and six daughters,

886
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,650
the youngest only four years old now.

887
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,110
His wife had no children,

888
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,110
but all his concubines

889
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,270
could bear heirs.

890
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,320
In a household like that,

891
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,260
do you think

892
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,590
life could be peaceful?

893
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,030
Definitely not.

894
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,780
After Lord Xin'an disappeared,

895
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,710
his household fell into chaos.

896
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,110
His sons don't get along,

897
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,000
and things are getting worse

898
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,030
day by day.

899
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,470
Lord Xin'an was proud

900
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,840
and cared deeply about his reputation.

901
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,800
For a man like him,

902
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,860
when he knew he had only 100 days left,

903
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,900
would he really hide away

904
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,150
in some unknown place

905
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,210
and end his own life

906
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,560
without going back to make arrangements?

907
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,100
What are you implying?

908
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,930
I think something happened to him.

909
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,470
Whether he's dead or alive,

910
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,480
we need to find out what that something was

911
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,400
and whether someone was behind it.

912
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Then we can report to His Majesty

913
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,090
and the Court of Judicial Review.

914
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,190
So you really are here to look for Lord Xin'an.

915
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,250
What did you think?

916
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,660
That I came here just for you?

917
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
I never said that.

918
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,920
Alright, let's go.

919
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,050
We've lost the lead,

920
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:08,940
and there's still

921
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,250
a lot we need to do.

922
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,160
Here, take this.

923
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,880
What for?

924
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,370
A dagger coated in insect oil.

925
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,870
What can it do?

926
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,800
It was given to me

927
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,070
by a demon hunter friend of mine.

928
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,130
It can kill demons.

929
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,840
The Underground City is a mixed bag.

930
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,110
You never know when a demon might appear.

931
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,710
Better safe than sorry.

932
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,600
I'll just be generous

933
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,400
and give you the insect oil too.

934
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,110
Are you worried about me?

935
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,360
I'm afraid you'll slow me down.

936
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,280
It may be the other way around.

937
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,400
This way, please.

938
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,540
Please.

939
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,150
Chi Xue!

940
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,710
Not bad, Xuanye.

941
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:30,050
[Shen Tunan, owner of Xiaodongtian]

942
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,070
As someone from the Eight Pillar Sect,

943
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,530
you really are something.

944
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,480
Who are you?

945
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,230
Why did you...

946
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,920
Why did I

947
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,360
make a replica of your Hidden Dragon Case?

948
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,550
Let me introduce myself.

949
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,870
I'm Shen Tunan, owner of Xiaodongtian.

950
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,120
Or if you prefer,

951
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,570
you may call me…

952
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,150
Uncle Master.
