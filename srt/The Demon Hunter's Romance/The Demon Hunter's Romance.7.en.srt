3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Good, you're here.

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,050
Where did you take my dad?

5
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,950
You've got some nerve.

6
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,730
I'm not afraid of you at all!

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,310
Is that so?

8
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,190
It's a trap again!

9
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,630
Impressive.

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,750
Take Tingzhou out.

11
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,730
No worries.

12
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,750
We're fully prepared.

13
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,520
There's no way he's getting away this time.

14
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,390
He's really here?

15
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Let me see

16
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
who he is!

17
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,230
I'm here to help you!

[Heal and Help]

19
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,710
There's no big deal.

20
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,030
Take some medicine, and you'll be fine.

21
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,660
I'll prescribe it for you.

22
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,670
Thank you, Physician Jiu.

23
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,390
My Lady.

24
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,670
Actually, I heard you call me

25
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,570
last night.

26
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,960
But I don't know why.

27
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,210
I could hear,

28
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,480
but I just couldn't open my eyes

29
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,680
or move a bit.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,310
You were bewitched by a demonic spell.

31
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,640
I seriously injured that demon.

32
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,519
It'll take him a while to recover.

33
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,480
Just in case,

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,430
the government should warn everyone in the city

35
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,280
not to play the game

36
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,540
of pear-genie summoning anymore.

37
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,430
Well...

38
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,790
If we issue such a notice as you said,

39
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
what are the people going to think

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,620
of our government office?

41
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,800
Then just buy

42
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,900
all the pears.

43
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,190
Well...

44
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,630
Wait, Xuanye...

45
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,870
Banxia,

46
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,190
come with me.

47
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,150
What are you doing?

48
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,560
What's wrong with you?

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,310
I'm fine.

50
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,380
You look like you're going to faint.

51
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,860
What are you going to do?

52
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,160
Xuanye...

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,120
Banxia,

54
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,270
come here.

55
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,000
Hey, you...

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,520
What's wrong with you?

57
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,120
Xuan...

58
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,600
What's this?

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,300
That Mirror Demon is still alive.

60
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,070
He might come again.

61
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,390
If you run into danger,

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,520
you must wake me up.

63
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
If you can't wake me,

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,909
just stab me with this.

65
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,190
Why should I stab you?

66
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,210
Did you

67
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
catch what I just said?

68
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Yes.

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,630
But what's happening?

70
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,190
I'm feeling too drowsy.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,940
I want to sleep.

72
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,160
What did the two of them go to do?

73
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,990
To sleep.

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,800
Sleep?

75
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,890
I don't think

76
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,860
this is appropriate.

77
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,360
Xuanye used the Mountain-shaking Sword.

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,150
Wait,

79
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,300
what does the Mountain-shaking Sword

80
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,620
have to do with sleeping?

81
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,940
Every sword he uses

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,330
takes a different toll on him.

83
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,640
Dubhe makes him gluttonous;

84
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,510
Mountain-shaking makes him sleepy.

85
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,370
But he still can't

86
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,159
drag My Lady into it.

87
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,630
This demon is hard to deal with.

88
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
Except Xuanye,

89
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,780
who else can protect

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,550
your lady?

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,080
Youhuang,

92
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,090
where are you going?

93
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,409
Youhuang!

94
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,430
I'm talking to you!

95
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,480
You ignore me every time I call you!

96
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,460
Youhuang!

97
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,690
Wait for me!

98
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,360
Um,

99
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,310
what should we do now?

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
What do you mean?

101
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,160
There's a demon around.

102
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm too scared to go back home alone.

103
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,620
You can go find an inn.

104
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,070
Xuanye.

105
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,100
Xuanye.

106
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm so thirsty.

107
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,270
I want to have some water.

108
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,680
A cultivator? Seriously?

109
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,180
Don't you even know men and women should keep a proper distance?

110
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,360
I'm engaged, okay?

111
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,240
If they call off the engagement,

112
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,120
will you marry me instead?

113
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,470
Oh...

114
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,900
Jeez, seriously?

115
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,130
Well,

116
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,150
um...

117
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,470
And down here...

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,590
Sir,

119
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,540
what are you doing?

120
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,980
We didn't do anything illegal.

121
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,430
Why are you confiscating our pears?

122
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,910
Consider it as the government buying them from you.

123
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,540
You can go ask the government for money.

124
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,950
Well...

125
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,120
Sir,

126
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,120
I also have

127
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
some pears to sell at home.

128
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,480
Does the government need more?

129
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

130
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,130
Send them all to the government office

131
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,910
with none left!

132
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,570
Yes, sir. I'll fetch them right away.

133
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,130
Are you alright?

134
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,430
That demon hunter's power is overwhelming.

135
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,070
I'm no match for him.

136
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,180
We can't stay here any longer.

137
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,480
Go pack up.

138
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,750
We'll leave the city tonight.

139
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,020
You're so badly injured.

140
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,360
Where can we be

141
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,300
if not here?

142
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,440
You stay here for rehabilitation.

143
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,430
Let's make long-term plans

144
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,950
after you recover, okay?

145
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,360
How are things going out there?

146
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,240
Everything's fine.

147
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,560
What's wrong?

148
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,150
Nothing.

149
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,640
I thought you wouldn't come tonight.

150
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,810
I was held up by the dance troupe.

151
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,180
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

152
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm willing to wait for my wife

153
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,910
no matter how long it takes.

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,370
Despite a few

155
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,770
twists and turns about our marriage,

156
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,000
my father

157
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,980
finally gave his consent to it.

158
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,230
He also said

159
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,590
he would give us a shop as a gift.

160
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,910
But the condition is that

161
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,950
we can neither invite our friends

162
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,180
nor hold a grand wedding at home.

163
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
I understand his concerns.

164
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,920
And I'm actually

165
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,470
quite tempted by that shop.

166
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,680
But after careful consideration,

167
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,840
I still said no.

168
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,110
Because I promised you

169
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,440
I will give you a proper and official wedding ceremony.

170
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,110
I also want everyone in the city

171
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,130
to know that

172
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,990
you will marry me,

173
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,860
and that you're the most beautiful woman in the world.

174
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,070
I don't want a grand wedding ceremony.

175
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,890
Let's leave this place together.

176
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,490
Let's go to a place

177
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,940
where no one knows us.

178
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,440
I have some savings.

179
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,560
I can keep you company when you study

180
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,040
and cook for you.

181
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,530
As long as I can be with you,

182
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,160
even if

183
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
it's just one year,

184
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,610
I'll have no regrets in my life.

185
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,300
You don't want to?

186
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,920
I do.

187
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,470
Having you is the best thing

188
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,350
I could ask for.

189
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,870
Who are you?

190
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,680
What do you want?

191
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,440
Don't you really want to

192
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,520
be with her?

193
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,690
Then I'll let you stay with her forever!

194
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,520
Li.

195
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:52,980
What are you busy with?

196
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,080
Nothing.

197
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,520
The mirror's face-down.

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,400
Why did you still come?

199
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,830
Didn't we agree that

200
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,090
when the mirror is flipped over,

201
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,560
that means I'm not available?

202
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,870
Is it necessary

203
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,040
between you and me?

204
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,200
Or

205
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,110
is there a secret

206
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,230
you don't want me to know?

207
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,350
Nope.

208
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,380
Just some women's issues.

209
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,710
What brings you here?

210
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm here to send you a pear.

211
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,040
I've washed it.

212
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,200
Take it.

213
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,870
Didn't you promise me

214
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,950
you wouldn't kill people

215
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,990
for pears again before the right time?

216
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
That being said,

217
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,690
he made a wish.

218
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,740
I had to grant it.

219
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,560
I don't want to eat.

220
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,710
Li,

221
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,130
be good.

222
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,830
Don't infuriate me.

223
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,030
Good girl.

224
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,990
Why doesn't this pear have a fishy smell?

225
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,760
I almost forgot.

226
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,630
I couldn't help but kill him

227
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,530
as soon as he ate it.

228
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,250
I was supposed to wait seven days,

229
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,160
but I really couldn't help it.

230
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,200
When I saw his face,

231
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,650
I couldn't wait

232
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,820
to wipe him out immediately.

233
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,200
You mortals always say,

234
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,990
"What you eat makes who you are." Right?

235
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,720
The owner of this pear

236
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,890
is a scholar.

237
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
I guess

238
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,520
this pear

239
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,600
boasts some scholarly properties.

240
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,350
Eat it,

241
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,950
and you'll understand

242
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,630
the meaning of "loyalty"

243
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,319
and "fidelity."

244
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,350
Banxia.

245
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,080
You're awake.

246
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,520
Tingzhou and Chi Xue

247
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,460
went to buy groceries for me.

248
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,700
You must be hungry.

249
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,590
I've made some porridge.

250
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,390
Why did you leave?

251
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,930
Didn't I tell you

252
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,150
to stick around me?

253
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,670
But I didn't leave the Ganshan Clinic,

254
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,760
nor did I go out.

255
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
You slept for three whole days.

256
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,550
We've been tied together the whole time.

257
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,910
I needed to eat, drink,

258
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,430
wash up, and use the bathroom, right?

259
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,100
My bad. I forgot that.

260
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,620
I know you were worried about my safety.

261
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,810
But to protect me,

262
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,560
there's actually a simpler method.

263
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,910
What is it?

264
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,150
Draw another mark on me.

265
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,600
That monster hasn't been caught yet.

266
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,430
I'm afraid...

267
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,290
Done.

268
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,480
Xuanye.

269
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,400
I saw a scar on your chest.

270
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,660
When did you get that?

271
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,040
I saw it by accident.

272
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,140
It's a big scar.

273
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,760
Quite scary.

274
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,080
So when did you

275
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,590
get hurt?

276
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,910
I don't remember.

277
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,760
You don't remember?

278
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,480
That was a deep wound

279
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,080
so close to your heart.

280
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,520
You almost died.

281
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,670
How could you not remember?

282
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,870
I don't remember anything

283
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,390
from my childhood.

284
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,480
What are you looking at?

285
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,000
Do you want some more?

286
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,800
Xuanye,

287
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
can I

288
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,640
go get changed later?

289
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,110
It's been three days.

290
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,240
It's going to stink.

291
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,390
After I finish it

292
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,390
I'll escort you back.

293
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,190
Okay.

294
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,910
Chief.

295
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,630
Chief!

296
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,870
A weird case again!

297
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,960
What happened?

298
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,700
Another murder occurred.

299
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,670
The victim, Zhou Jingyuan,

300
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,530
24 years old,

301
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,550
a local in Guangping,

302
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,840
was found dead

303
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,390
this morning.

304
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,400
His case is quite similar to Tian Rui's.

305
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,910
But he didn't turn into a dried corpse

306
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,000
Didn't turn into a dried corpse?

307
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,190
He just aged a bit.

308
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,270
Didn't turn into a dried corpse?

309
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,560
Are you Chief Constable Chu?

310
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,430
Yes, it's me.

311
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,350
Get up and talk.

312
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,170
Are you the one who reported the case?

313
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,870
Yes.

314
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,960
Sir,

315
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I'm just a merchant.

316
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,230
I know little about

317
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,920
autopsies and how to crack cases.

318
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,050
But I've never seen anything

319
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,830
spookier than this

320
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,870
in my whole life.

321
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,000
May I see the body?

322
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,590
Please go ahead, sir.

323
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,970
My son...

324
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,430
My son!

325
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,150
How could you leave me,

326
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,040
your mother like this?

327
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,110
My son...

328
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,770
My son!

329
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,030
Son, what happened to you?

330
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,150
My son...

331
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,760
Auntie! Auntie!

332
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,280

Hurry!

336
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,530
Go get a doctor!

337
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,430
Auntie...

338
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,190
Cuiying!

339
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,300
Come on, take her back to her room.

340
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,280
Cuiying...

341
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,080
Chief,

342
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,450

Why did you call me so loudly? Almost startled me.

371
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,810
I've already been here for a while.

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,160
Ms. Ji Li?

385
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,620
Hello, Miss Duan.

386
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,660
What a coincidence.

387
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,850
What brings you here?

388
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,840
Our dance troupe's invaded by rats.

389
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,080
I came to buy a rat killer.

390
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,910
You even sell that?

391
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,390
Miss Duan,

392
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,410
I have something to attend to. So I'll take my leave.

393
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,560
Chi Xue.

394
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,840
What did that woman just buy?

395
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,870
Rat killer.

396
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,110
Anything else?

397
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,460
And a bottle of insect oil.

398
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,610
What's insect oil?

399
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,280
You have something to do with it?

400
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,540
Another person died on North Street this morning.

401
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,640
The victim was

402
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,520
a young scholar.

403
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,320
After his sudden death,

404
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,430
he turned into a middle-aged man.

405
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,240
That woman you saw just now

406
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,390
was there mourning the deceased.

407
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,390
I guess they knew each other.

408
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,110
But I can't help feeling that

409
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,710
this whole thing is kind of fishy.

410
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,430
Insect oil is used to ward off evil things.

411
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,790
When applied to a sharp weapon,

412
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,480
it can cause damage to a demon's spiritual body.

413
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,190
If it hits a vital spot,

414
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,560
it can certainly be fatal.

415
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,800
Now it all makes sense.

416
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,530
That woman

417
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,770
must know the whereabouts of the demon.

418
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,390
Where is she?

419
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,560
She once said

420
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,000
they were from the Yunmen Dance Troupe.

421
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,490
Yunmen Dance Troupe?

422
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,280
The one who died at Yanlai Restaurant last time,

423
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
the dancer named Tian Rui,

424
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,890
was also one of the Yunmen Dance Troupe.

425
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,210
Let's go find her.

426
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
Didn't the previous victims

427
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,470
all age abnormally when they died?

428
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,560
Why did the victim

429
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,630
turn middle-aged this time?

430
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,680
Didn't Physician Jiu mention that

431
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,210
it'd take seven full days

432
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,930
for a jade pear

433
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,350
to fully absorb the life force

434
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,760
of the host eating the pear?

435
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,800
I guess this time, that demon took out the pear

436
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,570
before the time was up.

437
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,520
Am I right, Physician Jiu?

438
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,000
Maybe.

439
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,910
Then why would he do this?

440
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,780
Guess he messed up the timing.

441
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,450
Messed up the timing

442
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,830
of things like this? Really?

443
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,620
Well, demons

444
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,010
are all about murdering humans

445
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,760
and are quite dumb.

446
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,390
What's so surprising about that?

447
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,070
Could that be the truth?

448
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,870
Or maybe he just couldn't wait

449
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,630
to kill that man on the spot.

450
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,430
Chief Constable Chu.

451
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,240
Banxia?

452
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,050
What brings you here?

453
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,350
We're here to find Ms. Ji Li.

454
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,460
She's left.

455
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,560
What? Where did she go?

456
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,400
She bid farewell to the Manager yesterday,

457
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,740
saying she'd be heading south.

458
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,350
And she's already left the Dance Troupe.

459
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,910
How long has it been

460
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,040
since we last sat down

461
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,140
and had a proper meal together like this?

462
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,220
Whenever you visited,

463
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,670
you made me eat those jade pears

464
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,150
with a fishy smell

465
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,430
and an awful taste.

466
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,110
As time went by,

467
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,140
I'd recall that fishiness

468
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,520
at the sight of you every time.

469
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,490
That's why I keep quarreling with you.

470
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,630
Thinking about it now,

471
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,310
I really shouldn't have acted this way.

472
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,290
Today on the street,

473
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,000
I ran into a woman in her sixties,

474
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,630
gray-haired

475
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,910
and wrinkled.

476
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,910
Just one look

477
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,390
and it was terrifying.

478
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,180
A woman's youth

479
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,550
is rather fleeting.

480
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,930
Only about one or two decades.

481
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,000
Just like a flower,

482
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
before you can even appreciate it,

483
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
it withers.

484
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,070
What a pity.

485
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,700
But luckily,

486
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:43,760
I have you.

487
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,630
You love me, spoil me,

488
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,420
and make jade pears for me,

489
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,910
helping me stay young for 20 years.

490
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,350
This is something

491
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,890
countless people dream of.

492
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,910
Yet I was ungrateful,

493
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
quarreling with you,

494
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,070
saying things that hurt you,

495
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,350
and doing things you hated.

496
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,670
Thinking about it now,

497
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,960
I was really rebellious.

498
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,830
I never blame you.

499
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,030
Really?

500
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,670
Really.

501
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,520
Chuan,

502
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,240
thank you.

503
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,560
Li,

504
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,630
don't cry.

505
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,790
Let bygones

506
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,460
be bygones.

507
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,660
As long as we can

508
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,870
stay together forever,

509
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,180
nothing else matters.

510
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,070
I've made up my mind.

511
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,520
When we leave this place

512
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,000
and reach Jiangnan,

513
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,000
let's find a nice place with mountains

514
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,670
and water.

515
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,930
I don't want to be in the public eye anymore.

516
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,950
I just want to be with you,

517
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,190
do the washing and cooking,

518
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,350
play music and dance,

519
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,000
and never see anyone else again.

520
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,030
How does that sound?

521
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,910
I've been looking forward to that kind of life

522
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,830
for years.

523
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,260
I've also been looking forward to that kind of life

524
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,280
for a long time.

525
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,430
Do you have to do this?

526
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,910
How many times has this happened?

527
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,760
Do you really want me dead?

528
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,590
I've been so good to you,

529
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,190
yet you betrayed me

530
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,080
and had an affair with someone else.

531
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,340
I don't even blame you!

532
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,670
You've really disappointed me.

533
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,250
Sirs and madam, are you here to book some rooms?

534
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,960
We're here on official business.

535
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,139
Yes, sir.

536
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,639
Have you seen a girl

537
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,230
around 17 or 18,

538
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,199
slender in build,

539
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,360
with deep-set eyes?

540
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,590
She should have come alone.

541
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,440
No.

542
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,960
Please try to recall again.

543
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,750
She's very fair-skinned, thin,

544
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,050
and pretty.

545
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,590
It really doesn't ring a bell.

546
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,520
Sir,

547
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,719
I think I've seen

548
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,480
the person you described.

549
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,699
Where is she?

550
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,050
Upstairs, in the second room from the left.

551
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,880
That girl looks

552
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,159
like she stepped out of a painting.

553
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,929
Her waist is very slim.

554
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,420
I heard from some other guests that

555
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,080
he's a dancer from Yunmen Dance Troupe.

556
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,150
What kind of place is this?

557
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,040
Are you playing tricks again?

558
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,570
Yeah,

559
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,590
I forgot that

560
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,840
you don't remember anything.

561
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,960
Let me help you recall it.

562
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,570
Back then,

563
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,750
you were sold to the mansion as a dancer.

564
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,300
At first, you led

565
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,270
a pretty good life.

566
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,840
But as time went by,

567
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,170
you grew older,

568
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,070
losing your youthful charm

569
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,480
and favor.

570
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,700
Even the servants in the mansion

571
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,300
could bully you at will

572
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,010
and treat you like a toy.

573
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,690
You were resentful.

574
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,230
Day and night, you made wishes in front of the mirror,

575
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,440
hoping to regain your youth.

576
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,900
I

577
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,480
heard your voice

578
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,980
and came to you

579
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,970
to fulfill your wish.

580
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,630
Not only did you regain your beauty,

581
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,070
but I also helped you take revenge

582
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,940
by killing those who once hurt you.

583
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,440
You're talking nonsense!

584
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,300
I'm talking nonsense?

585
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,980
Mirrors

586
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,210
actually reflect

587
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,170
human hearts.

588
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,270
Greed

589
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,520
comes at a price.

590
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,000
Look at your face.

591
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,630
So young,

592
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,890
so radiant.

593
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,950
How gorgeous.

594
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,080
It's taken numerous human lives

595
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,750
to maintain such a beautiful face.

596
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,490
Over these years,

597
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,490
how many people have you killed?

598
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,210
That bookworm,

599
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,190
if he knew that

600
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,690
your beauty

601
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,750
is backed by so much bloodshed,

602
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,620
would he still love you?

603
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,110
Would he?

604
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,780
Would he really?

605
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,870
I didn't do that!

606
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,690
You didn't?

607
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,510
What do you mean?

608
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,560
Didn't kill with your own hands?

609
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,730
Or didn't harm any lives?

610
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,850
Don't tell me

611
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
you have no idea how this pear

612
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,590
is made.

613
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:04,610
Li,

614
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,290
come on...

615
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,400
That's too hypocritical.

616
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,440
I tried to kill myself.

617
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,920
I once tried to kill myself.

618
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:16,850
Right!

619
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,920
I attempted that!

620
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,030
You didn't allow it.

621
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,440
You stopped me!

622
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,140
If you really wanted to die,

623
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,300
could I have kept an eye on you day and night?

624
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,440
The path

625
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,420
is yours to walk on your own.

626
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,280
Is it so hard to admit that

627
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,620
you're a cruel,

628
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,510
cold-blooded creature?

629
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,620
You're truly a devil.

630
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,820
It was you.

631
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,440
You deceived me.

632
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,670
You beguiled me into eating the pears,

633
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,000
saying they'd keep me young

634
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,730
and alive forever!

635
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,080
You deceived me,

636
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,810
turning me into

637
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,310
a monster like you!

638
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,200
Li,

639
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,740
people

640
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,010
can't have everything they ask for.

641
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,460
I just want to leave you.

642
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,590
What did you say?

643
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,400
I don't know why

644
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,040
I met you.

645
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,550
You must have bewitched me.

646
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,360
I never want to eat those

647
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,440
stinking, fishy pears again.

648
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,560
I only want to stay with the person

649
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,190
I love!

650
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,900
Dream on!

651
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,560
Having drained people's blood

652
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,740
and reaped all the benefits,

653
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,440
you still dream about

654
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,560
living a normal life?

655
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,480
I'd rather die

656
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,850
than live with you.

657
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,150
They called you a flirt,

658
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,150
obsessed with seducing men,

659
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,360
born with no shame.

660
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,590
I don't believe it.

661
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,590
I don't!

662
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,560
I love you deeply.

663
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,590
Have you forgotten that?

664
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
You're a demon!

665
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,750
You're not human.

666
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,960
Do you know what love is?

667
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,290
Do you understand it at all?

668
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,440
Every moment

669
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,380
with you,

670
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,670
I hate myself.

671
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,660
This isn't love at all.

672
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,820
You don't deserve to talk about love!

673
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,870
I don't deserve that?

674
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,270
You're my one and only love

675
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,530
in my whole life!

676
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,030
What? I don't deserve it?

677
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,000
Do you think you deserve it?

678
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,900
No!

679
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,250
I've destroyed myself with my own hands.

680
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,440
I hate you.

681
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,340
And I hate myself even more.

682
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,360
They were right.

683
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,380
I am a flirt

684
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,190
obsessed with seducing men,

685
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,670
born with no shame.

686
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,670
I can be

687
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,110
with anyone.

688
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,050
Literally anyone!

689
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,190
Except you.

690
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,260
I'd rather age and die

691
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,630
than be with you!

692
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,630
Don't talk like that!

693
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,790
I knew it.

694
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,210
You think

695
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,900
after all these years,

696
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
this is really the first time

697
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,310
you've fallen in love with someone?

698
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,750
You think we've only been together

699
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,220
for twenty years?

700
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,980
What do you mean by that?

701
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,820
It'll be okay.

702
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,430
Don't be afraid.

703
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,630
After today,

704
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,360
we can be back to how we used to be.

705
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,080
Don't touch me!
