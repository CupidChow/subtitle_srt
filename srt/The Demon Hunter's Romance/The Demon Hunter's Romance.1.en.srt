Behind you?

199

Youhuang is following you again?

200

He's haunting me like a ghost.

201

It's raining. My lady, hurry!

202

I'll get an umbrella.

You're back.

I'm going back to my room.

206
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,300
Father, where did you go just now?

207
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
I was handling some matters.

208
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,030
You've been going out a lot lately.

209
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,540
Did something happen?

210
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,180
Nothing important.

211
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,330
We haven't

212

Banxia,

217
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,210
I know

218
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,060
you are not satisfied with this marriage.

219
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,750
But a girl must get married

220
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,870
when she grows up.

221
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,630
I'm familiar

222
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,750
with Li Xian.

223
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,870
He is indeed a gentle and polite person.

224
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,280
You can rely on him.

225
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,420
If you marry him,

226
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,150
you won't be mistreated.

227
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,660
Your mother

228
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,990
should be the one helping you with these matters.

229
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,900
What a pity.

230
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,180
Our family

231
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,350

232
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,270
In the future,

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,480
it will be your dowry.

a new pouch for you.

241
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,530
My daughter's embroidery is not bad.

242
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,470
Not bad?

243
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,540
Even Tingzhou said

244
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,350
I should just buy you a new one.

245
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,510

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,670
Everyone is dismissed.

389
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,780
Yes.

390
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,300
Did you see how

391
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,080
that thief got in when you were outside

392
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,990
last night?

393
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,230
It was dark last night.

394
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,160
I was too afraid.

395
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,580
I saw nothing.

396
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,430
Yanqiu,

397
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,910
that man said Sister-in-law is a demon.

398
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,780
Nonsense!

399
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,750
He was spouting nonsense,

400
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,430
but now,

401
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,860
you're adding to the trouble too.

402
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,270
Did you forget to take your medicine?

403
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,540
I'm not the one who said it.

404
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,300
Recently,

405
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,620
there have been many murders in the city.

406
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,990
I'm searching for the murderer.

407
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,140
Maybe the thief is the mastermind.

408
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,510
He must have received some news,

409
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,030
so he came to provoke us.

410
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,190
But don't be afraid.

411
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,780
I've dispatched men

412
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,430
from the government

413
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,310
to guard our home.

414
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,910
No matter how skilled he is,

415
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,140
he won't be able to break in.

416
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,620
You didn't sleep well

417
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
due to the commotion last night.

418
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,620
Go back and rest.

419
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,230
Okay.

420
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,270
Wait.

421
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,760
The banquet was in the front yard last night.

422
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,710
Why were you in my courtyard,

423
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,490
instead of eating?

424
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,690
I was late for the ceremony.

425
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,510
I couldn't see my sister-in-law clearly,

426
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,060
so I wanted to visit her.

427
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,340
Your sister-in-law was frightened last night.

428
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,780
Don't disturb her now.

429
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,670
You'll have opportunities to meet in the future.

430
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,820
Yes.

431
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,860
This is a flying fish.

432
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,300
It's gentle

433
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,540
and can be seen everywhere,

434
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,540
but its spiritual power is weak.

435
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,780
In order to survive,

436
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,860
it must hide its form at all times.

437
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,230
Ordinary people can't see it,

438
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,030
but you can,

439
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,070
right?

440
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,680
I can't see.

441
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,740
Then why are you running?

442
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,060
Clearly, you can see it,

443
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,900
but you lie to yourself that you can't.

444
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,320
Do you think you can escape

445
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,230
just by avoiding it?

446
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,370
That's all fake.

447
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,230
You know clearly if it's fake or not.

448
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,950
I know

449
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,750
you're scared,

450
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,340
but don't worry.

451
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:00,990
I'm a demon hunter.

452
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,300
As long as I'm here,

453
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,820
no demon can hurt you.

454
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,640
Just bravely tell your family

455
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,110
what you saw.

456
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,750
Understand?

457
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,540
Fine.

458
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,910
Go to your cousin now

459
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,540
and tell him the whole story.

460
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,670
Lead him here to see me.

461
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,910
By the way...

462
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,540
If you're able to,

463
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,440
can you

464
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,370
bring me some food?

465
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,710
Like cakes, warm noodles,

466
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,790
and steamed buns. Anything is fine.

467
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,990
Thank you.

468
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,910
Help!

469
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,620
Help!

470
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,540
Help!

471
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,510
The thief is here!

472
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,990
My lady,

473
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,950
what's wrong?

474
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,860
Hurry.

475
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,340
The thief from last night

476
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,990
is in my room.

477
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,240
Hurry!

478
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:15,950
Go!

479
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,270
What happened?

480
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,670
Where did he go?

481
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,620
Ms. Duan,

482
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,950
when Physician Sun comes back,

483
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,200
I will notify you.

484
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,660
Don't you still have the calming fragrance?

485
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,030
You can sniff it

486
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,870
when your illness returns.

487
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,950
I guarantee your vision will be clear

488
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,810
and your heart will be calm.

489
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,430
Take care.

490
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,540
Thank you.

491
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,860
Great!

492
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,430
Stop running.

493
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,470
I just want to make things clear.

494
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,540
I won't hurt you.

495
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,300
You...

496
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,710
Just listen to him.

497
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,910
Don't be afraid.

498
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,910
Why did she run away?

499
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,030
Who told you to come here?

500
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,470
I came to help you.

501
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,020
Second Lady.

502
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,860
Second Lady.

503
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,780
What's wrong with Second Lady?

504
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,770
I don't know.

505
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,980
My lady.

506
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,230
My lady.

507
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,950
Young Master sent a box

508
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,330
of desserts from Liupinju over.

509
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,380
They're still warm.

510
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,860
What's wrong?

511
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,100
You don’t look well.

512
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,190
Young Master is so nice to you.

513
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,910
He still remembers

514
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,340
you like the desserts here.

515
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,830
Tingzhou?

516
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,440
Have you heard of

517
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,580
how my brother and sister-in-law

518
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,030
met each other?

519
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,670
Of course.

520
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,450
I wouldn't dare to tell you

521
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,540
if you didn't ask me.

522
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,160
Xiang told me

523
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,540
three months ago,

524
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,780
a ventriloquist

525
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,280
came to the city.

526
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,470
She was very talented.

527
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,230
It is said that

528
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,840
she could imitate anyone,

529
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,140
no matter the age, gender, or species.

530
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,100
She had delicate lips and voice.

531
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,710
If you listened with your eyes closed,

532
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,860
it would sound so real.

533
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,140
Bravo!

534
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,270
Lord Duan.

535
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,140
Lord Duan.

536
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,060
Great! Great!

537
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,670
Awesome!

538
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,430
Bravo.

539
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,380
Listen.

540
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,750
This is really enjoyable.

541
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,620
Young Master also went to listen.

542
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,190
He ended up

543
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,430
becoming mesmerized.

544
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,580
Great!

545
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
I'll take you to the market today.

546
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,470
Grandpa, I want to buy something delicious and fun.

547
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,950
The market

548
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,100
has everything.

549
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,910
If you see anything fun,

550
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,300
I'll buy it all for you.

551
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,130
Sounds so alike.

552
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,580
Great!

553
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,820
[Flowery Snow]

554
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,540
She's here.

555
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,710
She's so pretty.

556
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,230
That's right. It's a woman.

557
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,620
Tell me.

558
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,540
How could

559
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,580
the household agree

560
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,270
to him marrying a performer

561
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,340
who hasn't even been on a proper stage?

562
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,230
It's such a joke!

563
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,340
But Young Master didn’t listen.

564
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,230
He even said

565
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,510
he would only marry her.

566
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,470
In the end,

567
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,430
he made a big fuss at home.

568
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,470
You know what happened later.

569
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,790
Young Master is an official now.

570
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,690
The Elder Master can’t control him

571
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,620
and Elder Madam dotes on him.

572
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,380
He can do whatever he wants,

573
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,780
He finally succeeded in the end.

574
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,030
I wonder what happened

575
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
on the wedding night.

576
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,430
Anyway,

577
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,060
Young Master said

578
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,580
the new madam was frightened.

579
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,370
Now, she can't even leave her room.

580
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,300
She hasn't even greeted

581
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,990
the two madams yet.

582
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,780
She hasn't served the bride's tea either.

583
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,950
How can everyone be happy with this?

584
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,190
Actually,

585
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,330
everyone can see that

586
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,080
the new madam is not a simple person,

587
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,100
but Young Master

588
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,330
protects her

589
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,340
like he's lost his mind.

590
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,670
I wonder what kind of spell he's under.

591
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,030
Second Lady, please wait a moment.

592
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,320
Greetings, Sister-in-law.

593
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,250
We are family now.

594
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,580
No need to be so courteous.

595
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,219
Are you here to see me?

596
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,500
A thief broke into our home

597
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,860
and scared you.

598
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,699
I came to see how you are doing.

599
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,659
Thank you.

600
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,239
I'm okay.

601
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,429
I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

602
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,139
Don't be shy.

603
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,610
Let's sit and talk.

604
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,179
I haven't been out for the past few days,

605
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,540
so I didn't prepare any snacks at home.

606
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,870
I only have some flower cakes from Liupinju.

607
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,150
I hope you don't mind.

608
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,540
Sister-in-law, no need.

609
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,270
Please sit down and rest.

610
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,870
I have a headache these days.

611
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,310
I couldn't visit Grandmother

612
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,350
as according to customs.

613
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,659
You are not feeling well.

614
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,870
I don't think

615
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,660
Grandmother would blame you.

616
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,140
Since I came to this household,

617
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,700
only you

618
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,540
came to see me.

619
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,280
Unlike you,

620
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,760
I don't have a father or brother to protect me.

621
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,870
I grew up wandering around the world,

622
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,860
performing for a living.

623
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,790
Luckily, I met Qiu.

624
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,950
He didn't mind my lowly background

625
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,510
and insisted on marrying me as his wife.

626
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,740
You might laugh at me,

627
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,430
but even now,

628
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,910
I still can't believe

629
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,950
that all of this is real.

630
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,990
When I wake up,

631
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,540
I forget where I am.

632
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,740
It's like a dream.

633
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,070
I know everyone dislikes me

634
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,830
and think I've bewitched Qiu.

635
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,950
I won't deny it.

636
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,950
I couldn't dissuade him

637
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,430
or my heart

638
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,140
and became greedy.

639
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,960
That's why there are conflicts in your family.

640
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,540
But Banxia...

641
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,100
I truly like him.

642
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,860
I want to be with him forever.

643
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,220
Do you believe me?

644
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,310
Yes.

645
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,540
I do.

646
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,950
You're so nice.

647
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,180
In this house,

648
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,790
you're the best person to me,

649
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,030
other than Qiu.

650
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,540
That day at the main hall,

651
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,680
I only glanced at you

652
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
through the veil,

653
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,010
and I thought you were

654
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,350
someone I could have heart-to-heart talks with.

655
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,180
Unfortunately,

656
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,510
you're only

657
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,220
staying here temporarily.

658
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,580
Otherwise,

659
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,030
we can be together forever.

660
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,700
You're so beautiful.

661
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,140
Your skin is so fair

662
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,030
and you have a nice voice.

663
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,870
I heard that you're already engaged to someone.

664
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,620
I wonder which family

665
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,990
is so lucky to have you.

666
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,100
Sister-in-law,

667
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,540
I suddenly feel

668
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,430
I might have caught a cold.

669
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,370
I want to go back and rest.

670
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,030
It's rare for you to visit.

671
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,540
Sister-in-law,

672
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,660
I'm going back to rest.

673
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,970
Amazing.

674
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,750
Wow.

675
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,870
Awesome!

676
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,890
Bravo! Bravo!

677
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,260
Rabbit guy!

678
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,470
Rabbit guy!

679
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,740
Rabbit guy!

680
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,420
Are you looking for me?

681
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,680
Who exactly are you?

682
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,910
Didn't I tell you before?

683
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,310
I'm just a demon hunter.

684
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,910
Do demons really exist?

685
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,470
Since you're looking for me,

686
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,260
you must have made up your mind.

687
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,660
Demons are the spirits created from the world

688
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,510
and born from the void.

689
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,180
They exist between illusion and reality.

690
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,660
They can be hazy

691
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,060
or have a tangible shape.

692
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,220
The largest ones

693
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,630
can hover in the universe,

694
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,620
swallowing stars and moon.

695
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,080
The smallest ones

696
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,350
are like stones and pebbles,

697
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,620
nameless.

698
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,990
Humans and demons are from two worlds,

699
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,350
but

700
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,790
we can coexist.

701
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,790
However, some demons

702
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,830
are delusional

703
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,290
and want to intervene in the human world.

704
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,580
Other demons

705
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,620
would sacrifice their cultivation

706
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,790
just to harm people.

707
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,140
This kind of demon

708
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,260
must be eliminated.

709
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,790
What about my eyes?

710
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,260
Most demons

711
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,660
are proficient in

712
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,490
disguise and invisibility.

713
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,430
As long as they don't show up voluntarily,

714
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,390
ordinary people can't see them.

715
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,740
But not only can you

716
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,700
see through their disguise,

717
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,700
you can even

718
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,850
see through their invisibility.

719
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,180
This talent

720
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,470
is one in a million.

721
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,470
What? You don't like it?

722
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,430
Calming fragrance?

723
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,970
It's harmful.

724
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,220
This thing

725
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,580
can temporarily

726
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,350
cover your divine consciousness

727
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,790
so you're unable to see those things.

728
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,030
However, smelling it too much is bad for your brain.

729
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,990
Is what you just said

730
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
all true?

731
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,030
If you didn't believe me,

732
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,270
you wouldn't have come to me.

733
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,510
I believe there are demons in the world.

734
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,870
But how do I know

735
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,740
if you really are a demon hunter?

736
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,910
You came to Nanyang City

737
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,600
to attend

738
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,870
your brother's wedding?

739
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,220
What a coincidence.

740
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
There is a wedding

741
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,140
in this place today.

742
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,670
Look.

743
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,740
They're here.

744
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,470
Who's here?

745
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,470
You used the calming fragrance?

746
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,180
That thing

747
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,510
will only weaken your five senses

748
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,680
and ruin

749
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,660
your rare vision.

750
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,540
How about this?

751
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,990
This is a rare opportunity.

752
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,470
I’ll use hypostasis water

753
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,740
to help you see again.

754
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,920
No thanks.

755
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,030
I...

756
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,390
It will sting.

757
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:24,620
Hang in there.

758
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,190
What is this?

759
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,740
Now take a look

760
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,920
and see if you can see it.

761
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,310
It's okay.

762
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,600
Don't be scared.
