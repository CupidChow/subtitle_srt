4
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,400
After we are done, let's go

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,530
pick up our clothes.

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,870
Let's wait a little longer.

7
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,270
I'm waiting for someone.

8
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,240
Physician Jiu, you were looking for me?

9
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,120
Could you please

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,850
deliver this

11
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,610
to Lord Guan's residence

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,760
at Huaijiang Alley in Shendu City?

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,420
Shendu City, Huaijiang Alley, Lord Guan.

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,090
Got it. Rest assured.

15
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,070
I'll make sure it's delivered.

16
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,200
Thank you very much.

17
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,390
Who is Lord Guan?

18
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,610
When I was in Shendu City on business years ago,

19
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,980
I happened to run into Lord Guan

20
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,280
who was being harassed by a demon.

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,329
I helped him out,

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,840
and that's how we got acquainted.

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,100
So this time, you're writing to him to...

24
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,710
To expose Xingxian.

25
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,880
The one who brought Xingxian into the capital this time

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,750
is the Vice Minister of Rites,

27
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,120
a subordinate of Qin Xuanzhi.

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,370
And this Lord Guan

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,000
has a very good relationship with Qin Xuanzhi.

30
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,380
Why are you exposing Xingxian?

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,880
Shouldn't I?

32
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,500
No... I just feel that...

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You think that because I'm a demon hunter,

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,860
I might be biased towards humans?

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,310
Everyone

36
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,860
must face the consequences

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,870
of their actions.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,590
We can't let good people suffer bad outcomes,

39
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,030
nor can we let evil people reap good rewards.

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,310
Demons must not hurt humans,

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,150
but humans should also not bully demons.

42
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,080
To achieve peaceful coexistence,

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,480
it must not be a one-sided expectation.

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,510
You're right.

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,210
Let's go.

46
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,150
Okay.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Xuanye.

48
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,590
Have you resolved that trouble that was

49
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,450
bothering you?

50
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,990
What trouble?

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,560
It was when you suddenly

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
seemed like a different person,

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,280
and then you told me to tell you

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,750
that you would definitely come back to find yourself.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,170
That has been resolved.

56
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,190
So...

57
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
was it another demon?

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
Don't worry about it.

59
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,240
I wasn't worried at all.

60
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,240
Why didn't Chi Xue come along

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
to enjoy something

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,460
as delightful as dessert?

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,690
He might be packing his things.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,910
Packing up?

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,800
He's leaving.

[A Land of Beauty and Blessing]

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
What's wrong?

68
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,700
Where... where is he going?

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
He thinks I haven't been treating him well lately,

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,410
so he's running away from home.

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,610
Isn't that just causing trouble?

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,880
And you agreed to him?

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,589
That's just how he is.

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,870
Sometimes when he's in the mood,

75
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,670
he'll go out and play for a while.

76
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,950
But isn't it dangerous for him to be running around

77
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,070
all by himself?

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
He's a demon,

79
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,560
not a child.

80
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,510
Yes,

81
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,270
but what if he accidentally encounters

82
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,630
other demon hunters?

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
That demon hunter surnamed Jiang last time

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,659
almost caught him, didn't he?

85
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,440
You don't want him to leave, do you?

86
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,510
At Eight Pillar Sect,

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,190
while we may have our demon-controlling techniques,

88
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,560
neither my father nor I have used them on

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Chi Xue.

90
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,000
Chi Xue was raised by my father since he was young.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,460
We all treat him as family.

92
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,970
So whether he stays or leaves,

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
we are all respectful of his choice.

94
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,350
Moreover,

95
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,750
he is a demon.

96
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,190
He will leave me sooner or later.

97
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,590
Why does he have to leave?

98
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,920
Why can't humans and demons

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,830
stay together?

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
You said it yourself

101
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,920
that we can coexist peacefully.

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,950
What I mean is,

103
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,970
can't good friends like you and Chi Xue

104
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,500
continue to stay together?

105
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,800
Even friends don't need to

106
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
be together all the time.

107
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,040
Everyone has their own path.

108
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,570
Forcing us to stay together

109
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,570
may cause trouble instead.

110
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,920
Alright,

I knew you would

117
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,420
come to pick them up today.

118
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
They were just finished last night.

119

Please go in and try them on.

I'll alter it for you right away.

Thank you for your hard work.

123
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,480
I'll go in and try on the clothes.

124
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,440

are all new arrivals.

130

If you find anything you like,

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
why not tailor something for yourself too?

Get up quickly.

148
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,640
It was a demon.

149

A big demon!

It was a very powerful demon beast.

152
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,360
It had immense strength.

153
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,890
It knocked me unconscious.

What about Xuanye?

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,940
I don't know.

was very brief,

what it would be like

174
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,020
if you weren't a demon hunter,

175
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,310
but a demon instead?

176
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,750
What are you talking about?

177
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,680
Have you heard of

the Carefree Land?

179
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,480
It is a wondrous and ethereal land

beyond the mortal realm.

181
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,240
I don't want to stay here

183
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
I'm not interested in telling stories either.

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,220
But as a demon hunter,

185
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,840
aren't you curious about where all the demons in the world

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,720
come from?

187
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,730
Carefree Land

188
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,950
is the mystical origin

of the primordial spirit

190
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
of countless demons.

the Carefree Grass releases the primordial spirit within the realm.

193
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,720
At that time, the secret realm opens,

194
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,270
connecting the human and demon worlds,

195
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,720
so that the primordial spirit can be dispersed

196
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,780
and live on its own.

197
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,720
Regardless of birds, beasts,

198
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,250
or even ancient artifacts,

199
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,010
once it catches hold of the primordial spirit,

200
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,630
its consciousness will be awakened

201
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,890
and it becomes a demon.

202
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,550
This is the origins of

203
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,890
the demon clan.

204
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,330
Such a secret realm

205
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,870
cannot be left unguarded.

206
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,030
That’s why the strongest of the demon clan,

207
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,240
the Mystic Panther Clan, has been safeguarding it for generations.

208
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,840
And the Supreme Master of the Mystic Panther Clan

209
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,720
is my father,

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,000
Yue Yan.

211
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,150
And you

212
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,580
are also my father's son,

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,440
my half-brother.

214
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,590
Your name is Man Ying.

215
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,580
You're saying I'm a demon?

216
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,470
That's right.

217
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,510
Twelve years ago,

218
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,360
to save a little girl,

219
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,670
you violated the rules of our clan

220
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,070
and have since been lost in the human world.

221
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,150
Now, as the Carefree Land

222
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,410
is about to open again,

223
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,000
I've come to the human world to look for you in advance.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,060
I am precisely here to bring you back.

225
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,790
Actually, before I came,

226
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,390
I thought about many things.

227
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
I thought about how you might refuse

228
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,180
or be unwilling to return.

229
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,870
I even thought about how you might have

230
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,730
your own valid reasons and logic.

231
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,670
But I never imagined

232
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,870
it would be like this.

233
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,720
You've actually lost your memory.

234
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,510
You had even forgotten about your supreme mission

235
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,510
and responsibilities completely.

236
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,120
How ridiculous.

237
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,200
Listen to me carefully.

238
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,270
I

239
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,890
was born in Guangping.

240
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,320
I have my own parents.

241
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
I am a demon hunter from the Ganshan Clinic,

242
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,830
and the successor of the Eight Pillar Sect.

243
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,490
I am not some

244
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,600
panther demon you've been talking about.

245
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
As a member of the demon clan,

246
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,500
not only did you become a demon hunter,

247
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,200
but you had even accepted incompetent mortals

248
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,130
as your parents.

249
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,410
Well, well.

250
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,460
How wonderful.

251
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,270
Should I praise you for that?

252
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,240
I won't allow you

253
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,590
to insult my parents.

254
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,750
Parents?

255
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,130
It seems nothing I say will make a difference.

256
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,730
You won't believe me anyway.

257
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
I won't fight you.

258
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,090
The way you are now,

259
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
even if I forcibly take you back,

260
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,870
it would be meaningless.

261
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,600
But you can't fool

262
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,060
yourself for much longer.

263
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,960
You should be able to feel it.

264
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,800
And I'm also curious about something.

265
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,330
If your family and friends

266
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
knew you were a demon,

267
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
how would they react?

268
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,990
Would they still

269
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,670
accept you

270
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,960
and trust you as before?

271
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,360
I recently learned a saying

272
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,460
in the human world

273
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,550
that makes a lot of sense.

274
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,630
It says, "Those who are not of our kind

275
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,000
cannot be trusted."

276
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,080
Cherish your time as a human.

277
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,460
I'll come back for you.

278
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,030
Banxia?

279
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,070
What brings you here?

280
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,470
Xuanye has disappeared.

281
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,590
What do you mean by disappeared?

282
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,440
We had agreed to go

283
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,100
to the market together today.

284
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
But I just went to Ganshan Clinic,

285
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,370
and he wasn't there.

286
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,840
How is that considered disappearing?

287
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,270
Not being at home

288
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,870
may just mean he had gone out.

289
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Taverns, teahouses,

290
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,750
the theaters and dance troupes.

291
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,550
Have you searched these places?

292
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,080
No,

293
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,600
it's mainly because Chi Xue said

294
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,510
a demon beast had entered

295
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,040
Ganshan Clinic yesterday.

296
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,430
A demon beast?

297
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,790
What kind of demon beast?

298
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,050
Why are you here again?

299
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,870
I'm here to see Lord Geng.

300
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,730
Do I need to notify you in advance?

301
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,570
Go on,

302
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,660
what kind of demon beast?

303
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,190
Chi Xue didn't give details.

304
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,510
He just said... it was a beast,

305
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,760
and that it was very strong.

306
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,950
How is Chi Xue now?

307
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,320
He's fine.

308
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,200
It seems that demon beast

309
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,930
only knocked him unconscious.

310
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,590
So you're saying

311
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,960
Chi Xue didn't see Xuanye

312
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,400
fight that demon beast?

313
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,470
No, he didn't.

314
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,940
Then you must be overthinking it.

315
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,310
Xuanye is someone who can come and go

316
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,120
as he pleases at the Underground City.

317
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,780
He shouldn't be in any danger.

318
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:27,960
He must have

319
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,560
gone after that demon beast.

320
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,860
There's no harm waiting a little longer.

321
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,600
How about...

322
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,610
You go home and wait first?

323
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,080
Alright.

324
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,190
I'll be going then.

325
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,480
If there's any news,

326
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I'll let you know.

327
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,870
Don't worry too much.

328
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,160
Xuanye!

329
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,589
Where did you go?

330
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,550
I've been looking for you for ages.

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,599
I didn't go anywhere.

332
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,829
Chi Xue said a demon beast got into the house.

333
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,890
Did you go after it?

334
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,079
Demon beast?

335
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,680
Yes.

336
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,960
He said that demon beast was very powerful.

337
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
It knocked him out in one hit.

338
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,280
You weren't home last night?

339
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,720
Let me go ask Chi Xue first.

340
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,250
-I’ll go with you.
-No need.

341
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,850
You go home first.

342
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,510
I'll go ask him first.

343
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,900
Xuanye!

344
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,680
You're back.

345
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,500
Chi Xue.

346
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,610
Banxia said last night,

347
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,890
a demon beast came into our house.

348
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,370
Is that true?

349
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,480
What kind of demon beast was it?

350
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,390
It...

351
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,570
was very fast

352
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,930
and very strong.

353
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:12,960
Before I could react,

354
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,270
I was already knocked out.

355
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,870
I didn't get a good look at it.

356
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,510
You didn't see it?

357
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,560
I thought you went after it.

358
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,720
Xuanye.

359
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,310
I won't leave just yet.

360
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,460
That demon beast is not easy to deal with.

361
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,660
I'll stay to help you.

362
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,470
Okay.

363
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,360
Have you ever thought

364
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,070
what it would be like

365
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,350
if you weren't a demon hunter

366
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,640
but a demon instead?

367
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,920
These are Moon Bugs.

368
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,350
They feed on primordial spirit and moonlight.

369
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,550
Some clever deception

370
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,170
can fool people,

371
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,170
but they can't fool Moon Bugs.

372
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,080
That's why

373
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,770
they have another name.

374
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,790
They are also known as the eyes of demon hunters.

375
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,410
So are there any other ways

376
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,240
one can deceive these Moon Bugs?

377
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,250
Very few.

378
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,800
These... these are all cut out?

379
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,400
Such skillful hands!

380
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,190
Of course, it can't be chewed out, right?

381
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,880
You should learn from them, Commissioner.

382
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,030
Those are real girls' hands.

383
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,690
Unlike you,

384
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,830
who only knows how to fight and kill.

385
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,480
Banxia,

386
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,300
what are you cutting?

387
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,280
Let me see.

388
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,240
It's obvious.

389
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,190
It's me.

390
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,010
This...

391
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,970
This is clearly a cat, isn't it?

392
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,500
Did... did you cut out a cat?

393
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,180
That looks like a tiger to me.

394
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,160
I think...

395
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,290
that looks like a panther.

396
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,610
Oh, right.

397
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,720
Where's Xuanye?

398
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,690
He went out.

399
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,210
Where did he go?

400
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,750
I don't know.

401
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,350
I haven't seen him since early this morning.

402
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,880
On such an important day...

403
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,590
Why did Xuanye go out at a time like this?

404
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,270
Exactly.

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,530
You've got such a big mouth.

406
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,310
So much nonsense.

407
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,350
Nothing to do at the government office,

408
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,680
so they let you gossip here?

409
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,210
I'm just making small talk.

410
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,140
Xuanye.

411
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,970
Where have you been?

412
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,090
I went out to take care of something.

413
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,070
Xuanye.

414
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,630
Were you out to catch a demon?

415
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,490
Was it the one Chi Xue mentioned

416
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,550
that broke into your house two nights ago?

417
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,550
That demon beast?

418
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,520
Yes, indeed.

419
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,000
Any leads?

420
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,480
Not yet.

421
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,370
Don't worry.

422
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,680
Lord Geng is already aware of this matter.

423
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,160
I've also notified the hunters outside the city.

424
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,830
Once they spot any trace of that demon beast,

425
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,120
they'll report to the government office immediately.

426
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,040
That's a demon.

427
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,000
What's the use of finding hunters?

428
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,570
So what if it's a demon?

429
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,590
It can't even transform into human form.

430
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,540
That means it's not as powerful as Chi Xue.

431
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,860
Why can't hunters handle it?

432
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,980
It's not as powerful as Chi Xue?

433
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,830
It knocked Chi Xue out in one hit.

434
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,880
That only proves it has brute strength.

435
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,110
You have brute strength too, don't you?

436
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,970
Can you beat me?

437
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,700
Right, Xuanye?

438
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,920
Xuanye.

439
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,130
Did you really go to catch that demon?

440
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,950
Yes, I did.

441
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,660
Chi Xue said that demon is very powerful.

442
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,120
Do you want to

443
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,160
ask for more help?

444
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,000
It's fine.

445
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,920
No need.

446
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,510
Xuanye.

447
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,180
Tomorrow, the two of us

448
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,510
are going to be engaged.

449
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,260
You'll be a man with a family from then on.

450
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,480
So no matter what you do,

451
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,870
you can't be as reckless

452
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,680
as you were before.

453
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,510
Do you hear me?

454
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,070
I understand.

455
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,110
You look so tired.

456
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,570
Why don't you lie down and rest for a while?

457
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,950
Alright.

458
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,030
The Supreme Master of the Mystic Panther Clan

459
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,960
is my father,

460
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,110
Yue Yan.

461
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,270
And you

462
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,110
are also my father's son,

463
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,830
my half-brother,

464
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,890
named Man Ying.

465
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,210
You're saying I'm a demon?

466
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,390
That's right.

467
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,270
Xuanye!

468
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,720
Xuanye!

469
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,600
Xuanye!

470
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,750
Xuanye, are you okay?

471
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,240
Xuanye!

472
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,660
Xuanye!

473
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,310
Xuanye!

474
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,400
Xuanye!

475
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,250
Have you seen Xuan...

476
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,390
P-Panther...

477
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,670
It's a panther!

478
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,560
Panther! It's a panther!

479
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,020
Have you heard?

480
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,070
There was another demon sighting last night.

481
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,590
Really?

482
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,270
Someone saw it with their own eyes.

483
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,000
They said it was a black panther demon.

484
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,130
There really are demons in this world.

485
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,120
Of course there are.

486
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,920
My brother-in-law is a clerk at the government office.

487
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,720
I heard from him

488
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,250
that Lord Geng has started capturing demons.

489
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,460
My Lady.

490
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,790
We are just paying taxes today.

491
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,170
You don't even need to be personally there.

492
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,970
Why are you dolling yourself up?

493
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
Why else do you think I'm getting all

494
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,300
dressed up?

495
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,060
Physician Jiu is coming?

496
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,700
We received the letter

497
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,120
and rushed to Guangping.

498
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I didn’t expect to

499
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,220
run into yet another happy occasion.

500
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,950
Yingheng,

501
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,960
this is what they call surviving a great ordeal and

502
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,420
being blessed with good fortune afterward.

503
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,310
Father couldn't believe it at first.

504
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,250
He kept confirming on the way here

505
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,400
if it was really your handwritten letter, Uncle Yingheng.

506
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,130
This matter,

507
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,950
indeed, is too bizarre.

508
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,400
If we hadn't experienced it ourselves,

509
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,360
no matter who said it,

510
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,820
we wouldn't have dared to believe it easily.

511
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,310
You know,

512
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,480
that girl Banxia,

513
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,200
who usually looks so delicate and fragile,

514
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,060
I never thought

515
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,430
she would be so brave.

516
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
That's all thanks to Physician Jiu.

517
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,510
Otherwise, with her abilities alone,

518
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,510
how could she have fought against a demon?

519
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,790
Still calling him Physician Jiu?

520
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,650
He's already our son-in-law now.

521
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,200
Yanqiu.

522
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,360
Uncle Yingheng.

523
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,750
I heard from Banxia

524
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,490
that you're also acquainted with Xuanye.

525
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,790
Yes,

526
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,440
he saved me previously.

527
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,770
He's a reliable person.

528
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,310
Banxia's making the right choice

529
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,240
by marrying him.

530
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,240
Tingzhou.

531
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,510
Is it time yet?

532
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,380
It should be time already.

533
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,070
I'll go check.

534
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,310
Don't worry.

535
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,750
In his household,

536
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,880
there are no elders,

537
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,860
so it's understandable if things are a bit chaotic.

538
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:00,960
Yes.

539
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,430
Uncle.

540
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
Banxia, why are you here?

541
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,280
Hasn't Xuanye arrived yet?

542
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,230
Yanqiu has already gone to look for him.

543
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:12,950
I'll go too.

544
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,480
Banxia.

545
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,510
Banxia!

546
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,200
-Xuanye!
-Xuanye!

547
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,830
Chi Xue!

548
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Xuanye!

549
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,610
Open the door!

550
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,940
What time is it already?

551
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,310
Yanqiu.

552
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,810
Banxia.

553
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,750
When did you get here?

554
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,880
We just got here too.

555
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,380
There was a demon causing trouble around here yesterday.

556
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,440
What kind of demon?

557
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,500
They say it was a black panther demon.

558
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,530
Kick the door open.

559
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,550
-Xuanye!
-Xuanye!

560
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,070
Xuanye!

561
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,830
-Xuanye!
-Xuanye!

562
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,860
Let's split up.

563
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,800
Search every corner.

564
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,330
Alright.

565
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,350
Xuanye!

566
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,720
Did you find him?

567
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,110
No.

568
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,880
My Lady.

569
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,400
The back door is open.

570
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,070
Then let's go outside.

571
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,530
Let's split up and search.

572
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,530
Scented sachets, pouches and little trinkets for sale!

573
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,350
Chief Constable Chu.

574
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,640
Have you found Xuanye?

575
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,450
Xuanye might be in trouble.

576
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,330
I've confirmed it.

577
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,440
Last night, a few more people

578
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,640
saw that demon beast.

579
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,310
He and Chi Xue

580
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,000
might have gone to exorcise the demon.

581
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
What kind of demon beast?

582
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,030
They say it's

583
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,010
a black panther demon.

584
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,270
My Lady.

585
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,170
Banxia.

586
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,480
What's wrong?

587
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,880
Banxia.

588
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,860
Do you know something?

589
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,210
Have you seen that demon beast?

590
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,310
Banxia.

591
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,510
Banxia.

592
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,650
Don't worry.

593
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,320
Xuanye is a capable person.

594
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,830
Even if that demon beast is powerful,

595
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,170
it surely can't do anything to him.

596
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,960
Chief Constable Wen and your brother

597
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,070
have already left the city.

598
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,800
We'll continue searching too.

599
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,280
Why don't

600
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,130
you go home first

601
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,400
and wait for our news?

602
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,060
My Lady.

603
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,280
Tingzhou.

604
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,320
My Lady.

605
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
My Lady, let's go.

606
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,520
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

607
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,810
What's strange?

608
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,960
When I was in Shendu previously,

609
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,160
I encountered a demon

610
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,120
that was related to Xuanye.

611
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,370
Why haven't I heard you mention this before?

612
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,530
Would you have listened if I had told you?

613
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,220
Why are you bleeding?

614
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,880
How... how did this happen?

615
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,410
Xuanye might be in trouble.

616
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,220
I've confirmed it.

617
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,350
Several people last night

618
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,720
saw that demon beast again.

619
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,750
He and Chi Xue might have gone to exorcise the demon.

620
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,750
What demon beast?

621
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,790
They say it's

622
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,980
a black panther demon.

623
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,640
Who?

624
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,940
My Lady.

625
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,050
Tingzhou, who did you see?

626
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,070
I just saw a figure

627
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,550
standing over there.

628
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,960
Xuanye?

629
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,230
It must be Xuanye.

630
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,280
Xuanye!

631
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,710
Xuanye!

632
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,340
Xuanye, come out!

633
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,219
Xuanye!

634
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,010
Banxia!

635
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,790
Banxia!

636
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,949
What's wrong?

637
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,889
Mother,

638
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,219
Tingzhou saw Xuanye.

639
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,920
I'm not certain either.

640
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
I just saw...

641
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,580
a figure standing over there.

642
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,460
-Banxia!
-My Lady!

643
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,360
Xuanye!

644
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,710
Xuanye!

645
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,020
Xuanye!

646
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,110
Xuanye!

647
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,590
Xuanye!

648
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,440
Xuanye, stop joking around!

649
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,370
Come out now!

650
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,150
Come out right now!

651
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,170
I'm really going to get angry!

652
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,330
I will really get angry.

653
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,530
♫Melody echoes along the river; wild geese soar in sudden fright♫

654
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,700
♫The music ends, and I stand in solitude♫

655
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,570
♫I see you turn into a handful of starlight♫

656
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,880
♫Drifting past me♫

657
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,130
♫In tears, the past memories still glow♫

658
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,630
♫Crystallized into cold amber♫

659
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,380
♫I know it also brought you great pain to let go♫

660
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,030
I'm sorry.

661
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,780
♫But why did you♫

663
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,380
♫Still endure the pain and shatter♫

664
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,550
I'm really sorry.

665
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,210
♫Remember me, don't miss me♫

666
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,280
Actually...

667
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,990
♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

668
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,150
I already knew

669
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,260
a long, long time ago,

670
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,210
♫I hate that I failed♫

671
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,440
But...

672
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:36,550
♫To catch the glistening starlight♫

673
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,450
But I didn't know

674
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,510
how to tell you.

675
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,510
I was afraid you'd push me away.

676
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:41,130
♫We were meant to miss each other in this life♫

677
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:46,020
♫Only after missing did we learn how much love could hurt♫

678
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,400
Xuanye.

679
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,330
Xuanye, I...

680
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:52,970
♫To have loved you is to have truly lived♫

681
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,800
I hate myself

682
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,710
for not telling you earlier.

683
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,550
I really don't care.

684
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,320
I really...

685
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,960
I really don't care!

686
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,030
You...

687
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,200
I was wrong.

688
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,230
Can you come back?

689
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,410
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,070
It's all my fault.

691
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,920
I'm... I'm sorry.

692
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,920
I'm sorry.

693
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,650
My Lady!

694
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,340
Master!

695
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,030
I think I hear

696
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,030
Ms. Duan's voice.

697
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,030
Master, look!

698
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,290
Banxia!

699
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,800
My Lady!

700
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,230
I was wrong.

♫Remember me, don't miss me♫

Banxia.

♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

706
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,280

♫I hate that I failed♫

708
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,710

♫To catch the glistening starlight♫

710
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,080

Banxia.

715

Have a bowl of ginger tea to keep the cold away.

716
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,680
A letter from Xuanye.

717
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,090
Do you want to read it?

718
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,600
He says

719
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,140
your marriage has been annulled.

720
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,160
But he didn't give a reason.

721
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,230
Banxia,

722
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,410
do you know why?

723
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,380
It's fine if you don't want to say.

724
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,680
Although he's being fickle about this,

725
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,350
but after all,

726
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,360
he's our family's benefactor.

727
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,160
I don't want to

728
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,030
put too much blame on him either.

729
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,560
I never wanted

730
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,520
you to marry him.

731
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,680
He's a demon hunter,

732
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,510
dealing with demons every day.

733
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,710
It's very dangerous.

734
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,290
You're my only daughter.

735
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,480
Our family was separated for 11 years.

736
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,840
I don't want to see

737
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,100
you in danger again.

738
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,510
But all of you convinced me otherwise.

739
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,500
I just didn't expect...

740
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,790
Your mother's health

741
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,140
has almost recovered.

742
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:38,970
Banxia.

743
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,400
Let's go back to Nanyang

744
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,910
with Uncle together.

745
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,220
Don't you miss your Grandmother?

746
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,400
When she learned that

747
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,070
your mother and I were still alive,

748
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,610
she was so happy that she couldn't sleep

749
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,740
for several nights.

750
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,170
She's getting old.

751
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,160
We should go back to see her.

752
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,740
Some things...

753
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,440
if you can't figure them out right away,

754
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,770
just let them be for now.

755
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,620
When the time is right,

756
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,440
maybe a change will come.

757
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,770
He doesn't want to see you now.

758
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,870
There's no point in you

759
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,220
staying here anymore.

760
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,510
Banxia.

761
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,320
Later,

762
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,960
drink the ginger soup.

763
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,400
Xuanye!

764
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,500
I've finally found you.

765
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,030
Chi Xue.

766
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,960
Go away!

767
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,240
I won't leave.

768
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,880
How did you turn into a demon?

769
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,340
Xuanye!

770
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,110
Go!

771
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,530
I can't control

772
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,210
myself now.

773
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,480
Go away!

774
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,440
Xuanye!

775
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,440
Xuanye!

776
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,590
You were originally from the Mystic Panther Clan.
