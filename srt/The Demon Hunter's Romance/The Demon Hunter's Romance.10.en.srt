[Episode 10]

3
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,090
My Lady.

4
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,000
My Lady.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Do you think Physician Jiu

6
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,229
will be angry with us?

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,560
What do you think?

8
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,950
Then will he

9
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,400
refuse to help us save Master?

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,430
Didn't you say he's lazy

11
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,410
and doesn't really care about us

12
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,080
and that Master Kongtongzi

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
is the real expert?

14
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,240
I did think so before,

15
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,560
but after thinking about it,

16
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,400
we've never actually seen

17
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,730
Master Kongtongzi's skills.

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,240
But Physician Jiu

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,680
has proven he can truly fight demons.

20
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,290
We dropped a sure bet

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,470
without finding a better one.

22
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,070
Feels like a big loss, doesn't it?

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,270
Don't worry.

24
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,800
That sure bet isn't going anywhere.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,840
Almost done, right?

26
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,960
Take a look.

27
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,560
Look, look.

28
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,900
I just discovered this one.

29
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,840
How is it?

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,240
Thank you, Physician Jiu.

31
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,250
I'll be off now.

32
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,950
"A great physician who's kind-hearted and skilled."

33
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,630
Someone gave that to you?

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,630
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,130
I'm here to dye your hair.

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,710
No need.

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Why?

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,430
Didn't you ask someone else for help?

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,030
Why are you still trying to curry favor with me?

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,190
It was all a misunderstanding.

41
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,430
I went there

42
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,210
to expose that fraud.

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Did I ever tell you

44
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,560
that after my dad resigned from his post,

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
he took me away from Guangping,

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,800
and we moved to Yuanzhou?

47
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,280
In Yuanzhou,

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,710
I ran a wine shop.

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,930
At first, I sold pine flower wine

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,840
and amber wine,

51
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,370
but for a long time,

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,870
business stayed low.

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,750
After some digging, we found out

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Yuanzhou already had sellers

55
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,790
for those two kinds of wine,

56
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,590
but they ruined the reputation

57
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,030
of those two wines

58
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,500
by selling low-quality stuff for profit.

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,260
In the end,

60
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,180
my dad and I

61
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,540
had to sell other kinds of wine instead.

62
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,630
You get it now, don't you?

63
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,800
No matter how skilled you are,

64
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,260
you still can't stop

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
greedy peers from

66
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,910
ruining the industry's reputation.

67
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,560
You work so hard every day,

68
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,240
risking your life to catch demons,

69
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,050
but those frauds out there

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,750
are stepping on your name

71
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,600
to climb higher.

72
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,630
Aren't you mad?

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,030
It makes you mad?

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,310
Of course.

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,400
I'm mad.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,710
I'm your friend, after all.

77
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,230
So what did you do?

78
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,080
I went to investigate.

79
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,890
I figured once I spotted

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,240
his flaws,

81
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,240
I'd expose him.

82
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,540
Xuanye.

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,630
Xuanye.

84
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,159
It took me

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,370
four hours

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,360
to prepare these black beans.

87
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,070
If you don't use them, they'll go to waste.

88
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,310
Come. Sit down.

89
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,280
What are you doing?

90
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,920
Sit, sit.

91
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,910
My dad said

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,590
white hair makes people

93
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,950
look tired and worn out.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,630
What did Kongtongzi say?

95
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,190
He said…

96
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,350
something really bad is going to happen to me,

97
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,570
but if I use

98
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,830
his magic tool,

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
I'll be safe from harm

100
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,120
and danger.

101
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,190
You gave him money?

102
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,070
Just a small amount.

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,130
I already sent Chi Xue out

104
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,680
to track down that life-swapping demon.

105
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,560
Once I've

106
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,850
given my word,

107
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,790
I never go back on it.

108
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,000
I have my own way of doing things.

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,159
Since you've chosen me,

110
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,360
you have to trust me.

111
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,980
I do trust you.

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,090
Then wait patiently.

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,190
Don't rush.

114
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,670
And stop looking for help elsewhere.

115
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,390
U-Understood.

Xuanye.

163
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,960
What were you two doing?

164
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,110
Why were you lying on his lap?

165
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,000
I was dyeing Xuanye's hair.

166
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Dyeing his hair?

167
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,630
My Lady.

168
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,570
Physician Jiu is not angry anymore?

169
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,830
Physician Jiu is more reliable.

170
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,750
From now on, let's listen to him

171
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,000
and wait patiently for news.

172
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,600
No more fussing around.

173
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,840
Leave here!

174
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,320
Tingzhou.

175
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,400
Do you think

176
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,930
Xuanye

177
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,870
could be Manying?

178
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,910
What?

179
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,750
You don't remember Manying?

180
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,510
I do.

181
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,460
Wasn't that someone you saw in a dream?

182
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:29,770
Yes.

183
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,080
Back then, you all said I was sick,

184
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,870
that there couldn't be demons in this world,

185
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,550
and it was just a dream.

186
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
But now it's been proven

187
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,350
that there are demons in this world.

188
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,970
So is it possible

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,050
that what I said was real

190
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,200
and Manying was real too?

191
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,870
Alright, alright.

192
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,160
It was all real.

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,270
But even if that dream was real

194
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,670
and Manying was real,

195
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,640
how do you know

196
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,980
Physician Jiu is Manying?

197
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,650
Xuanye

198
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,630
has a wound this big

199
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,000
right over his left chest.

200
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,580
And it's a through-and-through wound,

201
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,090
exactly where Manying

202
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,200
was wounded back then.

203
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,930
My Lady.

204
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,840
You took off Physician Jiu's clothes?

205
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,110
That's not the point.

206
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
My... My Lady.

207
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,900
You're engaged.

208
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,700
How could you just

209
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,990
take off a strange man's clothes?

210
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
How is Xuanye

211
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,790
a strange man?

212
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,540
We're quite close.

213
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,460
But you still

214
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,040
shouldn't have taken off his clothes.

215
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,270
I didn't mean to.

216
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,430
My Lady.

217
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,360
I know you don't like

218
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
Young Master Li,

219
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,770
but this match was arranged by Master.

220
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,650
Before you properly

221
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,710
settle this matter,

222
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,440
even if you've fallen for someone else,

223
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,210
you can only keep it

224
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
quietly in your heart.

225
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,630
How could you take off his clothes?

226
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,440
I told you I didn't mean to.

227
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,360
You know exactly

228
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,390
whether you did or not.

229
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
Anyway, I'll keep an eye on you

230
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,080
on behalf of Master.

231
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,840
Who's the one giving orders here?

232
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,550
Who's the one giving orders here?

233
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,480
I'll keep an eye on you!

234
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,520
Just take your stuff and go.

235
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm leaving.

236
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,030
My Lady, stop dreaming.

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,870
Snap out of it.

238
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
Snap out of it.

239
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,630
Xuanye.

240
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
I've got news about the life-swapping demon.

241
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,880
Tell me about it.

242
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,870
There was a guy who rode his horse recklessly

243
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,050
and killed someone.

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,200
Lord Geng had him beheaded.

245
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,190
You know about this, right?

246
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,340
Yes, I do.

247
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
But word is,

248
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,260
he didn't die.

249
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,470
He didn't die?

250
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,240
That's right.

251
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,870
Someone saw him leaving the city,

252
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,240
and they seemed really sure.

253
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,480
The government office has already sent people

254
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,080
to track him down in secret.

255
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,550
Think about it.

256
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,840
How could an ordinary person

257
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,770
come back from the dead?

258
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,000
Perhaps,

259
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,270
just like Banxia's dad,

260
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,510
his life was swapped by the demon.

261
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,390
Right?

262
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,770
My Lady, something happened!

263
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,030
What happened? Why the panic?

264
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
That Master Kongtongzi

265
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,910
we met yesterday—

266
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,790
he's dead.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,910
Dead?

268
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,390
I passed by while buying groceries

269
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,630
and saw mourning banners at his house.

270
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,120
I asked around and found out that

271
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,030
he got up to pee last night, tripped,

272
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,550
and died just like that.

273
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,000
How strange!

274
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,270
He was wielding swords and spears yesterday,

275
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
looking like a seasoned fighter.

276
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,660
Yet he died from falling when going to pee at night.

277
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,440
Miss, what do you mean by "the bird doesn't fly?"

278
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,480
Isn't it right here?

279
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:26,930
What's the matter, Xuanye?

280
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,880
We're busy here.

281
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,570
I just need

282
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,390
to ask you something.

283
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,770
That reckless noble who rode a horse

284
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,120
and ran someone over in the street—

285
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,670
did he really come back to life?

286
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,650
You've heard about it too?

287
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,890
What do you mean?

288
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,170
A few days ago,

289
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,240
he was beheaded.

290
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,960
But these past few days,

291
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,150
there have been rumors that he's not dead.

292
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,240
We're not taking it seriously.

293
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
Only Youhuang is,

294
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,630
and he's out looking into it.

295
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
There's no smoke without fire.

296
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,320
Well...

297
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,200
could there really be

298
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,800
a way to bring the dead back?

299
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,960
Maybe it's not resurrection.

300
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,320
It's very possible that the one you beheaded

301
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,670
wasn't him at all.

302
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,080
That's impossible.

303
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,390
I verified his identity myself.

304
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,120
Alright,

305
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,150
go back for now.

306
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,900
If anything else comes up,

307
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,870
let me know right away.

308
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,200
The white crow.

309
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,480
When the white crow appears, someone dies.

310
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,610
The white crow…

311
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,480
Banxia.

312
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,750
Why are you in such a hurry?

313
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,440
Where are you going?

314
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,440
The white crow.

315
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,000
There's a white crow above your head.

316
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,260
Xuanye.

317
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,460
Did you find anything?

318
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,390
Banxia.

319
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
Is that crow…

320
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,960
Is Master Crow

321
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,320
still here?

322
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,520
No?

323
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,750
Xuanye,

324
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,500
am I really going to die?

325
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,420
I…

326
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,120
If Yama wants you dead at midnight…

327
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,990
Shut up!

328
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,360
Shut up! Shut up!

329
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,320
Stop fooling around.

330
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
You scared the crap out of me.

331
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,570
But I don't get it.

332
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,210
Why does someone die

333
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,270
every time the white crow appears?

334
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,900
That day in Chi Wangchuan's illusion,

335
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,520
he sent the white crow

336
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,320
to attack us.

337
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,880
I thought at the time

338
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,080
it was just some spell of his,

339
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,790
but I didn't expect

340
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,240
the white crow

341
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,440
to be his companion demon.

342
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,630
Well,

343
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,050
that doesn't make sense!

344
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,210
I've never had bad blood

345
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,000
with Master Chi Wangchuan.

346
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,670
If he's after anyone, it should be you.

347
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Why me?

348
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,050
The white crow is just a spiritual creature.

349
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,349
It doesn't have the power to kill people.

350
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,400
What do you mean?

351
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
I mean,

352
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
death is the cause,

353
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
and the white crow is the effect.

354
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,500
It's appeared because your days

355
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,430
are numbered.

356
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,589
It's not because of its appearance

357
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,829
that you will die.

358
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,680
So when the white crow appears,

359
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,550
it only signals death.

360
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,880
It doesn't bring death.

361
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,310
That's right.

362
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,110
But that still doesn't make sense!

363
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,770
Isn't this just like

364
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,590
her eyes that can

365
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,310
see demons?

366
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,790
That's a good thing!

367
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,550
What, did that Chi Wangchuan

368
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,990
think she's pretty,

369
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,730
like her,

370
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,060
and give her his companion demon?

371
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,880
You think being able to see death

372
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,110
is some kind of gift?

373
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,200
It's not?

374
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,680
It's a curse.

375
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,070
Then what should I do? I…

376
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,980
Don't worry too much.

377
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,640
The appearance of the white crow

378
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,750
doesn't mean you'll die right away.

379
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,710
How long do I have?

380
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,240
Probably five or six days.

381
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,460
Five or six days?

382
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,310
Then maybe two or three days?

383
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,110
Two or three days?

384
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,790
How about just one or two days?

385
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,180
One or two days?

386
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,890
Stop yelling!

387
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,060
I...

388
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,830
Xuanye.

389
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,160
Did you come up with something?

390
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,880
I knew you'd have a way!

391
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,550
I didn't stay friends with you

392
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,070
all these years for nothing.

393
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,830
Come on.

394
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,610
Kill it.

395
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Kill it now. Come on.

396
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,770
The white crow is a spirit.

397
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,800
I can't kill it.

398
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,300
And it's just an omen.

399
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,580
Killing it won't

400
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,650
solve anything.

401
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,590
Then what should I do?

402
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,440
I'll figure something out.

403
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,610
Go home for now.

404
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,070
I…

405
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,030
I'm not leaving.

406
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,820
If I'm gonna die, I'm dying right here with you.

407
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,150
Wen Jian.

408
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,110
Wen Jian.

409
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,620
In the worst-case scenario,

410
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,620
if my method doesn't work,

411
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,350
you'll only have a day or two left to live.

412
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't you have anything

413
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,350
you want to say to your family?

414
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,550
I...

415
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,240
I...

416
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,780
Chi Xue.

417
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,400
Escort Chief Constable Wen home.

418
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,160
Chief Constable Wen.

419
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,030
Let's go.

420
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,750
No, no, I'm not leaving.

421
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,510
Come on, let's go.

422
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:37,830
I...

423
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,510
Help… Help me out.

424
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,060
You should go back too.

425
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,690
About the white crow,

426
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,610
don't worry about it for now.

427
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,520
It's different

428
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,710
from other demons.

429
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,840
It won't harm you.

430
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,920
If you see it again,

431
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,230
just act like you don't.

432
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,550
You'll be fine.

433
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,310
Okay.

434
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,790
I'll go back then.

435
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,790
Don't sigh.

436
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,060
Sighing won't help.

437
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,510
If death's coming, it's coming.

438
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,110
You…

439
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,240
Honey.

440
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,830
So you still remember to come home?

441
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,510
Did you go gambling again?

442
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,070
How much did you lose this time?

443
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,400
Honey, don't worry,

444
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,110
let me explain.

445
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,830
I...

446
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,880
I've heard enough of your excuses.

447
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,950
Don't I know what you're like?

448
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,650
I must've been blind to

449
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,000
fall for a fat idiot like you.

450
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,920
I...

451
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,200
Chi Xue, help me explain.

452
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,240
He really didn't go gambling.

453
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,110
Then why didn't he come home?

454
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,630
I don't know either.

455
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,240
Maybe

456
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,510
he's dying or something.

457
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,880
Why are you staring at me?

458
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,200
You're good at making up stories.

459
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,270
Go ahead, keep lying.

460
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,030
Honey,

461
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm dying.

462
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,920
You...

463
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,420
Don't worry.

464
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Let me finish what I'm saying.

465
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,620
Fine.

466
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,030
Go ahead.

467
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,340
Keep talking.

468
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,440
Speak.

469
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,000
I was lying

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,240
every time

471
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,400
I told you I lost money.

472
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,720
Come on, how clever I am.

473
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,850
Of course I know

474
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
that gambling leads to losses.

475
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm just fond of money

476
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,920
and wanted to save some pocket money.

477
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,030
I hid it

478
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,750
all in the

479
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,070
empty bricks of the outhouse.

480
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,310
Honey,

481
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,920
you're still young.

482
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,750
After I die,

483
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,790
find a good man to marry.

484
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,680
Wen Jian,

485
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,350
we're fine,

486
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,000
it's no big deal

487
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,450
if you lose a bit of money.

488
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,680
Don't scare me.

489
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,550
You know I'm easily frightened.

490
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,960
Did something happen to you?

491
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,280
Let's go find Lord Geng

492
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,620
and have him help you.

493
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,550
Lord Geng can't help me with

494
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,000
this matter.

495
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,160
Is someone seeking revenge?

496
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,110
I can't explain it clearly right now,

497
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,310
but anyway, this time

498
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,550
there's no escaping.

499
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,550
Changle Sword,

500
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,070
born from following the cause and effect,

501
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,720
has the power to sever the cause and break the past.

502
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,240
When the time comes,

503
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,350
the Changle Sword will appear on its own.

504
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,960
However,

505
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,550
opportunities are rare,

506
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,160
and it cannot be forced.

507
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,230
I'm back.

508
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,400
Was your journey safe?

509
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,400
It was safe,

510
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,110
but once we get home, it's another story.

511
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,750
His wife says she wants to

512
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,780
give him a serious scolding.

513
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,130
I think she's quite serious about it.

514
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,900
Are you planning to

515
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,940
use the Changle Sword to save Wen Jian?

516
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,680
Unfortunately, the time for the cause and effect hasn't come yet.

517
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,590
It still refuses to show itself.

518
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,930
It's actually true.

519
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,030
[Reunion Inn]

520
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,220
Are you here to stay

521
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,310
or to rob?

522
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,310
I'm here to stay.

523
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,720
Are you alone?

524
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,160
Yes.

525
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,830
[Zhou Wuniang]

526
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,930
How should I address you, sir?

527
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,720
My surname is Duan.

528
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,310
Mr. Duan,

529
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,030
where are you from

530
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,160
and where are you going?

531
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,440
Mr. Duan, if you don't show the travel permit,

532
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,310
we

533
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,480
won't be able to explain it

534
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,590
if the officials come to inquire.

535
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,010
It's my oversight.

536
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,750
May I ask

537
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,780
where the innkeeper is?

538
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,440
The innkeeper is my father,

539
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,920
in the back courtyard.

540
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,270
Are you from

541
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,660
an official family?

542
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,380
Could you give me a room first?

543
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,640
The hot springs at our inn

544
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,720
are the most famous.

545
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,170
How about

546
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,160
I take you to a hot spring bath later?

547
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,320
No need.

548
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,000
Just prepare some food and wine.

549
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,200
Alright.

550
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,100
Your inn

551
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,230
is really quiet.

552
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,780
My father is renovating the inn,

553
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,070
so we've not been

554
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,140
taking in guests recently.

555
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,710
Am I the only guest here?

556
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,160
Yes,

557
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,620
we can't turn you away.

558
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,200
It's not safe

559
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,240
for someone to sleep outdoors

560
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,920
in this desolate wilderness.

561
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,080
Your inn

562
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,400
is so complicatedly built.

563
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,240
Aren't you afraid guests will get lost?

564
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,000
We have many

565
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,240
attendants here.

566
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,820
No matter where you are,

567
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,680
as long as you call out,

568
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,000
someone will hear you.

569
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,200
So naturally,

570
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,590
there's no worry about getting lost.

571
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,700
-Wuniang.
-Wuniang.

572
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,350
You,

573
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
go prepare some food and wine

574
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,850
for this young master

575
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,480
and send it to the courtyard in front.

576
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,930
Yes.

577
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,350
What are you doing?

578
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,830
I noticed that your complexion

579
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,400
doesn't seem very good.

580
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,550
It would be best if you stayed a little longer

581
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,480
to rest and recover before continuing your journey.

582
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,830
I still have business to attend to.

583
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,110
I'll stay for one night and leave.

584
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,110
Just staying for one night?

585
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,400
My father said that

586
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,020
meeting is fate.

587
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,030
It's really a pity.

588
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,670
Mr. Duan,

589
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,550
your room is just ahead.

590
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,630
This is our house-made wine,

591
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,460
clear, sweet,

592
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,880
and with a lingering aftertaste.

593
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,720
Please,

594
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,260
have a taste.

595
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,720
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

596
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,790
I'll take my leave now.

597
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
Is anyone here?

598
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,510
Boss!

599
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,110
Boss!

600
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,870

Listen to me!

624
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,710
Bet here! Bet here!

625
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,510
Chief Constable Chu,

626
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,880
what brings you here?

627
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,710
An ill wind.

628
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,630
Come on, come on!

629
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,800
Next round, hurry!

630
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,040
Where are you running to?

631
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,470
Guangping Residence.

632
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,180
It's fine, it's fine.

633
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,290
Don't run!

634
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,230
Don't move!

635
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,630
Where's Gao Sheng?

636
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,510
He...

637
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,460
Didn't he die?

638
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,440
Dead?

639
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,510
Yes.

640
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,400
He's dead.

641
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,780
But I heard that just two days ago,

642
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,810
you were drinking with someone

643
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,510
and said Gao Sheng came back to life,

644
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,670
even toasting with you.

645
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,710
How is it that he's dead again now?

646
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,750
I was talking nonsense after drinking.

647
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,190
How can that be taken seriously?

648
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,880
No, no, no!

649
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,760
Are you going to tell me or not?

650
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
I'll tell you.

651
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,360
I really thought he was dead.

652
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,620
When I saw him again,

653
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,590
I was shocked.

654
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,710
He only told me while drinking that

655
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,290
his mother used some tricks

656
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,360
to help him escape death.

657
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,840
Where is he now?

658
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,440
He's...

659
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,670
He's at a relative's place in the mountains,

660
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,400
laying low to avoid trouble.

661
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,840
You're here.

662
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,190
You didn't sleep all night?

663
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,930
Have you found any solution?

664
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,510
Let's go to Wen Jian's house first.

665
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,280
Wait for me a moment.

666
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,480
There are often signs of misfortune, spreading the news of death.

667
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,800
Let's go.

668
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,360
Alright.

669
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,880
Wen Jian, wake up!

670
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,920
Where is he?

671
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,510
Go; up.

672
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,040
Careful.

673
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,420
A bit higher.

674
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,720
Higher.

675
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,280
That's right.

676
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,110
To the left. It's tilted. Left.

677
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:10,960
Left!

678
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,810
Don't stand here gawking!

679
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,760
Move along quickly!

680
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,290
Isn't that Chief Constable Wen?

681
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,360
Someone's been hit!

682
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,320
Ms. Wen,

683
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,550
just now a few constables came to the door

684
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,320
saying that Lord Geng from the government office

685
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,000
will be here soon.

686
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,190
Also,

687
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,150
the coffin from Su's Coffin Shop

688
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
will be here shortly.

689
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,280
You see,

690
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,630
are we going to carry it in now?

691
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,110
Why?

692
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,000
Why did this happen?

693
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,360
Ms. Wen.

694
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,190
Physician Jiu,

695
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,630
Ms. Wen has fainted from crying.

696
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,810
You and Wen Jian

697
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
have always been on good terms,

698
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,190
so why don't you

699
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,960
give her some advice?

700
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,590
Why did this happen?

701
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,930
What's going on?

702
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,510
Why all this commotion so early in the morning?

703
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,350
Wen Jian?

704
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,710
Wen Jian,

705
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,230
you're not dead?

706
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,880
What's wrong?

707
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,520
-Honey.
-You're not dead?

708
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,440
What's wrong, honey?

709
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,420
Honey.

710
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,440
You...

711
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,510
You dressed like this.

712
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,710
Our family...

713
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,270
I knew you couldn't die.

714
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,550
Honey.

715
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,190
Honey.

716
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,560
Today, on the street,

717
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,630
we saw someone

718
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,190
who looked exactly like you

719
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,510
get crushed by a signboard.

720
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,760
We all thought that person was you,

721
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,480
so we arranged a funeral for you.

722
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,510
Well...

723
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,950
Looked exactly like me?

724
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,250
What's going on with you?

725
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,030
Where have you been?

726
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,230
I...

727
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,110
I've been sleeping all along.

728
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,710
I just woke up

729
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,630
under the bed

730
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,510
and then heard all

731
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,440
the noise outside,

732
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,400
so I came out.

733
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Ban... Banxia,

734
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,110
that...

735
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,640
Is that Master Crow

736
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,280
still around?

737
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,440
No.

738
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,830
He flew away

739
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,120
when the signboard fell and killed him

740
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,190
on the street.

741
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,800
Is there really such a lucky turn of events?

742
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,070
Someone who looked exactly like me

743
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,840
died,

744
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,070
and I'm fine?

745
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,880
Do you know

746
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,690
the black cat at the memorial hall?

747
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,840
I...

748
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,120
How would I know a cat?

749
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,790
Ms. Wen,

750
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,580
do you know it?

751
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,270
I...

752
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,030
Honey.

753
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,730
This matter is very likely connected to a demon.

754
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,370
Though Wen Jian

755
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,690
has luckily escaped death,

756
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,960
we have no idea

757
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,240
whether this demon

758
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,540
is a blessing or a curse.

759
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,280
Ms. Wen, we hope that

760
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,480
you can be honest with us

761
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,250
so we can make plans early.

762
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,110
Well...

763
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,170
That day, Wen Jian came back

764
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,450
and talked a lot about life and death,

765
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,840
even telling me

766
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,710
where he hid his private money.

767
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,560
I was scared, couldn't sleep,

768
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,150
so I went to the place

769
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,070
he mentioned.

770
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,840
Suddenly,

771
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,480
I heard a cat meow.

772
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,630
When I turned around,

773
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,840
I saw a cat sitting on the wall.

774
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,840
Is that the same cat

775
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,590
from the funeral hall?

776
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,030
The night was too dark,

777
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,630
so I couldn't see clearly.

778
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,070
But that cat gave off

779
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,840
a very strange feeling.

780
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,850
I immediately thought of

781
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,760
the rumors about

782
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,550
the Cat Demon exchanging lives.

783
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,440
Then I remembered what Wen Jian had said,

784
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,520
and I got really anxious.

785
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,730
Feeling desperate, I decided to try anything

786
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,440
and gave all the money to that cat,

787
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,960
hoping it would help Wen Jian

788
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,280
escape this crisis.

789
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,360
I didn't expect

790
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,820
it to really work.

791
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,220
Honey.

792
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,920
The Cat Demon that exchanges lives?

793
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,110
Yes.

794
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,950
It's called the Nine Lives Immortal.

795
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,630
They say that if you give it money,

796
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,970
it can exchange lives for you,

797
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,010
taking death in your place.

798
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,210
The life-exchanging demon.

799
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,490
Is it that life-exchanging demon?

800
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,480
Ms. Wen,

801
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,000
do you know

802
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,770
how to summon this

803
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,930
life-exchanging demon?

804
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,150
I've secretly inquired about it.

805
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,150
They say you need to go out alone

806
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,280
at the hour of 11PM,

807
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,000
turn left at

808
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,400
the first intersection,

809
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,250
stop at

810
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,480
the seventh intersection,

811
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,710
and

812
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:24,040
along the way, you must never look back.

813
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,390
Why is Banxia

814
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,210
taking so long?

815
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,000
Could something have gone wrong?

816
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,230
I am Banxia,

817
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,110
sincerely praying,

818
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,800
humbly asking the Nine Lives Immortal to appear.

819
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,190
I am Banxia, sincerely praying

820
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,840
to the Nine Lives Immortal.

821
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,680
My name is Duan Banxia,

822
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,140
and my father is Duan Yingheng.

823
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,050
I have something

824
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,850
to ask the Nine Lives Immortal.

825
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,160
A month ago,

826
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,630
in Penglai Alley of Nanyang City,

827
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,100
the third house from the left

828
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,580
caught on fire.

829
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,880
I want to know if my father borrowed a life from you

830
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,670
during the fire, faking his death

831
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,630
to escape the capture of the Mirror Demon.

832
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,530
Nine Lives Immortal!

833
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,150
Banxia!

834
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,280
Xuanye,

835
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,320
I just saw Nine Lives Immortal.
