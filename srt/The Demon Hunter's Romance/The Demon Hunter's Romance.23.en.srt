[Episode 23]

3
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,680
Shoot arrows at him!

4
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,910
Don't let him escape!

5
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,690
They're bullying Big Brother!

6
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,750
Third Brother, Fourth Brother,

7
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,810
grab your weapons!

8
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,500
Grab your weapons!

9
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,750
Where did these scoundrels come from?

10
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,800
Everyone, stop!

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,030
Come beat him up!

12
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,550
I'll fight you!

13
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,240
Who sent you?

14
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,560
Why are you trying to assassinate me?

15
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,250
I won't tell you.

16
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,660
Come here if you dare!

17
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,690
I'll ram you to death!

18
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,580
How dare you meddle in our affairs!

19
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,270
You bastard!

20
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,870
Seize him!

21
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,630
I'll kill you with one punch!

22
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll kill you with two punches!

23
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,480
I'll kill you with three punches!

24
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,510
I'll kill you with four punches!

25
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,310
Five punches—

26
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,450
You have no honor in combat!

27
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,830
Die!

28
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,870
Stop!

29
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,160
Quick, go home! Go home!

30
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,920
My Lord, you look familiar.

31
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,870
May I ask who you are, My Lord?

32
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,070
We are from the Court of Judicial Review.

33
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,860
This is a traitor to the country.

34
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,920
We are here on imperial orders to investigate.

35
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
If he's a traitor to the country,

36
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
why not capture and interrogate him?

37
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,730
How can you kill someone in the street?

38
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,540
By the Emperor's decree,

39
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,800
we can kill as we please.

40
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,340
Do we need to explain ourselves to you?

41
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,740
I am the county commandant of Guangping.

42
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,830
This is Guangping's jurisdiction.

43
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,090
How can I allow you to kill in the streets?

44
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,350
Oh, the county commandant of Guangping?

45
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,450
Such a high-ranking official!

46
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,910
You've scared us to death!

47
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
I think you're a

48
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,000
soon-to-be-dead county commandant.

49
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,690
It's not honorable to win like this.

50
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,159
Take this great county commandant away.

51
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,040
-Yes.
-Yes.

52
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,120
Why are you here?

53
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,960
I have something to ask you.

54
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,070
Do we know each other?

55
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,430
Yes.

56
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,300
We know each other.

57
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,870
We moon-gazed together

58
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,120
on the hillside

59
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,760
of Nanyang City.

60
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,620
Have you seen this person?

61
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,540
Never seen him.

62
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,950
Now I want to see

63
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,280
if you'll die or not.

64
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,680
This is outrageous!

65
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
It's infuriating! Meddling in others' affairs!

66
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,950
This is absolutely outrageous!

67
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,190
It's truly outrageous!

68
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,160
I'm furious!

69
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,430
I want to see if you'll die or not.

70
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,070
I'm going to kill you.

71
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,690
Kill you.

72
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
I must kill you.

73
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,080
This scoundrel!

74
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,600
I want to see

75
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,860
how long you can hold out for.

76
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,059
Are you faster at running

77
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,460
or am I faster at drawing?

78
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,240
Coming!

79
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
May I help you?

80
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,860
I need some ink and brushes. It's urgent.

81
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,460
The shop is already closed.

82
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,050
Please try somewhere else.

83
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Where is Youhuang?

84
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,200
Who?

85
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
How did you wake me up?

86
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,100
What did you do?

87
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,000
There's no time to explain now.

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,390
We don't have much time left.

89
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,650
Where are we going now?

90
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
They've woken up.

91
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,670
You need to leave quickly.

92
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,730
I'll hold them off.

93
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,320
Be careful then.

94
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,200
After I'm done,

95
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,530
where should I find you?

96
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,440
My home.

97
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,560
Ganshan Clinic?

98
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,120
No.

99
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,460
Simao's house.

100
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,500
Go quickly.

101
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:13,940
Brother.

102
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,490
You're... you're back.

103
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,070
You're smarter

104
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,150
than I imagined.

105
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,920
Truly worthy of being

106
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,080
the Big Brother.

107
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,150
How dare I have

108
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,680
a younger brother like you?

109
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,670
Why?

110
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,680
Older and younger brothers,

111
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,040
rulers and subjects, fathers and sons...

112
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,440
all so affectionate.

113
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,510
How interesting.

114
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,250
When did you figure me out?

115
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,320
Long ago.

116
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,530
I didn't expect you

117
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,390
to be an even better actor than me.

118
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,680
Where did I slip up?

119
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,260
The master of this place

120
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,220
created such a

121
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,480
lifelike world.

122
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,630
How could they possibly

123
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,560
just be watching from the outside?

124
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
That makes sense.

125
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,600
When I was young,

126
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,840
my father told me

127
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
that in this world,

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,550
there are powerful demons

129
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,430
that can create very realistic illusions.

130
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,150
I didn't believe it at first.

131
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,810
I always thought he was lying.

132
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,300
I didn't expect it to be true.

133
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,080
It's just a pity.

134
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,550
It's a pity that your companion demon

135
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,080
is so weak in magical power.

136
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,360
It's not even

137
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,760
a match for my bare hands.

138
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,880
If I hadn't been pulled into the painting,

139
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,100
I could've easily

140
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,480
taken his life on the spot

141
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,680
that day in the study.

142
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,080
How could a demon

143
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,390
like that possibly be

144
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,990
the master of this painting?

145
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,440
So I concluded

146
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,670
that the mastermind behind this

147
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,870
must be someone else.

148
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,280
I also discovered

149
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,440
that as long as I didn't change

150
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,640
my words and actions,

151
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,630
the others wouldn't change.

152
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,480
Only you

153
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,800
would be different.

154
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,090
Big Brother.

155
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
Are you hurt?

156
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,840
What are you waiting for?

157
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,360
Help Big Brother up.

158
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,440
Okay.

159
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,680
What happened?

160
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,480
Why are you here?

161
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,200
Big Brother, are you alright?

162
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,640
Big Brother.

163
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,750
Are you hurt?

164
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,480
What are you waiting for?

165
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,120
Help Big Brother up.

166
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,420
What happened?

167
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,840
Why are you here?

168
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,670
We were talking about going to work.

169
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,420
Impressive, impressive.

170
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,810
I admire you.

171
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,670
We've been fighting for so long,

172
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,590
yet I still don't know your name.

173
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,390
I go by a single name:

174
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,030
Mirage.

175
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,360
Mirage?

176
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,750
Good name.

177
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,710
It suits you well.

178
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,720
It's been a long time since anyone

179
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
has made me this happy.

180
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,430
I am an ancient divine beast,

181
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,610
blessed with intelligence by the forces of nature.

182
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,960
There are countless demons who have

183
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,690
awakened their intelligence.

184
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,150
However, whether one can attain

185
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,240
the way of immortality

186
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,770
depends solely on oneself.

187
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,720
I refused to be mediocre.

188
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,120
I meditated by the abyss for a thousand years

189
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,720
to finally achieve this level of cultivation.

190
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,320
One day,

191
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,200
I arrived in Guangping.

192
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,520
Guangping is truly beautiful.

193
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,870
I was so engrossed in cultivation before

194
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,120
that I didn't even know

195
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,750
there was

196
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,810
such a wonderful place in this world.

197
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,030
In this vast universe, the mortal world is boundless.

198
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,890
The joys and sorrows of human life

199
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,670
are truly fascinating.

200
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,720
Have you ever eaten candied haw?

201
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,480
I have.

202
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,790
I ate it in Guangping.

203
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,600
The taste

204
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,750
was truly wonderful.

205
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,750
Sweet with a hint of sourness.

206
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,600
When you bite into it,

207
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,660
your mouth is filled with a sweetness

208
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,190
that lingers on your tongue for a long time.

209
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,890
I also drank fine wine,

210
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,640
watched foreign dances,

211
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
toured Guangping's night scenery,

212
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,080
and wandered through

213
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,140
all the streets and alleys of Guangping City.

214
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,320
Such a place of outstanding people and beautiful scenery,

215
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,930
with picturesque landscapes

216
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,600
and profound cultural heritage,

217
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
deserves to be captured in a painting by me.

218
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,550
So I moved into the Underground City

219
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,000
to paint "A Spring Day in Guangping."

220
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,030
I wanted to include the city's

221
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,600
every blade of grass, every tree, every brick and tile,

222
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,050
the city's people, and its famous landmarks.

223
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,380
I wanted to paint it all.

224
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,510
And this painting

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,030
took 100 years.

226
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,870
But when I reached The Six Wonders,

227
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,650
I realized

228
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,270
that I had thought too simply.

229
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,150
No matter what I did,

230
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,390
I couldn't capture

231
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,720
the true essence and spirit of the people.

232
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Ink figures, after all, lack a mind.

233
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,620
And that natural charm,

234
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,250
that divine craftsmanship,

235
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,840
was beyond my magical powers.

236
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,150
So,

237
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,390
you came up with the idea

238
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,850
of putting living people into the painting.

239
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
The tower keeper,

240
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,240
the owner of the Tang Residence,

241
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,970
Lord Xin'an,

242
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,550
the young Taoist priest under the Matchmaking Tree,

243
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,750
and Banxia's mother…

244
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,130
You captured them all, didn't you?

245
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,270
Some of them, yes.

246
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,390
Some of them, no.

247
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,790
Take Lord Xin'an

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,790
for example.

249
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,030
He was already a dying man.

250
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,700
If it weren't for me,

251
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,630
he would have become dust long ago.

252
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,850
I granted him immortality,

253
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,790
but he was ungrateful.

254
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,080
Then why did you send Chi Wangchuan

255
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,680
to capture Banxia's father?

256
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,480
At that time, I was painting Fa'en Temple,

257
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,360
but no matter how hard I tried,

258
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,420
I couldn't capture

259
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,380
the divine essence of the weeping Guanyin Bodhisattva.

260
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,260
So I had to

261
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,290
go out again to gather inspiration.

262
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,650
As if by fate,

263
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,240
I encountered Ms. Tang in the Underground City

264
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,320
who was searching for her daughter.

265
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,910
That Ms. Tang

266
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,030
had such a sincere love for her daughter.

267
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,760
It was deeply moving to behold.

268
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,790
When she cried,

269
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,360
she was identical to the Guanyin Bodhisattva

270
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,510
I had imagined.

271
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,069
But once the Guanyin Bodhisattva statue was completed,

272
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,200
she stopped crying.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,670
I couldn't understand why.

274
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,510
So I had to bring her out of the painting

275
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,240
to have a proper talk with her.

276
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,550
She

277
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,240
pretended to

278
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,230
write a poem

279
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,240
to express her longing.

280
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,920
Then, when I wasn't paying attention,

281
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,480
she sent that poem out.

282
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,560
It was precisely this letter

283
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,750
that made me realize

284
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,880
her deep love for her husband.

285
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,590
So I thought

286
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,310
that if I captured her husband too

287
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
and placed him before her every day,

288
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,720
they would be so close

289
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,180
yet unable to be together.

290
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,680
Wouldn't that make her cry?

291
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,580
You really went to great lengths.

292
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,640
I just wanted to create a good painting.

293
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,890
There was no other malicious intent.

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,260
What a fine statement!

295
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,200
Do you know

296
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,180
how many people's lives were ruined

297
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,750
because of your one painting?

298
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,880
I'll kill you today

299
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,100
to avenge my parents.

300
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,960
Are you alright?

301
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,030
How can this be?

302
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,640
He's the master of the painting.

303
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,700
Nothing in the painting can harm him.

304
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,100
How did she regain her memory?

305
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,740
What did you do?

306
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,940
What did I do?

307
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,430
Don't you know?

308
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,100
Could it be…

309
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,150
Could it be that you already know the incantation?

310
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,550
Incantation?

311
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,250
Is that what you call the moon?

312
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
Ancient divine beast?

313
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,270
Stop flattering yourself.

314
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,920
You're nothing but an

315
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,640
ephemeral

316
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,270
Moon-Fearing Bug, less significant

317
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,070
than an ant.

318
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,440
You—

319
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,110
There is an ancient book

320
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,240
called the Hundred Demon Catalog.

321
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
I'm sure you haven't read it.

322
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,720
The Moon-Fearing Bug

323
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
has a sandy color

324
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,310
and a turtle's shape.

325
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,070
It lives on the north bank of Taiqi Mountain,

326
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,440
in a place of sunlight and warmth.

327
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,570
It fears moonlight.

328
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,200
Exposure to it means death.

329
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,000
That's why it's called Moon-Fearing.

330
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,330
You must have been lucky

331
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,160
to be born in the Underground City.

332
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,550
That place is isolated from the outside world,

333
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,010
with no sight of sun or moon.

334
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,070
That's why you were fortunate enough to survive.

335
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,790
Moreover,

336
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,480
you were lucky to obtain a primordial spirit

337
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,540
and become a demon.

338
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,430
I, the honored one...

339
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,270
I, the honored one...

340
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,130
You keep saying "the honored one'

341
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,550
but I'd like to ask,

342
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,030
how are you honored?

343
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,800
How dare you!

344
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,590
Insolence!

345
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,160
All the demons in this world

346
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,200
obtained a primordial spirit

347
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,180
by accident,

348
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,750
which awakened their consciousness.

349
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,000
There are no exceptions.

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,880
You are not

351
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,240
some innate spiritual being,

352
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
nor are you an ancient divine beast.

353
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,680
You're just a bug.

354
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,680
I am not!

355
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,590
You transformed into a demon

356
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,790
and cultivated here.

357
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,720
I'll give you credit for enduring the loneliness.

358
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,390
Gradually,

359
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,110
you finally mastered your magical arts.

360
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,570
You went to Guangping City

361
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,960
and saw beautiful scenery,

362
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,500
other the pitch-black

363
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,640
Underground City.

364
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,030
You said you saw the night view of Guangping,

365
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,000
but that's a lie,

366
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,610
because you

367
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
don't dare to look at the moon at all.

368
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
Today is a full moon.

369
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,270
Who gave you

370
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,200
the lousy idea to paint Guangping?

371
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,830
Was it your companion demon?

372
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,000
Let me guess.

373
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,280
Your painting skills improved, and by chance,

374
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,590
you managed to infuse magical power into your painting,

375
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,270
glimpsing the method of creating reality from illusion,

376
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,160
the art of shaping a microcosm.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,830
In your eyes,

378
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,800
nothing in the human world is more beautiful than Guangping.

379
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,650
To have

380
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,060
your own Guangping

381
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,970
became an obsession you couldn't shake off.

382
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,480
As a

383
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,000
pitiful and cowardly bug,

384
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,000
I believe

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,480
you only needed one lesson

386
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,820
to never dare venture to the surface again.

387
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,340
So,

388
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,480
someone toured Guangping on your behalf,

389
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,160
inquired for you

390
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,980
about the events of the past thousand years,

391
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,290
and vividly depicted

392
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,430
all sorts of people for you.

393
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,030
Stop talking.

394
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,830
Shut up.

395
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,460
Be quiet!

396
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,290
Are you angry out of shame?

397
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,970
Which one infuriates you more?

398
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,270
Is it that your lies have been exposed,

399
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,880
or that your delusion of being powerful

400
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,010
has been shattered?

401
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,030
When you tell lies too often,

402
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,880
you start to believe them yourself.

403
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,350
What a pitiful bug.

404
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,110
I

405
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
am not.

406
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,730
I'm not a pitiful bug.

407
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,950
How did you figure it out?

408
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,770
There were too many flaws.

409
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,160
You wanted to paint

410
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,270
a scroll of the most beautiful scenery in the world,

411
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,000
yet there's no moon in your painting.

412
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,260
In this painted world,

413
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,720
the people you've captured

414
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,050
never mention the moon,

415
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,830
as if they don't even know

416
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,760
that the moon exists in this world.

417
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,200
Add to that Banxia

418
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,860
and Lord Xin'an's awakening,

419
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,110
and your identity

420
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,670
was naturally revealed.

421
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,590
Clever.

422
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,310
Such a clever mind.

423
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,280
But what can you do even if you know?

424
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,300
This is the world I created.

425
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,030
You can't harm me,

426
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,000
nor can you escape.

427
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,880
Xuanye,

428
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,040
what happened to your hand?

429
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,710
What did you do to him?

430
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,120
I didn't do anything.

431
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,010
You were the ones who first violated

432
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,740
the rules of the painted world.

433
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,930
It seems that before long,

434
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,830
you will

435
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,200
be like Lord Xin'an

436
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,550
and be completely erased by the painted world.

437
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,750
Your lies have been exposed.

438
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,970
Won't you admit your mistakes?

439
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,160
It's not too late now.

440
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,050
If you release the others,

441
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,270
I can spare your life.

442
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,830
Release?

443
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,200
Release?

444
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,070
Where do you want me to release them?

445
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,370
In this vast world of mortals, everyone suffers.

446
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,160
What do you know?

447
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,000
Humans are mere mortals.

448
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,790
They only have a fleeting lifespan,

449
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,110
like a white colt passing through a crack.

450
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,680
It's only an instant.

451
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,550
And even with just this instant,

452
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,350
they can't enjoy it peacefully.

453
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,190
They must seek food to fill their stomachs,

454
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,260
and sew clothes to cover their bodies.

455
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,730
They endure the difficulties of seven emotions and six desires,

456
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,650
suffer the pains of birth, aging, sickness, and death.

457
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,720
There's also hatred, separation,

458
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,920
floods, wildfires,

459
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,060
wars, and the oppression of the poor by the rich.

460
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,480
But in my painting,

461
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,930
this life has only this day.

462
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,190
Day and night cycle endlessly,

463
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,920
allowing everyone immortality.

464
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,050
Joy is eternal, sorrow does not exist.

465
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,270
There's no fear in life,

466
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,790
no dread in death.

467
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,720
The past is like an illusion and the future is eternal.

468
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,470
Isn't this

469
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,560
true liberation

470
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,050
and the ultimate freedom?

471
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,750
But this is all fake.

472
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,240
What did you say?

473
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,070
Fake?

474
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,920
You... you...

475
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,270
You tell me

476
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,160
all of this is fake.

477
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,280
Then tell me,

478
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,550
what is real?

479
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,200
How do you know that your world

480
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,330
is definitely real?

481
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,350
How do you know

482
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,100
you're not a puppet on strings,

483
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,030
not a clown on the stage?

484
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,640
How do you know that everything about you

485
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,500
isn't the moon in the water,

486
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,640
isn't a flower in the mirror,

487
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,850
isn't just the audience's

488
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,680
casual joke after tea and meals?

489
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,270
How can a clever person like you

490
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,330
not understand

491
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,710
there's no difference between inside and outside the painting?

492
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,270
Real and fake,

493
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,510
fake and real,

494
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,160
it's all just a dream.

495
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,550
You say these self-deceiving words

496
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,790
so smoothly.

497
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,030
All these years,

498
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,640
you've been relying on these words

499
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,300
to deceive yourself, haven't you?

500
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,060
Kid,

501
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,640
I originally wanted to spare your life,

502
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,640
but since you've

503
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,840
already seen through the incantation,

504
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,960
I can't let you live anymore.

505
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,310
What should we do?

506
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,310
We can't kill him.

507
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,440
We can.

508
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,470
Look,

509
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,520
the moon has come out.

510
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,270
You've ruined my important business.

511
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,240
I'm furious.

512
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,270
The moon.

513
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:50,920
The moon.

514
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,320
Finally, we see the moon.

515
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,540
It's so beautiful.

516
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,530
It's so bright.

517
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,470
It really is the moon.

518
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,830
Madam.

519
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,790
Ink.

520
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,550
Ermao.

521
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,640
Who's Ermao?

522
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,000
I am Big Brother.

523
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,070
Big Brother.

524
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,990
Where is this?

525
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,340
What is that?

526
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,200
That's the moon.

527
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,230
Beautiful, isn't it?

528
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,420
How can the moon be here?

529
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,160
You.

530
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,880
Since sound can travel out,

531
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,480
then scent can too.

532
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,750
Moon Bugs

533
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,890
really love lamb lung soup.

534
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,920
This is

535
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,680
the moon?

536
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,350
It's so beautiful.

537
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,630
It's truly beautiful.

538
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,110
Sha!

539
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,570
It's so beautiful.

540
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,170
Little Bug!

541
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,710
[Zi Kong]

542
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,310
You need to go quickly.

543
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,070
Don't worry about me.

544
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,550
So what's your name?

545
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,850
My name is Manying!

546
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,600
Run!

547
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,300
Master.

548
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,430
Did you bring him back?

549
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,750
No.

550
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,830
I searched in the human world for 12 years,

551
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,680
but I still couldn't find

552
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,310
the whereabouts of the Second Prince.

553
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,270
I believe

554
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,470
the Second Prince

555
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,950
must be dead already.

556
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,200
That's not possible.

557
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,680
Shao Li

558
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,070
has been stained with his blood.

559
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,100
If he were dead,

560
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,960
this bloodstain would disappear.

561
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,420
Give me the peach talisman.

562
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,200
The peach talisman

563
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
can only protect one person

564
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,480
to cross the Two Realms Mountain and the Carefree River.

565
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,030
Master,

566
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,110
you can't bring the Second Prince back.

567
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,510
The 12th year is coming.

568
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,320
When the gate opens,

569
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,480
I must bring him back

570
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,639
before Father acts.

571
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,949
What if the Second Prince doesn't want to return?

572
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,340
I will definitely bring him back.

573
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,570
Ordinary Moon-Fearing Bugs

574
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,630
live and die in a day, as fleeting as mayflies.

575
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,429
But this one was extraordinary.

576
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,630
Xuanye said he had been hiding in the Underground City

577
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,760
for over 100 years.

578
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,880
The sun wasn't visible,

579
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,190
so naturally, he couldn't see the moon either.

580
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,510
That's why he didn't die.

581
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,639
For his own benefit,

582
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,090
he created a world within a painting.

583
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,510
Every blade of grass and every tree there,

584
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,550
every object and every person,

585
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,360
all moved according to

586
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,760
his thoughts and desires

587
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,260
and they couldn't escape.

588
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,880
Then, how were you able to escape?

589
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
T-That's really incredible.

590
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,840
Yes,

591
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,060
it did take quite some effort.

592
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,030
We faced several dangers

593
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,490
and almost lost our lives.

594
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
Fortunately, we eventually saw through the illusion

595
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
and defeated that demon.

596
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,760
This is truly such a twisted and strange tale.

597
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,800
Who could have imagined

598
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
that such a demon exists in this world?

599
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,230
Indeed.

600
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,400
If I hadn't experienced it myself,

601
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
I wouldn't have believed it either.

602
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,760
S-So what happened next?

603
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,970
That demon was afraid of the moon.

604
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,100
As soon as he saw,

605
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,430
Xuanye's precious bugs,

606
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,890
he vanished into thin air.

607
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,750
Once he died,

608
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,670
the painted world also collapsed.

609
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,930
We, the living humans,

610
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,150
regained our senses,

611
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,560
and broke free from our restraints.

612
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,710
The leaders of the Xiaodongtian

613
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,590
also came forward

614
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,250
and sent the trapped people back home one by one.

615
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,240
Commissioner Sima,

616
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,170
didn't you enter the painting?

617
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,480
I didn't.

618
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,920
That's really a pity.

619
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,440
Yes,

620
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,880
it's indeed a pity

621
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,180
to not be part of

622
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
such a rare event.

623
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,500
Otherwise,

624
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,670
I could have fought alongside Chief Constable Chu,

625
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,880
and battled and vanquished

626
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,010
the demon together.

627
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,180
Don't say that.

628
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,320
You contributed

629
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,380
on the outside too.

630
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,800
Yes.

631
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,190
Tingzhou,

632
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
where is your lady?

633
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,300
She's on the second floor.

634
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,780
Xuanye's room?

635
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,010
Why isn't she coming down?

636
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,070
I'll go find her.

637
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,600
Sit down.

638
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,190
Tell Chief Constable Wen properly

639
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,250
how I contributed.

640
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,710
Why should I do whatever

641
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,360
you tell me to?

642
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,020
Can't you speak for yourself?

643
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,050
Not as well as you do.

644
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,880
Say more.

645
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,510
Say more.

646
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,630
Commissioner Sima was looking for us outside,

647
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,400
and by chance,

648
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,530
she found that study

649
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,710
and somehow,

650
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,670
she killed that demon.

651
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,540
That's all?

652
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,370
I was in the painting.

653
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,050
You can fill in the rest.

654
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,130
Does it still fit?

655
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,280
I feel like it's loose.

656
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,560
Have you lost weight in the past few days?

657
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,590
I haven't.

658
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,810
No, look at the waist here,

659
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,360
It's clearly loose.

660
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
I just measured it a few days ago.

661
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,990
Haven't you been eating lately?

662
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,090
I have eaten.

663
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,320
Your complexion doesn't look good either.

664
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,830
It doesn't look good?

665
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,400
Maybe I haven't been sleeping well lately.

666
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,800
I've been dreaming a lot.

667
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,290
What kind of dreams?

668
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,260
I can't remember clearly.

669
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,320
Take it off.

670
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,280
I'll take it to the tailor

671
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,610
for alterations later.

672
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,620
No need.

673
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,050
I think it's fine as it is.

674
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,230
Besides, the fabric is very comfortable.

675
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,830
Thank you.

676
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,070
The fabric was chosen by my mother

677
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,360
and I chose the style.

678
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,020
It's all very good.

679
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,500
Let me do it.

680
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,840
Xuanye,

681
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,640
what's wrong?

682
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,810
Can this broken part

683
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,030
be repaired?

684
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,310
My father didn't teach me

685
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,370
how to repair the Peerless Bracelet.

686
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,670
My father left me this

687
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,000
protective magic tool.

688
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,960
I wanted it

689
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,600
to stay by my side

690
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,480
as a token.

691
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,150
But I didn't expect

692
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,280
that it took the Mirage Demon's hit

693
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,440
in the painted world

694
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,160
and was damaged a little.

695
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,440
What a pity.

696
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,510
Why are you all at my house instead of

697
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,900
working in the government office?

698
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,760
Youhuang was telling me

699
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,480
about your experience in the Underground City.

700
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,440
Xuanye, seriously.

701
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,230
Why didn't you bring me

702
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,360
for this adventure?

703
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,400
I'll be returning to Shendu tomorrow.

704
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,070
This afternoon,

705
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,840
I've arranged a banquet at Yanlai Restaurant.

706
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,150
I hope you all can attend.

707
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,480
You're leaving so soon?

708
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,590
How is it soon?

709
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,150
It's been half a month

710
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,290
since we came out of the Underground City.

711
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,490
If I don't leave soon,

712
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
she'll have to stay for the New Year.

713
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,990
You seem quite resentful.

714
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,220
What's wrong?

715
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,280
You don't want me to stay here, do you?

716
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,330
I wouldn't dare.

717
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,110
The case of Lord Xin'an

718
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,390
has been solved.

719
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,710
Tell me,

720
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,760
do you want to

721
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,070
return to Shendu with me

722
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,000
to claim credit?

723
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,380
Thank you, Commissioner,

724
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,900
but I'm just a humble Chief Constable.

725
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,360
Solving this case

726
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,550
was all thanks to your brilliant deductions

727
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,440
and your wisdom and courage.

728
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,360
This achievement

729
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,820
is yours to claim, My Lord.

730
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,320
I don't need to go.

731
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,240
Alright.

732
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,640
I'll head back to the office first then.

733
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,400
See you this afternoon.

734
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,510
I'll go back first.

735
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,000
My Lady,

736
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,220
this one looks nice.

737
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,620
Choose this one, My Lady.

738
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,960
My Lady,

739
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,710
do you think

740
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,290
Miss Sima

741
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,850
likes Chief Constable Chu?

742
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,120
How did you figure that out?

743
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,610
It's quite obvious.

744
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,710
The way she looks at him like how you look at

745
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,570
Physician Jiu.

746
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,330
Is that so?

747
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:15,730
My Lady,

748
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,480
you've all been back

749
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,880
for over half a month now.

750
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:19,790
Why hasn't Physician Jiu

751
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,060
come to propose yet?

752
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,290
Didn't you already tell Master

753
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,650
that you want to break off the engagement with the Li family's son?

754
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,440
Well, my parents were trapped in that painting

755
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,480
for so long.

756
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,320
They must be severely weakened.

757
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,450
They need time to recover, don't they?

758
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,870
There's still time to write a letter later.

759
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,120
Xuanye went through so much this time.

760
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,790
He also needs to recuperate.

761
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,550
So, does that mean we

762
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,550
we don't have to return to Yuanzhou?

763
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,940
You don't want to return?

764
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,890
Do you not want to return

765
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,510
because if you do return,

766
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,060
you won't be able to see Chi Xue anymore?

767
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,590
What nonsense are you talking about, My Lady?

768
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,670
Chi Xue is a demon.

769
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,380
He's a rabbit.

770
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,640
How can a human be with a rabbit?

771
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,310
What's wrong with being a demon?

772
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,100
What's wrong with being a rabbit?

773
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,390
You look down on him?

774
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,760
It's not that.

775
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,440
Anyway, humans and demons are different.

776
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,070
Humans and rabbits are even more different.

777
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,190
If it were you,

778
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,510
would you be willing to

779
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,320
be with a demon?

780
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,110
I would.

781
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
You're bluffing.

782
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,070
You're going to be

783
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,600
with Physician Jiu anyway,

784
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,440
so of course you can talk big.

785
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,150
My Lady, are you going to choose or not?

786
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,680
If not, I'll choose for you.

787
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,800
[Moon Step]

788
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,030
Mother.

789
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,510
Banxia.

790
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,230
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

791
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,360
Where are you going?

792
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,510
Miss Sima from Shendu

793
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,400
is going back.

794
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,050
We're going to see her off.

795
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,050
Is that the female

796
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,210
Chief Constable from the government?

797
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,840
Then come back early.

798
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,200
Don't drink alcohol.

799
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,440
Alright.

800
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,180
I'll take my leave now.

801
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,570
Every year during the Lantern Festival,

802
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,470
the dragon boat race

803
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,800
is crowded with people, drums and gongs resounding,

804
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,400
It's so lively.

805
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,860
Really.

806
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,340
You came at the wrong time.

807
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,110
Next time, let me know in advance.

808
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,460
You two.

809
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,820
I...

810
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,040
Please, come in.

811
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,090
Banxia.

812
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,640
Why are you late?

813
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,630
My Lady was changing clothes.

814
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:49,920
It took her an hour.

815
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,510
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

816
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,310
It's alright.

817
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,710
Everyone is here now.

818
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,550
Let's serve the food.

819
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,410
Serve the food.

820
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,290
For this trip to Guangping,

821
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,510
I'm grateful for everyone's care.

822
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,320
I'll be returning to Shendu tomorrow.

823
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,250
I don't know when we'll meet again,

824
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,000
so I've prepared this feast

825
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,930
to thank you all.

826
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,210
Commissioner Sima, you're too kind.

827
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,550
Youhuang is my good friend.

828
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,670
Physician Jiu, you can just call me Lingying.

829
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,070
Right.

830
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,130
Just good friends.

831
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,480
Why haven't my pork ribs been served yet?

832
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,070
Waiter!

833
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,740
Waiter!

834
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:30,990
Xuanye,

835
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,080
can you help me ask about it?

836
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:47,450
Banxia,

837
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,490
have some fish.

838
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,070
I've removed all the bones for you.
