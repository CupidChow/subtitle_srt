00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,030
[Episode 34]

3
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,680
Jiu, it's time.

4
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:17,360
Let's go.

5
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,050
Let's go.

6
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,440
Why make such a fuss?

7
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,450
Our Master said

8
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,370
tonight is your big moment.

9
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,260
There can't be any slip-ups.

10
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,450
Uncle

11
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,210
is really attentive to me.

12
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,910
This way, please.

13
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,150
It's even quieter

14
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,820
than last time.

15
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,310
All the shops are closed too.

16
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,520
Besides the waterways, they've also

17
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,120
locked down the entire city.

18
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,120
Seems like

19
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,510
your guess might be correct.

20
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,970
Humans are cunning.

21
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,920
No matter what happens,

22
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,770
it's always right to assume

23
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,680
the worst.

24
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,190
Let's head for the Sky Cavern first.

25
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,720
Okay.

26
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,300
Let's go this way.

27
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,900
Be careful not to alert them.

28
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,010
Okay.

29
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,050
Jiu, here we are.

30
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,570
Manager Lyu.

31
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,940
There's a situation outside.

32
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,600
Our men don't know

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,530
how to handle it.

34
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,500
What's wrong?

35
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,430
Nothing serious.

36
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,250
I'll go fix it.

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,110
Jiu, please go ahead.

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,220
I'll be there soon.

39
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,430
Okay.

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,650
This is heavily guarded.

41
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,960
I'll go in and check.

42
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
Do you have a plan?

43
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
Just fight our way in.

44
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,930
Don't be reckless.

45
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,300
They far outnumber us.

46
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,760
Do those weaklings even count as manpower?

47
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,510
Don't forget that

48
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,920
all your injuries

49
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,850
were caused by those "weaklings."

50
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,500
Quiet! Look.

51
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,440
Can't hear what they're saying.

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,870
There's a boat out there.

53
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,750
It surely carried someone.

54
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,870
"There's a boat out there.

55
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,470
It surely carried someone."

56
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
No matter who it is,

57
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,360
we can't let them mess up

58
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,830
the things at the Bone Washing Pool.

59
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,630
"We can't let them

60
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,080
mess up the things at the Bone Washing Pool."

61
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,880
"Kill any intruders you find."

62
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

63
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,240
The Bone Washing Pool?

64
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,220
Did they already get started?

65
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,390
I know that path. Follow me.

66
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,720
The Bone Washing Pool is over there.

67
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,650
I'll hold them off. You keep going.

68
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,800
Keep up.

69
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,040
Go.

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,480
Xuanye.

71
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,990
Uncle, is this

72
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,720
the Bone Washing Pool that you mentioned?

73
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,159
That's right.

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,730
This is where

75
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,310
you're going to

76
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,560
get a rebirth.

77
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,190
It's also the Gate connecting the two realms.

78
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,520
The 12th year is coming.

79
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,580
Xuanye,

80
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,280
Beyond this is your home,

81
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,180
the Carefree Land.

82
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,840
You know what?

83
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,870
I once accidentally entered that place

84
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,360
and saw one of the most unforgettable scenes in my life.

85
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,020
Demons and monsters abounded

86
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
and ran rampant;

87
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,480
each one was unbelievably strong and mighty.

88
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,880
Even if only one in 10,000

89
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
of such formidable demons come

90
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,850
to the mortal world,

91
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,750
it'll bring

92
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,770
catastrophic disaster to mankind.

93
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,810
But they can't.

94
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,020
I am from the Mystic Panther clan.

95
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,390
Our mission

96
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,890
is to guard this Realm Gate

97
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,880
and prevent the Carefree Land's demons

98
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,610
from coming to the human world.

99
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,320
Is that so?

100
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,030
But you came here.

101
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,210
So did your brother.

102
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,830
How can you guarantee they won't come?

103
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,030
And how can you ensure that the Mystic Panthers

104
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,840
will never change

105
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,960
and will always be able to fight off

106
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,020
other demon clans?

107
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,460
So,

108
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,380
Uncle, you established the Sky Cavern here

109
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,480
not for money,

110
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,830
but to guard the Realm Gate?

111
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,630
Of course.

112
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,310
The Sky Cavern's mission

113
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,840
is to fend off the demon clans

114
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
and guard the Realm Gate.

115
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,350
If things go south one day,

116
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,370
we will fight to the death.

117
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,300
Even if we have to blow up

118
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,780
the entire Underground City,

119
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,790
we must not allow demon clans

120
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,450
to set foot in the human world.

121
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,120
I guessed so.

122
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,000
What?

123
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,670
If it weren't to fight the demon clans,

124
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,430
why would you have carved

125
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,850
the demon-subduing formations all over the stone wall?

126
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,790
Xuanye,

127
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,240
you know, we humans

128
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,600
have a saying that goes,

129
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,330
"Those not of our kind can never be trusted."

130
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,320
Not all demons

131
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,240
are like you.

132
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,850
Everything I've done

133
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,190
is just for our survival.

134
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,080
Hope the demons won't come,

135
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,320
never come.

136
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,910
Uncle,

137
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,290
when did you

138
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,520
discover this place?

139
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
I told you

140
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,140
I once fell for a fox demon.

141
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,240
Later, she accidentally

142
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,910
hurt me,

143
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,600
so she left out of guilt.

144
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,150
Since then,

145
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
I've been looking for

146
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,670
a way to turn demons into humans.

147
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,530
Now,

148
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,380
I've worked it out,

149
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,020
but I can't find her anymore.

150
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,680
Have others tried it before?

151
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,570
Yeah, sure.

152
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,600
Otherwise, how could I dare to let you try?

153
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you ready?

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,350
Xuanye.

155
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,450
Humans are born ignorant,

156
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,810
leading a sordid life of petty gains,

157
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,750
even unable to scratch the surface of what the world is really about.

158
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,440
They're naturally intimidated

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,690
by the unknown.

160
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,830
You know what?

161
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,150
Throughout history, those who made

162
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,360
great achievements weren't necessarily the smartest,

163
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,690
but definitely the bravest of their time.

164
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,750
Look.

165
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,560
The Path of Life is open.

166
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,300
Whether you want to live as a human

167
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,030
or remain a demon,

168
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,000
it's now

169
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,000
your call.

170
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,510
Please.

171
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,510
Get them!

172
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,030
Come on!

173
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,200
That way!

174
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,330
Stop there!

175
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,650
-Let's go.
-Go.

176
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,410
You're impressive fighters.

177
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,810
Miss Duan,

178
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,420
here we meet again.

179
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,480
Where's Xuanye?

180
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,140
Jiu's deeply in love with you,

181
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,380
yet you're hanging out with the demon who hurt him.

182
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,640
Aren't you afraid of breaking his heart?

183
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,390
You are the ones who want to hurt him!

184
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,670
We've helped you guys over and over again,

185
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,330
but you blindly trust a demon.

186
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,030
It's truly disheartening.

187
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,630
Cut the crap, dude.

188
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,840
We've already sent a message.

189
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,960
If we die here,

190
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,970
I swear

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,000
not a single living being

192
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,350
will survive in your Sky Cavern.

193
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,790
Catch them.

194
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
-Yes!
-Let's go!

195
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,720
No time to waste! I'm going to find Xuanye!

196
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,360
Not bad, Commissioner.

197
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,980
I am your superior.

198
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,480
If I couldn't outdo you,

199
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,330
how could I deserve my salary?

200
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,530
Oh, arrogance.

201
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,310
What's wrong?

202
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,020
Are you afraid now?

203
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,160
Uncle, you're right.

204
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,260
I am indeed afraid.

205
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,280
I am not the bravest

206
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,640
of our time.

207
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,250
Sorry for having troubled you, Uncle.

208
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,750
I need to ponder over

209
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,850
where my future path

210
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,920
should lead.

211
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,290
I'll take my leave now.

212
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,170
Stop there.

213
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,410
When did you find it out?

214
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,160
You were rushing it.

215
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,150
I haven't known you and Lyu

216
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,840
for very long.

217
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,010
Usually, you all maintain

218
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,430
a calm demeanor

219
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,630
come what may.

220
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,240
But you showed unusual concern only for

221
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,840
my demon-human transformation

222
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,240
in the Underground City.

223
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,120
I found it

224
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,210
a bit off back then.

225
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,360
Maybe it was just

226
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,290
out of our genuine concern for you.

227
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,120
That's

228
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,010
what I thought in the first place.

229
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,870
But soon,

230
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,320
I once again

231
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,380
lost consciousness and transformed

232
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,370
into a panther.

233
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,320
Could it be related to the Peerless Bracelet?

234
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,030
Yes,

235
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,320
I thought

236
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,650
the same the first time.

237
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,330
But the second time,

238
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,750
I was pretty sure that

239
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,490
someone was deliberately causing this.

240
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,320
Zi Kong was the only one who managed to

241
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,180
make it before.

242
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,860
So I went to find him.

243
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,680
Did you find him?

244
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,810
No, I didn't.

245
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,510
But I discovered

246
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,840
where you ambushed him.

247
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,790
The Eight Pillar Sect's Dragon-locking Formation

248
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,880
and the Underground City's pass token,

249
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,070
I do recognize them.

250
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,840
If Zi Kong

251
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,500
really got caught by you guys,

252
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,040
then who was the one

253
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
plotting against me?

254
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,630
Uncle,

255
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,480
I really can't figure out

256
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,510
what you are up to.

257
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,170
If you think I'm a demon,

258
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,350
you can just go ahead and kill me.

259
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
Why bother going to such lengths

260
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,150
to put on this show

261
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,480
of being a caring uncle?

262
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,740
Out of curiosity about

263
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,780
your views on the demon clans,

264
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,600
I went to

265
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,720
the 18 Stores

266
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,180
and checked the records of Song Qi's

267
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,580
entries and exits in the Underground City.

268
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,240
He has never left

269
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,500
the Underground City.

270
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,650
But you told me in your letter that

271
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,740
he had already been sent away.

272
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,720
So,

273
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,080
Uncle,

274
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,980
you were lying.

275
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,230
Our Sky Cavern is wealthy and powerful.

276
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,790
Perhaps we used some means

277
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,390
to send him away in secret.

278
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:34,720
No,

279
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,410
you killed him.

280
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Over these years,

281
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,790
the Sky Cavern's been buying demons at high prices.

282
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,480
Many demon hunter friends of mine

283
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,810
are all your customers.

284
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,670
Even Jiang Shangyun and his disciple

285
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,250
were your honored guests.

286
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,360
[Jiang Shangyun]

287
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,720
The two of them

288
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,050
were also killed by you, right?

289
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,080
You've collected loads of demons.

290
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,930
Where are you hiding them all?

291
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,010
If I'm not mistaken,

292
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,920
you've thrown them all

293
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,849
into the Bone Washing Pool, right?

294
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,569
You used Banxia to lure me,

295
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,970
orchestrating a plan to drive me out of control,

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,680
just to make me

297
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,410
jump into the Bone Washing Pool

298
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,900
and get my demon bones.

299
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,010
You do have the guts then.

300
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,000
You knew I was up to something, yet you

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,130
still dared to come?

302
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,170
I had to figure out

303
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,930
what tricks you were playing.

304
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,830
Otherwise, I'd be a pain to live

305
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,350
on guard against you every day.

306
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,610
Aren't you afraid that

307
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,030
you might not be able to leave once you're here?

308
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,360
Are you going to kill me?

309
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,630
I've never offended you, have I?

310
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,080
If you want to kill me,

311
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,920
you've had so many chances to do it before.

312
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Why did you have to wait until today?

313
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,850
This Bone Washing Pool

314
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,880
can't help me transform

315
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
from a demon into a human, I guess.

316
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,100
You want me to jump into it.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
What exactly do you want?

318
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,770
My primordial spirit?

319
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,560
Or my physical body?

320
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,120
Your Sky Cavern

321
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,920
has been running in the Underground City for years.

322
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,650
You must have great ambitions.

323
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,800
Are you

324
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,110
plotting against the Carefree Land, Uncle?

325
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,110
Enough!

326
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,880
Alright.

327
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,680
Since you've already guessed it,

328
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,280
I won't beat around the bush.

329
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,120
Given our relationship,

330
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,290
as long as you jump into it on your own,

331
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,490
perhaps our Eight Pillar Sect

332
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,690
can still maintain some final dignity.

333
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,510
Jump!

334
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,240
Uncle,

335
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,130
stop joking around.

336
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,220
You want to kill me,

337
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,110
so there's already no dignity left

338
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,310
between the two of us!

339
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,700
Maybe it's not too late

340
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,300
to change your mind and stop here.

341
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,310
It's too late.

342
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,640
It's already been too late

343
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,700
since 12 years ago.

344
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,400
So cut the crap!

345
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,090
The Greedy Wolf Sword?

346
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,690
My stubborn old master

347
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,480
refused to pass down the Hidden Dragon Case

348
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,000
to me.

349
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,550
Instead, he insisted on

350
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,070
giving it to your unambitious father,

351
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,160
letting such a treasure end up

352
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,820
being held by a demon like you!

353
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
How ridiculous.

354
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,070
The Eight Pillar Sect values harmony with all beings

355
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,400
and going with the flow.

356
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,880
A radical man like you

357
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,840
could never understand it.

358
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,760
Let me go! Let go!

359
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,720
Banxia!

360
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,790
Xuanye!

361
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,750
The Bone Washing Pool can't help you

362
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,710
transform into a human.

363
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,880
Instead, it will kill you!

364
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,940
Get out of here now!

365
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,190
Let her go!

366
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,000
She has nothing to do with this!

367
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,060
She does have nothing to do with this.

368
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,000
So, Xuanye,

369
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,240
as long as you jump into

370
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,440
the pool on your own,

371
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,480
I'll let her go.

372
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,410
I'm a man of my word.

373
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,710
Xuanye, don't listen to his nonsense!

374
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,270
Shut up!

375
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,160
Xuanye,

376
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,350
her survival

377
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,010
is actually not decided by me.

378
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,780
It all depends on you.

379
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,400
You know I'm not

380
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,480
a patient person.

381
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,120
Push her down.

382
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,460
Good, you're here too!

383
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,140
Now you two brothers have gathered here.

384
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,000
Kill them!

385
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,080
Yes, Master!

386
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,690
Let's end this quickly.

387
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,760
That's also what I'm thinking.

388
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,250
Man Ying!

389
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,230
Do you still remember the skills

390
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,290
Father taught you?

391
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,550
Yes.

392
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:19,960
Good.

393
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,590
Then show me

394
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,970
how much progress you've made

395
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,260
after all these years in the human world.

396
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,680
Interesting.

397
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Watch out!

398
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,770
I'll break this formation with Shao Li Lance.

399
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,900
If there's a chance,

400
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,060
take it and escape.

401
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,480
Once the formation is bust,

402
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,140
we'll both fall into the pool.

403
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,560
I have a plan.

404
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,880
Just do as I say.

405
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,270
But...

406
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,280
Don't argue.

407
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,970
I'm your older brother.

408
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,570
You should listen to me.

409
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,750
Lingying.

410
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,970
I'll kill you!

411
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,350
Youhuang.

412
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,080
Youhuang.

413
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,130
Commissioner, I'm fine.

414
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,240
Youhuang.

415
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,970
Youhuang...

416
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,030
Youhuang?

417
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,070
I truly underestimated you two.

418
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,470
However, this show

419
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,870
should come to an end now.

420
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,720
Man Ying,

421
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm entrusting the Mystic Panther Clan and the Carefree Land

422
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,940
to you now.

423
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,480
You were too slow!

424
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,720
I was letting you win.

425
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,310
Funny. Then let's do it again!

426
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,550
I'd rather rest a bit.

427
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,700
Let's take a break.

428
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,960
Zi Kong,

429
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,480
what do you want to do when you grow up?

430
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,410
Like our father,

431
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,100
I want to be the clan leader

432
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,680
to protect the Carefree Land and Mystic Panthers.

433
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,540
What about you?

434
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,240
Me?

435
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,480
I want to

436
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,830
be your support.

437
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,190
If you really become the leader

438
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,150
of the Mystic Panther Clan in the future,

439
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,790
remember that

440
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,030
I'm also one of them,

441
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,750
and you should protect me too.

442
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,400
Of course.

443
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,450
No matter when,

444
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,380
I will always protect you.

445
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,470
Congratulations, Master,

446
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,840
on collecting 1,000 demons' bones!

447
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,050
You've transformed into a demon?

448
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,400
Ridiculous, huh?

449
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,550
I've actually turned into a demon,

450
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,750
what I hated the most!

451
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,760
I've become a demon.

452
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,230
Miss Duan,

453
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,240
I know you don't recognize me,

454
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,480
but do you remember

455
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,970
the human trafficker who sold you?

456
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,740
So beautiful.

457
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,680
I know, right?

458
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,920
It's pretty. I think...

459
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,800
This one is nice too.

460
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,410
I have some candy here. Come on.

461
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,900
That day in the filthiest, narrowest alley

462
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,220
of the Underground City,

463
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,110
I killed that demon,

464
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,070
avenging my entire family.

465
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,300
Fate does work in mysterious ways.

466
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,280
It was also on that day

467
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,740
that I met you.

468
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,000
You have nowhere to escape now.

469
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,860
Go back with me!

470
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,680
Let go of me!

471
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,770
You little brat, you...

472
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,920
I should say thank you.

473
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,510
You were the one

474
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,570
who brought me into the Carefree Land.

475
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
There,

476
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,640
I saw the origin of all demons,

477
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,910
the Carefree Herb.

478
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,910
That place was awash with primordial spirits.

479
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,680
I finally realized

480
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,470
why more demons would appear

481
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,350
every 12 years,

482
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,590
like a never-ending cycle with demons emerging infinitely.

483
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,880
I supposed that

484
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,480
if I could destroy the Carefree Herb,

485
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,310
there would be no more primordial spirits in this world,

486
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,480
and thus, no more demons as well.

487
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,350
But I hated myself

488
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,310
because I was human!

489
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
Humans can do nothing

490
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,840
in the Carefree Land!

491
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,590
I needed to find a way

492
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,550
to turn myself into a demon.

493
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,470
Only then can I sneak into the Carefree Land

494
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,860
and eliminate all the demons!

495
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,570
Is this the solution you've come up with

496
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,880
as a demon hunter?

497
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,239
That's right.

498
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,070
To get rid of demons,

499
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,630
I must become a demon first!

500
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,590
Dream on!

501
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,460
You're right. It is a dream.

502
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,880
But my dream

503
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,960
is about to come true,

504
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,000
while your dream

505
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,330
will never be realized.

506
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:50,880
Xuanye!

507
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,860
The Realm Gate is about to open.

508
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,030
Behold the doomsday for the demon clans!

509
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,760
Wait for another 12 years

510
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,840
if you want to enter the Carefree Land!

511
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,030
Seriously?

512
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,400
No one can stop me!

513
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,360
Open!

514
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,460
Now!

515
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,710
Fine.

516
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,290
Since you are stopping me from opening it,

517
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,680
I'll reduce the entire Underground City

518
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,340
and the whole Guangping City

519
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,030
to ashes right now!

520
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,110
Let's all die together!

521
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,360
Go to hell together!

522
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,630
The Origin-returning Sword?

523
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,290
The Origin-returning Sword!

524
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,090
I've planned for a lifetime,

525
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,930
giving it my everything.

526
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,800
How could I fail?

527
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,180
Banxia!

528
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,490
Banxia.

529
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:31,900
Banxia.

530
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,310
How are you doing?

531
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,630
This place is about to collapse.

532
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,310
You should leave now.

533
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:41,920
How could I possibly

534
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,850
leave you behind

535
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,230
and get out by myself?

536
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,070
I have no strength to leave.

537
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,590
Just go.

538
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,510
Banxia.

539
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,880
Xuanye,

540
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,400
there's no time to waste. You need to go now.

541
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,800
Banxia.

542
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,800
Forget me.

543
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,800
♫Wishing for a nice city♫
