[The Demon Hunter's Romance]

2
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,009
[Episode 31]

3
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,110
You were originally from the Mystic Panther Clan.

4
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,870
Someone used a secret technique

5
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,430
to suppress your beastly nature for nearly 10 years.

6
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,280
Suddenly breaking free from the restraints,

7
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,710
it's naturally difficult to control yourself.

8
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,039
If you can't control it,

9
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,710
then don't try to control it anymore.

10
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,040
Follow your bloodline.

11
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,790
Do what you want to do.

12
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,840
You are so powerful.

13
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,970
This world

14
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,220
should be your hunting ground.

15
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,360
It's you?

16
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,250
How about it?

17
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,960
Now you know

18
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,690
your true identity, don't you?

19
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

20
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,220
I'm just telling you the truth.

21
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,250
You don't hate those who kept it from you,

22
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,579
but you hate me instead?

23
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,160
You're really ungrateful.

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,180
None of your business.

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,860
You are my brother.

26
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,720
Of course this is my business.

27
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,800
I won't go with you.

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,030
Dream on!

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,970
You're so stubborn.

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,340
I'll beat some sense into you.

31
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,540
Xuanye!

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,260
If you have the guts, just kill me.

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,920
You'd rather die than be a demon.

34
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,560
What kind of

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,840
spell did they put you under

36
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,100
to make you so devoted?

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,300
I'll ask you one more time.

38
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,250
Are you coming with me or not?

39
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,790
Don't even think about it.

40
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,750
Fine.

41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,030
Fine.

42
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,290
Humans and demons can't coexist.

43
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,590
You're a demon,

44
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,520
yet you're desperate to be human.

45
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,980
Then I'll grant your wish.

46
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,960
I'll let you see

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,460
whether anyone will still accept you

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,470
if your identity is exposed.

49
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,540
Xuanye, are you alright?

50
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,000
Father,

51
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,600
Mother,

52
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,159
Big Brother,

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,060
I've come to see you again.

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,670
All these years,

55
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,760
whenever I return from demon hunting,

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,700
I always come to visit you,

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,870
clean your room,

58
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,360
and tell you

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
about my experiences

60
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,750
while hunting demons.

61
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,600
It's as if

62
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,690
you're right here beside me.

63
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,830
Father,

64
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,500
I never understood before

65
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,160
why

66
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,680
I couldn't remember

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,080
anything before I was 12,

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,390
why

69
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,120
you gave me the Peerless Bracelet,

70
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,159
why

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,600
you wouldn't let me go to the Underground City,

72
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:40,600
and why

73
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,490
all of you were poisoned by demons

74
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,020
while I alone was unaffected.

75
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,390
Now,

76
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,210
I understand everything.

77
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,430
It's actually quite simple.

78
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,000
Because

79
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,230
I am a demon.

80
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,470
♫Just sobered up after a dream, sighing for my life♫

81
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,270

♫The other side sees fantasies fading into obscurity♫

85
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,310
How ironic.

Father,

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,750
you once told me

92
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,180

93

that people can be good or evil,

95
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,320
and demons

96
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,800
are the same.

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,690
I can't generalize.

98
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
♫If there were no regrets♫

99
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,800

Let's begin!

138
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,770
Come on, pass the ball!

139
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Give it to me!

140
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,270
Xuanye,

141
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,690
will we ever return to Guangping?

142
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,880
I don't know.

143
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
Then where will we go?

144
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,240
I don't know.

145
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,410
Should we open a pharmacy somewhere else?

146
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,000
Xuanye,

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,020
if you have nowhere else to go,

148
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,660
why don't you come with me?

149
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,090
You taught me how to be human before

150
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,240
and you did a good job.

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,700
Now it's my turn to teach you how to be a demon.

152
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,550
Don't worry.

153
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,150
I'm sure I can teach you well.

154
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,500
If you're willing,

155
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,850
you could even be my companion demon.

156
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,640
Or I could be your companion demon.

157
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,440
I don't care about these things.

158
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,510
Chi Xue.

159
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,790
Don't follow me anymore.

160
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,290
Why?

161
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,180
When I transform,

162
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,360
my mind becomes chaotic.

163
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,690
I can't control myself.

164
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
I'm afraid I might hurt you.

165
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,960
It's okay.

166
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,150
I can run fast.

167
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,440
Next time, I'll run as soon as you transform.

168
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,320
I'll come back when you return to human form.

169
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,450
I promise you won't be able to catch me.

170
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,120
Xuanye,

171
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,770
don't be upset.

172
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,510
There's nothing wrong with being a demon.

173
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,150
Didn't your father say before

174
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,770
that humans and demons are the same?

175
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,430
As long as you act righteously,

176
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,230
there's nothing to be afraid of.

177
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,090
I'm a panther demon.

178
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,270
Aren't you afraid I'll eat you?

179
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,390
You are Xuanye.

180
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,040
Xuanye never eats rabbits.

181
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Hurry!

182
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Don't let that panther demon escape!

183
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,960
The demon is over there!

184
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,910
Quick, let's go!

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,060
Over there, hurry!

186
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,840
Hurry!

187
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,550
It's over there! Let's go, quick, quick, quick!

188
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,320
Hurry up!

189
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,030
They said panther demon.

190
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,750
Could it be...

191
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,950
Let's go check it out.

192
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,080
We've searched everywhere, inside and outside the city.

193
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,870
There's not

194
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,270
a single trace of Xuanye.

195
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,880
Banxia has left with her parents.

196
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,230
He'll be furious when he hears about this.

197
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,360
This guy...

198
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Seriously...

199
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,290
He left without even

200
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,490
saying goodbye to us.

201
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,370
Wen Jian.

202
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Who are those two?

203
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:22,780
They must be

204
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,810
the demon hunters the lord invited.

205
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,320
Demon hunters?

206
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,390
Hasn't Xuanye already gone?

207
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,060
Why do we need other demon hunters?

208
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,090
Xuanye was supposed to

209
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,630
get married recently, wasn't he?

210
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,080
You think the lord

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,540
is as shortsighted as you?

212
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,520
Bad news!

213
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,720
Bad news!

214
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,480
Chief Constable Chu,

215
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
Chief Constable Wen,

216
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,360
the panther demon...

217
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,490
The panther demon has appeared again!

218
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,790
The demonic aura is strong.

219
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,450
It must be in these mountains.

220
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,270
I can smell it too.

221
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,780
Where is it?

222
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,830
It's coming from you.

223
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,180
Let's split up and search.

224
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,670
Chi Xue.

225
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,520
Be careful.

226
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,070
Don't try to be a hero.

227
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,000
Got it!

228
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,910
Mother!

229
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,390
I want to go home!

230
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,240
Mother!

231
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,880
I want to go home!

232
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,160
Mother!

233
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,670
I want to go home!

234
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,550
Mother!

235
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,240
I want to go home!

236
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,790
I want to go home!

237
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,360
I want to go home!

238
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm scared.

239
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
You're fast.

240
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,200
Demon!

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,800
Are you talking about yourself?

242
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,080
So fierce.

243
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,390
Very well.

244
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,960
Since you like to play,

245
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,020
I'll play with you.

246
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,430
Nine Spirits Suppression.

247
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,570
Reverse Blood Flow!

248
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,020
How's that?

249
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,240
Fun, isn't it?

250
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,150
This is the Heart-Killing Technique that Father taught me personally.

251
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,810
I never thought the first time

252
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,220
I'd use it would be on you.

253
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,920
How is it?

254
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,150
Compared to the techniques

255
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,810
your human father taught you,

256
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,480
which is

257
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,500
superior?

258
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,440
I've sealed your transformation ability.

259
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,500
For the time being,

260
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,530
don't even think about changing back to human form.

261
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,190
Man Ying,

262
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,190
don't hate me.

263
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,610
All my arrangements

264
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,650
were simply to teach you

265
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,640
why they say humans and demons walk different paths.

266
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,480
Time is short.

267
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,960
Understand it soon.

268
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,630
Over here!

269
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,370
You insolent demon,

270
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,870
you dared to enter the city

271
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,310
and hurt people in broad daylight.

272
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,440
The demon is injured.

273
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,900
Kill it!

274
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,480
Kill!

275
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,030
Demon, prepare to die!

276
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,630
Chi Xue!

277
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,930
How was that?

278
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,090
Am I impressive?

279
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,980
Run! I'll protect you.

280
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,730
Go!

281
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,700
Go!

282
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,000
Go...

283
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Just a beast waiting for slaughter.

284
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,030
Everyone,

285
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,830
subdue the demon!

286
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,200
My Lady.

287
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,200
My Lady!

288
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,070
Banxia.

289
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,360
Banxia!

290
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,030
My Lady!

291
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,400
Banxia!

292
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,310
Banxia.

293
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,400
Banxia.

294
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,750
What's wrong, Banxia?

295
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,150
Did you have a nightmare?

296
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,750
Banxia.

297
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,200
Where are we?

298
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,760
We are

299
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,120
on our way back to our hometown in Nanyang.

300
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,110
Banxia.

301
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,380
Last night,

302
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,700
you were delirious with fever.

303
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,790
Your father was afraid that when you woke up,

304
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,010
you wouldn't want to leave.

305
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,130
So he made the decision early this morning

306
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,640
and we set off for home.

307
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,960
♫Melody echoes along the river; wild geese soar in sudden fright♫

308
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,790
Mother.

309
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,120
♫The music ends, and I stand in solitude♫

310
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,200
I can't leave.

311
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,330
Mother, I can't leave.

♫I see you turn into a handful of starlight♫

313

♫Drifting past me♫

315
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,010
I know Grandmother is getting old.

316
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,660
She needs me to go back and keep her company.

317
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,140
I should go back,

318
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,550
♫In tears, the past memories still glow♫

319
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,720
but Xuanye is now

320
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,920
in danger.

♫Crystallized into cold amber♫

322

♫I know it also brought you great pain to let go♫

324
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,160
I can't abandon him.

♫But why did you♫

327
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,510
But if you go back now,

328
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,640
what can you do?

329
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,800
♫Still endure the pain and shatter♫

330
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,400
I can stay with him.

331
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,110
I can comfort him.

332
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,070

♫Remember me, don't miss me♫

334
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,310
I can save him.

Mother,

336
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,450

♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

338

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,750
However,

382
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,200
I have already informed my sect

383
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
and requested my master to handle it.

384
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,260
That's excellent.

385
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,270
Well,

386
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,640
I'll leave it to you two Immortal Masters to handle then.

387
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,400
Please,

388
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,640
don't let that demon suddenly attack and harm people again.

389
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,400
Please rest assured, Lord Geng.

390
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,660
With the two of us here,

391
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,680
it won't dare.

392
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,070
Thank you for your efforts.

393
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,390
Master,

394
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,820
this demon is quite fierce.

395
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,050
On the way back, I've already sent a letter

396
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,780
to that lord in the Underground City.

397
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,120
Once we receive the reward,

398
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,110
we'll hand it over.

399
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,770
This matter

400
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,070
will then have nothing to do with us.

401
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,640
Master,

402
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,330
haven't we seen

403
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,020
this demon somewhere before?

404
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,360
What do you mean?

405
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,370
Just a feeling.

406
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,640
Feeling?

407
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,070
Your cultivation is not sufficient.

408
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,480
Don't let your imagination run wild all day.

409
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,010
Focus on your cultivation.

410
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,030
[Ganshan Clinic]

411
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,050
What are you doing?

412
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,750
The lord said

413
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,270
it's the demon hunters' duty to exorcise demons

414
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,400
and protect the Way.

415
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,940
No one is allowed to give them trouble.

416
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:16,880
But...

417
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,120
If it weren't for those two.

418
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,250
Chi Xue wouldn't have died.

419
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,550
Chi Xue was a demon.

420
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,310
Do you want to seek justice

421
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,370
for a demon in the government office?

422
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,650
Even if you want to,

423
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,370
you must plan for the long term.

424
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,540
Besides, I always feel

425
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
something is off about this matter.

426
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,160
Why would Chi Xue be willing

427
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,400
to risk his own life

428
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,560
to help that panther demon?

429
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,080
Stop it! All of you, stop it!

430
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,590
What are you trying to do?

431
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,570
There's a demon locked up in here.

432
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,110
You're being way too reckless!

433
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,550
Demon?

434
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,940
So what if it's a demon?

435
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,270
It ate my child!

436
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,080
A life for a life!

437
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,480
I want it to pay with its life!

438
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,280
Right, make it pay with its life!

439
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,990
Fellow villagers!

440
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,240
Everyone, please calm down and listen to me.

441
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,330
The demon indeed deserves to die.

442
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,480
It's our responsibility as demon hunters

443
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,880
to eliminate evil demons

444
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,640
and protect the people.

445
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,720
However, this demon is fierce and dangerous.

446
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,380
Ordinary methods won't work against it.

447
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,310
You won't be able to kill it either.

448
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,490
Therefore,

449
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,300
we need to take it back to our sect

450
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,680
and let my master deal with it.

451
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,430
Nonsense!

452
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,770
How can it not be killed?

453
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,920
I don't care what kind of demon it is.

454
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Today,

455
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,920
I'll burn it to death with fire!

456
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
You can't take the demon away!

457
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,640
We must burn it to death right here!

458
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
Stop making trouble!

459
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,960
Stop causing a commotion!

460
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,920
Oh, my son...

461
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,880
Burn it to death.

462
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,590
We must burn it to death today!

463
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,750
I'm 36 years old

464
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,680
and only had this one son,

465
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,720
but it ate him!

466
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,680
I don't care!

467
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,270
I want it to pay with its life!

468
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,070
The demon must pay with its life!

469
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,910
It's that one!

470
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,920
Fellow villagers,

471
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,760
this is the one that harmed my child!

472
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,290
I'll fight you to the death!

473
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,950
Kill it! Burn it to death!

474
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,510
All of you, stop!

475
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,310
Whoever causes more trouble

476
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,310
will be locked up!

477
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,900
Who let the villagers in?

478
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,350
Ask your own men

479
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,590
why they didn't stop the villagers

480
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,720
from barging in.

481
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,790
Why did you lower this black cloth?

482
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,070
The villagers have harbored too much resentment.

483
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,350
It's good to let them vent a little.

484
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,610
Who gave you the authority?

485
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,980
Lord Geng has already

486
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,410
entrusted me to manage this place.

487
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,250
Come with me to see Lord Geng.

488
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,790
Chief Constable Wen!

489
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,720
Banxia.

490
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,130
Any news about Xuanye and Chi Xue?

491
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,440
I just went to Ganshan Clinic,

492
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,720
but the door was still closed.

493
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,850
Have they returned?

494
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,590
I...

495
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,110
Did something happen?

496
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,920
This morning, a panther demon appeared

497
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,250
and abducted a child outside the academy.

498
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,400
Lord Geng

499
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
summoned two demon hunters.

500
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,520
For some reason,

501
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,030
Chi Xue desperately protected

502
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,490
that black panther demon.

503
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,440
He...

504
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:53,960
He...

505
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,960
Chi Xue died?

506
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,080
Xuanye has also disappeared.

507
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,740
He probably doesn't know about this yet.

508
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,400
What about that panther demon?

509
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,930
Where is the panther demon?

510
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,650
It was captured by those two demon hunters.

511
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,450
It's locked up in the courtyard.

512
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,070
Demon!

513
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,550
Kill the demon! Demon!

514
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,110
Beat the demon! Kill it! Burn it!

515
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,550
Stop! Don't hit it anymore!

516
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,280
Stop smashing! Stop smashing!

517
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,030
Stop hitting it!

518
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,270
I'm sorry.

519
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,030
It's my fault.

520
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,370
I didn't tell you.

521
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,590
Tell me

522
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,790
how I can help you escape,

523
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,270
Xuanye.

524
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,070
Tell me quickly.

525
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:27,610
Tell me

526
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,270
how I can help you escape!

527
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,340
Kill it!

528
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,750
Kill it!

529
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,440
We can't let it live!

530
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,270
Run!

531
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,310
Banxia!

532
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,660
Banxia! Ban—

533
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,920
Banxia!

534
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,310
Get out of the way!

535
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,270
There's no one here anymore.

536
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,130
Xuanye, you...

537
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,330
Are you alright?

538
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,610
Don't be angry with me.

539
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
You think if you're mean to me,

540
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,820
you'll scare me away?

541
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,690
I've searched for you for so long.

542
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,750
I've thought about you for so long.

543
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,720
How could I possibly

544
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,120
be scared away so easily?

545
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,010
Run! Don't worry about me!

546
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,580
So what's your name?

547
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,790
My name is Man Ying!

548
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,480
Now, run!

549
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,230
I remember I told you before.

550
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,180
When I was little, I encountered danger.

551
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,920
A boy named Man Ying

552
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,590
saved me.

553
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,790
He was injured while saving me.

554
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,590
A drop of his blood fell

555
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,720
into my left eye.

556
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,550
Since then,

557
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,160
I've been able to see demons.

558
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,170
Everyone told me

559
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,530
that it was just a dream.

560
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,310
Only I knew

561
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,440
it wasn't.

562
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,030
But for some reason,

563
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,350
I could never find

564
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,350
that place again.

565
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,740
I couldn't find Man Ying anymore.

566
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,510
I thought that was the end.

567
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,220
If it was a dream,

568
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,370
one would eventually wake up.

569
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,310
Wouldn't I become crazy

570
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,240
if I lived in a dream forever?

571
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,070
Xuanye...

572
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,690
We've met again.

573
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,440
It's just that you don't remember

574
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,920
that you are Man Ying.

575
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,180
You don't remember me.

576
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,110
But I haven't forgotten.

577
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,389
What's wrong?

578
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,670
Xuanye!

579
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,110
Xuanye!

580
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,440
Beast.

581
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,710
Attack!

582
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,840
You've made a mistake!

583
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,210
He's not the one who hurt people.

584
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,810
Banxia!

585
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,590
It's dangerous!

586
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,650
Come here quickly!

587
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,380
Don't hurt him! He's Xuanye!

588
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,910
Catch the panther demon.

589
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,880
Stop it!

590
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,120
Stop it!

591
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,870
Stop it!

592
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,080
Xuanye, I'm fine.

593
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,590
It's okay.

594
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,110
Miss Duan.

595
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Immortal Master!

596
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,630
Xuanye.

597
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,590
Xuanye.

598
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,800
Xuan...

599
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,710
Master,

600
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,330
he—

601
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,680
Mother!

602
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,650
Son!

603
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,480
Son, son!

604
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,960
You're back!

605
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,340
Let me see if you're hurt.

606
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,960
Mother.

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
It's alright.

608
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,230
There, there. Don't cry.

609
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,030
Good child, it's alright, it's alright.

610
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,070
It's good that you're back.

611
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,400
It's good you're back.

612
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,620
Don't cry now, it's okay, it's okay.

613
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,280
My Lord, why did you arrest Banxia?

614
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
She's not a demon.

615
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,870
That's right, My Lord.

616
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,030
Let me ask you all.

617
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,320
The two Immortal Masters said

618
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,440
that Xuanye is that black panther demon.

619
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,500
Is it true or false?

620
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,320
My Lord,

621
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,630
that's just

622
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,230
their one-sided statement.

623
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,480
Then where is Xuanye now?

624
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,840
Isn't Xuanye often away?

625
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,990
Maybe he's gone to catch demons.

626
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,960
But that rabbit demon

627
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,730
is his companion, right?

628
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,790
In that case,

629
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,640
that case from six years ago

630
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,190
must be related to him.

631
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,150
This case has wide implications.

632
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,710
Until it's fully investigated,

633
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,370
Duan Banxia

634
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,030
is not allowed to leave even half a step.

635
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,590
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

636
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,790
You may all leave now.

637
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,520
Miss Duan,

638
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,280
we meet again.

639
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,010
You called that panther demon Xuanye.

640
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Could is be that the successor of the Eight Pillar Sect

641
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,120
is a demon?

642
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,950
Even if you don't tell me,

643
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,830
I can still catch him.

644
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,510
Did anyone actually see that panther demon

645
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,030
abduct the child?

646
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,670
Yes,

647
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,960
it was witnessed.

648
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,390
That's impossible.

649
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,440
Xuanye would never harm anyone.

650
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,520
The one who abducted the child

651
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,360
must be another demon.

652
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,360
You've got the wrong person.

653
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,230
Masters,

654
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,110
the child has been returned.

655
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,080
Banxia is injured

656
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,450
and the lord refuses to release her.

657
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,740
I don't know if she can hold on

658
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,740
in prison.

659
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,580
Poor Banxia.

660
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,410
I just never thought

661
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,220
Xuanye was really a panther demon.

662
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I've known Xuanye for so many years,

663
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,880
and have seen him catch so many demons with my own eyes.

664
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,140
I never expected this.

665
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,830
No wonder Chi Xue

666
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,960
protected him at all costs before.

667
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,370
It seems Banxia

668
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
has known Xuanye's identity all along.

669
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,960
So what if she knew?

670
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,920
The kidnapped child

671
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,540
has been released, hasn't he?

672
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,070
It proves it wasn't Xuanye.

673
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,420
But you should know

674
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,000
that to the people,

675
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,210
Xuanye will always be a demon.

676
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,420
What does it matter if one is a demon or human?

677
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,760
If demons don't harm and humans don't do evil,

678
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,230
neither should be arrested.

679
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,160
Why are you here?

680
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,730
To help, of course.

681
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,960
Help?

682
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
You don't need it?

683
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,290
We do.

684
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,690
Better late than never.

685
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,890
How can you help?

686
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,050
By rescuing Banxia.

687
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,360
I am a judicial commissioner of the Court of Judicial Review.

688
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,680
I have the authority to supervise, impeach, and review cases.

689
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,920
I believe this case of yours

690
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,840
has been misjudged.

691
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,540
So I want to bring out the detained suspect

692
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,360
for questioning

693
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,490
to review this case.

694
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,660
Your rank is lower than Lord Geng's.

695
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,860
How can you review it?

696
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,650
We'll review it secretly.

697
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,750
How secretly are we talking?

698
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,030
We'll quietly bring the person out.

699
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,070
What if someone tries to stop us?

700
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,890
Knock them out.

701
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:31,960
Isn't that a jailbreak?

702
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,400
No, jailbreaking is illegal.

703
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,460
This is just flexible case handling.

704
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,400
Well,

705
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,400
can we do it without knocking people out?

706
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:39,960
Sure.

707
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,670
You figure it out.

708
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,230
Xuanye.

709
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,510
Uncle.

710
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,900
Xuan...

711
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,860
Xuanye?

712
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,150
She's awake.

713
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,880
She's awake.

714
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,670
Go find Xuanye.

715
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,850
We need to go to

716
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,960
the Underground City's Sky Cavern

717
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,820
to find Xuanye.

718
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,070
I know,

719
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,350
but you're seriously injured right now.

720
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:27,820
Come on.

721
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,510
Rest for a while first.

722
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,570
We'll go tomorrow.

723
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,760
Uncle.

724
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,130
Xuanye.

725
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,720
You're awake.

726
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,490
How long have I been asleep?

727
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,000
You've been asleep for three days.

728
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,510
Here.

729
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,600
Three days?

730
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,310
Drink some water.

731
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:58,790
Come.

732
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,300
Banxia.

733
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,690
Don't worry.

734
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,840
My people reported that

735
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,400
Miss Duan

736
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,800
has already been rescued by your friends.

737
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,510
Rescued?

738
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,440
Yes.

739
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,190
Here.

740
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,910
Drink some water.

741
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,280
I've been busy taking care of you lately,

742
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,880
so I couldn't look after her.

743
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,650
Don't worry.

744
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,650
I've already sent people to find her.

745
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Thank you, Uncle.

746
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,030
I've been keeping an eye on

747
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,630
the situation in Guangping.

748
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,920
I heard you were in trouble,

749
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,580
so I rushed over immediately.

750
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,120
But I didn't expect to be a step too late.

751
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,880
Xuanye,

752
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,290
your Peerless Bracelet

753
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,320
was shattered in the painted world

754
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,850
by the Moon-Fearing Demon.

755
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,140
Without the Peerless Bracelet,

756
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,690
you revealed your true form.

757
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,110
Uncle, you've known

758
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,190
my identity for a while, haven't you?

759
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:56,840
Yes,

760
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,230
but the Peerless Bracelet

761
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,630
is an extremely rare magic tool.

762
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,290
The method of its creation

763
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,360
was known only to your father.

764
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:01,970
So I...

765
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,630
It's just a clever illusion.

766
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,760
I don't want another one.

767
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,760
What?

768
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,910
Are you blaming your father?

769
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,670
Xuanye,

770
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,840
things are not

771
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,240
as you imagine them to be.

772
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,630
Your father has been

773
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,630
protecting you all along.
