3
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,140
Xuanye.

4
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,950
Xuanye!

5
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,030
Xuanye!

6
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,500
Xuanye.

7
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,590
No signs of escape detected.

8
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:31,930
Xuanye.

9
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,400
Get out!

10
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
You ruined my mood.

11
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,480
Why are you crying?

12
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
W-Who's speaking?

13
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,940
Don't you like this

14
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,030
aging face?

15
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,800
Do you want to regain your youth?

16
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,430
I do.

17
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,000
I do.

18
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,120
Then you need to promise me

19
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
one condition.

20
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,270
Are you willing?

21
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,360
I am.

22
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,720
You need to promise me

23
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,430
to stay by my side forever.

24
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,630
You only need to agree

25
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,600
and I can make you

26
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,610
eternally youthful.

27
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,510
Li.

28
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Because I promised you

29
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,970
I will definitely marry you properly.

30
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,900
I also want everyone in the city

31
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,930
to know

32
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,630
that the woman who will become my wife

33
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,430
is the most beautiful woman in the world.

34
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,760
No matter how you change,

35
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,600
I will forever

36
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,190
cherish you,

37
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,310
love you,

38
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,070
and be good to you.

39
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
Do you remember now?

40
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,420
They all covet

41
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,450
your beauty.

42
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,870
They don't understand you.

43
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,040
Only I

44
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,720
am the one who loves you the most.

45
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,560
So the people I loved

46
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,790
were all killed by you,

47
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,480
one

48
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
after another.

49
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm going to kill you!

50
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,270
You promised me.

51
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
You can't leave me.

52
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Ever.

53
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,510
You were great before.

54
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,240
It was them.

55
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,430
They corrupted you.

56
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,040
They're the bad ones,

57
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,310
not you.

58
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,480
I've already locked them up.

59
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,310
All those bad things

60
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,830
are forgotten.

61
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,750
Li,

62
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,920
let's start over,

63
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:25,870
okay?

64
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,390
Okay?

65
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,670
Playing tricks.

66
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,160
Xuanye.

67
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,400
Wait for me.

68
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,100
Xuanye!

69
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Who let you in?

70
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,870
Xuanye, save me!

71
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,510
Don't be afraid.

72
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,550
I'm here to save you.

73
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,630
You've got some skills, demon.

74
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,880
Go find a spot in the back

75
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,630
and take a good look

76
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,080
at how I deal with him.

77
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,430
You be careful.

78
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,270
Don't worry.

79
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,480
Okay.

80
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,150
Such arrogance

81
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,240
Whether I have arrogance or real skills,

82
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,350
you'll find out soon enough.

83
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Greedy Wolf!

84
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,000
Xuanye.

85
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,200
Don't worry.

86
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,080
No demons alive now can hurt me.

87
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,750
Mountain Shaker.

88
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,490
Be careful.

89
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,080
Don't panic.

90
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm deliberately letting him have a few moves.

91
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,030
Everything is under control.

92
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,510
Xuanye.

93
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,240
Are you alright?

94
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm fine.

95
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,390
Everything is under control.

96
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,440
Why don't you draw your sword?

97
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
A mere minor demon isn't worth drawing my sword for.

98
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,490
You seem a bit different.

99
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,750
How am I different?

100
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,030
Kid,

101
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,910
don't you understand yet?

102
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,200
Understand what?

103
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,840
You touched my mirror.

104
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,270
A part of you

105
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,150
has been sealed by me.

106
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,080
You're no match for me now.

107
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,350
Bah!

108
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,120
You're quite an old demon.

109
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,240
Have some shame, will you?

110
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,480
Xuanye, don't!

111
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,870
Don't!

112
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,080
Wake up!

113
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,750
Xuanye!

114
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,030
Come on!

115
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,270
Where is he?

116
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,270
Li.

117
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,030
Li.

118
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,270
Come with me.

119
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,960
Xuanye.

120
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,750
Let me out.

121
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,480
Let me out!

122
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,510
I'll kill you!

123
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,600
Ms. Ji Li?

124
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,600
Let me out!

125
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,840
I'll kill you!

126
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,480
I really underestimated you.

127
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,480
I have something to ask you.

128
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,069
You'd better answer honestly.

129
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,160
You don't understand what I'm saying?

130
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,720
You once kidnapped

131
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,609
someone named Duan Yingheng

132
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,480
in Nanyang City.

133
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,790
Where is he now?

134
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
In Penglai Alley, Nanyang City,

135
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,270
someone set fire to

136
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,920
the third house

137
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,990
on the left.

138
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,480
I saw a mirror at the scene

139
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,790
that couldn't reflect people.

140
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,750
There was one in my father's room too.

141
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,470
So was it you who set the fire, killed people,

142
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,460
and kidnapped my father?

143
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,590
It was me.

144
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,750
Why?

145
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,960
Half a year ago,

146
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,610
I was entrusted by a senior from the demon clan

147
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,430
to capture your father.

148
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,750
When we were in Yuanzhou,

149
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,680
I almost succeeded.

150
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,400
He was very alert.

151
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
He fled to Nanyang with his family.

152
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,380
I chased after him.

153
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,720
Just as I was about to succeed,

154
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,310
a demon

155
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,830
intervened.

156
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,510
It lent your father a life.

157
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,880
Lent a life?

158
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,030
Yes.

159
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,030
He took on your father's appearance

160
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,540
and staged that fire,

161
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,810
helping him fake his death and escape.

162
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,720
It almost fooled me.

163
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,830
Fortunately,

164
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,000
I tracked him to your home

165
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
and captured him.

166
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,110
Father?

167
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,720
Father!

168
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,630
What's wrong?

169
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,160
I beg you.

170
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,400
Please don't hurt my daughter.

171
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,270
I'm begging you.

172
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,070
I implore you.

173
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,030
Spare my daughter.

174
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,790
I'll go with you.

175
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,750
So that night,

176
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,960
you were in the room too.

177
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,570
How could anything happen to me?

178
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,750
I'm just

179
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,440
tired from organizing manuscripts without rest.

180
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,920
I'm really a bit exhausted.

181
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,160
Who's the demon that made you capture him?

182
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,590
Where is he?

183
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,680
Speak.

184
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,270
Alright,

185
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,920
I'll tell you.

186
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,640
Let's go.

187
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,750
Chi Wangchuan.

188
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,030
Banxia,

189
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,880
stop Ji Li.

190
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,880
Ms. Ji Li.

191
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,960
Li.

192
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
Li.

193
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,720
Chuan.

194
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,400
Chuan.

195
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,590
Chuan.

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,420
♫How to break off the entangled love and hate?♫

199
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,400
Chuan!

200
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,400
Chuan.

201
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:33,190
♫Sorrows and joys can't be reflected fully in mirrors♫

202
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,200
Chuan!

203
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:39,960
♫Accompanying each other through the vibrant days♫

204
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,690
♫I'll return your old dream to you♫

205
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,170
Banxia.

206
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,020
Let's go.

207
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,070
Wait a moment.

208
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,930
♫To get drunk for thousands of years♫

209
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,590
Ji Li,

210
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,510
this place is about to disintegrate.

211
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,550
We need to leave quickly.

212
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,690
♫River Styx flows♫

213
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,110
This is his memory realm.

214
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,240
He's dead.

215
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,690
♫I'm afraid I can't forget the pain♫

216
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,460
This place is going to collapse too.

217
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,070
You should leave quickly.

218
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,970
He's already dead.

219
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,530
♫I don't regret the first meeting back then♫

220
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,160
If you don't leave now, it'll be too late.

221
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,720
The person I loved is dead.

222
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,260
The person I hated is also dead.

223
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,560
Everything is over.

224
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,940
It's all self-inflicted.

225
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,830
I can't blame anyone else.

226
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,920
Hurry and leave.

227
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:39,440
♫Share days and nights with you♫

228
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,050
Let's go, Banxia.

229
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,620
Go!

230
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:45,440
♫In exchange for deep love♫

231
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,720
Chuan.

232
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,030
All love and hate have dissipated.

233
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,190
♫Entwined through the endless night♫

234
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,250
We're finally even.

235
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,190
♫Blossoms fell into eternal sleep in a blink♫

236
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:58,100
♫With no regrets, only joy in this life♫

237
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,200
This…

238
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,200
This doesn't reveal anything either.

239
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,240
Is there a possibility

240
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,900
that there's a secret passage in that inn?

241
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,960
Impossible.

242
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,980
I've torn up all the floorboards.

243
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,590
So you've torn up the floorboards,

244
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,000
but could there be a secret passage in the walls?

245
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,670
I've torn down the walls too.

246
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,660
You've torn down the walls too?

247
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,880
Everything's been torn down.

248
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,580
Are you alright?

249
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,310
Wen Jian has an emergency at home.

250
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,650
He can't make it to the appointment.

251
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,790
What business do you have with Wen Jian?

252
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,240
I want to know about the Ganshan Clinic case

253
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,330
from six years ago.

254
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,200
Six years ago, at Ganshan Clinic,

255
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
Xuanye's entire family was

256
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,560
murdered in one night.

257
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,720
Everyone said

258
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,000
it was Xuanye who did it.

259
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,130
I believed that too at the time.

260
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,070
Ganshan Clinic had few people,

261
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,880
just Xuanye's family of four

262
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,590
plus three apprentices.

263
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:45,930
His father

264
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,200
was a renowned physician.

265
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,720
Still sleeping?

266
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,880
Study hard.

267
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,800
The brothers learned medicine from their father

268
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,070
and gained some reputation.

269
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
Ganshan Clinic usually

270
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
made a living by setting bones

271
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,350
and treating injuries.

272
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,400
Of course,

273
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,310
the father and sons

274
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,680
had another identity.

275
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,880
It's what you know.

276
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,480
Demon hunters.

277
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,960
When the murder occurred,

278
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,310
I had just arrived in Guangping.

279
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,310
It was the first case I handled

280
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,880
after I came to Guangping City.

281
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,550
It was also the most horrifying crime scene

282
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,150
I had ever witnessed in my life.

283
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,000
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

284
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,680
I couldn't have imagined it at all.

285
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,110
Father!

286
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,030
Mother!

287
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:18,750
Mother!

288
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,350
Move aside!

289
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,680
Xuanye.

290
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,000
There's no saving them.

291
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,250
There's no hope.

292
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,030
Do it!

293
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,000
Xuanye.

294
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,830
Son.

295
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,640
It's not your fault.

296
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,790
It's not your fault.

297
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,070
I was tricked by the Miasma Demon.

298
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,270
But I've already killed it.

299
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,060
You don't need to be afraid.

300
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,270
It was I

301
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,590
who harmed your mother,

302
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,880
your elder brother,

303
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,690
and everyone else.

304
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,690
It has nothing to do with you.

305
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,680
Father,

306
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,160
it was me.

307
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,330
I angered the Miasma Demon.

308
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,650
That's why it came to Ganshan Clinic

309
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,590
to seek revenge.

310
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,240
I'm the one who harmed you all.

311
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,270
Do you still remember

312
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
what I told you before?

313
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,270
People can be good or evil,

314
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,510
and the same for demons.

315
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,160
Even if your parents

316
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,720
and brother

317
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,590
were all killed by demons,

318
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,750
you can't let hatred

319
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,160
blind your eyes.

320
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,070
Don't kill indiscriminately without distinguishing right from wrong.

321
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,290
Also,

322
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,920
in this world,

323
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,460
you can go anywhere,

324
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,230
except for the Underground City.

325
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,250
Humans and demons mingle there,

326
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,380
with powerful demons lurking.

327
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,880
You must not go there.

328
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:12,920
Also,

329
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,790
this Bu'er Bracelet

330
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,480
is your protective charm.

331
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,480
As long as you have it,

332
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
you'll be safe.

333
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Got it?

334
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,680
Father,

335
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:34,890
why are you

336
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,960
suddenly telling me all this?

337
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,720
It's alright,

338
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,160
Xuanye.

339
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,550
Xuanye.

340
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,310
Father.

341
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,920
Xuanye,

342
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,550
Ganshan Clinic

343
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,550
is now in your hands.

344
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,030
Also,

345
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,550
you must keep

346
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,590
the Hidden Dragon Case safe.

347
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,310
Those five swords

348
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,350
are not ordinary weapons,

349
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,880
especially the last two.

350
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,880
Never use them unless

351
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,440
it's absolutely necessary.

352
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,960
Xuanye...

353
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,440
The sword!

354
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,550
Changle Sword!

355
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,920
Xuanye!

356
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,350
Father.

357
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,270
I'll save you.

358
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,350
Don't waste your energy.

359
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,000
It's not the time for karma yet.

360
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,400
Eternal joy has not appeared.

361
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,130
It means all of this

362
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,960
is destined.

363
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,200
Our Jiu family

364
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,240
is fated

365
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,800
to face this tribulation.

366
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,790
It's just that

367
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
you've suffered so much.

368
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,640
Xuanye,

369
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,750
I don't know

370
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,270
what's best

371
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,790
for you.

372
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,790
I'm afraid I've made a mistake.

373
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,000
Father.

374
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,110
Father.

375
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,110
Hold on.

376
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,480
There are so many demon hunters in this world.

377
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,680
We'll surely find

378
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
a demon hunter who can

379
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,680
cure the miasma poison.

380
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,880
I'll take you to get treatment.

381
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,590
Let's go!

382
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,750
It's no use.

383
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,160
It's no use.

384
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,920
Son,

385
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,480
remember this.

386
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,360
Only you

387
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,550
can decide

388
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,760
who you are.

389
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,110
Father.

390
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:41,880
Father.

391
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,710
Father!

392
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,070
When I arrived

393
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,030
at the crime scene,

394
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,840
it was already daybreak.

395
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,880
Xuanye was kneeling in a pool of blood,

396
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,670
holding

397
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,150
the dagger that killed his father.

398
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,710
The scene at that time

399
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,360
made it obvious

400
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,000
that everyone

401
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,030
had died by Xuanye's hand.

402
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,880
It was undeniable.

403
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,920
So I arrested him.

404
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,840
All these years, I firmly believed

405
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,670
he was the murderer.

406
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,480
Until these past few days…

407
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:19,890
Until these past few days,

408
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,370
I came to believe in the existence of demons.

409
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,320
So I went to ask Wen Jian.

410
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,320
Wen Jian told me

411
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,740
Xuanye's entire family had been poisoned by a demon.

412
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,710
The poison was extremely vicious.

413
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,550
Once poisoned, one would lose their mind

414
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,030
and become like a wild beast.

415
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,100
Xuanye killing his family

416
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,630
must have been an act of desperation.

417
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,070
But at that time,

418
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,920
he didn't say a word in his own defense.

419
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,280
Then what did he say?

420
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,070
He said he was the murderer.

421
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,510
But why?

422
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,000
I used to think

423
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,880
he had nothing to say in his defense.

424
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,320
But now it seems

425
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
at that time,

426
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,630
he was suicidal.

427
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,190
As the day

428
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,070
of his execution approached,

429
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,440
Xuanye's master

430
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,350
suddenly came to Guangping.

431
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,360
That man had some influence.

432
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,930
I don't know what methods he used,

433
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,000
but he convinced the prefectural governor.

434
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,550
As a result, the case

435
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,280
was ruled as the work of bandits.

436
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,630
Xuanye was acquitted.

437
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,670
Of course, I wasn't convinced.

438
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,960
But the prefectural governor said

439
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,710
the bandits were just an excuse.

440
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,160
The truth was

441
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,670
there were demons at work.

442
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,280
At that time,

443
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
how could I possibly believe it?

444
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,360
Chief Constable Chu.

445
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,930
Do you know

446
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,290
if Xuanye ever suffered

447
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,360
any serious injuries?

448
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,840
In this line of work,

449
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
who doesn't get injured?

450
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,670
I mean injuries from when he was young.

451
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,230
Then I know even less about that.

452
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,890
All these years, I thought

453
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,890
he was a murderer.

454
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,030
I made things difficult for him everywhere.

455
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,590
I can't say we were friends.

456
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,510
I really want to know

457
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,030
what Xuanye was like before.

458
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,150
I heard from Wen Jian

459
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,440
that he was a free-spirited and outgoing person,

460
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,710
unrestrained and carefree.

461
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,000

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,200

The fourth drawer of the third row.

578
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,190
I found it.

579
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,180
You slept for six days straight

580
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,070
without eating or drinking anything.

581
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,730
I was afraid you'd starve to death.

582
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,190
I wanted to bring you some food,

583
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,630
but Chi Xue wouldn't let me.

584
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,550
He said when you're asleep,

585
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,710
you don't need to eat or drink.

586
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,800
Banxia,

587
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,290
Five grams of banxia.
