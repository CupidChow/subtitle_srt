[Episode 11]

3
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,190
Make do with this.

4
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,140
Here.

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,200
What's wrong?

6
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,470
Li,

7
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,229
take a look for me.

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
I think there's a bug on my back.

9
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,170
Come on, as a grown man.

10
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
why are you afraid of a little bug?

11
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,380
There's nothing there.

12
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,070
Put it back on now.

13
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,430
Really?

14
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,840
Making a fuss over nothing.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,660
Chief,

16
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,250
I have a feeling that

17
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,910
this Gao Sheng's case is a bit mysterious.

18
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,280
Just because of what Chen Kui said,

19
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,630
we've come all the way here.

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,030
What if he's

21
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,710
fooled us?

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,840
The point is that

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
multiple people have seen

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Gao Sheng alive.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,070
No way...

26
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,280
Li,

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
with so many of us watching,

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,120
he couldn't have been replaced, right?

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,120
Could it be the tricks of evil demons?

30
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:41,960
Don't talk nonsense.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,400
What? Demons?

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,590
As powerful as the Gao family is,

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,400
maybe

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,870
they've bribed someone

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,150
and played

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,360
a trick of swap.

37
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,870
Chief,

38
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,590
We've seen this kind of thing happen before.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,370
But we'll figure out the truth once we catch

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,310
and question the person.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,240
Let's eat first.

42
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,120
Okay.

43
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,270
I'll go get some water.

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,750
Li.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,750
Yan Li.

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,240
What is it, Chief?

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,400
Open it and take a look.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,650
A gift for your son's

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
one-month celebration.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,400
Thank you, Chief.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
You had already

52
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,140
taken leave to prepare

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,870
for your son's one-month celebration back home.

54
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,030
I shouldn't have called you back.

55
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
But this matter is special.

56
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,360
I feel that they have some spies

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,960
in the government office.

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,070
Moreover, you run fast with excellent qinggong

59
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,630
and also excel in tracking people.

60
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,470
If you hadn't come to help me scout,

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,000
I'd be pretty much screwed.

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,630
Chief,

63
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:43,910
I understand.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,470
Actually, you just

65
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,000
couldn't bear to be without me.

66
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,070
Keep it well.

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,680
This Master of Nine Lives is too vigilant.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,720
We stayed so far away,

69
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,680
yet he still noticed us.

70
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,770
At least we have a lead now,

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,470
don't we?

72
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,000
Banxia,

73
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,930
how can you be so sure that

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,870
this Master of Nine Lives

75
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,180
has something to do with your father

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
and even knows where he is?

77
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm not absolutely sure either,

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,430
but it's the only lead I have.

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,890
Every demon has its own

80
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,800
unique ability.

81
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,310
Take Chi Wangchuan for example.

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,920
He can zip around

83
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,830
the mirror realm freely.

84
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,340
That Cat Demon is called Nine Lives,

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,870
so it probably has nine lives.

86
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,310
Plus, it can shape-shift.

87
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,600
So it cashes in on this skill.

88
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,800
Wait, well...

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,520
It

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,480
trades one life for only 200 taels of silver?

91
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,560
That's a terrible deal, isn't it?

92
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,800
Besides, what would a demon

93
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,150
need money for anyway?

94
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,720
Xuanye!

95
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,630
I found a box in the courtyard.

96
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,110
This...

97
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,280
Isn't this my money pouch?

98
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,650
This is the secret money

99
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,160
I hid in the outhouse's hollow brick.

100
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,310
Why did this Cat Demon

101
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,950
return the money?

102
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,920
Asking for mercy?

103
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,550
This is my father's.

104
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,400
I embroidered this!

105
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,600
This is my father's.

106
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,950
So that means

107
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,270
my father really did borrow a life from the Cat Demon.

108
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,070
There's a card.

109
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,730
[Reunion Inn]

110
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,150
Reunion Inn?

111
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,120
I really didn't know!

112
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,630
He suddenly came to me,

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,600
saying he got into trouble in the city.

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,040
I-I thought

115
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,800
he just lost money gambling.

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
Who'd know

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,920
it was actually such a monstrous disaster?

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm so wronged.

119
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,000
Enough,

120
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,100
you've repeated that many times already.

121
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,040
Can you be quiet?

122
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,270
Where is he?

123
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,360
Did you lie to us?

124
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,040
Sir.

125
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm innocent.

126
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,510
I didn't lie.

127
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,430
Behave yourself!

128
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,240
Sir, sir, sir.

129
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,160
I really have no idea.

130
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,890
I-I only brought him some food and drink

131
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,680
when he just came here.

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
After that,

133
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,000
I haven't been here either.

134
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,120
I wouldn't dare to lie.

135
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,010
Sir,

136
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,190
I'm so wronged.

137
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,800
I really have no idea

138
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,530
where he is.

139
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,600
How would I dare lie to you?

140
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,430
Chief.

141
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,150
What now?

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,630
Constable Li, you stay here.

143
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,360
Let's take him with us

144
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,390
to look for that guy.

145
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:54,830
Yes!

146
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,480

147
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,630

148

and water in there.

149
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,480
I've also put in some silver.

150
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,600
It should be enough for you.

151
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,210
Okay.

152
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,510
Don't bother seeing us off. Just go back.

153
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,720
My Lady,

154
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,070
please come back safe and sound.

155

that you can't handle,

160
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,430
you can go turn to Wen Jian.

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,190
you must take good care of

She's timid and weak.

165

If you encounter any demons or monsters,

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,310
you must protect her no matter what.

167
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,680
Just rest assured.

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,390

♫A segment of reminiscence engraved for a lifetime♫

194
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,120
Sir,

195
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,670
-when can you let me go home?
-Cut the crap.

196
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,000
We'll let you go once we find Gao Sheng.

197
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,240
What's this odor?

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,120
Do you smell it?

199
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,790
It smells

200
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,600
like something

201
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,510
is rotting.

202
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,440
This is the smell of a decomposing body.

203
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,870
Go take a closer look over there.

204
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,390
I'll search this side.

205
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,270
Yan Li, here!

206
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,440
Gao Sheng?

207
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,320
Come here!

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,550
Squat down.

209
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,630
Xuanye.

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
Thank you

211
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,790
for accompanying me on this journey.

212
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,200
I already promised you.

213
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,750
Besides,

214
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,120
that Cat Demon sent us the money.

215
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,480
Seems like it wants my help.

216
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,510
Getting paid means a duty

217
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,320
to fix problems.

218
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,510
I should at least go and see

219
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,870
what on earth it's up to.

220
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,380
Why did this Cat Demon seek help from you?

221
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,930
Could it be that at the Reunion Inn,

222
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,030
there's someone it can't beat,

223
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,370
and it needs your backup?

224
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,250
I feel this Cat Demon

225
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,200
isn't evil.

226
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,440
It traded lives with death row inmates.

227
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
That's an evil deed.

228
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,360
It's just a little kitty.

229
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,960
It might not even know

230
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,600
who it's helping.

231
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,910
Just think about it.

232
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,860
It can't even

233
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
maintain a human form

234
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,080
like Chi Wangchuan.

235
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,480
So it's just a little demon, right?

236
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,360
A little kitty, huh?

237
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,510
Any demon out there

238
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,390
is way older than you.

239
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,330
When it poses a threat

240
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,670
to your life with one blow,

241
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,120
let's see if you still

242
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,150
want to call it

243
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,480
"a little kitty."

244
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,790
You're skipping a proper meal.

245
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,390
Then would you like some pastries?

246
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,200
Where are the pastries?

247
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,350
I didn't steal them.

248
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,130
I didn't even say you stole them.

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,360
Y-You're even chewing some right now.

250
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Xuanye, save me!

251
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,870
Spit it out!

252
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,790
G-Give them back to me!

253
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,230
Fortunately,

254
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,360
there's a relative of Gao Sheng here

255
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,710
who can collect his body and bury him.

256
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,480
Otherwise, the three of us would suffer.

257
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,630
Not only did we fail to find any news about him,

258
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,000
but most importantly, we'd have had to carry

259
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,940
his corpse back to Guangping.

260
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,960
That's right.

261
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,120
Didn't his relative say that

262
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,550
lynxes are often spotted around here?

263
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,480
Every year, people

264
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,440
die from lynx attacks.

265
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,870
I'd say

266
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,510
this guy was terribly unlucky.

267
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,720
He escaped the executioner's blade

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,390
but ended up falling victim to some lynxes.

269
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,080
I think it'd have been better to be beheaded.

270
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,440
Having his eyeballs gouged out was a more tragic ending.

271
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,870
Right?

272
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,870
Lynxes eat eyes,

273
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,790
but do they cut hair?

274
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,670
I'm afraid this matter isn't that simple.

275
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,200
Chief,

276
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,870
it's getting late.

277
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,720
How about we go

278
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,550
find a place to rest first?

279
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,630
Chief,

280
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,510
there's a light ahead.

281

[Reunion Inn]

282
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,790
The wind blows; the rain pours;

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,080
a fat monk comes, carrying a drum.

284
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,150
Where to hide? The temple of the shrine.

285
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,320
There, a little lad quietly hides.

286
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,390
Lad, lad, hide yourself.

287
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,520
Nowhere to run when the storm comes.

288
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,390
It's cold outside.

289
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,320
Do you mind if I spend the night here?

290
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,320
I don't mind.

291
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,840
Xuanye,

292
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,600
can you draw another mark

293
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,620
on my hand?

294
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,260
Last time in the mirror realm,

295
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,170
I used it up to break the mirror.

296
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,870
Done.

297
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,480
Why did you agree so easily this time?

298
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
The place we're heading to this time

299
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,700
is fraught with danger

300
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,630
and unknown perils.

301
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,720
With the mark guarding you,

302
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,750
I can be less worried.

303
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,440
Time to sleep now.

304
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,150
Not gonna sleep?

305
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,440
Yes.

306
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,080
Good night.

307
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,750
This way,

308
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,080
he really looks like that boy.

309
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:34,840
Wait.

310
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,320
What's wrong?

311
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,390
I think we're lost.

312
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,670
Is that so?

313
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,440
We might have accidentally

314
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,360
walked into the miasma in the forest.

315
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,550
If we can't find the right path,

316
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,000
we'll keep going around in circles here.

317
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,750
It's true.

318
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,750
It does seem like we've been here before.

319
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,600
What should we do then?

320
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,080
I told you, well...

321
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,010
You should listen to me.

322
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,220
You know what?

323
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,510
Every time you guys

324
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:37,910

326
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,630
do you know

327
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,840
how to get out of here?

328
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,320
Chi Xue,

329
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,320
let's go.

330
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,320
Xuanye,

331
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,480
who are they?

332
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,790
Ginseng Spirits.

333
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,200
They were the ones making noise last night.

334
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,630
They're quite adorable.

335
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,000
What's wrong with your eyes?

336
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,790
Haven't you noticed that?

337
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,120
I can see demons only with my left eye.

338
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,720
Really?

339
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,690
Don't you notice

340
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,830
anything abnormal?

341
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,150
I can't tell.

342
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,480
That makes sense.

343
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,880
My father took me to see numerous doctors back then.

344
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,069
None of them found anything wrong,

345
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,640
just diagnosing me with hysteria.

346
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,970
Do you remember that I told you

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,720
about a young man who saved me?

348
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,510
Yes.

349
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,480
He was injured while saving me.

350
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,390
A drop of his blood

351
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,900
fell into my left eye.

352
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,790
A drop of his blood?

353
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,140
Since then,

354
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,160
I've been able to see demons.

355
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,240
I see.

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,610

358
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,400
childhood stories to share with me?

359
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
I don't have any secrets.

360
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,880

361
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,510
my biggest secret.

362
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,400
Or are there any funny things you did as a kid?

363

I don't remember anything from my childhood.

364
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,160
You don't remember?

365
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,570
When I was twelve,

366
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,520
I had a high fever,

367
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,460
which wiped out

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,640
all my childhood memories.

Here's the thing.

383
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,810
We've lost our way in the forest.

384
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,240
It's in the dead of night now.

385
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,330
We really have nowhere else to go.

386
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,410
We hope that you can

387
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,400
do us a favor

388
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,830
and offer us a room.

389
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,550
That would be enough.

390
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,590
The renovation is underway.

391
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
The guest rooms are not fit to stay in.

392
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,550
I'm afraid you'll have to leave.

393
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,400
Keep heading west,

394
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,670
and you'll be down the mountain.

395
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,070
Father.

396
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,790
It's pitch dark, and the roads are slippery.

397
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,280
Where do you think

398
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,410
they can go right now?

399
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,350
But our guest rooms

400
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,270
are being renovated.

401
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,200
They're not fit for guests.

402
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,270
Our inn is under renovation,

403
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,110
but it's not uninhabitable.

404
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,350
Besides,

405
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,310
didn't you tell me that

406
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
meeting someone is a kind of fate,

407
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,400
and we should lend a hand if we can?

408
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,960
Sorry, guys.

409
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,400
My daughter fell

410
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,350
seriously ill recently,

411
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,480
so...

412
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,170
S-Sorry for my improper behavior.

413
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,070
We're the ones who should apologize for it, bothering you so late.

414
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,880
Miss,

415
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,940
you're so beautiful.

416
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,110
Show the guests to their rooms.

417
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,170
Guys,

418
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,750
please follow me.

419
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,880
This way, please.

420
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,440
Our inn

421
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,400
has

422
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,920
twenty-two separate courts,

423
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,270
named after the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.

424
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,310
You're accommodated

425
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,160
in the

426
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,270
innermost one,

427
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,160
Jia Court.

428
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,440
This place is covered with so much snow.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,190
Stepping on the shadow!

430
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,270
Stepping on the shadow

431
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,640
brings bad luck.

432
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,270
Stepping on the shadow

433
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,790
brings bad luck.

434
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,980
Stepping on the shadow

435
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,270
brings bad luck.

436
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,070
Brings bad luck to everyone.

437
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,480
Stepping on the shadow...

438
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,260
Let's go.

439
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,590
Our inn

440
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,240
looks amazing, right?

441
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,720
Everyone who's been here says

442
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,720
they don't want to leave,

443
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,310
finding this place

444
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,310
perfect for a long, relaxing stay.

445
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,110
This is indeed an elegant court.

446
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,920
Sir, you have a good taste.

447
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,550
No wonder you could

448
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,240
have such a beautiful wife.

449
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:58,830
I...

450
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,350
It's just up ahead.

451
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,640
Jia Court has two rooms.

452
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,550
Sir and madam,

453
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,590
[Jia]

454
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,110
you can stay in the inner room.

455
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,270
And, sir,

456
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,590
you can stay in this side room.

457
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,920
Please.

458
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,480
This is our best room.

459
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,590
The view outside the window

460
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,160
is excellent.

461
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,220
There are a few loquat trees in the back garden.

462
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,540
It's the season for loquats now.

463
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,590
If you like,

464
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,200
I can pick some for you tomorrow.

465
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,430
Don't bother doing so much.

466
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,160
It's okay.

467
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,050
There are no other guests in the inn.

468
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,510
I'm free and bored anyway.

469
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,880
You've come all the way here.

470
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,270
Bet you won't

471
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,110
stay for just one day, right?

472
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,590
This place is also close to the small hot spring.

473
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,740
When I have nothing to do,

474
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,540
I like to chill and enjoy

475
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,000
the scenery here.

476
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,510
If there's nothing else,

477
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,400
I'll take my leave now.

478
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,680
Feel free to call me if you need anything.

479
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,030
Thank you so much.

480
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,350
Do you smell something?

481
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
It's the calming fragrance.

482
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,310
The inn is still under renovation,

483
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,440
not open for guests.

484
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,750
Why do they burn so much calming fragrance?

485
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,310
I forgot to tell you.

486
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,170
Our carriage

487
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
is still at the mountain gate.

488
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,310
Can you keep an eye on it for us?

489
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,880
Okay.

490
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,550
Sir,

491
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,550
how do you like the room for you?

492
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,160
Not bad.

493
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,110
Just "not bad"?

494
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,750
That's not a high praise.

495
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,510
Do you have any radishes to eat here?

496
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,440
I'm a bit hungry.

497
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,600
Radishes?

498
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,790
We don't have any.

499
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,750
However,

500
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
there are snacks near the small hot spring.

501
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,790
Would you like to take a bath in the hot spring?

502
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,720
Hot spring bath?

503
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,590
The hot spring bath is our inn's specialty.

504
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,720
The spring water comes

505
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,510
directly from the mountain,

506
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,340
heated by the earth,

507
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,140
gushing through the "earth veins."

508
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,190
Many guests

509
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,570
come here specifically for it.

510
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,240
Usually,

511
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,750
you'd have to wait for a long time

512
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,610
for an available hot spring pool.

513
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,990
Then I'm in.

514
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,030
Alright.

515
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,270
I'll go prepare now.

516
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,480
Clean it up thoroughly.

517
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Bring some fruit

518
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,300
and tea snacks later.

519
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,400
The guest will arrive soon.

520
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,700
Yes.

521
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,920
Wuniang.

522
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,110
Father.

523
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,310
Why did you let them stay?

524
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,080
We run an inn

525
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,070
to receive guests, right?

526
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,590
But these people are different.

527
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,410
I feel that

528
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,390
something's off.

529
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,790
What's off?

530
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,750
I didn't notice anything wrong.

531
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,720
I'm not sure either.

532
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,720
Anyway,

533
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,440
it just doesn't feel right.

534
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,400
Father,

535
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,890
we run this inn

536
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,550
to do business.

537
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,110
You dare not run it in Guangping.

538
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,310
We're already hiding in this deep mountain.

539
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,310
What else is there to fear?

540
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,960
I guess you're afraid

541
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,680
I might behave improperly again, right?

542
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,020
I'll go attend to the guests now.

543
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,680
Father, if there's nothing else, you can go get some rest.

544
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,430
It's useless to put that out.

545
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,480
All the candles in this place

546
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,700
contain calming fragrance.

547
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,150
Don't you have that hypostasis water?

548
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,960
Doesn't it work for the calming fragrance?

549
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,460
Only if there's a little of the fragrance.

550
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,510
But given the way they're burning it,

551
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
even my hypostasis water can't work.

552
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,580
Something is wrong with this inn.

553
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,970
I wonder why this Cat Demon

554
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,200
lured us here.

555
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,720
Let's find it

556
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
and ask it why.

557
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,640
Banxia,

558
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,800
Chi Xue and I will be staying next door.

559
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,470
Call me if anything happens.

560
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,750
She misunderstood

561
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,720
our relationship just now.

562
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,890
You don't need to explain.

563
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,790
This inn is suspicious.

564
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,030
Let's play along

565
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,070
to facilitate our investigation.

566
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,640
Alright.

567
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,640
Who is it?

568
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,070
It's me.

569
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,270
I'm here to guide you two.

570
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,400
Come in.

571
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,070
Esteemed guests,

572
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
the hot spring is ready.

573
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,550
You can go and enjoy it now.

574
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,110
What hot spring?

575
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,640
Something great for relaxing muscles

576
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
and relieving fatigue.

577
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,640
It's really good for your health.

578
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,240
Maybe we'll skip it.

579
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,920
Why?

580
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,700
Your attendant

581
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,320
said yes to the hot spring bath.

582
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,400
I've already got it ready.

583
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,380
We're worn out

584
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,260
and want to rest.

585
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,240
That's exactly why you should bathe.

586
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,000
Trust me, miss.

587
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,310
Give it a try.

588
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm sure

589
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,310
it'll be worth your time.

590
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,440
We'll go.

591
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,070
Lead the way.

592
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,920
Okay.

593
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,680
I just saw

594
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,830
something run by.

595
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,920
It looked like a cat.

596
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,440
Really?

597
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,770
My wife is afraid of cats.

598
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,070
Do you keep any cats in the inn?

599
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,360
There are many squirrels around the mountain.

600
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,370
The inn is under renovation

601
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,240
without many guests.

602
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,120
No one keeps cats here.

603
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,840
My wife might have been mistaken.

604
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,030
This way, please.

605
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,240
This one for gentlemen,

606
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,270
and this one for ladies.

607
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,590
Miss, please follow me.

608
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,110
This way, please.

609
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
Madam, your skin is as white as snow

610
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,870
and as delicate as jade.

611
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm so envious.

612
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,200
Madam,

613
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,180
what's that on your forehead?

614
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,550
Yes,

615
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,460
what is it?

616
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,480
It's so pretty!

617
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,210
Yes, it's really beautiful.

618
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,070
Girls, behave yourselves.

619
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,160
Wuniang.

620
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,200
You yapped too much.

621
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,160
That was annoying.

622
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
Get out now.

623
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,650
Yes.

624
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,750
Having lived in the mountain for a long time

625
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,680
and not seen the outside world,

626
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,000
we don't know how women

627
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,110
dress out there.

628
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,110
Did they disturb you?

629
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,750
It's alright.

630
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,110
Miss,

631
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,300
you're so beautiful.

632
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,680
The flower makeup is gorgeous,

633
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,610
and so are you.

634
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,030
You're beautiful too.

635
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Am I?

636
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,910
I thought

637
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,610
I was good-looking,

638
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,440
but now,

639
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,750
miss, I think you're more beautiful.

640
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:43,850
Miss,

641
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,580
let's go to the hot spring.

642
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,070
It's so comfy.

643
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,440
Xuanye,

644
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,780
come down and join me!

645
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,550
You enjoy the bath.

646
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,720
I have something to handle.

647
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,550
The guest from Xu Court is the best.

648
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,720
But she's gone.

649
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,480
She left.

650
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,030
She even gave me a silk headband.

651
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,280
The lady who just arrived

652
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,110
is wearing flower makeup.

653
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:31,960
It's really amazing.

654
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,790
I want to learn that too.

655
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,750
The guest who came yesterday is very imposing

656
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,750
and also very handsome.

657
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,690
That guest drinks all day,

658
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,400
but he's really good-looking.

659
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,890
I want to get drunk too.

660
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,510
Wonder if I can hold my liquor.

661
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,610
So many guests have swarmed in at once.

662
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,730
Too many to closely watch everyone.

663
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,790
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

664
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,270
Are you alright?

665
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,200
Yeah, I'm fine.

666
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
My bad, I wasn't paying attention.

667
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,790
Did your eye get hurt?

668
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,240
No, no.

669
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,160
Then why are you covering it?

670
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,200
I'm just a bit dizzy.

671
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,720
I'll be fine after a short rest.

672
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,270
Please don't worry about it, sir.

673
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,350
Miss,

674
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,030
is the temperature good?

675
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,400
This hot spring is our inn's specialty.

676
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,380
It can nourish the skin

677
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,730
and help with relaxation and sleep.

678
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,790
Yes, madam,

679
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,610
it's very comfortable.

680
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,980
That's right, madam.

681
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,560
How about you

682
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,510
go attend to other matters first?

683
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,060
Miss, you don't need us

684
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,260
to attend to you?

685
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,000
No,

686
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,200
you can leave me alone.

687
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,310
Okay.

688
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,930
We won't be far away.

689
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Just call us if you need anything.

690
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,970
You're not a Carefree Land native.

691
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,030
Where are you from?

692
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,510
I don't know.

693
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,310
I was kidnapped.

694
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,810
I just escaped and fell into this place.

695
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,000
Don't be afraid.

696
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,740
Are you hungry?

697
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,030
Here's a peach for you.

698
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,240
My name is Banxia.

699
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,110
My father's name is Duan Yingheng.

700
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,200
My mother's name is Tang Ruyun.

701
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,630
Can you take me to find them?

702
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,760
Okay.

703
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,070
Oh, no.

704
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,239
They've noticed us.

705
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,000
Let's go!

706
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,710
You...

707
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,030
What's your name?

708
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,630
Where are we going?

709
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,960
And where are we now?

710
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Let's get out of here first.

711
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,360
Run! Don't worry about me!

712
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,880
So what's your name?

713
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,880
My name is Manying!

714
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,190
Now, run!

715
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,670
Xuanye,

716
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,530
Manying.

717
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,110
Can they really be the same person?

718
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,980
Sir.

719
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,540
This is our inn's storage room,

720
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,410
where we keep

721
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,630
all sorts of odds and ends.

722
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,550
No one lives here.

723
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,110
Sir,

724
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,510
you must be lost.

725
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,030
What happened?

726
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,590
Feeling any better?

727
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,480
Yeah, much better.

728
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,280
The mountain dwelling is chilly.

729
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,800
Looks like

730
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,440
it might snow tonight.

731
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
Tuck yourself in

732
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,190
and stay warm.

733
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,440
I just saw the Cat Demon.

734
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,280
Where?

735
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,760
Right in the court.

736
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,030
But the innkeeper suddenly appeared,

737
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,200
and I lost track of it.

738
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:20,840
Come in.

739
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,960
Miss,

740
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,350
are you feeling better?

741
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
I made you some calming tea.

742
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,510
It's all my fault.

743
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,870
I should have

744
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
stayed by your side

745
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,110
the whole time.

746
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,320
Let me do it.

747
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,600
Thank you, anyway.

748
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,840
I can help.

749
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,480
It's late.

750
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,950
It's time for us to rest.

751
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,440
Miss,

752
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,360
do you really not need me to take care of you?

753
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,080
Don't need to worry so much.

754
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,280
I should be fine after some sleep.

755
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,960
Alright then.

756
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,410
You are supposed

757
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,030
to take care of your wife on your own.

758
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,230
Well then, miss,

759
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,830
I'll take my leave.

760
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,240
Don't you think

761
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,030
the people here

762
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,540
are a bit too hospitable?

763
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,730
What exactly

764
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,940
happened to you just now?

765
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,300
I saw something weird

766
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,710
in the pool.

767
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,320
Isn't this just a piece of useless wood?

768
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,510
What's so special about it?

769
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,920
Everything here is nice.

770
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,320
It's just a bit cold at night.

771
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,570
It's already this season, yet there's still snow here.

772
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,300
The bed is the warmest place.

773
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,570
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

774
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,440
Like clouds drifting, like rivers flowing.

775
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,370
Face all

776
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,480
without turning away.

777
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,580
In peace, release desires that cloud the mind.

778
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,630
For all things rise and fall, unite and part like the ebbing tide.

779
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,280
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

780
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,360
Like clouds drifting, like rivers flowing.

781
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,110
Face all without turning away.

782
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,190
In peace, release desires that cloud the mind.

783
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,710
For all things rise and fall, unite and part like the ebbing tide.

784
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,760
Who's it?

785
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:11,920
It's me.

786
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Why are you here?

787
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,880
The night breeze is chilly.

788
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,070
You just came back in wet clothes.

789
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,300
To keep you from catching a cold,

790
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,630
I made you a bowl of ginger tea.

791
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,000
Thank you.

792
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,000
It's cold outside. Go back inside now.

793
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,320
Would you like to come in and chill for a bit?

794
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,480
No, thanks.

795
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,880
Get some rest early.

796
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,440
Who's there?

797
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:52,570
Come out.

798
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,110
Sir,

799
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,070
madam.

800
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,470
It's already so late.

801
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,320
What's the matter?

802
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,380
There are strong night gusts in the mountain.

803
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,320
And your wife was startled today.

804
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,440
The innkeeper sent me here to ask

805
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,920
if you need more charcoal fire.

806
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,360
No.

807
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,150
Then sir, madam,

808
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,440
hope you get some good rest.

809
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,000
I'll take my leave now.

810
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,510
Xuanye,

811
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,120
don't you think he...

812
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,710
Darling,

813
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,500
let's go inside now.

814
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,400
How is it?

815
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,510
He's not here.

816
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,440
Has he left then?

817
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,070
Not necessarily.

818
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,610
This servant is really peculiar.

819
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,110
He came in the middle of the night, claiming to add charcoal fire,

820
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,880
yet he didn't even bring any charcoal.

821
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,830
That might just be an excuse.

822
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,590
His behavior was suspicious.

823
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,280
If I hadn't spotted him,

824
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,260
he probably wouldn't have shown himself at all.

825
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,800
This inn is really odd.

826
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,710
Come on,

827
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,560
drink this first.

828
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,040
I don't like the taste of ginger.

829
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,840
Then do you like the taste of medicine?

830
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,070
By the way,

831
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,890
I was outside just now,

832
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,630
hearing you

833
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,620
mumbling something inside.

834
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,000
What was it?

835
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,720
I was reciting the chant you taught me.

836
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,590
Were you scared?

837
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,020
Not exactly.

838
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,660
Didn't you say

839
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,770
reciting that chant

840
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,510
would make you calm

841
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,700
and fearless?

842
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,080
I thought reciting it

843
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,670
might help me sleep better.

844
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,280
How about

845
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,400
I stay and keep you company tonight?

846
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,480
I-I mean,

847
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,960
I'll stay by your bedside.

848
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,380
After you fall asleep,

849
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:25,350
I'll go back.

850
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,630
Wouldn't that be troublesome for you?

851
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,360
Not at all.

852
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,630
We just moved in.

853
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,920
We know literally

854
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,960
nothing about this inn now.

855
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,320
Moreover,

856
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,960
the Cat Demon comes and goes randomly.

857
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,030
It's truly dangerous.

858
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,000
Staying here alone

859
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,230
without Tingzhou's company,

860
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,760
you'll naturally feel nervous.
