00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,150
She's arrived home safely.

4
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,800
Where are we going?

5
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,410
To work.

6
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,800
Isn't the Human-faced Owl already dead?

[Duan's Mansion]

8
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,360
Father is back.

9
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,280
Father.

10
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,310
Father?

11
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,050
Father!

12
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,910
What happened?

13
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,010
Banxia.

14
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,970
Father, what was that sound just now?

15
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,470
I accidentally fell down.

16
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,240
It's nothing serious.

17
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,840
You fell?

18
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,800
Where are you hurt?

19
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,670
I'm alright.

20
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,030
Why are you...

21
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,400
Still up?

22
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,680
I was hungry, so I went to get some food.

23
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,610
Father, when did you come back?

24
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,649
Just now.

25
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,660
I just came back.

26
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,980
A lot of things happened at home.

27
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,360
Do you know about them?

28
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,320
It's that new sister-in-law of mine.

29
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll go inside and talk to you in detail.

30
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,630
Banxia.

31
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,270
It's so late now.

32
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,390
Let's talk

33
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
tomorrow.

34
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,310
I've been busy

35
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,600
organizing manuscripts all day.

36
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
I'm quite exhausted.

37
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,670
I want to sleep early.

38
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,440
Are you really alright?

39
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,240
Banxia.

40
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,320
What could possibly be wrong with me?

41
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm just

42
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,830
really tired.

43
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,070
Rest early then.

44
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,510
Grandmother has been asking about you these days.

45
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,560
Remember to

46
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,800
go see her early tomorrow morning.

47
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,800
It's been a long time

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
since I last dyed your hair.

49
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,320
Tomorrow when you have time,

50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,600
I'll dye your hair for you.

51
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,690
Okay.

52
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,300
I'll go back then.

53
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,170
Banxia.

54
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,360
It's dark.

55
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
Be careful.

56
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,480
Got it.

57
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,090
After I leave,

58
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,750
don't go back to reading.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,510
Got it.

60
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,720
It's midnight. Safe and sound.

61
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,480
It's midnight. Safe and sound.

62
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
What's your name?

63
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,600
My name is Manying.

64
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,630
My Lady.

65
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,190
W-What's wrong?

66
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,760
Did you have another nightmare?

67
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,750
Did you dream about Manying?

68
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,680
Tingzhou.

69
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,270
Do you think Manying might be real?

70
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,270
Here we go again.

71
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,870
My Lady.

72
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,310
The physician has told you

73
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,510
it was just a dream.

74
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,800
You also dreamed about things like

75
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,400
the Bat Spirit

76
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,360
and the Black Panther Demon.

77
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,000
How could it be real?

78
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,330
But if

79
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,800
there really are demons in this world,

80
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
does that mean

81
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,040
my dream was real,

82
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,650
the people inside my dream are real,

83
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
and Manying is also a real person?

84
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,480
My Lady.

85
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,080
It's so early in the morning.

86
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,280
Instead of thinking about this,

87
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,120
maybe you should think about

88
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,800
how to respond to Elder Madam.

89
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,120
Master has been gone for days.

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
Elder Madam is obviously angry.

91
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
My father has come back.

92
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,800
He's back?

93
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,780
When?

94
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,110
Last night.

95
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,130
Go get me some water.

96
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,850
I'll wash up and go see my father.

97
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,750
Okay.

98
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,740
Clean this area more thoroughly.

99
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,020
Alright, give it another wipe.

100
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,560
Mr. Xu.

101
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,070
My Lady.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,160
Is my father inside?

103
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,010
Has the Second Master come back?

104
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,950
Make way!

105
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,840
This way.

106
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,820
Yingheng.

107
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,670
Yingheng.

108
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,030
How could this happen?

109
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
How could this happen?

110
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,320
I...

111
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
M... My father...

112
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,120
Why is my father here?

113
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,480
This mansion

114
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,840
was originally a residence affiliated with

115
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,390
the Yunqing Trading Company.

116
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,670
The company usually earns some money

117
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,010
through renting out properties.

118
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,020
Recently,

119
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,200
Uncle Yingheng rented this place

120
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,500
and has been living here for several days straight.

121
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,510
Last night between 9 to 11 p.m.,

122
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,910
the woodshed caught fire.

123
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,440
The fire was huge,

124
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,320
and it spread to this courtyard very fast.

125
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,240
I guess Uncle Yingheng...

126
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,600
Had nowhere to escape,

127
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,960
so he hid back in the study.

128
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,550
In the end,

129
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,270
he was suffocated to death in here.

130
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,670
Yingheng!

131
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,120
Yingheng...

132
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,480
Yanqiu.

133
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,840
That's impossible.

134
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,690
I saw my father

135
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
at midnight last night.

136
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,300
My father had lost a lot of weight

137
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,240
and looked haggard at that time.

138
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,550
I...

139
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,880
I noticed he has grown a lot of gray hair,

140
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:32,600
and he agreed

141
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,150
to let me dye his hair today.

142
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:34,820
It's true!

143
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,480
Banxia.

144
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
He's already passed away.

145
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,790
No! Trust me!

146
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,120
I saw him last night.

147
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,410
He couldn't be dead.

148
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,150
Banxia!

149
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,120
The fact is already right in front of us.

150
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,700
You still won't believe it?

151
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,250
Something must be wrong.

152
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,540
My father is not dead.

153
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,190
My father is not dead.

154
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,630
I saw him.

155
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,480
He can't be dead.

156
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,440
He's not dead.

157
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,100
This can't be.

158
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,050
My father is not dead.

159
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,000
There must be something wrong somewhere.

160
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,970
What on earth are you doing?

161
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,090
Luring the sound eel out.

162
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,970
The sound eel is the Human-faced Owl's companion demon.

163
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,990
Since the Human-faced Owl died,

164
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,720
the sound eel will definitely avenge her.

165
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,390
Didn't you say

166
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,050
the sound eel was born with poor eyesight,

167
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,090
but it has exceptional hearing

168
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
and loves beautiful sounds?

169
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,360
Then I can definitely lure it here

170
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
with my flute.

171
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,150
You call this a beautiful sound?

172
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,360
Isn't it beautiful?

173
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,150
If you don't play the flute,

174
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,650
it may come faster.

175
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,360
It's here?

176
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,120
Be careful.

177
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,630
Chi Xue!

178
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,220
[Sound Eel]

179
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,740
Chi Xue.

180
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,510
Cut the rope!

181
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,750
You can't run away now, can you?

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,750
What a small world.

183
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,530
We meet again, guys.

184
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,170
What are you doing here?

185
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,080
I hope I'm not ruining

186
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
any of your fun, Physician Jiu.

187
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:27,740
What do you want?

188
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,670
Nothing.

189
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,760
It's just the weather is nice,

190
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,940
so I came out for a walk.

191
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,030
Are you going back to the city?

192
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,750
How about we go together?

193
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,330
It's out of your way.

194
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,390
It's not.

195
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,930
No matter where you want to go, Physician Jiu,

196
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,270
it's on my way.

197
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,630
Chi Xue.

198
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,440
Let's go.

199
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,390
Hey, let's go together.

200
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,720
W-Was this place robbed?

201
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,390
My Lady.

202
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,460
Why is it so messy here?

203
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,080
Was Father planning to travel far?

204
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,270
M-My Lady!

205
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,900
Come here!

206
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,069
Look.

207
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,440
Here.

208
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,550
Look at this.

209
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,069
Why is this mirror

210
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,310
not reflecting us?

211
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,460
[Duan's Mansion]

212
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,750
My poor girl.

213
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,070
Your mother died when you were still little,

214
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,870
and now, you've lost your father too.

215
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,760
How should you live

216
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,240
alone in this world

217
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,310
from now on?

218
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,580
Grandmother,

219
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,390
please don't be sad.

220
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,510
My father might still be alive.

221
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,630
At midnight the day before yesterday,

222
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,000
I saw my father come home with my own eyes.

223
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
He was right in his room.

224
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,200
He seemed to be in good spirits at that time,

225
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,270
but he did look a bit tired.

226
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,310
He said it was because

227
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,370
he hadn't rested well

228
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,240
since he'd been organizing manuscripts.

229
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,200
Therefore, I didn't talk to him for long.

230
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,840
On my way back to my room,

231
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,350
I heard the watchman beating his drum.

232
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,340
He clearly struck it three times.

233
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,410
But the government file stated that

234
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,310
my father died before 11 p.m.

235
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,640
Think about it.

236
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,750
If he had died before 11 p.m.,

237
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,590
how could he have come home

238
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,730
at midnight?

239
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,640
There must be something fishy about this.

240
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,650
My father must still be alive.

241
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,030
This... This...

242
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,310
Could it be she ran into a ghost?

243
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,350
Banxia.

244
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,880
I know you're feeling heartbroken,

245
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:20,550
but...

246
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,510
Uncle.

247
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm not saying this

248
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,680
out of excessive sadness.

249
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,680
You all know that

250
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,920
my eyes have been different

251
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,170
from those of ordinary people since childhood.

252
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,980
If this were caused by ghosts or demons,

253
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,520
I'd definitely be able to tell.

254
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,000
Uncle Yingheng lived in the east courtyard,

255
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,350
while you live in the west courtyard.

256
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,790
The two sides are very far apart.

257
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,330
Why didn't you sleep that night

258
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,920
and went to Uncle Yingheng's room instead?

259
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,110
I didn't go there from my room.

260
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,000
Actually, I saw the lights were on

261
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,340
in my father's room when I came back

262
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,040
from outside.

263
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,260
So I went to check.

264
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,600
At such a late hour,

265
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,420
where did you go?

266
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,510
I...

267
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,680
I went to see a friend.

268
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,720
You live in Yuanzhou year-round.

269
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,680
Why do you have friends in Nanyang City?

270
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,070
I'm not lying.

271
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,660
Mr. Xu.

272
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,130
I saw Mr. Xu changing the candles

273
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,870
when I came back.

274
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,650
That's when

275
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,830
his hand got scalded.

276
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I saw him first,

277
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,350
and then my father.

278
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,000
Young Master.

279
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,240
My hand was indeed

280
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,480
scalded when

281
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,240
changing the candles

282
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,160
the night before last.

283
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,460
It was exactly at midnight.

284
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,310
My Lady.

285
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,000
I didn't see you

286
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,000
when I changed the candles.

287
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,140
I came back too late.

288
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,930
I didn't want to be scolded by Grandmother,

289
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,780
so I hid myself.

290
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,930
Mr. Xu's hand injury is not a secret.

291
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,080
This still can't prove

292
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,010
what you said is true.

293
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,740
I know what I said is hard to believe,

294
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,660
but think about it carefully.

295
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,790
Don't you find it strange?

296
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,610
My father and I came back this time

297
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,120
for Yanqiu's marriage.

298
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,720
But as soon as he came back,

299
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,260
he rented a mansion outside,

300
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,080
and he didn't come back often.

301
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,090
as if he was

302
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:00,960
hiding from something.

303
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,960
Uncle Yingheng asked me to rent that mansion for him.

304
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,800
He said it was to organize manuscripts peacefully,

305
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,410
not to avoid anyone.

306
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,330
The weather and the life

307
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,790
are both unpredictable.

308
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,170
Banxia.

309
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,980
I know it's hard for you to accept

310
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,870
Uncle Yingheng's death right now.

311
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,350
But now that it's come to this,

312
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,440
you must stay strong.

313
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,400
Tingzhou, the mirror.

314
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,130
I found this mirror

315
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,490
in my father's room.

316
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,970
It can only reflect objects,

317
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,930
not people.

318
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,280
I went to the fire scene

319
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,020
at Penglai Alley

320
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,080
and found a mirror

321
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,030
which is exactly the same as this one.

322
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,830
Isn't this suspicious enough?

323
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,340
This...

324
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,280
How could this be?

325
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,750
No way.

326
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:50,890
It clearly couldn't

327
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,990
reflect anything yesterday.

328
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,480
Tingzhou, you saw it too, right?

329
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,330
Yes.

330
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,480
I saw it too.

331
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,470
It couldn't reflect people.

332
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,110
I know.

333
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,160
It must have been a powerful demon

334
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,640
using a deceptive spell.

335
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,000
That's why we couldn't see it.

336
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,310
I know a demon hunter.

337
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,510
-We can…
-Banxia!

338
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,240
Tingzhou.

339
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,810
Help your lady back to her room.

340
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,270
Why?

341
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,990
Why can't you

342
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,630
believe me even for once?

343
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,400
I'll take you to Jishi Clinic later

344
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,750
to see Physician Sun.

345
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,480
I'm not sick!

346
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,160
I said my father is still alive!

347
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,800
These are all caused by demons!

348
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,350
Demons?

349
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,920
Demons again?

350
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,000
How come only you

351
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,190
can see those demons?

352
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,720
Why can't I see any of them?

353
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:54,850
You have.

354
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,500
You all have!

355
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,280
It's just that you couldn't see through

356
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,550
her disguise.

357
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,540
Don't tell me you still think that

358
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,780
Sister-in-law was abducted by a villain.

359
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,070
She's a demon,

360
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,060
a Human-faced Owl,

361
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,350
with a monkey's body and a dog's tail,

362
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,760
which likes to eat human throats.

363
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,790
She approached you just to...

364
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,650
Shut up!

365
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,030
Sir, welcome.

366
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,000
Sir, welcome.

367
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,750
Please, come in.

368
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,870
Mr. Zhang.

369
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,920
Sir, please come inside.

370
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,790
Please, come in.

371
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,550
This is your first time here, right, Sir?

372
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:46,910
Please, come in.

373
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,640
Come on. This way.

374
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,160
Have another drink.

375
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,640
Is this your first time here?

376
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,440
Where did you come from, you brute?

377
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,930
How dare you hit me?

378
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,720
Mr. Song.

379
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,440
Mr. Song!

380
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,290
Why are you leaving?

381
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,110
Sir,

382
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,590
Chuntao

383
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,550
already has a guest today.

384
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,230
How about

385
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,480
I arrange some other girl

386
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:46,960
for you?

387
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,740
I won't disturb you any further.

388
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,310
Chuntao.

389
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,470
Take good care of this gentleman here.

390
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,480
Sir.

391
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,640
Your bamboo hat...

392
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,540
Keep playing!

393
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,310
In the future,

394
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,200
if you encounter any trouble,

395
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,090
you can come to Guangping City to find me.

396
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,430
My Lady.

397
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,800
It's time to take your medicine.

398
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,310
They don't believe me,

399
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,060
and you don't, either?

400
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,250
Of course I believe you, My Lady.

401
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,390
But what's the use

402
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,940
of me being the only one

403
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,770
who believes you, My Lady?

404
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,650
All others, including Young Master, don’t believe you.

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,880
I don't need them.

406
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,210
We've been looking for so long and still haven't found him.

407
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,790
Do you think he might have run far away?

408
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,070
No.

409
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,780
He must be nearby.

410
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,510
Why?

411
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,340
Sound eels are different from other demons.

412
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,270
For him, beautiful sounds

413
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,110
are both food

414
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,110
and medicine.

415
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,440
Since he's injured,

416
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,640
he'll definitely search for

417
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,760
beautiful sounds in the city

418
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,720
to heal himself.

419
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,610
He just won't leave us alone.

420
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,030
What should we do?

421
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,250
She's been playing the whole night.

422
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
Why haven't they come out yet?

423
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,200
Exactly, Madame.

424
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,070
Madame.

425
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,690
How about we report it to the government?

426
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,640
Right.

427
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,100
Right.

428
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,830
Madame, it's a matter of life and death.

429
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,000
It's a matter of life and death, Madame.

430
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,510
Right.

431
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,680
Alright.

432
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,270
Let's report this to the government.

433
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,300
Qiusheng!

434
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,400
Come here.

435
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,240
Come on.

436
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,480
You're the fastest.

437
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,340
Go to the government office

438
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,320
and ask Chief Constable Song

439
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,510
to bring enough people over.

440
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,300
Go quickly.

441
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,060
Yes.

442
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,970
Why are you so flustered?

443
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,550
Do you know Chief Constable Song?

444
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,110
Yes, I do.

445
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,550
Come with me and report to the government.

446
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,790
Report to the government?

447
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,490
Let's go. Someone is causing trouble.

448
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,880
May I ask who you are...

449
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,720
Quite the refined entertainment, isn't it?

450
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,000
If she keeps playing, she'll bleed out.

451
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,520
Young lady?

452
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,210
You've woken up?

453
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,350
Wearing a bamboo hat indoors,

454
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,720
don't you feel stifled?

455
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,110
Run while you still can.

456
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,200
You're really getting uglier and uglier.

457
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,180
Chi Xue.

458
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,160
Take it away.

459
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,540
I received a letter from your fiancé.

460
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,290
He knows what happened to your father.

461
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,020
He said he'd come to Nanyang

462
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,400
as soon as he finishes his work.

463
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,030
I've inquired about him.

464
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,560
He's a good guy.

465
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,830
Pretty talented.

466
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,880
Uncle Yingheng had good taste.

467
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,240
Banxia.

468
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,790
I've got news about Manniang.

469
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,400
Do you still remember

470
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,410
that throat-slitting scoundrel

471
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,640
in the city recently?

472
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,250
Guangping has sent an official arrest warrant.

473
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,200
The scoundrel on the portrait

474
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,960
is Manniang.

475
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,500
Do you believe it?

476
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,350
I will go investigate it.

477
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,030
So you still don't believe it.

478
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,590
Of course I don't believe it.

479
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,270
She's just a weak woman.

480
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,680
I'll continue to investigate.

481
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,360
But regardless,

482
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,760
there are no demons in this world,

483
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,750
and that's a fact.

484
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,400
So,

485
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,550
you should stop overthinking it.

486
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,830
Now,

487
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,510
although Uncle Yingheng is gone,

488
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,110
we will take good care of you.

489
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:33,590
I understand.

490
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,790
It's raining.

491
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,740
Let me walk you back.

492
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,000
No need.

493
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,780
I can go back by myself.

494
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,520
Go back and rest early.

495
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,460
My Lady.

496
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,830
I've finished packing.

497
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,370
Okay.

498
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,020
Let's go.

499
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,470
[To Yanqiu]

500
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,370
It's raining so heavily.

501
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,230
Mister.

502
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,300
Is there a ferry dock ahead

503
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,850
where there are boats to Guangping every day?

504
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,980
Do you know

505
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,950
when that boat comes?

506
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,860
Every day at noon.

507
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,600
Are you taking a boat to Guangping?

508
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,790
The boat only comes once a day.

509
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,340
It's raining so heavily.

510
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,010
I'm afraid you won't make it today.

511
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,670
Wait until tomorrow.

512
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,030
My Lady.

513
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,969
How about we go back?

514
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,800
When will this rain stop?

515
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,469
Let's go.

516
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,139
[Guangping City]

517
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,199
What should we do about him?

518
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,240
When the full moon arrives,

519
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,320
I'll deal with him.

520
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:00,410
Alright.

521
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,450
You're a demon yourself too.

522
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,850
Why are you so rude

523
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,800
to someone of your own kind?

524
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm nothing like him.

525
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,040
He's so stupid.

526
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,090
If I were him

527
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,280
and encountered such a formidable opponent like you,

528
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,190
I would have probably disappeared by now.

529
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,570
Companion demons are very loyal.

530
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,170
Once they've chosen their master,

531
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,160
they'll never regret it even if they die a hundred times.

532
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,160
I killed the Human-faced Owl.

533
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,990
Of course he wants to avenge his master

534
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,610
by staying close to his enemy

535
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,420
and waiting for the right time.

536
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,010
This sound eel

537
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,120
is actually quite loyal.

538
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,990
Keep a close eye on it.

But he still didn't make it in time for your wedding.

549
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,640
It's okay.

550

Look at these.

557
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,320
How long have you been wearing these shoes?

558
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,160
They're so dirty.

559
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,970

Don't put any oil, salt, sauce or vinegar in it.

568
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,900
Just boil it in plain water

569

00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,300
♫Where you lingered♫

573
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:02,970
Just wait.

574
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,240
Wait for my Moon Bugs

575
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,800
♫The other is the unforgettable♫

576
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,240
to grow big and strong.

577
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,120
I guarantee that if you carry them with you,

578
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,800
♫Dream of mine♫

579
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,320
even a century-old demon

580
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,320
will be terrified and run away.

581
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,210
♫A fallen leaf, a drop of wine♫

582
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,310
♫Each drop into my heart♫

583
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,370
Did your trip this time go well?

584
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:23,490
♫A moment of memory, an illusion♫

585
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,740
♫One side is the past♫

586
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,680
Son.

587
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,050
♫Where you lingered♫

588
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,970
People can be good or bad,

589
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,120
and the same goes for demons.

590
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,760
You can't generalize.

591
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,550
♫The other is the unforgettable♫

592
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,120
Got it?

593
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,300
♫Dream of mine♫

594
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,410
Yes.

595
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,880
♫A fallen leaf, a drop of wine♫

596
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,400
♫Each drop into my heart♫

597
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,360
♫A moment of memory, an illusion♫

598
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:58,010
♫A segment of reminiscence engraved for a lifetime♫

599
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,970
The starry sky is really bright tonight.

600
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,160
So delicious.

601
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,460
[Zhang's Mansion]

602
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,760
Between 7 to 9 p.m.,

603
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,490
the moon hangs low.

604
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,800
Pear Fairy, listen to my words.

605
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,490
I'm not blinded by money,

606
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,640
nor am I seeking a good marriage.

607
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,340
Between 9 to 11 p.m.,

608
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,450
the moonlight is cold.

609
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,170
Pear Fairy, come to my courtyard.

610
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,930
I'm not lamenting in front of the mirror,

611
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,970
nor am I foolishly seeking to extend my life.

612
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,240
At midnight,

613
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,600
the moonlight is dim.

614
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,670
Pear Fairy, listen to my wishes.

615
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,680
First wish: the flowers bloom again,

616
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,930
life and death I bear.

617
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,160
Second wish: I offer my bones and blood,

618
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,020
just to be young again.

619
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,080
Eat it.

620
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,200
Come on, eat it.

621
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,920
Come on.

622
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,440
Eat it.

623
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,630
Come on, eat it.

624
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,280
It's midnight. Safe and sound.

625
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,340
It's midnight. Safe and sound.

626
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,680
Chi Xue!

627
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,160
Chi Xue.

628
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:56,490
Go back.

629
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,280
In a minute.

630
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,090
Hurry up.

631
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,890
Boss, on credit.

632
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Manniang's sister-in-law.
