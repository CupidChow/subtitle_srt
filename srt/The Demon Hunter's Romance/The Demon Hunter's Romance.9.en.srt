[The Demon Hunter's Romance]

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,960
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Banxia.

4
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,530
Five grams of banxia.

5
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,200
Fifth row, third drawer.

6
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,420
Fifth...

7
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,960
Found it.

8
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,590
These past couple of days,

9
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,790
I've been carefully thinking about

10
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,370
Chi Wangchuan's last words.

11
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,000
What we can be certain of now is

12
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,150
my father is still alive.

13
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,120
It's just that

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,680
he was taken by a powerful demon.

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,470
But until his dying breath,

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
he never mentioned

17
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,470
who this demon was,

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
let alone where it lives.

19
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,800
So, in that case,

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
we've lost all our leads.

21
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,840
Ten grams of duhuo.

22
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,070
Duhuo...

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,190
Found it.

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,240
Chi Wangchuan also said

25
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,960
my father had borrowed a life from a demon before,

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,120
intending to fake his death and escape.

27
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,150
But he failed.

28
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,280
Ten grams of chaihu.

29
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,940
Chaihu...

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,340
Chaihu is in...

31
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,000
The fifth drawer of the second row from the top.

32
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,850
Second from the top...

33
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,520
Found it.

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,870
So now the question is,

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,430
what exactly is this life-exchanging demon

36
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,410
he mentioned?

37
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,710
If he dared to lend his life,

38
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,360
it means

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,980
he had a way to get out unscathed.

40
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,520
So, does that mean

41
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,980
if we find him,

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,630
we can find out my father's whereabouts?

43
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,420
Haven't you forgotten something?

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,870
What is it?

45
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,030
Didn't I tell you before?

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,950
We demon hunters work

47
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,140
for payment.

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,590
I can help you,

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,800
but you must pay me.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
One thousand taels of silver.

51
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,400
But when you caught Manniang

52
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,470
and Chi Wangchuan before,

53
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,190
I didn't see you charging any silver.

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,190
Lord Geng of Guangping Prefecture

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,280
once helped me.

56
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,800
I promised him

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,470
that as long as he's in Guangping,

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,660
I'll keep the people under his rule safe.

59
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,190
Well, I'm also

60
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,400
one of the people under his rule.

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,630
Besides,

62
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,240
I've helped you before.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,829
If it weren't for me,

64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,950
how could you have caught the Mirror Demon so quickly?

65
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,910
Don't go.

66
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,040
Why are there so many bugs?

67
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
So many bugs!

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,680
There are bugs here.

69
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,360
No, no.

70
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,720
Hey,

71
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,270
why are there so many bugs?

72
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,750
These are called Moon Bugs.

73
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,390
They're specifically for dealing with demons.

74
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,680
Haven't you seen them before?

75
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,750
W-Why do you have bugs

76
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,920
in your pharmacy?

77
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,630
Are you scared?

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,830
Stop laughing.

79
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Since you're so afraid of bugs,

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,090
don't touch my things

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,040
carelessly.

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,430
I-I'm not scared, I just...

83
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,570
I've never seen anything like this before.

84
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,630
Why do they glow?

85
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,000
Moon Bugs feed on moonlight.

86
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,360
Of course they glow.

87
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,680
They feed on moonlight?

88
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,720
Then what's that in your hand?

89
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,580
They occasionally eat some

90
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,090
fish gills and sheep lungs.

91
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,920
Strange bugs raised by a strange person.

92
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,250
How about

93
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,010
you lend me that book to read?

94
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,460
What book?

95
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,280
The one you lent to Wen Jian last time,

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,160
the Hundred Demon Catalog.

97
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,190
I often see demons.

98
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,430
If I read up on them beforehand,

99
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,600
at least next time

100
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
I won't be so panicked.

101
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,870
No.

102
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,980
W-Why not?

103
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,000
Xuanye!

104
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,630
Xuanye!

105
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
Mrs. Song.

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
I just passed by

107
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,190
the vegetable garden.

108
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,270
I saw Ms. Cui

109
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,750
fainted in her yard again.

110
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,830
You'd better go check on her quickly.

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,870
Let's go.

112
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,270
Physician Jiu.

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,360
Ms. Cui,

114
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,630
are you feeling better?

115
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,580
Did I faint again just now?

116
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

117
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,390
You haven't fully recovered

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,480
from your palpitations yet.

119
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,270
You still need to continue taking the medicine.

120
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,870
I've already

121
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,870
written some prescriptions for you.

122
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,830
In a bit,

123
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,040
Chi Xue will bring them over.

124
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,670
[Ms. Cui]

125
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,190
Also...

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,560
This too.

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
I can't accept this.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
I haven't used up the money

129
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,950
you gave me last time.

130
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,830
Ms. Cui,

131
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,000
don't be so polite.

132
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,510
This is all part of my duty.

133
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,400
Thank you.

134
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,790
Then I'll take my leave now.

135
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,420
Who was that Ms. Cui?

136
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,180
The wife of my shop assistant.

137
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,510
You don't have any shop assistants.

138
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,000
So,

139
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,950
as you can see,

140
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,850
I'm not very popular.

141
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
The pharmacy hardly has any business.

142
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,070
The government jobs rarely pay.

143
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,760
And I have several families to support.

144
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,720
You're asking for my help

145
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,520
and you still have the nerve to bargain with me?

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,600
It's mainly because

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,070
that 1,000 taels you're asking for is too much.

148
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,190
How about this?

149
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,360
I'll pay you a part first.

150
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,000
When you

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,070
find my father later,

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,160
have him pay you.

153
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
He has a lot of money.

154
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,169
Move aside! Quickly, move aside!

155
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,440
Make way! Make way! Make way!

156
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,550
Make way!

157
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,370
[Gao Sheng]

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,930
He seems to be dead.

159
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,360
Chief Constable Wen.

160
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,750
Are you done?

161
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,230
Yes.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Thank you.

163
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,550
Let's go.

164
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,130
That was really dangerous.

165
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,440
You weren't scared, were you?

166
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,330
How is that person

167
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,110
who was hit?

168
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
Even Xuanye couldn't save him.

169
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,790
He died on the spot.

170
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,720
Hurry up. Behave yourself.

171
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,870
Behave yourself.

172
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,240
It's you again,

173
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,600
Mr. Gao?

174
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,910
Hello.

175
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,590
Where's the lord?

176
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,480
In the back courtyard.

177
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,440
Take him away.

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,790
Quickly.

179
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,600
How will that person be sentenced?

180
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,550
Recklessly riding a horse on the street,

181
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,590
taking someone's life…

182
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,480
It isn't the first time this bastard did this.

183
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,970
Lord Geng won't let him off easily.

184
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,040
It's getting late.

185
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,670
You two should head back first.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,720
I'll work for a while longer.

187
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,410
About your father's matter,

188
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
I've kept it in mind.

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,790
But this matter

190
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,630
isn't something that can be resolved

191
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,630
overnight.

192
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,370
You don't need to keep rushing me every day.

193
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,870
You don't want the money anymore?

194
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,470
I'm not trying to rush you.

195
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,630
As the saying goes,

196
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,690
two heads

197
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,630
are better than one.

198
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,630
I want to discuss something with you.

199
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,760
Shouldn't we

200
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,710
start investigating this life-swapping demon first?

201
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,360
Tell me, what exactly is this

202
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
life-swapping demon?

203
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,840
Why is he so bold?

204
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,240
He doesn't even fear death.

205
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:54,890
Alright.

206
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,440
Stop talking about it.

207
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,800
I'm already home.

208
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,670
You should go back now.

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,270
If there's any progress on the matter,

210
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,280
I'll let you know.

211
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,790
Then, tomorrow...

212
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,870
My Lady, where have you been? I...

213
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,270
Young Master.

214
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,720
Yanqiu.

215
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,150
Have a seat.

216
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,150
Would you like some tea?

217
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,440
Let's not rush to drink tea.

218
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,270
I have something to ask you.

219
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,120
Why were you with him?

220
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,240
Who?

221
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,030
The one living next door to you.

222
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,840
My father was taken by a demon.

223
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,330
None of you believed me.

224
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,240
I could only turn to him.

225
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Is he a good person or a bad person?

226
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,240
Do you know?

227
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,600
You trust him just like that?

228
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,670
Did you know Grandmother is ill?

229
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,150
The doctor has visited.

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
He said it's due to excessive worry

231
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,270
and depression in her heart.

232
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,000
How could this be?

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,430
She was fine when I left.

234
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,130
Yes, that was when you left.

235
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,750
You left home

236
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,750
without a word.

237
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,870
You haven't even sent a letter.

238
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,000
Grandmother is already over 70.

239
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,750
She just experienced the pain of losing a son,

240
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,200
and now she has to worry about you all day.

241
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,510
She can't eat or drink.

242
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,500
She cries every day.

243
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,530
How could she not fall ill?

244
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,320
Banxia,

245
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,910
you weren't like this before.

246
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,360
Among the sisters in the family,

247
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,960
you were the most obedient and gentle.

248
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,120
But now,

249
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,790
how could you do

250
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,350
such an unfilial thing?

251
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,390
You ran away from home before

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,720
Uncle Yingheng's mourning period had even passed.

253
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,030
Being a young woman alone out there,

254
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,890
how can your family

255
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,070
not worry about you?

256
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,690
I know I was wrong this time,

257
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,360
but I had no choice.

258
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,390
What do you want me to believe?

259
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,670
Should I believe in your so-called

260
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,170
tales of monsters and ghosts,

261
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,600
or should I believe that Uncle Yingheng

262
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
can come back from the dead?

263
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,510
My father is not dead.

264
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,390
I've already found some clues.

265
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,120
Enough!

266
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,960
Pack your things.

267
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,010
Come back with me immediately.

268
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm not leaving.

269
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,270
You've already turned the household

270
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:32,960
into a mess.

271
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,000
What more do you want?

272
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,390
You must come back with me today.

273
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,570
I'm not leaving. Tingzhou!

274
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,150
I won't go.

275
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,970
-My Lady!
-Let go of me!

276
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,940
Young Master,

277
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,670
please believe her.

278
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,410
I didn't believe it at first either.

279
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,030
Get out of the way.

280
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm not leaving.

281
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,200
Don't pull me.

282
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,750
My Lady!

283
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,840
Do you need any help?

284
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,170
These are all the files

285
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,080
of the throat-slitting case.

286
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,520
You can take a look.

287
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,900
Why do you have

288
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,570
official case files?

289
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,870
I handled the case,

290
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,360
so I was able to borrow them.

291
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,200
Moreover,

292
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,270
you are also a government official,

293
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,240
and had a close relationship with the criminal.

294
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,670
So there's no need to be secretive.

295
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,080
Three years ago, Qu Manniang

296
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,150
came to Guangping.

297
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,150
In just three short years,

298
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,080
she committed 23 murders.

299
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,910
The victims included men and women,

300
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,370
old and young.

301
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,360
Most of them were people with beautiful voices.

302
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,320
She had many identities in her daily life:

303
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,550
singer, dancer,

304
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,790
merchant, tourist.

305
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,120
Her last crime

306
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,480
in Guangping

307
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,440
was luring and killing a child.

308
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,740
Lord Geng from the government office asked me to intervene.

309
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,150
I confronted her.

310
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,550
She was no match for me,

311
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,670
so she fled to Nanyang.

312
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,750
In Nanyang City,

313
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,880
she disguised herself as

314
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,000
a ventriloquist performer.

315
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,670
Her skills were astonishing,

316
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,150
causing quite a stir

317
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,030
in the city.

318
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,120
And then,

319
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,120
she met you, Lord Duan.

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,140
This is absurd.

321
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,840
Manniang was just a weak woman.

322
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,670
How could she, in a heavily guarded

323
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,360
marquis's mansion,

324
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,480
kill a singer

325
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,240
and take her throat?

326
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,150
And with this one,

327
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,390
how could she subtly cut out

328
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,000
the storyteller's throat

329
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,550
in a hall full of guests?

330
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,390
This is simply a fantasy.

331
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,120
A weak woman certainly couldn't do it.

332
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,030
But she

333
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
was not just a weak woman.

334
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,550
What do you mean?

335
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,870
Banxia has already

336
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,270
explained it very clearly to you before.

337
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:40,930
It's just that you

338
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
don't want to believe it.

339
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,150
I was wondering

340
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,600
why Banxia dared to leave home.

341
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,520
It turns out you bewitched her.

342
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,750
Before this,

343
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,600
you sneaked into my residence

344
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,730
and slandered my wife.

345
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,590
Now, you're deceiving my sister.

346
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,840
Who exactly are you?

347
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,500
Yanqiu...

348
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:01,980
Shut up.

349
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,080
Sister-in-law Manniang

350
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,530
was really a demon, not a human.

351
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,320
The prefectural governor of Guangping Prefecture

352
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,630
and those constables

353
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,840
can all testify to this.

354
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,360
Why won't you believe it?

355
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,320
And my father really isn't dead.

356
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,520
I'm not talking nonsense.

357
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,390
I don't want to

358
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,320
discuss these things with you now.

359
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,410
I came here today

360
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,750
just to take you home.

361
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,750
Grandmother is ill

362
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,480
and everyone at home misses you dearly.

363
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,080
If you still have any sense,

364
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,670
come back with me right now.

365
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
I can't go back with you.

366
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,320
You—

367
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,590
Hearing is deceiving. Seeing is believing.

368
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,990
Lord Duan, you're so stubborn.

369
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,600
I don't have the ability to convince you either.

370
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,960
You'd better experience it yourself.

371
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,280
Chi Xue!

372
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,150
Lord Duan.

373
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,580
Steamed buns!

374
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,790
Thank you

375
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,220
for today.

376
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,369
What are you laughing at?

377
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,000
You seem to always be saying that.

378
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,349
Actually, in this world,

379
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,880
most people

380
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,960
don't have the courage to face the truth.

381
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,680
Rather than facing

382
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,069
those bloody facts,

383
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,000
they prefer to believe

384
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,350
what they want to believe.

385
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,830
This is normal.

386
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,590
If your cousin were to believe you,

387
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,920
he would have to believe

388
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,240
that his wife was a demon.

389
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,160
This is difficult for him.

390
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,960
I understand.

391
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,550
So,

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,920
cheer up.

393
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,590
Don't look so gloomy.

394
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,160
Are you trying to comfort me?

395
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,270
What do you think?

396
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,200
Then I'll take it as such.

397
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,000
My Lady.

398
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,790
Why is there so little wine in your house?

399
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,920
Put it down.

400
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,680
Put it all down.

401
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,550
Want a drink?

402
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,680
I forgot.

403
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,750
You don't drink.

404
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,160
Father doesn't like to drink either.

405
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,480
In the entire family,

406
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,790
only Manniang would drink with me.

407
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,830
Manniang had an excellent capacity for alcohol,

408
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,400
even better than mine.

409
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,220
Yanqiu, stop drinking.

410
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,080
You're drunk.

411
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,100
Yes,

412
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,070
I'm drunk.

413
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm drunk.

414
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,160
When I married Manniang,

415
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,570
everyone in the family disapproved.

416
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,480
They said

417
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,860
her background

418
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,790
wasn't a match for me.

419
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,930
But whether we matched or not,

420
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,610
how would they know?

421
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,310
Only me…

422
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,680
Only I know.

423
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,930
I earned my scholarly honors at 16 years old.

424
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,920
I studied and practiced martial arts,

425
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,160
never slacking off.

426
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,670
I can support myself

427
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,480
and take care of my family.

428
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,590
I don't want those

429
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,920
rich ladies

430
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,640
who come for my family status

431
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,990
and government position.

432
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,240
I only want someone…

433
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
Someone who only likes me,

434
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,680
someone who only cares about me.

435
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,270
Manniang was that person.

436
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,400
But I failed to protect her.

437
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,350
Yanqiu, she was a demon.

438
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,420
She harmed many people.

439
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,600
But she didn't harm me.

440
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,270
But in the end,

441
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,880
humans and demons are different.

442
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,190
Humans and demons are different.

443
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes.

444
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,100
Just as Father said,

445
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,690
when two people are together,

446
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,720
the most important thing is to be of equal social status.

447
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,700
But when two people are together,

448
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,480
isn't the most important thing

449
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,680
that they like each other?

450
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,690
Banxia,

451
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,960
when she died...

452
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,650
Was it painful?

453
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,830
It probably wasn't painful.

454
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,750
That's good then.

455
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,160
That's good.

456
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,510
Yanqiu,

457
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,640
when Sister-in-law was dying,

458
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,110
she asked me to tell you

459
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,680
that she truly liked you.

460
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,720
She never intended to harm you.

461
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,030
I know.

462
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,100
I know.

463
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,920
Tell me.

464
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
If I had

465
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,350
met her earlier,

466
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,640
stopped her sooner,

467
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
and discovered earlier,

468
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,920
would she have,

469
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,310
for my sake, given up her murderous thoughts

470
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,990
and stopped doing evil?

471
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Could things have been

472
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,920
different between us?

473
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,480
A sunken ship can be salvaged,

474
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,160
but spilled water cannot be gathered.

475
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,790
The dead are gone.

476
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,110
Thinking more is useless.

477
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,400
Different.

478
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,480
Different.

479
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,240
Different.

480
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,400
Different.

481
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,440
Yanqiu.

482
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,510
Different.

483
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,590
Tingzhou!

484
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,960
Tingzhou!

485
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Help me lift him up.

486
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,110
Alright.

487
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,240
My Lady.

488
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,600
Why don't I go find Chi Xue for help?

489
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,220
It's so late. He's probably asleep.

490
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,410
He won't.

491
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,310
I'll go check.

492
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,690
Physician Jiu.

493
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,130
My Lady.

494
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,550
Why are you here?

495
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,460
Why else?

496
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,350
Where's Chi Xue?

497
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,400
Apparently he went out.

498
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,060
Tingzhou, grab his hand.

499
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,440
Careful, careful.

500
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,240
This way.

501
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,920
Thank you for today.

502
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,750
Let me walk you out.

503
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,960
I have something for you.

504
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,270
What's this?

505
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,920
Didn't you catch a cold?

506
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,590
Thank you.

507
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,570
I'll go back now.

508
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,610
You have some gray hair?

509
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,240
It's fine.

510
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,400
You can't see it yourself.

511
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,560
Let's buy some black beans tomorrow

512
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,110
to make bean dye.

513
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,270
Then I'll dye your hair when we get back.

514
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,750
You know how to dye hair?

515
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,640
When I was at home,

516
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
I often dyed my father's hair.

517
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,160
Alright.

518
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,200
Do as you please.

519
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,270
My Lady,

520
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,590
I think Physician Jiu likes you.

521
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,640
Why do you say that?

522
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,400
I just went next door.

523
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,750
I clearly saw Chi Xue,

524
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,430
but he said Chi Xue wasn't home.

525
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,820
He insisted on coming over to help himself.

526
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,880
Really?

527
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,440
It's absolutely true.

528
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
Chi Xue revealed his true form.

529
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,270
He turned into a rabbit and was gnawing on shoes.

530
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,350
I saw it all.

531
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,550
My Lady,

532
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,790
do you think we could

533
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,830
take a little advantage of this?

534
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,070
We could coax Physician Jiu

535
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,200
to help us find Master.

536
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,090
Don't talk nonsense.

537
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,680
There's no need for that.

538
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,990
He has already agreed to help.

539
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,780
Really?

540
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,270
Alright,

541
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
let's leave it at that.

542
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,000
Don't let anyone else know about this.

543
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,440
Otherwise,

544
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,680
it will be awkward when we meet.

545
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,640
Of course I won't say anything.

546
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,070
My Lady,

547
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,240
you're already betrothed.

548
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,530
There's no possibility with him.

549
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,420
But it's true,

550
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,270
Xuanye is very nice to me.

551
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,590
Who can deny that?

552
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,370
Xuanye,

553
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,030
I'm back.

554
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,310
I bought some snacks. Would you like some?

555
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,920
Chi Xue.

556
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,730
What's this?

557
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,920
This is my pet.

558
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,640
It's so cute!

559
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,070
Xuanye, can I keep it?

560
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,550
Your pet?

561
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,270
You can't keep it.

562
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,070
Prisoner Gao Sheng.

563
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
I've reviewed your past records.

564
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,060
Three years ago,

565
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,540
you drunkenly rode your horse into the fields

566
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,270
and injured

567
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,060
a Mrs. Zhang who was working there.

568
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,660
Mrs. Zhang

569
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,290
was pregnant at the time.

570
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,070
And a year ago,

571
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,720
in the market,

572
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,640
you deliberately rode your horse over and broke

573
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,180
the leg of a beggar.

574
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,720
You truly never learn, do you?

575
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,100
Yesterday,

576
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,110
again in the market,

577
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,960
you deliberately rode your horse to commit a crime

578
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,720
and killed a passerby named Wang Zi'an.

579
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Do you plead guilty?

580
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,720
I was drunk.

581
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,640
It was unintentional.

582
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,110
Unintentional?

583
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,750
All these incidents

584
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,550
have witness testimonies.

585
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,970
Take a close look.

586
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,960
Is there

587
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,340
a single word

588
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,640
that wrongly accuses you?

589
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,350
My Lord,

590
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,510
there's no need for a trial.

591
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,790
I plead guilty, alright?

592
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,160
How much money do they want?

593
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,200
I'll pay it all.

594
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,000
Paying compensation is a given.

595
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,310
However,

596
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,880
you must also pay with your life.

597
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,810
My Lord,

598
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,390
I was drunk, and so are you now.

599
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,480
You're not new to Guangping.

600
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,960
Don't you know about the Gao family?

601
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,240
My Lord,

602
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,240
this is

603
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,330
the son of Deputy Gao, the wealthy landowner from the east of the city.

604
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,190
He has a sister

605
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,490
who entered Prince Xiang's household three years ago

606
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,570
as a concubine.

607
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,400
She has given birth to three sons

608
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,030
and is highly favored.

609
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,310
My Lord, rest assured,

610
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,570
I will pay every cent of compensation due.

611
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,000
I won't put you in a difficult position.

612
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,960
I'll also spend a few days in jail.

613
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,920
Just consider it

614
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,590
as penance for my sins.

615
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,970
If you want to

616
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,630
truly repent and atone for your sins,

617
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,720
then go to the underworld

618
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,900
and tell it to the deceased.

619
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,070
Guards!

620
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,110
Yes, sir.

621
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,880
Prisoner Gao Sheng,

622
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,590
for deliberately using your horse to commit a crime,

623
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,890
you will be imprisoned

624
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,970
according to our dynasty's laws

625
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,240
and executed after autumn.

626
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,030
Yes, sir.

627
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,000
Go.

628
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,030
How dare you!

629
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,590
My brother-in-law is a prince of the current dynasty.

630
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,440
You dare to touch me?

631
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,370
My sister will be back in a few days.

632
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,610
Well, Mr. Gao,

633
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,040
when exactly is your sister returning?

634
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,000
She'll be back in three days.

635
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,160
In that case,

636
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,640
you will be executed immediately

637
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,920
tomorrow at noon.

638
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,070
Take him away.

639
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:09,920
Yes, sir.

640
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,800
How dare you!

641
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,380
My brother-in-law won't let you off the hook.

642
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,750
He won't spare you.

643
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,640
Go!

644
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,030
Don't worry.

645
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,510
I will take good care of Grandmother.

646
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,400
Be extra careful

647
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,240
staying here.

648
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,590
Find Uncle Yingheng soon

649
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,720
and return home for a family reunion.

650
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,700
I was

651
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,870
blind to your greatness before.

652
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,450
Thank you, Jiu, for not holding a grudge.

653
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,410
I will remember

654
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,640
your kindness in my heart.

655
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,030
I will surely repay you generously in the future.

656
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,000
Banxia grew up in seclusion since childhood.

657
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,550
She knows nothing about social norms.

658
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,310
Regarding Uncle Yingheng's matter,

659
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I'll need to trouble you, Jiu.

660
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,720
Take care on your journey.

661
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,380
Take good care of yourself.

662
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,480
Banxia.

663
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Come with me for a moment.

664
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,720
I told you so.

665
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,980
Sit down.

666
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,200
What's the matter?

667
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,030
Try this.

668
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Chi Xue bought this

669
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,000
last night.

670
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,310
He bought it when your cousin was drunk

671
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:42,960
and Tingzhou came to me

672
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,310
to ask for help.

673
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,640
It tastes pretty good.

674
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,040
You can try it.

675
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,790
Okay.

676
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,310
What's that sound?

677
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,510
Chi Xue's pet rabbit.

678
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,640
Isn't he a rabbit demon himself?

679
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,010
Why would he raise rabbits?

680
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,590
Indeed.

681
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,920
I don't know either.

682
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,440
Maybe

683
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,880
he's raising a wife for himself.

684
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,960
So,

685
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,200
do you understand now?

686
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,480
What?

687
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,160
You don't understand?

688
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,080
Do you like it?

689
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,910
If you like it, it's yours.

690
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,790
My Lady.

691
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Chi Xue?

692
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,350
It's Chi Xue's wife.

693
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,510
Wife?

694
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,360
He's got some nerve.

695
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,440
He's going to the execution ground tomorrow,

696
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,960
yet he's sleeping so soundly.

697
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,150
He's been yelling all day.

698
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,070
Guess he's passed out from exhaustion.

699
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,960
Let's go.

700
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,030
Let's go.

701
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,960
Serves him right.

702
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,760
Execute him quickly.

703
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,670
How can there be such a person?

704
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,710
He's too despicable.

705
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,070
This guy,

706
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,260
wasn't he cursing happily yesterday?

707
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,620
Why is he so quiet today?

708
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,710
Maybe he's tired from all the cursing.

709
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,440
Our Lord Geng is quite bold,

710
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,880
even daring to touch

711
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,450
Prince Xiang's brother-in-law.

712
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,800
Then do you know

713
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,290
whose brother-in-law

714
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,710
our lord is?

715
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,030
Whose?

716
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,710
Our lord's surname is Geng

717
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,440
and the Noble Consort's surname is also Geng.

718
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,150
It's half past noon.

719
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:48,800
Execute.

720
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,230
The corpse is placed in the center of the hall.

721
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,030
I'll show the deceased the way.

722
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,760
I advise the deceased

723
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
to not go south.

724
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,410
There's a flaming mountain in the south.

725
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,640
I advise the deceased to not go west.

726
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,920
The west is arid, with thin air.

727
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,840
I advise the deceased,

728
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,760
you should

729
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,190
take the middle path.

730
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,360
Sway and wobble upwards.

731
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,630
[Backyard]

732
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,810
[Moon Teahouse]

733
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,150
Fresh steamed buns just out of the oven.

734
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,480
Fragrant sachets, take a look.

735
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,360
My Lady,

736
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,360
I've bought them.

737
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,430
My Lady,

738
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,040
will currying favor with Physician Jiu like this

739
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,920
be effective?

740
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,590
I don't know either.

741
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,890
What should we do then?

742
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,230
He doesn't want me watching him.

743
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,150
I've noticed he's been very lazy lately.

744
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,480
He doesn't even go out.

745
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,960
He stays at home all day.

746
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,510
How can he help us investigate the case?

747
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,150
What if

748
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,510
he only cares about official matters

749
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,550
and doesn't take our affairs

750
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,840
seriously at all? What should we do?

751
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,880
It's a big world.

752
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,190
He's definitely not the only demon hunter here.

753
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,630
If worst comes to worst,

754
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,590
we can

755
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,070
look for other options

756
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,670
and find a more powerful demon hunter.

757
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,480
Demon hunter?

758
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,670
Ladies,

759
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,510
I'm afraid you've encountered

760
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,740
something unclean, haven't you?

761
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,330
You should seek out

762
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,000
the half-immortal Kongtongzi.

763
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,070
When it comes to capturing demons and monsters,

764
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,210
and the skill of divination,

765
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,600
if Master Kongtongzi

766
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,420
claims he's second in the world,

767
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:52,930
I'm afraid

768
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,400
no one would dare claim first.

769
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,300
[Kongtong Temple]

770
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,610
Greetings, Immortal Master.

771
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,490
Last night,

772
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,220
I observed the celestial phenomena.

773
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,640
I saw the universe's energy was clear,

774
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,650
and the Yaoguang star appeared.

775
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,010
I presumed

776
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,660
that distinguished guests would visit.

777
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,550
That must be you, young lady.

778
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,710
Immortal Master, you flatter me.

779
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,590
I've heard that your skills

780
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,110
are unmatched.

781
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,050
I had some doubts at first,

782
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,300
but now that I've seen you,

783
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,920
you truly have the bearings of an immortal.

784
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,030
You understand swordsmanship, young lady?

785
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't.

786
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,750
But I read books when I was young.

787
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,970
The books mentioned

788
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,510
a superior technique

789
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,900
called Sparrow Doesn't Fly.

790
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,960
It means that while moving and turning,

791
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,430
one's body is graceful and agile,

792
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,320
yet the shoulders remain as steady as a mountain.

793
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,730
Even if a bird were to land on one's shoulder,

794
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,320
it wouldn't feel any tremor

795
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,070
and wouldn't want to fly away.

796
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,230
I always thought

797
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,360
it was the author's fabrication.

798
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,490
I didn't expect it to be real.

799
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,070
Young lady, may I ask you

800
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,800
what is "Sparrow Doesn't Fly"?

801
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,570
Isn't it right here?

802
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,430
Is this a crow?

803
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,760
Why is it white?

804
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,140
Is this your pet, Immortal Master?

805
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,070
Th-th-this...

806
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,890
She's been seen out?

807
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,710
Master, yes.

808
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,030
Master,

809
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,280
this Ms. Duan

810
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,920
clearly comes from a wealthy family.

811
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,230
She must be very rich.

812
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
This fat sheep has been delivered right to our mouths.

813
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,400
We

814
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,930
can't let this opportunity slip away.

815
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,630
We'll see, we'll see.

816
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,780
This girl seems to have some tricks up her sleeve.

817
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,960
She's a bit strange.

818
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,610
Does it hurt a lot?

819
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,120
It doesn't hurt.

820
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,290
It's... it's reconnected?

821
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,760
It's reconnected.

822
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,610
You need to be careful these days.

823
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,630
You can't work or lift heavy objects.

824
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,390
Go home and rest for a few days.

825
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,760
Okay.

826
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,470
Here.

827
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,280
Thank you, Physician Jiu.

828
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,810
You're welcome.

829
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,690
Farewell.

830
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,030
My Lady!

831
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,800
My Lady!

832
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,810
My Lady, wait for me!

833
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,370
Banxia.

834
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,920
Physician Jiu.

835
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,960
Where have you been?

836
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,550
Nothing much.

837
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,030
Just wandering around the streets.

838
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,090
Before, even when I closed the door here,

839
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,600
you would still try to climb over the wall to get in

840
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,260
to take a few peeks.

841
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,280
What's going on today?

842
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,490
Have you done something you feel guilty about?

843
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,510
How could I have done anything to feel guilty about?

844
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:18,840
We

845
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,770
went to buy black beans.

846
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,150
Black beans?

847
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Didn't we agree to use bean dye

848
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,590
to dye your hair?

849
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,030
Black beans, huh?

850
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,110
What are you holding in your hand?

851
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,770
Let me see.

852
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,780
You went to see Kongtonzi, didn't you?

853
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,630
I just went to take a casual look.

854
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,760
He's a fraud.

855
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,140
Be careful not to be swindled out of everything you own.

856
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,800
What should we do, My Lady?
