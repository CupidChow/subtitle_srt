If that's the case,

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,429
why didn't you report it?

179
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,030
Well, you see,

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
he's a heavy drinker

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,000
and often goes traveling with friends.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,840

He drank himself to death?

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,130
I've said it before—

198
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,670
if he kept drinking like that,

199
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,550
he'd drink himself to death sooner or later.

200
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,390
Did I ask you?

201
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,630
Xingxian,

202
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,620
you must stay strong.

203
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,850
My condolences, madam.

204
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,240
Come to the government office within three days

205
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
to claim the body.

206
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,910
Yes.

207
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,490

all recent injuries.

211
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,390
Judging by the torn clothing,

212
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,390
they were likely caused by the fall.

213
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,170
His neck is dislocated and broken.

214

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,330
Indeed, no poison.

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
The only fatal wound

218
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,710
is on the neck.

219
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,440
On such a sunny day,

220
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,210
he actually fell and broke his neck just walking.

221
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,150

No?

Then why did you follow him?

228
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,250
It felt like...

229

like you knew something would happen.

What white crow?

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,450
It's so eerie.

235
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
I'll tell you about it later.

to interrupt your conversation.

298
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,720
It's just that it's getting late,

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
I'll head back.

You're right to be unsure.

Are you hungry?

Why are you eating ink?

324
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,880
What's wrong?

325
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,860
You've been uneasy lately.

326
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,420
Is it that obvious?

327
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,330
What's wrong?

328
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,230
Sit.

329
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,490
There's something that's been confusing me.

330
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,600
I don't know who to talk to about it.

332
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,940
Ever since we left the world in the painting,

333
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,990
I've kept dreaming about what happened there.

334
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,880
In the painting,

335
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,420
I was the county commandant of Guangping.

336
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,810
My parents were alive.

337
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,890
I was even married.

338
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,110
Do you know who my wife was

339
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,040
in the painting?

340
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,360
Who?

341
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,360
Banxia.

342
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,120
Don't laugh!

343
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,670
Well,

344
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,810
it was all just a painting, wasn't it?

345
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,560
What confuses me most is that

346
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,610
it seems impossible for me to move on

347
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,660
from that world.

348
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,570
And I'm not sure

349
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,990
if Banxia has

350
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,420
the same feelings as I do.

351
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,320
Now every time I see her,

352
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,750
something feels off.

353
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,970
Youhuang, here's the thing.

354
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,079
The painting

355
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,920
drawn by that demon

356
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,030
was fake.

357
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,680
Moreover,

358
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,750
to me, Banxia

359
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
treats you like a normal friend.

360
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:21,680
Really?

361
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,150
Youhuang,

362
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,970
you must have noticed

363
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,859
that Banxia likes Xuanye, right?

364
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,200
Banxia likes Xuanye?

365
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,840
How is that possible?

366
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,640
Youhuang,

367
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,090
you're so clueless.

368
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,070
All of us have noticed it.

369
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,760
And honestly,

370
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,090
I'm almost certain

371
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,860
that Xuanye likes Banxia too.

372
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,480
Have you ever seen Xuanye

373
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,280
be so attentive and considerate to another woman?

374
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,480
Youhuang.

375
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,830
As someone who's been through it,

376
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,630
let me give you a piece of advice:

377
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,720
cherish the one in front of you.

378
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:11,930
No.

379
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,560
The one in front of you.

380
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,330
Go away.

381
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,350
Uncle Duan, please get up.

382
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,720
I have come today

383
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
to ask for a favor.

384
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,570
Please stand up first.

385
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,310
I can never repay you for saving my life.

386
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,600
You saved my entire family.

387
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,600
I'd

388
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,160

to return your kindness.

390

However,

391
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,370
if you ask me to repay it

392
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
with my daughter's hand in marriage,

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,830
I…

394
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
can't do it.

395
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,890
Physician Jiu,

396
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,550
you're good-looking

397
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,120
and have inherited your family's craft.

398
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,240
You're also

399
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,830
well-educated.

400
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,570
Though not from a wealthy or noble family,

401
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,160
you still have servants.

402
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,380
From what I've seen,

403
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,720
you've got a calm, refined nature.

404
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,310
And above all,

405
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,680
you saved my whole family.

406

Even if

407
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,920
I were picky,

408
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,900
I couldn't find a single flaw.

409
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,110
But…

410
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,530
there's just one thing—

411
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,440
you're a demon hunter.

412
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,820
I don't want

413
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,520

414
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,490
related to demons ever again.

Capital.

Capital?

419
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,870
Isn't it Shendu City?

420
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,690
Shendu City is the capital.

421
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,930
Are you a foreigner or something?

What a pity.

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,900
I heard that monks can achieve

460

enlightenment by feeding themselves to tigers.

461
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,480
I guess feeding wolves might work too.

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,880

Look carefully at these wolves.

They look fierce,

468

We'll leave

helping our father with things.

Because of my love for music,

00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,590
what's your name?

Are you married?

My name is Jiu Xuanye.

Second in the family.

527
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,950
Nice to meet you, Xuanye.

528
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,850
Xuanye,

529
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
where do you live?

530
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,340
Why are you alone

531
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
in these wild mountains?

532
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,150
I live in Guangping City.

533
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,880

534
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,070
What a coincidence!

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,920

How far?

545
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,920
Young Master, this is

546
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,250
the outskirts of Tanzhou.

547
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,140
About three miles ahead

548
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,100
is Tanzhou City.

549
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,370
Guangping

550
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,060
is about three days from here.

Banxia.

552
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,310
Where is he?

553
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,210
I don't know.

554
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,000
When I got up this morning,

555
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,130
he was already gone.

556
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,160
Banxia.

557
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,230
Father.

558
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,690
You went next door?

559
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,970
But Xuanye isn't home.

560
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,600
If there's nothing else,

561
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,860
I'll go back to my room.

562
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,870
Finally done for the day.

563
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,030

564
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,750
stop bustling about.

565
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,430
Come and have some pastries.

566
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,880
These cardamom cakes you made are so good.

567
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,940
Just as good as the ones sold outside.

568
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,210
Aren't you eating, Banxia?

569
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,200
Banxia?

570
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,440
What's wrong with you?

571
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,640
You seem distracted.

572
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm fine.

573
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,950
It's about your good neighbor again, isn't it?

574
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,400
It's just—

575
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,860
he left early this morning

576
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,040
without saying where he was going.

577
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,800
He didn't leave any message?

578
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,510
He barely goes out?

579
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,890
And he tells you every time he does?

580
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,200
Not every time.

581
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,790
But our relationship

582
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,230
is kind of different now.

583
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,030
Different how?

584
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,590
You two took an oath

585
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,920
to be together forever?

586
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
It seems to me that

587
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,270
you're

588
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,700
carrying a torch for him.

589
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,500
Last time I saw him,

590
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,040
he didn't look too happy.

591
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,680
He's just been

592
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,900
a bit strange lately.

593
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,610
What do you like about him anyway?

594
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,320
I think he's quite ordinary.

595
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
I mean, sure—

596
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,000
he's kind of nice-looking,

597
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,090
knows a bit of medicine

598
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,070
and martial arts,

599
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,510
and owns a house and shop.

600
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,720
His wife doesn't need to serve his parents

601
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,960
or deal with

602
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,180
the sisters-in-law.

603
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,350
Come to think of it,

604
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,350
he's actually got great qualities.

605
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,720
No wonder you like him.

606
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,980
Even I'm a bit tempted.

607
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,790
That's not why I like him.

608
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
It's because when I'm with him,

609
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,480
I feel at ease.

610
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,240
At ease?

611
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,350
No matter what I do,

612
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,700
as long as he's around,

613
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,880
I don't feel afraid.

614
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,650
You've really fallen for him.

615
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,110
Enough about me.

616
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,240
Your house is so big and bright.

617
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,540
It must have cost quite a bit, right?

618
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,720
Someone just died nearby.

619
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,960
It's considered a bit ominous,

620
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,220
so the rent is cheaper.

621
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,110
Besides,

622
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,550
it's close to the market.

623
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,480
So I moved in.

624
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,000
You're really brave.

625
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,150
Every patch of land buries someone.

626
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,360
I'm not afraid at all.

627
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,550
You vicious tramp!

628
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,590
Vicious tramp, come out!

629
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,550
You vicious tramp.

630
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,060
You cheated and caused my second uncle's death.

631
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,240
Today I'm here to get justice

632
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,960
for my uncle!

633
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,000
That's right! Justice!

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,720
Justice!

635
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,240
I didn't cheat. I didn't!

636
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,840
Nonsense!

637
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,320
If you hadn't cheated,

638
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,400
why didn't you report it

639
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,620
when my uncle went missing?

640
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,630
You clearly had something to hide!

641
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,240
Yeah!

642
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,700
Someone like you

643
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,310
should be expelled from the Zhang family!

644
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,440
Yes, expel her!

645
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,070
That's right.

646
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,110
A heartless,

647
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,020
unfaithful woman like you

648
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,210
has no right

649
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,840
to stay in the Zhang family!

650
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,300
Right! Expel her!

651
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,990
Everyone's watching.

652
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,790
You vicious woman,

653
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,920
do you admit to adultery?

654
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,750
Do you admit it?

655
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,070
Do you admit it? Speak up!

656
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,480
Speak!

657
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,160
Speak!

658
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,720
Just admit it.

659
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,400
Yeah, do you admit it?

660
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,270
I admit it.

661
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,270
I admit it's all my fault.

662
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,890
I shouldn't have been born a woman.

663
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,480
If I hadn't, maybe my husband's death

664
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
wouldn't have brought

665
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,160
you bullies to my doorstep!

666
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,040
Watch your mouth!

667
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,130
What did you just say, you vile woman?

668
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,610
You all really think I don't get it?

669
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,410
You act all righteous,

670
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,380
but you just want

671
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,400
to pin a crime on me

672
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,090
and kick me out

673
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,770
so you can steal my house!

674
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,640
Lies!

675
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,630
You filthy tramp!

676
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,960
I'll tear your mouth apart today!

677
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,110
-Don't!
-Hit her!

678
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,550
Hit her! Hit her!

679
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,440
Back off!

680
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,360
Who are you?

681
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,240
Never seen someone dumping slop before?

682
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
I said back off, but you didn't move.

683
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Serves you right.

684
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,790
All of you ganging up

685
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,050
on one helpless woman—

686
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,590
aren't you afraid of the law?

687
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,110
Don't try to scare us with the law.

688
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,030
Who are you?

689
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
That's

690
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,720
none of your business!

691
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,240
You're assaulting someone in public,

692
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,400
and she's hurt.

693
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,550
If you don't leave,

694
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,750
I'll report this to the government now.

695
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,480
Fine.

696
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,830
You win this time.

697
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,790
But I don't believe

698
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,160
you two can protect her forever.

699
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,960
Just you wait.

700
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Just you wait!

701
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,520
Are you okay?

702
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,400
As your neighbor,

703
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,590
I've heard a bit

704
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,850
about your situation.

705
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,040
Forgive me for saying this,

706
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,200
but your husband

707
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,230
was an alcoholic.

708
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,480
He was rude

709
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,400
and violent.

710
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,480
His death

711
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,330
must be a relief for you.

712
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,540
Maybe you should report this.

713
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,920
You're all alone.

714
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,800
If they come back,

715
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,930
what will you do?

716
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,930
At worst, they'll beat me to death.

717
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,720
Don't say such things.

718
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,790
Is there no justice left in this world?

719
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,320
You can't be afraid of them.

720
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,310
The more fear you show,

721
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,840
the more they'll bully you.

722
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,960
The Sanhuai Lane

723
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,160
really is cursed.

724
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,400
Banxia,

725
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,960
do you remember the man

726
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
who fell to his death the other day?

727
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,960
He lived here too.

728
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,170
You knew him?

729
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,750
No.

730
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,810
I live right there.

731
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,310
We're neighbors from now on.

732
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,710
If you need any help,

733
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,680
just call me.

734
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,650
Thank you.

735
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,240
Let's go.

736
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,300
You again!

737
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,960
I was about to look for you,

738
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,489
yet you showed up yourself.

739
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,290
Where did you get this?

740
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,120
Do you really know Manying?

741
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,030
Yeah, I do.

742
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,090
Untie the rope,

743
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,370
kneel down,

744
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,770
and kowtow three times to me.

745
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,430
Then I'll take you to find him.

746
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,350
You don't know him.

747
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,950
Xuanye.

748
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,480
Xuanye…

749
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,230
Then do you know Xuanye?

750
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,200
You do.

751
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,070
Then take me to see him.

752
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,760
No way!

753
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,640
Then I'll have no choice but to kill you.

754
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,980
I don't think you will.

755
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,980
I don't have much patience.

756
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,230
Three.

757
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,190
Two.

758
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,860
I'll take you.

759
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,260
I can take you to him,

760
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,350
but after you see him,

761
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,480
you have to let me go.

762
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,070
Sure.

763
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,280
Once I see him, I'll let you go.

764
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,440
Physician Jiu isn't here.

765
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,700
Come back another day.

766
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,400
He's been gone for three days.

767
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,490
Think carefully again.

768
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,090
Did he say where he was going?

769
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,250
Where have you been all these days?

770
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,150
Banxia?

771
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,270
It really is you!

772
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:40,960
Don't you recognize me?

773
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,890
It's me, Li Xian.

774
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,030
Xuanye.

775
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,400
This is Banxia,

776
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,510
my fiancée.

777
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,350
Sir,

778
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,700
madam,

779
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,980
after I heard what happened to you,

780
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,810
I traveled day and night

781
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,470
to get here.

782
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
This is truly wonderful news.

783
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,480
Uncle Duan has returned,

784
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,020
and Aunt Duan has been found.

785
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,320
When my father heard about it,

786
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
he was so happy he drank

787
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,690
three big bowls of wine!

788
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,180
If not for his official duties,

789
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,580
he would've come with me.

790
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
It was a long journey.

791
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,000
Xian,

792
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
you must be tired.

793
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,570
Uncle, you're so kind.

794
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,030
We're all

795
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,490
one family now, aren't we?

796
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,800
Oh, right.

797
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,960
This is Physician Jiu. His name is Xuanye.

798
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,900
He saved my life.

799
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,550
My journey here

800
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,020
was full of danger—

801
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,420
steep mountains,

802
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,520
vicious beasts,

803
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,860
and wolves all around.

804
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,390
I barely made it out alive.

805
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,420
If it hadn't been for Xuanye,

806
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,550
who scared off the wolves

807
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,880
with his mere presence,

808
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,690
this fragile body of mine

809
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,920
would've disappeared

810
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,850
from this world.

811
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,320
Xuanye

812
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,880
is not only kind and righteous

813
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,140
but also clever, wise,

814
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,430
well-read,

815
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,710
and talented.

816
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,190
On our way back,

817
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,990
we talked about

818
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,390
astrology, geography, and local customs.

819
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,390
We never ran out of things to say.

820
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,990
I truly wish we had met earlier.

821
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,330
Xian, you may not know,

822
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,670
but we've known

823
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,540
Physician Jiu for some time now.

824
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,710
He also saved

825
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,840
our whole family.

826
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,360
What a coincidence!

827
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,670
Xuanye,

828
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,760
I told you we were destined to meet.

829
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,020
We should do as I suggested—

830
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,320
follow the ways of the ancients,

831
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,110
drink blood wine,

832
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,640
and become sworn brothers.

833
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,600
But he refused.

834
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,310
Thank you, Physician Jiu,

835
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,560
for saving Li Xian.

836
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,850
It's a great kindness

837
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,070
to both the Duan family

838
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,470
and Banxia.

839
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,360
You must be tired

840
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,200
after your long journey.

841
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,440
Why don't you go home and get some rest?

842
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,360
In a few days,

843
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,480
I'll host a banquet at Yanlai Restaurant

844
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,670
and invite you to drink with us.

845
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,570
That's a great idea.

846
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,480
Xuanye,

847
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,230
don't turn us down then.

848
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,480
Okay.

849
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,440
I'll head back now.

850
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,030
Yeah, Banxia,

851
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,230
see Xuanye off for me.

852
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,360
Xuanye,

853
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,610
I'll come to thank you in person soon.

854
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,950
Xuanye.

855
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,760
Xuanye.

856
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,300
As you know,

857
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,880
I've already told my father

858
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,320
about breaking off the engagement,

859
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,030
and he was going to write to the Li family.

860
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,280
I don't know why

861
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,830
Li Xian suddenly showed up.

862
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,830
Are you mad?

863
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,150
I'm not mad.

864
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,960
Really?

865
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,070
Really.

866
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,660
You should go back now.

867
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,400
After all, he came here for you.

868
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,460
Don't be impolite.

869
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,810
But...

870
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm really fine.

871
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,330
Alright then.

872
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,280
I'll come see you later.

873
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,000
Okay.

874
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,950
Bodhisattva,

875
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,740
I'm here again.

876
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,510
Lv Sanlang is dead too.

877
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,190
I think

878
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,750
you must've heard my prayers

879
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,000
and used your divine powers

880
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,800
to punish the wicked.

881
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,880
My life has been full of sorrow.

882
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,670
I married Zhang Pu at 15.

883
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,150
After we married,

884
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,170
he drank excessively every day

885
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,480
and beat

886
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,470
and yelled at me over the slightest thing.

887
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,950
After his death,

888
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,130
my neighbor Lv Sanlang

889
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,510
took advantage of my being alone

890
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,430
and often harassed me.

891
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,210
I had no one to turn to,

892
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,200
so I came to you.

893
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,370
But I never thought

894
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,850
you would really listen.

895
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,640
Bodhisattva,

896
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,200
you've already helped me twice.

897
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,480
I thought I could start

898
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,960
a new life,

899
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,270
but why is it still not possible?

900
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,280
Is it that I don't deserve

901
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,940
to have happiness in this life?

902
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,840
If I were a man,

903
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,640
everything would be different, right?

904
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,820
Bodhisattva,

905
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,070
please help me.

906
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,680
This is the last time I'm asking for your help.

907
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,190
Please show mercy.

908
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,960
Being a woman is too painful.

909
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,760
In my next life,

910
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,960
please let me be a man.

911
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,840
Take care.

912
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,070
Banxia.

913
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,660
Are you looking for Xuanye?

914
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Yeah.

915
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,390
He's not here.

916
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,680
Where did he go?

917
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,770
He went fishing.

918
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,160
Then I'll go find him.

919
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,140
Chi Xue.

920
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,580
Lend me your umbrella.

921
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,150
I don't want

922
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,740
my daughter involved in anything

923
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,690
related to demons ever again.

924
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,400
And I don't want her

925
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,590
to marry a demon hunter.

926
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,190
Do it!

927
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,190
Xuanye.

928
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,840
I've been looking for you.

929
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,920
It's going to rain,

930
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,230
so I brought an umbrella

931
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,030
to pick you up.

932
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,170
Let's go home.

933
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,040
Once it starts raining,

934
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,030
it'll be hard to find shelter.

935
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,710
Banxia.

936
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,070
I need to talk to you.

937
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,030
Can't it wait

938
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,420
until we get home?

939
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,360
Let's go home first.

940
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,710
Let's end things here.
