[Episode 20]

3
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,759
Where am I?

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,200
W-What are you guys up to?

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,950
And who are you?

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,750
Stop talking.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,539
Leave me alone.

8
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,310
Sir?

9
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,030
Sir,

10
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,220
I-I'm hungry.

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,650
Can you untie me

12
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
and give me something to eat?

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,800
Hey,

14
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,560
don't be so silent.

15
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,910
Just cut to the chase.

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,940
Are you after my money or my looks?

17
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,470
if you want money, we can talk.

18
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,930
I'm from a wealthy family.

19
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,290
We can talk about it.

20
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,310
S-See?

21
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm just a weak girl.

22
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,970
I can't escape

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,460
now that you've caught me,

24
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,500
but whatever you're planning,

25
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,300
you can't let me

26
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,530
starve to death, huh?

27
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,630
Otherwise,

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
you would end up

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,290
getting nothing for it.

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
Not a great deal, huh?

31
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,630
Don't glare at me.

32
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,150
Honestly,

33
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,830
I haven't had anything to eat or drink

34
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,220
since this morning.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,870
You don't know how much a girl has to go through

36
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,820
for a wedding ceremony.

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,640
You know what?

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,310
When I woke up this morning,

39
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,550
firstly, I had to wash up.

40
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,780
After washing up,

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,120
I had to get dressed up.

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,720
After getting dressed up...

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,470
Hey! Untie me!

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,640
Big Brother!

45
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,250
Where are you going?

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,170
Oh no,

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,420
Big Brother is mad.

48
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,250
What are you doing?

49
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,370
Listen,

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,460
don't mess around!

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,030
Do you know who I am?

52
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
Where's that guy?

53
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
You mean our Big Brother?

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,940
Aren't you hungry?

55
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,000
Damao probably

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
went to buy you some food.

57
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,060
So his name is Damao?

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,910
Yes.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,030
Didn't he tell you

60
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,870
his name?

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,370
Y-You don't even know

62
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,120
h-his name?

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,750
How am I supposed to know that?

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,150
Because he likes you!

65
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,090
The other day,

66
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,610
he headed south first,

67
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,710
then north,

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
and then he met you.

69
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,510
he fell in love with you.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,589
Fell for me?

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,390
Yes.

72
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,830
Didn't you know that?

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,070
No, I didn't!

74
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,120
Oh no.

75
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,630
Oh no.

76
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,690
Oh, our Big Brother.

77
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,180
He's such a poor thing.

78
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,160
It was all for nothing.

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,090
So Big Brother is one... one-sided...

80
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,070
Shut up.

81
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,159
All of you, be quiet.

82
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,800
You speak.

83
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,750
What else is there to say?

84
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,950
When our Big Brother ran into you,

85
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,310
he fell in love with you.

86
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,070
He didn't want you to marry someone else.

87
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,720
So we came to snatch the bride!

88
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,280
So,

89
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,090
you are now our

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,070
sister-in-law!

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,930
Sister-in-law!

92
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,560
Really?

93
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,880
For sure!

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,660
Stop laughing.

95
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,150
Get up.

96
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,380
Big Brother is back.

97
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,630
Just something simple.

98
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,490
Make do with it.

99
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,100
These snacks...

100
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,240
Hey, don't be rude.

101
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,200
Line up, line up.

102
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,850
Big Brother,

103
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,950
I'll distribute the snacks to them.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,060
Let's go, let's go.

105
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,290
We'll leave you to it, Big Brother.

106
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,000
If you don't untie my hands,

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,330
how am I supposed to eat?

108
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,760
Don't you want some too?

109
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,050
I'm not hungry.

110
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,130
Are there

111
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,890
only four of you in your family?

112
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,120
Are your parents

113
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,250
still in Guangping?

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't bother asking me anything

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,830
or trying to probe for information.

116
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,900
I won't hurt you.

117
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,390
I'm just still not sure

118
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,750
how exactly

119
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,680
to explain

120
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,800
everything to you.

121
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,810
Let me think about it.

122
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,610
I'll tell you when I've decided.

123
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,680
Now that I look at you,

124
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,600
you're indeed way more handsome than your

125
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
three younger brothers.

126
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,870
Come on...

127
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,430
Your brothers

128
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,750
have told me everything.

129
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,440
You kidnapped me at my wedding

130
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,950
because you fell for me.

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,630
When did you

132
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,360
run into me?

133
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,040
Was it in Guangping?

134
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
Why don't I remember?

135
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,870
That makes sense.

136
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,360
I have always

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,530
been popular since I was young.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,870
But you came too late.

139
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,920
My husband, you know,

140
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,240
works in the government office.

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,920
Given the way

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,870
you kidnapped me in broad daylight,

143
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,240
you'll be convicted of a felony.

144
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,100
How about this?

145
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,870
If you let me go now,

146
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
I'll go back

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,240
and put in a good word for you,

148
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,770
asking him to go easy on you.

149
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,200
You're still young.

150
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,870
You don't understand that

151
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,270
love can't come by

152
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,870
through force.

153
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,830
Just take it as

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,890
we're not meant for each other,

155
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,830
okay?

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,630
Have you heard that?

157
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,830
Lord Huang was getting married today.

158
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,680
But a sedan chair bearer took the bride away.

159
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
There are officials and servants

160
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
from Huang's Residence searching everywhere.

161
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,580
It's hard not to hear about it.

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,960
She eloped with a bearer.

163
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,190
The neighbors

164
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,000
will have much to gossip about.

165
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:41,920
Indeed!

166
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,380
County Commandant Huang has been famous...

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Who did this?

168
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:47,750
Who?

169
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,300
My Lord.

170
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,720
Keep it quiet.

171
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,850
Greetings, My Lord.

172
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,450
I've sent all our men

173
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,240
to go all out.

174
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,870
I believe

175
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,870
we'll catch those scoundrels soon.

176
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,600
The scoundrels can wait.

177
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,160
The first priority now

178
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,310
is to rescue my wife.

179
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,750
When it's done,

180
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,350
hope you'll keep your word, My Lord,

181
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,320
and be lenient

182
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,180
with our men in jail.

183
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,950
Sure, sure.

184
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,000
Murderers must pay with their lives,

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,510
but I'll go easy with the rest.

186
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,190
It's a deal.

187
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,690
Spread the word.

188
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,070
Whoever rescues her

189
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,870
will receive an extra generous reward from me.

190
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,600
Understood.

191
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,040
Alright, alright.

192
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,370
-Please await good news, My Lord.
-Go, go.

193
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,340
Come on, hurry!

194
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,780
Over there!

195
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,490
Okay.

196
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,210
-You go that way.
-Yes, sir!

197
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,620
-And you go that way!
-Yes!

198
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,750
My hands hurt.

199
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,590
What's wrong with your hands?

200
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,350
I've been tied up for so long.

201
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,669
My hands now feel

202
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,790
completely numb.

203
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,620
I can't even move them.

204
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,210
How about this?

205
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,160
Can you kindly

206
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,270
loosen the ropes a bit?

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
Do you think

208
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,440
I can trust you?

209
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,360
Fine, fine.

210
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,350
Then can you at least change my posture?

211
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,320
Like, tie my hands in the front?

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,850
That should be okay, right?

213
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,720
Bro,

214
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm the lady from a martial arts school.

215
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,080
You really are...

216
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,790
What?

217
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,710
You let your guard down.

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,030
Besides,

219
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,670
didn't you say you liked me?

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,670
You don't even know I can do martial arts,

221
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,950
yet you claim to like me?

222
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,760
Nonsense!

223
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,150
Stop!

224
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,510
I...

225
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,970
Are you crazy?

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Big Brother, I...

227
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you nuts too?

228
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,480
I...

229
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,210
Are you okay?

230
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,870
J-Just one hit,

231
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,960
and you're bleeding?

232
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,810
Behave yourself!

233
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,140
Don't bother saving me.

234
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,970
What are you doing?

235
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,350
My bros!

236
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:09,910
I...

237
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,290
Big Brother.

238
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:14,940
It's her,

239
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,890
Miss He.

240
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,200
It's her.

241
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,870
My Lady, please don't be nervous.

242
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,550
County Commandant Huang

243
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,610
sent us to find you.

244
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,750
I've already let someone go inform him.

245
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,480
Soon enough,

246
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,150
Lord Huang will

247
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,430
come to take you back in person.

248
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,690
No need to wait for him.

249
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,620
I'll go back now.

250
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,480
No, you can't!

251
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,230
She's not going anywhere

252
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,000
unless

253
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,010
you knock me out.

254
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,720
Who do you think you are?

255
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,270
I don't even need to ask.

256
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,870
You must be the one who took the bride away, huh?

257
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,080
You must

258
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
be crazy.

259
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,550
How dare you try to snatch a woman

260
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,390
from Commandant Huang?

261
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,250
You're insulting my Big Brother?

262
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,130
I'll fight you to the death!

263
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,810
Beat him up!

264
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,980
Hit him!

265
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,930
Big Brother!

266
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,180
Stop fighting!

267
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,200
I'll go with you.

268
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,680
You little hooligan,

269
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,440
you've got some nerve!

270
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,720
Unless you beat me to death today,

271
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,240
don't even

272
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,990
think about taking her away!

273
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,060
Are you stupid or what?

274
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,660
What if they really kill you?

275
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,670
Good.

276
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,730
I'm impressed by your guts.

277
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,140
I'll grant your wish then.

278
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,510
What are you waiting for?

279
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,150
Hurry and run!

280
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,610
Come on!

281
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,630
Hurry up!

282
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,840
My Lord.

283
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,490
Bad news.

284
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,550
Miss He and the bearer

285
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,440
have run to the west.

286
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:11,870
What?

287
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,300
My Lord,

288
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,920
I just heard about it.

289
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,230
The people there claimed

290
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,760
to see Miss He and the bearer

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,460
running towards the west.

292
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Man, you've got

293
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,030
neither strength

294
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,890
to do anything,

295
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,440
nor power or status,

296
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,000
and you're even taking care of three dumb brothers.

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,390
Why on earth did you take me away from the wedding?

298
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,270
I know I'm quite irresistible,

299
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,760
but as a healthy man,

300
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,200
you will find someone to marry.

301
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Why do you have to

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,030
stick to me?

303
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,320
If I hadn't saved you just now,

304
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,580
you'd be dead already.

305
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
See the blood on this handkerchief?

306
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes.

307
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,010
What color is it?

308
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,790
Red.

309
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,200
Then, what color

310
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,380
was the blood of the people

311
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,040
who were fighting us just now?

312
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,480
Are you messing with me?

313
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,320
I'm asking you what color it was.

314
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,920
It must all be red, of course.

315
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,600
Can't you tell the difference?

316
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,570
Then why did you help me?

317
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,150
I have no idea

318
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,240
why I helped you!

319
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,630
Maybe just like you,

320
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,290
my brain's not working right.

321
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,390
When those people go back to report,

322
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,030
and my father finds out,

323
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,030
he'll definitely teach me a lesson.

324
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,610
And you're still laughing?

325
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,720
Don't be afraid.

326
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,630
Everything will be fine

327
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,090
when you wake up tomorrow.

328
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,490
I don't understand what you mean.

329
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
Anyway, I'm already engaged.

330
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,270
No matter how much you love me,

331
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,670
I just won't fall for you!

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,060
I'm going home now.

333
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,310
Huang?

334
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,030
So the rumor is true.

335
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,850
You really have an affair with someone.

336
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,210
How could you do this to me?

337
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,720
I'm going to kill him right now!

338
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,090
Why are you helping him?

339
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,370
Wait, no.

340
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,290
Let me explain.

341
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,270
Enough!

342
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,910
He Quelian.

343
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
We grew up together

344
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,960
as childhood sweethearts.

345
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,050
I gave you

346
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,950
my whole heart

347
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,930
long ago.

348
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,780
How could you do this to me?

349
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,240
You...

350
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,750
You...

351
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,320
You heartless woman!

352
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,270
I'm going to

353
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,360
kill you right now!

354
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,480
You fell on your own, okay?

355
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,100
Let's go, let's go.

356
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,080
Is my face messed up?

357
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,720
They're over there! Get them!

358
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,310
Search carefully.

359
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,970
Stop there!

360
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,270
I'm over here.

361
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,710
Go after them!

362
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,150
We're safe now. We're safe.

363
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,910
Let's get out of here.

364
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,910
Oh, no.

365
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,080
Now there's no way

366
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,790
to clear my name.

367
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,510
Then don't try to clear it.

368
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,240
Let's go now.

369
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,000
What do you mean by "let's go"?

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,240
Hey, you...

371
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,320
Do you understand social etiquette at all?

372
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,480
I've brought disgrace

373
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
to my family now.

374
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,670
Your romantic escapades

375
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,800
can't overcome everything, can they?

376
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,750
Besides, I don't even love you.

377
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,550
I just knew you not long ago!

378
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,600
You took a brick attack for me,

379
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,750
I'm touched.

380
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,670
But today is

381
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,670
my wedding day.

382
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,120
If you really like me,

383
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,180
you shouldn't have hurt me like this.

384
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,470
Are you angry?

385
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,190
Isn't it obvious?

386
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,300
You like Youhuang?

387
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,000
Who is Youhuang?

388
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,410
The man who just got injured.

389
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,000
That's my husband!

390
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,400
So you like him?

391
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,370
I don't even want to explain to you.

392
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,400
If I say I'll go back with you

393
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,800
and explain everything,

394
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,910
will you feel any better?

395
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
But I have one condition.

396
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,680
Spend the rest of the day with me.

397
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,480
What kind of condition is that?

398
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,800
It's simple.

399
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Just stay with me.

400
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,550
I'll take you back

401
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,480
right at 9 PM

402
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,680
and explain everything

403
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,000
in detail.

404
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,860
I'll be at your mercy then.

405
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:58,920
You...

406
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,750
Spend a day with you?

407
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,920
Well then,

408
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,920
what would we do?

409
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,920
Don't worry.

410
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,610
I won't force you

411
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,500
to do anything against your will.

412
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,750
Just hang around

413
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,750
with me casually.

414
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,110
Are you serious?

415
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,800
I am serious.

416
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,270
You do realize that

417
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,120
if you go back with me,

418
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,150
you'll be jailed and beaten, right?

419
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,590
Moreover,

420
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,750
Huang

421
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,730
works in the government office.

422
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,310
You brought him

423
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,570
great shame this time.

424
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,310
Once you enter there,

425
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,310
your fate will be no longer yours to decide.

426
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,240
I know.

427
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,830
A gentleman

428
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,360
never goes back on his word.

429
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,030
Wait,

430
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,640
what's the point

431
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,370
of all this mess you're making?

432
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,930
As I've told you,

433
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,550
I just want you to spend a day with me.

434
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,120
You're sacrificing so much

435
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,200
just to have me with you for a day?

436
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,970
You can understand it this way.

437
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
You're so in love with me.

438
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,310
Deal!

439
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,410
I'll stay with you!

440
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,340
You have my word!

441
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,100
Let's hang out!

442
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Then come with me.

443
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,730
Alright.

444
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,640
Bye, and hope to see you again,

445
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,440
sir and madam.

446
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,690
Let's go.

447
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,570
Enjoy your meal.

448
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,910
Sir and Madam,

449
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,950
this way, please.

450
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,000
Come on, let me fill it up for you.

451
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,790
Come on.

452
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,620
What would you two like to eat?

453
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,400
Anything is fine.

454
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,450
Any interesting news lately?

455
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,200
Tell us about it.

456
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,440
Haven't you heard about

457
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,000
the big incident that happened today?

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,860
What happened?

459
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,550
The county commandant's bride

460
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,830
was taken away by a bearer.

461
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,510
Really?

462
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,800
Tell us more.

463
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,080
You two didn't see it.

464
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,070
That bearer

465
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,730
ran off carrying the bride.

466
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,110
This sounds

467
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,100
much more interesting than

468
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,310
the Six Wonders of Guangping.

469
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,070
Right?

470
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,920
That's fun.

471
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,350
Six Wonders of Guangping?

472
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,320
Look up.

473
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,210
Open your eyes.

474
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,510
The Six Wonders of Guangping are magnificent.

475
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,390
The grand mountains,

476
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,550
the gorgeous blossoms.

477
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,160
The century-old pride and grace peak at the present.

478
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,240
Who unlucky.

479
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
Crossing paths with a funeral procession

480
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,110
on his wedding day.

481
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,310
It is unusual.

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,240
Maybe it'll become an anecdote

483
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,300
as famous as the Six Wonders of Guangping in the future.

484
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,110
Who are you calling a pervert?

485
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,590
What's wrong with you?

486
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,790
What's your problem?

487
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,850
Sorry, sorry.

488
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
I'm sorry.

489
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,400
Easy, easy.

490
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,590
What is wrong with her?

491
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,200
Calm down.

492
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,130
Sit down now.

493
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm sorry.

494
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,050
It's all your fault.

495
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,130
Yeah, it's my fault.

496
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,880
Enjoy your meal, please.

497
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,740
Where are we going after the meal?

498
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,760
Do you know about the Six Wonders of Guangping?

499
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,210
Yes, I do.

500
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,480
What are they?

501
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,640
The Panorama from atop Shinan Tower,

502
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,850
the Spring Scenery at Tang Garden,

503
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,680
the Sogdian Whirl Dance with Aroma,

504
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,030
the Fair at Flower Festival,

505
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,640
the Night Banquet at South Lake,

506
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,570
and the Ancient Matchmaking Tree.

507
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
How do you know all these?

508
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,640
They're well-known to all.

509
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,070
Everyone in Guangping knows them,

510
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,870
yet you don't?

511
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,160
What's the Night Banquet at South Lake?

512
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,700
A banquet hosted by Lord Xin'an for those scholars

513
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,290
from humble backgrounds.

514
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,000
When is it?

515
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,790
It's being held tonight.

516
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,640
How did you know what's going to

517
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,570
happen tonight?

518
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,370
Or you knew it when you were little?

519
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,790
I...

520
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,000
Time is ticking.

521
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,750
Eat up now.

522
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,970
I still can't figure out

523
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,890
why I knew that the Night Banquet

524
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,750
at South Lake would happen today.

525
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,920
Tell me

526
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,480
what day it is today.

527
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Today is an auspicious day.

528
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,920
Yes,

529
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,110
today is your wedding day.

530
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,130
Of course it's an auspicious day.

531
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,980
But you don't remember

532
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,310
the exact date today.

533
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,590
No need to rack your brain.

534
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,120
You can't recall it anyway.

535
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,570
Because this place

536
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,590
doesn't have specific dates at all.

537
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,850
The Six Wonders of Guangping are famous,

538
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,810
but actually,

539
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,160
they didn't even exist

540
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,120
in the same era.

541
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,110
The Night Banquet at South Lake

542
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,660
was in the 2nd year of Tianxiang Era.

543
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,160
And Shen Yingniang of the Sogdian Whirl Dance with Aroma

544
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,020
was from over a hundred years ago.

545
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,510
And that Shinan Tower

546
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,810
was destroyed in a wildfire long ago.

547
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,360
I don't understand what you're saying.

548
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,440
In short,

549
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,680
my Guangping and your Guangping

550
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,060
are different.

551
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,240
Alright,

552
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,370
let's go take a look.

553
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,240
We might get an answer there.

554
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,400
Didn't you say this place

555
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
was destroyed in a wildfire?

556
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Where's the fire?

557
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,850
Why do you have to

558
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,710
come up here?

559
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,460
The air up here is quite refreshing.

560
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,270
And the scenery is amazing too.

561
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,640
Why don't you recite a poem?

562
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,720
Other men

563
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,920
usually recite a poem

564
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,170
at moments like this

565
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,330
to show off their talents, don't they?

566
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,960
Hey, wait.

567
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,440
Where is he going again?

568
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,680
Are you alright?

569
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,770
I'm fine.

570
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,800
It's okay.

571
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,670
Come on.

572
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,760
What was wrong with you just now?

573
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
What do you mean?

574
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,440
You think I didn't see it?

575
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,900
Did you do that on purpose?

576
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,310
No, that was an accident.

577
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,150
Are you lying to me again?

578
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,310
And what did you come

579
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,980
here for again?

580
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,600
[Tang Garden]

581
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,200
Among the Six Wonders of Guangping,

582
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
didn't we already visit

583
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,500
the Panorama from atop Shinan Tower?

584
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,430
This Spring Scenery at Tang Garden is the second spot.

585
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,080
They say

586
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,420
the Second Young Master of the Tang family

587
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,750
is a flower enthusiast,

588
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,350
especially fond of peonies.

589
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,590
The peonies inside abound in varieties,

590
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,430
and they are of excellent quality

591
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,690
and rosy glow.

592
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,930
What? Do you want to go in here too?

593
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,620
No, I guess.

594
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,100
Young Master Tang,

595
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,030
he's right here.

596
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,640
Did

597
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,790
you two claim to have a

598
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,790
premium Zilonghuai to sell to me?

599
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,980
No.

600
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,320
Man...

601
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,460
You clearly said that

602
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,790
you had a flower to sell.

603
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:08,640
You two,

604
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,850
are you making fun of me?

605
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,680
Yes, we are.

606
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:15,880
Pardon?

607
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,570
Young Master!

608
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,160
Young Master!

609
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,550
-Are you alright?
-Blood!

610
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,590
How dare you hit me?

611
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,070
You...

612
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,240
Guards!

613
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,030
Run, run, run!

614
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,720
Anybody?

615
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,720
Go call for help!

616
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,850
Guards! Guards! Guards!

617
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,850
Catch them and bring them back to me!

618
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,550
They're up ahead! Get them!

619
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes!

620
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,440
What's wrong?

621
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,790
You're asking me that?

622
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,900
I should be asking you!

623
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,430
What on earth are you doing?

624
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,830
No matter what crazy things you're up to,

625
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,790
I'm done playing along.

626
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,650
I'm going home.

627
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,240
I suddenly find the land

628
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,110
in front of your house

629
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,750
a good spot with brilliant feng shui.

630
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,550
If I

631
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,580
smash my head and die there,

632
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,240
my ghost can often see you come and go.

633
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,960
That would be

634
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,560
fulfilling one of my wishes.

635
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,120
Are you threatening me?

636
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,750
Didn't you promise

637
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,250
to keep me company for a day?

638
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,910
You can't go back on your word.

639
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,160
But I agreed to hang around with you,

640
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,540
not to bully others

641
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,590
with you.

642
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,830
Then I promise you

643
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,930
I won't act recklessly again.

644
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,450
Neither will I hit anyone.

645
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,030
I-I had no choice.

646
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,720
If I

647
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,030
go back with you today,

648
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,640
I might very well

649
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,680
end up in jail.

650
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,640
Those two people held a grudge against me.

651
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,510
If I didn't take this chance

652
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,640
to settle the score,

653
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm afraid I wouldn't rest in peace even after death.

654
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,510
Death? What are you talking about?

655
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,110
For this little trouble you've caused,

656
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,580
at most you'll get a few lashes

657
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,640
and be jailed for a few days.

658
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,040
Then you'll be released.

659
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,000
But

660
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,960
you pushed someone

661
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,880
and punched someone,

662
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,080
what grudge was that?

663
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,880
It's getting late.

664
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,590
Let's continue to walk around.

665
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,820
Didn't you promise

666
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,680
to spend the day with me?

667
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Stop!

668
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,400
I-I didn't!

669
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,970
I'll take you somewhere.

670
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't want to go with you anymore.

671
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,030
Sir and Madam,

672
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,160
your dishes are all served.

673
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,960
Please enjoy.

674
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,750
Using the money from selling my jewelry

675
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,070
to come and watch dancers,

676
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,400
how generous you are.

677
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,320
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

678
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,450
You pay me back? How?

679
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,270
Bravo!

680
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,510
Bravo!

681
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,590
I have a name!

682
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,280
I'm Xuanye.

683
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,960
I don't care about your name!

684
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,510
Don't you think

685
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,910
you've gone a bit too far?

686
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,350
One minute you're confessing

687
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,030
to me.

688
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,070
Even if you'll end up in jail,

689
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,470
you still want me with you today.

690
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,200
The next minute, you're here

691
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,920
worshiping other women,

692
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,110
unable to tear your eyes away.

693
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,370
What do you take me for?

694
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,880
Wait...

695
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,400
Who is this jealous woman?

696
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,190
Jealous woman!

697
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,270
Who are you calling that?

698
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,070
Who gave you the right to butt in?

699
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,470
Sir,

700
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,480
why didn't you

701
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,480
teach your wife some manners?

702
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,150
Yeah!

703
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,160
You really should discipline her!

704
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,200
Who's his wife?

705
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,070
Keep talking nonsense

706
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,730
and I'll knock your teeth out!

707
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,910
Who are you talking to?

708
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,970
I'm talking to you!

709
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,800
So stubborn.

710
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,750
Let's go.

711
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,100
Go.

712
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
Come and fight me!

713
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,180
Come on, let's go.

714
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,580
Let's continue to drink.

715
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,160
What are you laughing at?

716
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,790
Nothing.

717
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,620
Alright,

718
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,730
don't be mad.

719
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,550
I came here

720
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,960
not for the dancers.

721
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,920
I have my own reason

722
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,830
for being here.

723
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,110
What reason?

724
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,000
You won't buy it even if I tell you.

725
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,720
Anyway,

726
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,750
we only have this one day

727
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,720
to be together.

728
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,630
Please bear with it a little.

729
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,440
After tonight,

730
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,920
everything will be back to how it used to be,

731
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,120
and you'll completely forget about me.

732
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,880
Given your impressive capacity,

733
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,680
how could I possibly forget you?

734
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,160
Bravo!

735
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,160
Y-You enjoy the meal first.

736
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,620
I need to use the restroom.

737
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
You haven't eaten anything!

738
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,180
Why do you need to use that?

739
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,790
Miss Shen?

740
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,000
Miss Shen.

741
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,160
Miss Shen,

742
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,070
your dance today was stunning.

743
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,480
Sir, you're not supposed to be here.

744
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,030
Please get out.

745
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,680
Miss Shen,

746
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,930
I, Sun, have been admiring you since long ago.

747
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,770
Have a drink with me.

748
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:22,880
Let go!

749
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,130
Just drink with me!

750
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,420
Why are you still here?

751
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,640
Your friends have all left.

752
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,020
It's you again? I...

753
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,350
It's me, so what?

754
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:32,830
I...

755
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,350
Miss Shen,

756
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,940
you should be careful.

757
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,350
If you flirt with him,

758
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,110
his ferocious wife

759
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,640
might scratch your face!

760
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,830
Thank you for helping me, sir.

761
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,760
Are you alright?

762
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,690
Are you okay?

763
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,050
Banxia.

764
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,010
Banxia!

765
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,250
Banxia.

766
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,590
Banxia.

767
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,830
Who is Banxia?

768
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,440
Fine, fine.

769
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,550
He Quelian,

770
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,520
Miss He,

771
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
listen to me.

772
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,890
Are you alright?

773
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,040
Did you get hurt?

774
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,960
Did you enjoy our shadow puppetry?

775
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,110
Yes! It was amazing!

776
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,160
It was nice!

777
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,530
Are you still mad at me?

778
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,550
It really wasn't

779
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,750
what you saw.

780
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,020
But I know you won't

781
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,420
believe my explanation.

782
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,030
You said you'd go back

783
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,200
with me to explain everything.

784
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,460
Does that still count?

785
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,830
Of course it does.

786
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,550
I won't help you

787
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,720
or speak up for you.

788
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,030
I know.

789
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,590
You'll definitely be harshly punished

790
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,400
and caned.

791
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,440
You might even

792
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,440
be put in jail.

793
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,550
I know.

794
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,880
Are you out of your mind?

795
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,210
Do you know that after today,

796
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,440
I will get married!

797
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,400
Even if Huang

798
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,680
resents me because of this

799
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,800
and refuses to marry me,

800
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,440
my father will still

801
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,040
marry me off to someone else.

802
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,730
Who will he marry you off to?

803
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,800
T-There are plenty of choices!

804
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,300
It could be the son of a rich merchant,

805
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,070
a senior disciple from our martial arts school,

806
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,830
or those

807
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,750
scholars with bright futures.

808
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,410
But it definitely won't be...

809
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,590
It won't be a bearer.

810
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,200
It won't be me.

811
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,280
That's right.

812
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,440
In no case will my father

813
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,240
consider you good enough for me.

814
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,210
He definitely won't let me marry you.

815
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,940
You should give up on that idea.

816
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,250
Alright.

817
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,480
Sir, are these pears sweet?

818
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,540
Sure! They're sweet, crisp, and red.

819
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,790
Shall we buy some?

820
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,400
Stop there!

821
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
I've changed my mind.

822
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,440
I don't need you to go back with me anymore.

823
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,720
You

824
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,650
have neither martial arts skills

825
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,750
nor a prominent family background.

826
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,110
Being snatched away by someone like you

827
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,200
is a disgrace to me!

828
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,550
Get out of Guangping right now.

829
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,070
Don't show up

830
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,470
in front of me ever again!

831
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,170
You can go wherever you want,

832
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,130
find a suitable person,

833
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,070
and marry her.

834
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,920
Don't aim too high again.

835
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,400
No more flights of fancy.

836
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,960
Don't do

837
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
anything that leads nowhere,

838
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,640
confusing

839
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
or troubling others.

840
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,440
Do you hear me?

841
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,030
Then what do you call something that leads somewhere?

842
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,060
Love involves two people.

843
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,150
You like her,

844
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,510
and she can respond to your feelings.

845
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,770
That's something that leads somewhere.

846
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
When the sun rises tomorrow,

847
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,889
you'll forget me again, won't you?

848
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,280
Who could forget someone

849
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,540
as annoying as you?

850
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,739
You don't understand.

851
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,889
Everything here

852
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,440
is like a dream.

853
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,080
None will remain when it's over.

854
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,670
If I tell you

855
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,570
we've known each other for a long time,

856
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,239
will you believe me?

857
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,000
But I don't remember you.

858
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,000
You don't need to remember.

859
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,750
So long as I remember.

860
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,210
♫Melody echoes along the river; wild geese soar in sudden fright♫

861
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,370
♫The music ends, and I stand in solitude♫

862
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,240
♫I see you turn into a handful of starlight♫

863
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,840
Actually,

864
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,550
♫Drifting past me♫

865
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,540
I do really like you.

866
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,800
♫In tears, the past memories still glow♫

867
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,400
But I don't know

868
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,590
when it started.

869
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,300
♫Crystallized into cold amber♫

870
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,670
Perhaps

871
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,840
my love began a long time ago.

872
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,050
♫I know it also brought you great pain to let go♫

873
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,840
I didn't respond to you

874
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,450
♫But why did you♫

875
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,480
because I saw no possibility

876
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,050
♫Still endure the pain and shatter♫

877
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,140
between us.

878
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I'm a demon hunter who makes a living

879
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,880
♫Remember me, don't miss me♫

880
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,230
in a world of bloodshed and violence.

881
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,070
But you're different.

882
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,660
♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

883
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,060
You have your originally peaceful life,

884
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,110
parents who love you,

885
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,880
♫I hate that I failed♫

886
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:59,230
♫To catch the glistening starlight♫

887
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,680
and a perfect match for you.

888
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,890
Because of demons,

889
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,070
your life

890
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,800
♫We were meant to miss each other in this life♫

891
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,280
deviated a bit.

892
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,010
So you accidentally

893
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,440
crossed paths with me.

894
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,690
♫Only after missing did we learn how much love could hurt♫

895
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,510
And I

896
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,460
should help you correct these deviations

897
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,640
♫To have loved you is to have truly lived♫

898
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,710
and send you back

899
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,710
to the path you're supposed to take.

900
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,440
So honestly,

901
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,930
I'm not supposed to fall in love with you.

902
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,820
What are you talking about?

903
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,640
I don't understand.

904
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,860
It doesn't matter.

905
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,160
Even if you understood,

906
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,720
you would forget about it tomorrow anyway.

907
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,450
♫Remember me, don't miss me♫

908
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,550
♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

What a beautiful evening,

914
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,730
but it's a pity there's no moon.

915
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:04,260
♫To have loved you is to have truly lived♫

916
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,540

917
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,530
Big Brother,

918
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,460
are you hurt?

919
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
What are you waiting for?

920
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,120
Help Big Brother up.

921
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,590
It's okay.

922
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,390
I'm your Big Brother.

923
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,680
Will you listen to me?

924
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,510
Yes.

925
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,230
We will.

926
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,710
Congratulations, My Lord!

927
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,440
Thank you, thank you all.

928
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,510
Congratulations.

929
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,960
Thank you, thank you.

930
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,800
Congratulations!

931
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,510
Thank you.

932
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,110
Thank you, guys.

933
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,330
Come and join the feast.

934
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,910
Thank you, thank you.

935
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,730
Big Brother,

936
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,320
this is my first time snatching a bride.

937
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm kind of nervous.

938
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,530
We used to escort brides.

939
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,960
Today we're snatching one.

940
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,620
We've never done this before.

941
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,570
I-It's also my first time.

942
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,260
I-I'm quite nervous as well.

943
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,440
Don't panic.

944
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,850
Just follow my instructions.

945
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,480
Okay.

946
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:02,510
Got it.

947
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,960
Congratulations.

948
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,590
Congratulations.

949
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,110
Congratulations.

950
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,840
Congratulations, Lord Huang.

951
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,710
Congratulations, Lord Huang.

952
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,770
Congratulations.

953
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,940
Congratulations.

954
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,400
Xuanye!

955
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,190
Xuanye!

956
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,030
Ermao, Ermao.

957
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,130
I need to answer the call of nature.

958
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,260
Hang in there, okay?

959
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,800
Big Brother, Big Brother!

960
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,070
I...

961
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,960
Big Brother!

962
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,110
Banxia.

963
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,280
Banxia.

964
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,590
I'm here.

965
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,190
You remember now?

966
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,000
Come with me.

967
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,090
How did you regain your memory?

968
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,320
I'm not sure either.

969
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,710
I just recalled everything when I woke up today.

970
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,960
How did you find me?

971
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,550
I followed the clues you left behind

972
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,580
and tracked you to the Enlightenment Bookstore.

973
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,670
That bookstore owner

974
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,870
is indeed something.

975
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,510
When I was fighting him,

976
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,280
I accidentally fell into

977
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,710
"A Spring Day in Guangping."

978
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,590
After that,

979
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,480
I saw

980
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,810
you and Youhuang, both without memories.

981
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,710
It's not just us.

982
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,110
There must be many more

983
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,970
people trapped in this painting.

984
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,190
Perhaps

985
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,420
your parents

986
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,560
are also stuck in this painting.

987
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
You have a lead?

988
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,840
In "A Spring Day in Guangping",

989
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,800
there are six famous Guangping spots depicted,

990
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,630
known as the Six Wonders of Guangping.

991
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:29,960
Yesterday,

992
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,820
we already visited three of them.

993
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,500
As for the keeper of the Shinan Tower,

994
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,510
the owner of Tang Garden,

995
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,590
and the Sogdian Whirl dancer,

996
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,790
I've tested them all.

997
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,960
Just like us, they're

998
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,020
all humans who entered the painting.

999
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,410
But

1000
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,060
how can you tell who's from the real world

1001
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,660
and who's from the painting?

1002
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,510
Look.

1003
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,000
That's ink?

1004
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,780
The blood of those from the real world

1005
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,800
is all red,

1006
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,440
but when the others are injured,

1007
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,110
the blood they shed,

1008
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:01,710
just like these

1009
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,860
completely destroyed things,

1010
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,120
will all turn into ink.

1011
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,840
But Guangping City is so huge,

1012
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,240
inhabited by thousands of people.

1013
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,930
We can't possibly test them one by one, can we?

1014
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,760
The painter

1015
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,510
doesn't randomly capture anyone in sight

1016
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,310
but seeks

1017
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,670
those who match the Six Wonders

1018
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,400
and traps them in the painting.

1019
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:22,920
So, does that mean

1020
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,280
if we visit all the Six Wonders,

1021
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,540
we might have a chance to find my parents?

1022
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,640
This dress is such a hassle.

1023
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,760
We need to find a place

1024
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,020
and let me get changed.

1025
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,550
Well, well.

1026
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,880
There you are, as expected!

1027
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Let her go now!

1028
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,230
Calm down.

1029
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,320
Don't hurt him.

1030
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,290
He Quelian,

1031
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,120
I can't believe you're protecting him.

1032
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,770
Why are you helping him?

1033
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,270
Tell me why!

1034
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,730
What exactly is your relationship?

1035
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,040
Wit, Youhuang,

1036
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,290
let me explain.

1037
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,240
This is a rather complicated case.

1038
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,230
Well, let's sit down

1039
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,280
and talk it over.

1040
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,150
He Quelian,

1041
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,630
you even ran away from your wedding for him.

1042
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,430
What else is there to talk about?

1043
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,880
I'll kill him right now.

1044
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,400
Big Brother,

1045
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,440
are you... Are you alright?

1046
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:52,840
Why is

1047
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,590
Youhuang also in the painting?

1048
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,840
Maybe

1049
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,230
he came to investigate a case

1050
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,890
and ended up here by accident.

1051
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,510
Is it possible that he's also

1052
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,040
a figure from the painting?

1053
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,440
We could prick him with a needle

1054
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,110
to find out.

1055
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,710
You...

1056
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,840
He Quelian.

1057
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,790
As childhood sweethearts,

1058
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,370
we've known each other for over a decade.

1059
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,140
Now for a useless pretty boy,

1060
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,960
you actually want to hurt me?

1061
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,880
What's your conscience?

1062
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,030
I really misjudged you!

1063
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,050
Useless pretty boy?

1064
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,800
No need to test.

1065
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,360
Being this stubborn,

1066
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,490
he must be Youhuang.

1067
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,260
Well,

1068
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,840
look at him now.

1069
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,250
Is there any way

1070
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,160
to wake him up?

1071
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,400
I've tried almost everything I could think of

1072
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,060
but failed.

1073
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,510
Then what now?

1074
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,370
Just leave him here like this?

1075
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,950
I have an idea.

1076
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,070
Let's knock him out.

1077
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,710
That way, he won't sabotage

1078
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,840
our plans, right?

1079
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,430
You're going too far!

1080
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,130
You're discussing

1081
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,690
so loudly and aboveboard

1082
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,090
how to do bad things to me?

1083
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,370
I-If I break free,

1084
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,860
I certainly won't let you off.

1085
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,070
Down on my luck, and everyone can mess with me...

1086
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,420
How about

1087
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,480
we reason with him

1088
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,830
properly?

1089
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,560
Reason with him?

1090
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,970
Well, you give it a try.

1091
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,390
Listen.

1092
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,680
You

1093
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,110
are not the Young Master of Huang Residence.

1094
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,360
Your name is Chu Youhuang.

1095
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,090
You're one of our friends.

1096
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,600
So what we need to do now

1097
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,890
is to escape from the painting together.

1098
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,980
Do you understand?

1099
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,360
That's all?

1100
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,630
If you want to kill

1101
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,230
or torture me, just do it now.

1102
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,860
Since you dared to have an affair with him,

1103
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,400
bringing disgrace to my family,

1104
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,030
why did you make up

1105
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,510
such a story to deceive me?

1106
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,910
A fickle woman

1107
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,420
and a despicable man,

1108
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,200
you two are a perfect match!

1109
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,980
You disgusting couple!

1110
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,060
How shameless!

1111
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,900
You vicious bitch!

1112
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,690
You'll get what you deserve!

1113
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,000
You're right.

1114
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,760
We should just

1115
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,000
leave this stubborn fool here.
