00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,920
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,610
His temperament has always been like this.

4
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,870
Don't take it to heart.

5
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,039
No wonder he

6
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,900
kept harping on your case before.

7
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,920
Now that I've seen him in person,

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,180
he's really stubborn.

9
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,039
Big Brother.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Big Brother.

11
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,490
Sister-in-law.

12
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,640
Sister-in-law, you're so pretty.

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,750
Big Brother, you indeed have g-great taste.

14
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,910
I'm going out for a while.

15
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,680
Keep an eye on that young master

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,410
from Huang Residence inside.

17
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,120
Don't let him get away.

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
Big Brother, rest...

19
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,400
Shut up.

20
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,280
Rest assured, Big Brother.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,810
Let's go.

22
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,170
Where are we going now?

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,520
Among the Six Wonders of Guangping,

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,480
there are three places left for us to visit.

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,960
The Ancient Matchmaking Tree is the nearest.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Let's go there first.

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,710
Okay.

28
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,750
This is it.

29
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,430
So this is the Matchmaking Tree.

30
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,750
Looking at it like this,

31
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,410
it doesn't seem that special.

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,190
In this world,

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,630
most of the famous landmarks

34
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,120
aren't particularly

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,320
special themselves.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
What truly makes them famous

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,510
are the stories behind them.

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,790
It's said that during a military rebellion in the previous dynasty,

39
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,750
the Emperor's most beloved Noble Consort

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,960
escaped from the palace

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,760
and came here.

42
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,590
On the way, she encountered villains

43
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,850
with evil intentions.

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,960
The Noble Consort, who was loyal and unyielding, refused to submit

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,020
and took her own life under this tree.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,710
To commemorate the Noble Consort,

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,800
the Emperor ordered

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,030
a tree to be planted here,

49
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,800
embracing this tree

50
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,540
and intertwining with it.

51
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,010
The two trees embrace,

52
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,490
with their roots intertwined

53
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,030
and their branches and leaves intermingled.

54
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,360
The commoners believed

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,150
that it was the love between

56
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,680
the Emperor and the Noble Consort

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,010
that moved the heavens,

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,370
so they named it the Matchmaking Tree,

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,530
holding it in great reverence.

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,410
I didn't expect that

61
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,680
a place where people come to pray for a good marriage

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,590
would have such

63
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,000
a sad story behind it.

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,750
This Noble Consort

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,760
was truly loyal and unyielding.

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
You admire her?

67
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,840
Don't you?

68
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,240
I don't know.

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,240
I only know that

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
life is extremely precious.

71
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,750
No matter what happens,

72
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,090
and no matter what problems you encounter,

73
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,630
you should never easily give up

74
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,430
your life.

75
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,920
Why are you so familiar

76
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,070
with this place?

77
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,560
This painting is of Guangping.

78
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,070
I grew up here since childhood,

79
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,930
so of course I'm familiar with it.

80
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,890
So, have you been here with someone else?

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
I mean, have you ever come here

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,890
with someone else to pray for a good marriage?

83
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,190
No, I haven't.

84
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,800
That's good.

85
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,510
What are these?

86
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,830
These are wishing plaques,

87
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,159
used for making wishes.

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you want to make a wish?

89
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,500
This whole world is fake.

90
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,680
Can wishes made here come true?

91
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,130
It doesn't hurt to try.

92
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,250
Here.

93
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,020
[Safe]

94
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,440
What should I do, Xuanye?

95
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,890
I knocked down

96
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
someone else's wish.

97
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,360
How am I supposed to

98
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,410
[Stay true to your heart, and things will work out eventually.
Duan Yingheng]

99
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
hang it back up?

100
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,510
Where should I hang it?

101
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,120
Banxia.

102
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,350
Duan Yingheng?

103
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,690
This is indeed my father's handwriting.

104
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,870
It means he's also in this painting.

105
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
And look, Xuanye,

106
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,830
he remembers his name is Duan Yingheng.

107
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,240
Doesn't that mean

108
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,040
he's trapped in this painting

109
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,160
just like us?

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,659
He must be here somewhere, right?

111
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,510
We're finally about to find him.

112
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,680
Esteemed patrons,

113
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,880
are you here to pray for a good marriage?

114
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,159
Young Taoist.

115
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,630
Have you ever seen this person?

116
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,090
His name is Duan Yingheng.

117
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,830
Duan Yingheng?

118
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,400
I've never seen him.

119
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,190
Right.

120
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,850
There are so many people coming and going.

121
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,250
How could you possibly remember everyone?

122
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
Young Taoist,

123
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,850
which temple are you from?

124
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,250
I? I'm from the Sanqing Temple on Mount Yu.

125
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,660
Or maybe I'm from the Bodhi Temple.

126
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
The Bodhi Temple?

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,120
If it's the Sanqing Temple, it's the Sanqing Temple.

128
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,890
How could you be from the Bodhi Temple as well?

129
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,480
Because I had a dream today.

130
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,720
In that dream, I was a young disciple

131
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,290
of Master Bodhi at the Bodhi Temple

132
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,140
on Mount Bodhi.

133
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,270
That day, my master, Master Bodhi,

134
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,750
set off for Mount Fangyan

135
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,830
to attend the 90th birthday celebration

136
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,270
of the head master of the Fangyan Sect.

137
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,480
But after he left,

138
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,010
he didn't return for a year.

139
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,130
I missed my master,

140
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,400
so I went down the mountain to look for him.

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,159
But as soon as I got to Guangping,

142
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,240
I ran out of money.

143
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,800
So I had to enter the city to earn some travel money

144
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
by fortune-telling.

145
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,880
But it's just a dream.

146
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,120
It's a dream, yet not a dream.

147
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,090
This is like Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly.

148
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,070
If this really is a dream,

149
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,130
do you hope to be

150
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,830
a young Taoist from the Sanqing Temple

151
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,830
or a disciple from the Bodhi Temple?

152
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,020
It doesn't matter.

153
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,270
I just hope to discard the false and keep the true,

154
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,720
to eliminate the illusory and preserve the real.

155
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,070
Since it's a dream,

156
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,210
how can you distinguish

157
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,270
between truth and falsehood, reality and illusion?

158
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,710
Where this heart finds peace, there lies the truth.

159
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,270
Young Taoist, your words are full of Zen wisdom.

160
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,070
I'm inspired.

161
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,890
You're too kind.

162
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,789
If you don't mind,

163
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,990
could you help this humble Taoist with the first deal of this day?

164
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,720
Is this enough?

165
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,590
Kind lady.

166
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,390
This bracelet

167
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,670
is worth 100 times of fortune telling from me.

168
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,330
The matter I want you to divine

169
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,730
is worth this price.

170
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,960
May I ask what kind of fortune you seek to be told, kind lady?

171
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,220
Family relationship.

172
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,080
Could you please explain the divination to me?

173
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,120
The time of adversity is ending, and good fortune is coming.

174
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,920
Shake off the dust from your body

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
and get rid of the dark grime on your body.

176
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,480
Especially during the hours of Mao and Yin, which is 5 to 7 am,

177
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,720
good news will come.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,720
By then, the broken mirror will be mended,

179
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,000
and those who are separated

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,330
will surely meet again.

181
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,640
Thank you, young Taoist.

182
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,890
Gentleman, is there anything you want me to divine for you?

183
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,510
I don't.

184
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,170
There's a Matchmaking Tree here.

185
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,100
I'll divine

186
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,730
your marital fortune for you then, gentleman.

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,450
Please, gentleman.

188
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,840
The mirror is broken, and the wind doesn't cease.

189
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,400
Don't sail against the current.

190
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,260
Gentleman, this divination is very inauspicious.

191
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,210
Don't take what that young Taoist

192
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,530
said just now to heart.

193
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,830
He's young and lacks experience,

194
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,890
so his divination can be inaccurate.

195
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,390
Let's not talk about him anymore.

196
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,150
At least we discovered

197
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,720
your father's handwriting.

198
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,380
That's quite an achievement.

199
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,320
Yes.

200
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,390
As long as we can confirm he's in the painting,

201
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,390
finding him is just a matter of time.

202
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,390
There are two more places to visit.

203
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,850
I'm sure we'll find clues.

204
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,570
If we

205
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,090
can find a way out,

206
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,760
does that mean

207
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,670
the other people

208
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,870
trapped in the painting can get out too?

209
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,510
Then that young Taoist we just met

210
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,480
could return to the Bodhi Temple

211
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
to see his master.

212
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,600
Actually,

213
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,650
60 years ago,

214
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,070
there was a flood on Mount Bodhi.

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,650
His master and the entire temple

216
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,020
have long since turned to rubble

217
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,030
and disappeared.

218
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,480
Sixty years have passed,

219
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,720
yet he knows nothing of it.

220
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,590
He must have been in the painting for a long time.

221
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,720
The world in this painting

222
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,840
repeats in cycles,

223
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,550
but the time outside

224
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,900
flows on relentlessly.

225
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,890
Once this place collapses and shatters,

226
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,480
he will instantly age

227
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,570
and turn from a child

228
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,870
into an old man.

229
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,130
If that's really the case,

230
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,310
I'm not sure

231
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,520
whether it's better for him to stay here

232
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,320
or to get away.

233
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,870
If he stays here,

234
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,790
at least he still has hope and

235
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,600
something to look forward to every day.

236
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,320
But if he really gets away,

237
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,270
it would be like waking from a long dream to nothing.

238
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,200
His life would already be at its end

239
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,570
before he could experience anything.

240
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,810
Junior Sister?

241
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,700
Go inform Master quickly.

242
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,410
-Hurry!
-Okay.

243
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,300
[Fa'en Temple]

244
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,960
The incense offerings at Fa'en Temple

245
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,290
are really prosperous.

246
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,550
The Emperor believes in Buddhism.

247
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,750
Plus, this place

248
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,210
once witnessed a miracle.

249
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,080
That's why there are

250
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,430
more people coming here.

251
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,630
What kind of miracle?

252
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,060
Years ago, there was a severe drought in Guangping.

253
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,890
Not a drop of rain fell for four consecutive months.

254
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,870
The people's lives were in dire straits.

255
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,030
So the wealthy people in the city,

256
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,790
led by the prefect,

257
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,240
came to Fa'en Temple

258
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,630
on the day of the Flower Festival

259
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,760
to pray for rain before the Guanyin Bodhisattva statue.

260
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,550
Just as the ceremony began,

261
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,150
an odd phenomenon occurred.

262
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,870
The Guanyin Bodhisattva's statue was seen shedding tears,

263
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,930
thunder gathered,

264
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,870
and suddenly a torrential rain poured down.

265
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,570
After that spring rain,

266
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,620
flowers bloomed everywhere.

267
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,320
The commoners believed

268
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,960
it was the compassion of Guanyin Bodhisattva

269
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,560
that brought the sweet rain.

270
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,500
So they designated the Flower Festival

271
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,620
as the Temple Fair Day.

272
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,510
Devout men and women

273
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,570
all come on this day

274
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,850
to Fa'en Temple to offer incense and pray for blessings.

275
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,030
I see.

276
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,600
But don't you think

277
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,410
searching like this

278
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,540
is leading nowhere?

279
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,510
Since my father remembers

280
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,680
his name,

281
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
he should remember my voice as well.

282
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's shout around.

283
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,000
If he hears it,

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
he will respond to me, right?

285
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,200
I guess so.

286
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,910
Quick, go after them!

287
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,010
Hurry up, let's go!

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,460
Master.

289
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,030
Father!

290
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,630
I'm Banxia!

291
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,390
Where are you?

292
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,790
Father!

293
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,390
Father!

294
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,580
Master.

295
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
It sounds like Junior Sister's voice.

296
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,180
Quick, quick, go search!

297
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,580
I forgot that I know the Lion's Roar technique.

298
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,900
You evil creature!

299
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,600
Father?

300
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,080
I don't have such

301
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,680
an unfilial daughter as you!

302
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,230
So this is your father?

303
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,590
No, not really.

304
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,390
He's my father in this painting.

305
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Go get her!

306
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,240
Go!

307
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,210
Quick, quick!

308
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,440
You evil creature, stop right there!

309
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,840
Stop!

310
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,030
You evil creature!

311
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,600
Stop!

312
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,320
You can't pass through here.

313
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,080
You all,

314
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,100
go that way.

315
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,090
Let's go this way.

316
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,090
Let's go, Master.

317
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,800
Follow me! This way!

318
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,910
Come on, this way!

319
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,600
Go check the east side.

320
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes.

321
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,750
Master!

322
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,010
How did it go? Did you find her?

323
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,840
We've searched the courtyard,

324
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,550
but we didn't see Junior Sister.

325
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,150
No luck on this side, either.

326
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,360
How is that possible?

327
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,170
I clearly saw her in the temple.

328
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,200
Go search again.

329
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,750
Be more thorough.

330
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,720
-Go.
-Yes.

331
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,600
Let's go.

332
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,970
What were you running from?

333
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,750
They were chasing me.

334
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,910
Aren't you skilled in martial arts?

335
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,770
Can't you just fight your way out?

336
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,320
But that's my father.

337
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,910
He's just your father in the painting.

338
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,310
But he's still my father.

339
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,110
Master!

340
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,480
How did it go?

341
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,750
We've searched until there were no more paths

342
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,330
and still haven't seen Junior Sister.

343
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,000
That's impossible.

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
She must be somewhere in this temple.

345
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,840
There are no more doors in the backyard.

346
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,970
There's only one...

347
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,410
Dog hole left.

348
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,010
Nonsense!

349
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,710
How could my daughter go through a dog hole?

350
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,880
Go look again, quickly.

351
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,270
Yes.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,530
Let's go!

353
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,160
Go.

354
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,310
Quick, quick, hide!

355
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,310
How could this be?

356
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,310
I just don't believe it.

357
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
They've all left.

358
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,400
So, can you

359
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,370
let go of me now?

360
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,440
No.

361
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,030
What if they come back later?

362
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,030
What should we do?

363
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,510
Can't you move back a bit?

364
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,760
There's still so much space behind you.

365
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,620
Do you have to squeeze in so close?

366
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,790
I can't.

367
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,100
If I move back any more,

368
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,310
they'll see us.

369
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,730
Just bear with it a little longer.

370
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,390
Hold on a bit longer, alright?

371
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,170
Another fruitless search.

372
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,730
I wonder where he

373
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,610
put them in the painting.

374
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,750
The rain is getting heavier.

375
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,610
Let's hurry up.

376
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,310
Go, quickly.

377
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,110

May I ask which school or sect you belong to?

533
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,670
I learned from my father.

534
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,000

Perhaps I know him.

539
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,410
You wouldn't.

540
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,660

550

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,430
Alright, everyone's hungry. Let's eat.

565
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,110
These are just some simple home-cooked dishes.

566
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,310
I hope you don't mind.

567
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,450
Please, eat up.

568
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,380
Is it not good?

569
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,130
It's delicious.

570
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,880
This is my homemade

571
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,080
pickled vegetables.

572
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,530
It probably doesn't suit your taste.

573
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,350
Here, have a chicken leg.

574
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,070
I bought it from Li's Smoked Meat Shop.

575
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,270
It's very delicious.

576
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,350
It really is.

577
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
When I was little,

578
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,240
what I ate most often

579
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,030
was the pickled vegetables

580
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,230
my mother made for me.

581
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
Since she passed away,

582
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,930
I haven't

583
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,420
tasted this flavor again.

584
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,310
I see.

585
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,800
If you like it, eat more.

586
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,430
There's more in the kitchen.

587
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,430
If you don't mind,

588
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,580
take some with you when you leave.

589
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,200
Brother, you can take it all.

590
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,150
I don't like it anyway.

591
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,440
He's so clever and adorable.

592
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,270
He'll surely be successful in the future.

593
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,750
He doesn't have to be successful.

594
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,550
I don't have any expectations

595
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,750
for this little brat.

596
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,710
As long as he can pass down

597
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,850
the Ganshan Clinic

598
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,680
and ensure my demon-hunting skills

599
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,340
don't die out, that's enough.

600
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,270
I can tell at a glance

601
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,930
that you're a blessed person.

602
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,640
Not to mention passing the business down,

603
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,440
he might even

604
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,110
surpass you one day.

605
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,510
This young lady sure knows how to talk.

606
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,790
If that's really the case,

607
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,720
I'd wake up from my dream laughing.

608
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,720
But if you laugh,

609
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,030
I might cry.

610
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,700
In this line of work,

611
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,350
it's all about fighting, killing,

612
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,150
and dealing with demons all day.

613
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,440
I don't want

614
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,570
my son to do this job.

615
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,140
If you ask me,

616
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,310
as long as the family is together

617
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,010
and safe, that's better than anything else.

618
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,370
You two just got married recently, right?

619
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,760
We're not married.

620
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,920
We're just friends.

621
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,150
Don't try to fool me.

622
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
I can tell.

623
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,960
Tell what?

624
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,070
I can tell that

625
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,570
you two are deeply in love,

626
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,050
and you're a couple.

627
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,680
Anyway,

628
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,880
you definitely like him.

629
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,300
Later,

630
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,100
we left the South Sea.

631
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,110
He's a good guy.

632
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,790
I think so too.

633
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,930
You've been to the South Sea?

634
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,610
My father took me there.

635
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,420
There's a type of demon in the South Sea

636
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,070
called the Dead Leaf Butterfly.

637
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,400
It's huge, with wings like cattail sails.

638
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,850
This demon

639
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,570
is best at weaving illusions

640
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,300
and bewitching people's minds.

641
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,450
The first time my father and I

642
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,790
encountered this demon,

643
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,920
we fell for its trick

644
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,600
and fell into its illusion.

645
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,160
We almost lost our minds.

646
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
But fortunately,

647
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,690
in the end, my father woke up

648
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,040
and slayed that demon.

649
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,320
Actually, the illusions in this world,

650
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,830
although they may seem mysterious

651
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,960
and extraordinary,

652
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,140
they all follow the same principle.

653
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,790
As long as you find the right focal point,

654
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,450
they can be easily dispelled.

655
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,000
People trapped in illusions

656
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,550
are like turtles in a jar,

657
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,850
or birds in a cage.

658
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,200
Of course it's hard for them to break free.

659
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,830
But if viewed from the outside,

660
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,630
they're like flowers in a mirror

661
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,960
or reflections in the water.

662
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,020
With a gentle poke,

663
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
they'd dissipate like bubbles.

664
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,720
So you mean,

665
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,480
to break the illusion,

666
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,790
we need to attack from both inside and outside?

667
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,850
You could say that.

668
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,920
The focal points can be divided into two types.

669
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,880
One connects

670
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,100
the door between reality and illusion.

671
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,700
By passing through it,

672
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,390
one can escape the illusion.

673
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,930
The other type

674
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,510
is the person who cast the formation.

675
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,570
As long as they die,

676
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,480
the formation will dissipate along with them.

677
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,070
Dad, look!

678
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,460
I've learned

679
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,370
the Bahuang Fist you taught me.

680
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,190
Young man.

681
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,640
This is our family's ancestral  Bahuang Fist.

682
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,500
Would you like to learn it from me?

683
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,000
Sure.

684
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,360
You're in a good mood today.

685
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,240
I practiced a set of fist techniques,

686
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,970
and it made me feel much better.

687
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,720
Why are your parents

688
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,240
in the painting as well?

689
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,000
That demon must have spent

690
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,490
many years painting this.

691
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,120
It painted whatever it saw.

692
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,100
For example,

693
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,840
the Six Wonders of Guangping

694
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,550
couldn't possibly have

695
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,810
taken place in one day,

696
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,480
but since the painter

697
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,720
was deeply impressed,

698
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,850
it painted them all.

699
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,000
But if it could paint,

700
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,140
why did it have to capture living people to put into the painting?

701
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,510
I'm also puzzled by this.

702
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:20,900
Perhaps

703
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,960
only by meeting the painter in person

704
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
can we get the answer.

705
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,160
Let's go.

706
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,070
How are you feeling today?

707
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,800
Much better.

708
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,880
Thank you for taking me in, Master.

709
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,920
Since Mr. Jiu sent you here,

710
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,070
of course Xiaodongtian has no reason

711
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,000
to turn you away.

712
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,860
Just rest and recuperate here.

713
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,190
When you fully recover,

714
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,710
you can find another place to settle down.

715
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,080
Lady, please line up at the back.

716
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,690
I require to see your manager.

717
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,390
I'm here on the orders of the Minister of the Court of Judicial Review,

718
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,950
Lord Song Zhilian,

719
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,750
to investigate

720
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,000
the case of Lord Xin'an's disappearance.

721
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,260
Since you are well-established in the Underground City,

722
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,430
having been doing business here for a long time,

723
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,760
I wonder if you could

724
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,340
provide assistance to me.

725
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Assisting the government with case investigation

726
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
is Xiaodongtian's duty.

727
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,510
However, My Lord,

728
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,220
do you have any leads

729
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,280
on where to start the investigation?

730
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,790
Two years ago, Lord Xin'an

731
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,720
came to the Underground City

732
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,780
with an old servant

733
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,250
to see the Living Healer,

734
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,850
Huangfu Bai, for treatment.

735
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,590
According to Huangfu Bai's diagnosis,

736
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,880
he was found to have a blood-borne disease

737
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,240
and didn't have long to live.

738
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,480
However, after that,

739
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,610
he didn't return to the capital

740
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,800
and disappeared in the Underground City instead.

741
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,430
Lord Sima.

742
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,920
With all due respect,

743
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,920
since His Lordship was already terminally ill

744
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,510
and it's been two years,

745
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,680
even if we find him,

746
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,940
he will probably be beyond recognition.

747
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,380
That's not for you to worry about.

748
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,820
You're well aware of

749
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,240
Lord Xin'an's status.

750
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,570
Even if he has unfortunately passed away,

751
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,630
I still want to uncover the truth.

752
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,530
Well...

753
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,030
What?

754
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,170
Don't want to help?

755
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,680
How could I?

756
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,600
I'm just trying to think of a way to help.

757
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,980
I'm wondering

758
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,190
if you have a personal letter from Lord Song?

759
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,000
If you do,

760
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,400
I can take it

761
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,159
to the managers of other trading companies

762
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,230
to have them join forces with me.

763
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,199
This way,

764
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,760
the search would be faster.

765
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,159
So you think my rank isn't high enough.

766
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,409
No, I wouldn't dare.

767
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,000
Is the Grand Secretary of the imperial court high enough for you?

768
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,199
The Grand Secretary?

769
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Let me be straightforward with you.

770
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,030
There's another Chief Constable

771
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,270
who came here with me.

772
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,679
To be honest with you,

773
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,070
he is the Grand Secretary's

774
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,550
future son-in-law.

775
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,969
If anything goes wrong,

776
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,480
not only will you be unable to bear the consequences,

777
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,940
even your boss, the owner,

778
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:47,750
won't be able to handle it.

779
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,540
May I ask which Grand Secretary it is?

780
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,139
Is this something you can inquire about?

781
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,440
First, a lord,

782
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,980
now the Grand Secretary's son-in-law.

783
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,940
I could ask Lord Song for instructions,

784
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,690
however,

785
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm afraid it's not a letter that will be coming,

786
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,600
but soldiers.

787
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,800
By then,

788
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,190
this Underground City

789
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,850
will be thoroughly searched.

790
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,820
If it affects your business,

791
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,360
don't blame me

792
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,090
for not warning you in advance.

793
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,040
Thank you for the warning, My Lord.

794
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,320
The son-in-law of a Grand Secretary?

795
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,920
Yes.

796
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,020
She wouldn't tell me

797
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,140
which Grand Secretary specifically.

798
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,800
I don't know whether what she said is true or not.

799
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,790
What's that judicial commissioner's surname?

800
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,440
Sima.

801
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,920
Sima.

802
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,880
Interesting.

803
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,190
The time for the gate

804
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,480
to Carefree Land to open

805
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,410
is drawing near.

806
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,480
The Underground City

807
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,980
is indeed getting livelier and livelier.

808
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,000
So, Master,

809
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,690
should we help her?

810
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,670
Of course we should help her.

811
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,840
Chunmian.

812
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,710
Assign more people to assist her.

813
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,580
Once she's done with her antics,

814
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,910
she'll leave on her own.

815
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,090
Get rid of her as soon as possible.

816
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,550
Yes.

817
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,050
You said just now

818
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,400
that you studied at Dexin Academy, right?

819
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,030
How is that possible?

820
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,630
Such a prestigious academy

821
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,400
would never accept someone like me.

822
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,330
Then what about that Master Zhang?

823
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,240
There's no Master Zhang.

824
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,710
I was just making it up.

825
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,930
Besides, they took

826
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,820
your bracelet.

827
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,440
No matter where I said

828
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,630
we came from,

829
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,550
they would let us

830
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,750
come in and have a try.

831
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,000
That's true.

832
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,120
So this is the last wonder of Guangping.

833
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,000
But why is the Night Banquet at South Lake

834
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
also considered one of the wonders?

835
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,540
It's said that

836
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,560
Lord Xin'an

837
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,390
is the current emperor's uncle.

838
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,210
When they came to this place years ago,

839
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,500
they found it rich in talent and resources.

840
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,830
So they invited poor scholars

841
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,970
from various places to a banquet at the South Lake.

842
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,280
As long as their poems and essays

843
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,890
stood out at the gathering,

844
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,590
they could drink and chat

845
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,590
with Lord Xin'an.

846
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,590
Even better,

847
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,150
in the following year's imperial examination,

848
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,920
they could achieve official ranks.

849
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,650
That's why it became one of Guangping's wonders.

850
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,760
So, do you know how to write poems?

851
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,060
Gentlemen.

852
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,080
I'm Liu Kuo, courtesy name Kefu.

853
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,840
Pleased to meet you.

854
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,480
May I ask

855
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,570
how to address you two gentlemen?

856
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,430
My surname is Jiu.

857
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,660
Duan Yanqiu.

858
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,030
Mr. Duan.

859
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,360
Mr. Jiu.

860
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,190
May I ask where you two are from

861
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,520
and which academy you study at?

862
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,160
We are from Guangping,

863
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,880
and we study at Dexin Academy.

864
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,800
Dexin Academy?

865
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,960
So we are fellow disciples.

866
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,990
No wonder you both look so familiar.

867
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,090
May I ask,

868
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,180
which master do you study under?

869
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,120
Master Zhang.

870
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,890
Master Zhang?

871
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,920
You mean Zhang Maosong, Master Zhang?

872
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,360
Yes.

873
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,030
But hasn't Master Zhang

874
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,400
been bedridden

875
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,030
for a long time?

876
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,060
We are his bedside disciples.

877
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,270
Bedside?

878
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,480
Pardon me for my ignorance.

879
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,110
I've only heard of closed-door disciples.

880
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,230
Mr. Liu.

881
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,160
How long is this time limit?

882
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,360
It counts as long as the incense is still burning.

883
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,600
You know how to write poems?

884
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,460
This Night Banquet at South Lake

885
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,590
took place over a decade ago, right?

886
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,130
Yes, indeed.

887
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,760
Over the past 10 years,

888
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,110
there have been no fewer than

889
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,280
100 widely circulated new poems.

890
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,960
Although I haven't deliberately memorized them,

891
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,590
I could

892
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,360
still recall

893
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
two of them.

894
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,060
And they definitely haven't heard them before.

895
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,620
Why are you out?

896
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,300
I'll fight you to the death!

897
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,570
Today,

898
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,920
even if you have to turn Guangping

899
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,000
upside down,

900
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,480
you must find

901
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,840
those two people for me!

902
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,880
Yes!

903
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,710
His Lordship has read

904
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,000
all the poems you wrote.

905
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
He is very pleased

906
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,630
and has specially awarded gold, silver, and valuables,

907
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,880
as well as writing brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones

908
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,630
to aid in your studies.

909
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,760
He hopes you all will study extensively, think carefully,

910
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,730
discern clearly, and act diligently.

911
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,410
He also looks forward to seeing you all

912
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,480
in the capital and achieve high honors

913
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,310
in next year's imperial examination.

914
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,430
Thank you, My Lord.

915
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,760
Studying is for

916
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,710
strengthening and revitalizing our country,

917
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,000
and serving as an official is for

918
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,730
ensuring peace for the people.

919
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,670
This is the message bestowed upon you all by His Lordship.

920
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,310
He hopes all of you will bear it in mind.

921
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,030
We will bear it in mind.

922
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,110
My Lord.

923
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,560
Do you think there's anyone else from outside the painting here?

924
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,410
Very likely.

925
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,280
Upon this scene,

926
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,670
and with this mood,

927
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,080
I would like to recite a poem

928
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,570
to present to His Lordship

929
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,710
and everyone here.

930
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,110
Ten years of study by rain-beaten lamplight.

931
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,220
At the top of a hundred-foot pole, watching the tide rise.

932
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,730
A thousand sails finally cross, with ambitions soaring high.

933
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,980
Ten thousand miles of blue waves reflect the red sun.

934
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,590
Bravo! What a great poem!

935
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,670
Wonderful poem! Truly a magnificent piece!

936
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,670
Excellent poem!

937
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,150
What a great poem!

938
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,490
As expected of you, Kefu.

939
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,130
Your literary talent is indeed remarkable.

940
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,200
My skills are not worth mentioning.

941
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,930
There are many talents from humble backgrounds,

942
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,410
such as Mr. Duan here.

943
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,360
Despite his young age,

944
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,830
he's very accomplished at composing poetry,

945
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,510
even better than me.

946
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,270
Me?

947
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:31,800
Yes, indeed.

948
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,090
I saw Mr. Duan

949
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,360
pick up his brush to compose a poem just now,

950
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,190
and he finished it with just a few strokes,

951
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,800
showing his quick wit.

952
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,120
You're too kind.

953
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,280
Mr. Duan, there's no need to be so modest.

954
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,140
With His Lordship present today,

955
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,080
Mr. Duan, why don't you compose another piece?

956
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,800
That's right, no need to be modest.

957
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,420
Compose another piece. One more.

958
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,550
Compose another piece. One more.
