00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,990
is quite old.

196
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,320
And with all the shops nearby,

197
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,240
it is a bit noisy.

198
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,000
A good house is easy to find,

199
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
but good neighbors are rare.

200
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,490
Back in Nanyang City,

201
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,560
we ran into that dangerous

202
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,290
[Mrs. Duan, Tang Ruyun]

203
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
Human-faced Owl.

204
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,530
Just thinking about it now

205
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,450
still gives me chills.

206
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,800
Only by living next to you

207
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,870
can I feel a bit safer.

208
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,180
[Mrs. Jiu, Hong Ning]

209
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,630
Actually,

210
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,480
I was scared too when I first married him.

211
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,790
But gradually,

212
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
I got used to it.

213
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,070
You know,

214
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,970
we can't let those things

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,130
scare us from living our lives, right?

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,270
I'm back!

217
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,750
Banxia, come here.

218
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,679
Greetings, Mrs. Jiu.

219
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,030
Where have you been?

220
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,370
Why are you all sweaty?

221
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,120
Nowhere.

222
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,940
I just went to see a friend.

223
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,030
She's so reckless.

224
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,200
I actually think

225
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,120
Banxia has a lovely temperament.

226
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,550
Is she engaged?

227
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,280
We're looking for a match for her.

228
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,210
If I recall, your son

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,670
is also at the age of marriage,

230
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,150
right?

231
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,260
He's already engaged.

232
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,650
They'll be married by the end of this year.

233
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,470
That's great.

234
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,510
He's engaged?

235
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,910
My Lady,

236
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,090
you must've skipped your medicine again.

237
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,510
Or you wouldn't have had hallucinations again.

238
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,030
Why were you so surprised

239
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,390
that

240
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,590
Mr. Jiu is engaged?

241
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,000
The way you looked and talked today,

242
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,150
anyone would think

243
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,480
you're in love with him.

244
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,600
In love.

245
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,760
In love.

246
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,620
In love.

247
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,060
Stop mimicking nonsense.

248
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,530
Fortunately, there were no outsiders there.

249
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,530
If those words

250
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,910
were twisted and spread around,

251
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,270
people

252
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,930
would gossip about you again.

253
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,140
I'm not sick at all.

254
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,320
I know.

255
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,630
You're not sick.

256
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,550
It's just that

257
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,600
you occasionally

258
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,460
talk nonsense,

259
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,630
lack energy,

260
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,080
and cry

261
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,360
in your sleep.

262
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,510
Still,

263
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,740
your condition

264
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,200
is a bit mysterious.

265
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,750
For instance,

266
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,930
back then, no one believed

267
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,130
the bride was a demon.

268
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,880
Only you believed

269
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,110
Uncle Jiu instantly.

270
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,000
My Lady,

271
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,630
how did you figure out

272
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,870
the bride was a demon?

273
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,370
I don't know either.

274
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,920
When I saw Manniang,

275
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,090
she just felt strangely familiar.

276
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,790
I also felt fear

277
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,120
and some…

278
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,910
pity, maybe?

279
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,960
My Lady,

280
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,800
it was your first time meeting the bride.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,200
Where did all those feelings come from?

282
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,600
Banxia.

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
-Mom.
-Madam.

284
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,870
This is from Mrs. Jiu.

285
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,000
She said when you

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,030
wake up from bad dreams at night,

287
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,790
reading this

288
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,810
can help calm your mind.

289
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,840
Chi Xue!

290
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,630
Come help me with something.

291
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,320
Coming.

292
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,750
May the heart remain in timeless serenity.

293
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,120
Like clouds drifting, like rivers flowing.

294
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,240
Face all

295
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,650
without turning away.

296
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,200
In peace,

297
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,080
release desires that cloud the mind.

298
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,680
For all things rise and fall, unite and part like the ebbing tide.

299
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,750
Who are you?

300
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,440
What's wrong with me?

301
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,470
[Liushui Pavilion]

302
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,960
[Chilian]

303
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,870
Miss Duan.

304
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,420
Ms. Xingxian.

305
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,910
It's really you.

306
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,950
If you hadn't sent me that invitation,

307
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,550
I wouldn't have believed it.

308
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,240
I've already divorced Zhang Pu.

309
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,320
These days, I play the Qin

310
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,450
at Liushui Pavilion

311
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,690
as a way

312
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,250
to make a living for myself.

313
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,670
Congratulations!

314
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,210
I have to thank you, Miss Duan.

315
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,980
If you hadn't shaken me awake

316
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,100
and helped me out,

317
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,360
I wouldn't even be alive

318
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,490
to play the Qin here.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,860
You're the one who made it happen.

320
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,150
I've heard

321
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,550
that the owner of Liushui Pavilion

322
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,750
is a master of the Qin.

323
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,870
Most musicians don't

324
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,600
get the chance to perform here.

325
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,980
The fact that you do

326
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,840
means your skills are top-notch.

327
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,650
Top-notch? Hardly.

328
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,720
I hadn't touched a Qin in years.

329
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,580
It's all thanks to Mr. Bai.

330
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,000
He recommended me

331
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,060
and even wrote a new piece just for me.

332
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,030
That's how I found a place to stay.

333
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,420
Mr. Bai?

334
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,060
He's a renowned master of the Qin.

335
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,400
Kind-hearted like you,

336
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,240
he took pity on me for being all alone

337
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,770
and helped me find this job.

338
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,870
Great!

339
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,670
Great! Great! Great!

340
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,320
Miss Duan, it's my turn.

341
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,860
We'll talk more later.

342
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,830
Go ahead then.

343
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Hoto noodles!

344
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,480
Hot Hoto noodles!

345
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,910
Freshly made and sold!

346
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,400
Waiter.

347
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,010
Any seats left?

348
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,200
Miss,

349
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
why don't you order first?

350
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
There's an empty seat there.

351
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,010
Alright.

352
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,360
One bowl of Hoto noodles, one stuffed lotus root,

353
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,290
and a honey cake.

354
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,020
Certainly!

355
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,010
This way.

356
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,530
Sir, are you finished?

357
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,130
I'd like to settle the bill.

358
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,870
Take care.

359
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Can I help you?

360
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,490
Sorry.

361
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,670
Have we met before?

362
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,230
You must be mistaken.

363
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,540
This is my first time in Guangping.

364
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,470
I don't know you.

365
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,390
Farewell.

366
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,130
Think carefully.

367
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
I don't know why,

368
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,440
but you feel familiar to me.

369
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,670
I'm Duan Banxia.

370
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,600
Are you sure we haven't met before?

371
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,840
Yes.

372
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
Thank you, sir.

373
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,510
You're very kind.

374
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,720
Are you here for work,

375
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,400
for business,

376
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,010
or maybe to visit someone?

377
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,890
Where are you staying?

378
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,720
At an inn?

379
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,680
Or at a friend's place?

380
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,920
Sir,

381
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,720
how long have you been in Guangping?

382
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,240
Have you had a chance to look around?

383
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,099
Is your foot not hurting anymore?

384
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,960
It hurts.

385
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,329
It really hurts.

386
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,750
However,

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I have some great herbal oil at home.

388
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,070
My neighbor, Physician Jiu

389
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,000
from Ganshan Clinic, gave it to me.

390
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,920
He is the best

391
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,420
bonesetter in Guangping.

392
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
My house is just up ahead.

393
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,090
Thank you for today.

394
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,200
You were

395
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,160
heading back to your inn just now, right?

396
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,520
The closest one nearby

397
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,920
should be Jude Hotel.

398
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,290
Are you staying there?

399
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,200
It seems so.

400
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,610
Here we are.

401
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,210
[Qingche Hall]

402
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,310
I still don't know your name.

403
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,170
My name is Man Ying.

404
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,550
Man Ying…

405
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,880
Jingchu is home to many Miao descendants.

406
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,610
The surname Man is a prominent one there.

407
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,680
Are you

408
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,080
from Jingchu?

409
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,310
So, Mr. Man,

410
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,640
how long will you be staying in Guangping?

411
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,550
I'm leaving.

412
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,140
When will you come again?

413
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,230
I won't.

414
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,830
For years,

415
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,240
I've been having the same dream

416
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,070
over and over.

417
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,140
In my dream,

418
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,720
there's a man.

419
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,440
He's about your height

420
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,630
and your build.

421
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,200
But the fog's too thick.

422
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,790
I can never see his face clearly.

423
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,450
Every time I walk towards him,

424
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,740
I wake up.

425
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,440
Someone told me

426
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,350
you can only dream about

427
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,590
people or things

428
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,030
you've seen before.

429
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,290
So I've always wondered

430
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,640
if he's someone

431
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,900
I met long ago

432
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,670
but forgot.

433
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,530
When I saw you

434
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,920
at the noodle shop just now,

435
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,580
you felt strangely familiar.

436
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,750
That's why I stopped you.

437
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,400
I know

438
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,790
this is a bit rude,

439
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,550
but I have to ask again.

440
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,640
Have you really never been to Guangping before?

441
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,200
Have we really never met?

442
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,070
No.

443
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,080
I see.

444
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,740
Thank you for carrying me home today.

445
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,990
You're done talking?

446
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,520
I'll be going.

447
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,880
My Lady, who's that guy?

448
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,160
My Lady,

449
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,320
what happened to your foot?

450
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,370
I remember you.

451
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,760
What brought you here?

452
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,050
Hoto noodles are ready!

453
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:29,840
Chi Xue,

454
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,110
you sure you can eat all this?

455
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,120
Have you come into money?

456
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,160
Physician Jiu gave you a salary?

457
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,200
It's not like I'm not paying you.

458
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,460
Why so many questions?

459
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,370
Enjoy your meal.

460
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,240
Last time at the Reunion Inn,

461
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,400
the person who helped us fight the puppets

462
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,460
was you, wasn't it?

463
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,000
Face covered,

464
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,110
wielding a curved blade,

465
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,350
with one move, you shattered Feng Tian's sword

466
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,080
into pieces.

467
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,120
How did you recognize me?

468
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,970
I smelled you

469
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,400
from three streets away.

470
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,680
Since when

471
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,280
did your nose become so keen?

472
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,480
Surprised?

473
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,550
I've practiced the Five-Sense Technique.

474
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,150
I learned it from a dog demon.

475
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,480
My five senses are sharp,

476
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,140
especially my sense of smell.

477
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,070
Sir,

478
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,900
don't add garlic, please.

479
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,960
I don't eat garlic.

480
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,790
Your nose is so sharp.

481
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,270
It's more tasty with garlic.

482
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,200
You're smiling.

483
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,830
You're admitting it, aren't you?

484
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,270
Here,

485
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,240
eat some more.

486
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,510
My master said you meant no harm

487
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,510
and told me not to go looking for you.

488
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,880
He took you as a disciple?

489
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:36,550
Yes.

490
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,550
Jiu Xi

491
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
is good at numbers

492
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,290
and a decent physician,

493
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,370
but he's not cut out for fighting.

494
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,000
That old man wants his skills

495
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,210
to be passed down.

496
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,310
So he took me in.

497
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
But he said

498
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm just learning some basics.

499
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,620
Not really the one to inherit his legacy.

500
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,280
He needs to find someone else.

501
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,670
But I don't think he ever can.

502
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,510
Why?

503
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,130
He has an image

504
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,790
of an ideal successor in his mind.

505
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,790
He wants someone

506
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,640
exactly like that.

507
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,750
He's too picky to find them.

508
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,550
Take your time.

509
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,400
Here,

510
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,810
have this bowl too.

511
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,500
I haven't eaten this much in ages.

512
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,040
I've been so busy lately.

513
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,260
Busy with what?

514
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,460
Jiu Xi is getting married.

515
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,680
The old man is planning to

516
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,810
renovate the house.

517
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
That's good news.

518
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,090
Who is Jiu Xi marrying?

519
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,720
The daughter of a herbal merchant on Gujing Street.

520
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,790
The old man goes there a lot

521
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,660
to buy herbs.

522
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,380
Over time, they got close.

523
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,860
His wife picked the match.

524
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,410
Does Jiu Xi really like her?

525
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,160
I don't know.

526
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,790
But let me tell you,

527
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,550
he's been acting a little silly lately.

528
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,170
Sometimes when he's writing,

529
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,440
he just starts smiling

530
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,640
out of the blue.

531
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,370
Looks kinda weird.

532
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,120
I wonder if the bride

533
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
will like him.

534
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, right.

535
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,260
Thank you for that day.

536
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,640
Master said

537
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,940
if you hadn't shown up,

538
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,880
he and I alone

539
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,640
might not have been able to stop all the puppets.

540
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,790
If they had gotten loose,

541
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,450
we'd have been in big trouble.

542
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,140
From now on, you're my friend.

543
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,680

544
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,210
Friend.

545
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,240
Alright, friend.

546
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,290
I'm heading home then.

547
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,070
Wait.

551
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,250
No problem.

553
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,030
Thank you.

554
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,750
You look so happy.

555
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,850
Feeling hungry again?

556
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,550
No,

557
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,750
I just smelled grilled venison.

558
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,810
It smells amazing.

559
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,720
It's Master's favorite.

560
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,920
Wait for me.

561
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,490
You're such a kind person.

562
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,410
From now on,

563
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,810
you're my brother.

564
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,940
Aren't we friends?

565
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,040
Friends aren't this generous.

566
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
You're family, a brother.

567
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,750
I'm home.

568
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,240
Go in.

569
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,440
Chi Xue?

570
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,250
Why are you back so late?

571
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,900
Master, what are you looking for?

572
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,740
I'm hungry.

573
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,110
I swear there was a plate of fried beans left.

574
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,400
Where is it?

575
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,440
What's that smell?

576
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
What are you holding?

577
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,790
Grilled venison.

578
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,110
Fresh off the grill.

579
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,490
Your favorite, Master.

580
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,570
Quick, quick, set it out!

581
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,610
It's grilled venison!

582
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,340
Wonderful!

583
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,510
Dad, Chi Xue,

584
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,720
what are you eating?

585
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,510
Your nose is quite sharp, isn't it?

586
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,160
Sit down.

587
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,590
Join us.

588
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,120
Alright.

589
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,480
Eat up.

590
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,830
This is so delicious.

591
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,290
We have to eat it with wine.

592
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,200
You're right.

593
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:15,960
Go, go,

594
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,590
bring out the good wine I've hidden.

595
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,720
Okay, I'll go get it.

596
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,490
Wait for me.

597
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,550
Dad, the wine's here!

598
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
Let's all keep our voices down.

599
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,550
Don't wake your mom.

600
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,270
Or we'll all get scolded.

601
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,830
Okay.

602
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,330
Let me fill your cup.

603
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,440
Dad,

604
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,410
you're playing favorites.

605
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,640
You snuck Chi Xue pocket money,

606
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,500
but none for me.

607
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
Yesterday I wanted to buy a poetry book,

608
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,110
but when I checked my pocket,

609
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,070
I didn't have enough money.

610
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,680
Nonsense!

611
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,220
I didn't give Chi Xue any pocket money.

612
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,820
Master didn't give me money.

613
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,490
This was bought by my brother.

614
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,910
Your brother?

615
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,930
The one from last time at the Reunion Inn

616
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,260
who used a curved blade.

617
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,650
Didn't I tell you

618
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,510
not to go to him?

619
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,440
I didn't.

620
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,480
He just happened to pass by

621
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,270
from Manniang's Cousin-in-Law's place today.

622
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,200
We ran into each other,

623
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,160
so I said hi.

624
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,480
Then he insisted on treating me to a meal.

625
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,310
He even bought me a lot of new clothes.

626
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:23,960
On the way back,

627
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,090
he bought the grilled venison for you.

628
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,850
Tell me,

629
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
how come other demon hunters

630
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,200
are all so rich,

631
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,190
and we end up losing money

632
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,600
every time we take a job?

633
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,130
Dad,

634
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,680
our clinic is barely breaking even.

635
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,240
You brat,

636
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm saving up

637
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,140
to get you a wife!

638
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,350
I also gotta fix the backyard

639
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,440
and patch up the roof.

640
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,370
It's all for you.

641
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,250
All for you.

642
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,070
Go away.

643
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,610
Let's have a toast.

644
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,440
Here.

645
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,330
I'll drink tea instead.

646
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,930
Cheers, cheers.

647
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,400
Banxia,

648
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,090
I used to wonder,

649
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,730
if we'd never met,

650
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,170
what kind of life you'd have lived.

651
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,250
Hurry up, Dad, Mom.

652
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,100
Come.

653
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,920
Dad, Mom,

654
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,450
look.

655
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,790
Is my bunny pretty?

656
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,510
Yes.

657
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,610
Be careful.

658
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,790
Banxia,

659
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,970
at school,

660
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,830
you need to listen to your teacher, okay?

661
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,890
Yes, Mom.

662
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
When I come back, I'll recite

663
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,240
what I've learned for you.

664
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,680
Okay.

665
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,490
Here, have a duck leg.

666
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,240
More.

667
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,610
Thank you, Mom and Dad.

668
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,540
Mom, this one is for you.

669
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,620
Banxia,

670
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,030
I don't like to eat this.

671
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,270
Your mom likes this.

672
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,200
Here.

673
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,200
I like it too.

674
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,130
Eat more, okay?

675
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,310
Dad, let me help you.

676
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,710
Okay.

677
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,740
♫Melody echoes along the river; wild geese soar in sudden fright♫

678
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,910
♫The music ends, and I stand in solitude♫

679
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,780
♫I see you turn into a handful of starlight♫

680
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,090
♫Drifting past me♫

681
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,340
♫In tears, the past memories still glow♫

♫Crystallized into cold amber♫

683
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,590
♫I know it also brought you great pain to let go♫

684
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,990
♫But why did you♫

685
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,590
♫Still endure the pain and shatter?♫

686
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:31,420
♫Remember me, don't miss me♫

687
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,640
I don't raise rabbits.

688
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,200
♫Don't put the blame on yourself for my solitude♫

689
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,830
My name is Jiu Xuanye.

690
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,310
I'm Duan Banxia.

691
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,420
♫I hate that I failed♫

692
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,760
♫To catch the glistening starlight♫

693
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,340

♫To have loved you is to have truly lived♫

696
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,090
I really do like you,

697
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,680
but I don't know

698
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,880
when it started.

699
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,200
Maybe

700
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,110
a long time ago.

701
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,440
♫In tears, the past memories still glow♫

702
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,480
But I can

703
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,680
swear on my life,

704
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,960
if you're willing to marry me,

705

♫Crystallized into cold amber♫

706
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,280

♫But why did you♫

712

wash up and go to sleep.

724
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:08,159
♫To have loved you is to have truly lived♫

725
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,280

Here.

727
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,630
These are all the Moon Bugs?

728
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,610
Still not enough.

729
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,760
There should be more at the Ganshan Clinic.

730
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,730
But that old man Jiu

731
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,330
isn't easy to deal with.

732
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,860
Can you handle him?

733
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,830
Oh, right.

734
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,430
I need to make a trip to Yangxi County.

735
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,960
There's a bear demon there.

736
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,230
It's time.

737
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,490
Be careful.

738
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,850
I know.

739
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,230
No matter what,

740
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,190
we still have more than ten days

741
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,850
before the Realm Gate closes.

742
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:11,620
We have to

743
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,370
be back before that happens.

744
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,180
Got it.

745
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,390
You went to see that woman again?

746
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,870
If you like her so much,

747
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,320
just bring her back to the Carefree Land.

748
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,440
Once the Realm Gate is shut,

749
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,770
she can't leave anyway.

750
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,530
What else can she do but stay

751
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,260
by your side every day?

752
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,000
So indecisive.

753
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,510
My Lady.

754
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,960
My Lady.

755
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,630
My Lady.

756
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,550
My Lady.

757
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,320
-Banxia.
-Wake up, My Lady.

758
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,030
Banxia.

759
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,920
Manniang's Cousin-in-Law.

760
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,960
-My Lady.
-Miss Duan.

761
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,030
-Manniang's Cousin-in-Law.
-Miss Duan.

762
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,630
Miss Duan.

763
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,480
Miss Duan.

764
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,710
Why aren't you waking up, My Lady?

765
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,400
Manniang's Cousin-in-Law.

766
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,630
-Miss Duan.
-My Lady!

767
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,150
-Manniang's Cousin-in-Law.
-Miss Duan?

768
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,350
-Banxia.
-Miss Duan.

769
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,110
-Manniang's Cousin-in-Law.
-Miss Duan.

770
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,230
Manniang's Cousin-in-Law.

771
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,320
-Miss Duan.
-Banxia.

772
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,130
Manniang's Cousin-in-Law.

773
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,840
Miss Duan.

774
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,710
Miss Duan.

775
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,360
Banxia.

776
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
Manniang's Cousin-in-Law!

777
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,030
Miss Duan.

778
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,020
Miss Duan.

779
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,840
Banxia.

780
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,880
Banxia.

781
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,110
Wake up.

782
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,710
Banxia.

783
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,000
You can't escape it.

784
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,480
Banxia.

785
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,110
Banxia.

786
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,990
Forget me.

787
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,050
No!

788
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,630
My Lady.

789
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,660
My Lady.

790
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,850
What's wrong, My Lady?

791
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,320
Did you have a nightmare?

792
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,930
Impressive!

793
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,570
Are you alright?

794
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,170
I'm fine.

795
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,130
There are Moon Bugs in this bag.

796
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,340
You're a demon,

797
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,440
aren't you?

798
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,190
I've heard the rumors.

799
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,530
Two demons

800
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,510
posing as demon hunters

801
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,670
are capturing evil demons across the land

802
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,620
and collecting primordial spirits.

803
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,910
They're also buying

804
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,450
Moon Bugs at high prices from other

805
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,330
demon hunters.

806
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,940
At first, I didn't understand,

807
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,960
but the moment I saw you,

808
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
it all made sense.

809
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,920
You're from the Carefree Land.

810
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,340
Is the Carefree Herb there

811
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,230
withering?

812
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,090
How do you know that?

813
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,610
If demons can enter the human world,

814
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,360
we humans

815
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,280
can also go to the Carefree Land.

816
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,840
12 years ago,

817
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,230
when the Realm Gate opened wide,

818
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,480
I went to the Underground City to look for my junior brother.

819
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,680
By sheer luck, I got a chance to go there.

820
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,930
I never thought

821
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,590
that outside the human world,

822
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,440
there would be

823
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,280
such a place.

824
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,710
No wonder

825
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,150
every 12 years,

826
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,030
more demons

827
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,200
show up in the world.

828
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,420
That's when I discovered—

829
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,300
the primordial spirits of demons

830
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,310
come from the Carefree Herb.

831
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,910
In the Carefree Land,

832
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,000
they devour primordial spirits to become demons.

833
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,360
And once the Carefree Herb loses its primordial spirit,

834
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,490
it starts to wither.

835
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,230
So,

836
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,150
after a demon dies,

837
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,670
its primordial spirit returns

838
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,870
to the Carefree Herb,

839
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,800
making it take root and sprout again.

840
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,630
It's a cycle

841
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,150
that never ends.

842
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,280
But the primordial spirits that come to the human world

843
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,410
can no longer return

844
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,920
to the Carefree Land after the demons die.

845
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,500
As a result,

846
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,020
the Carefree Land

847
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,190
will eventually run into problems.

848
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,660
All these years,

849
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,300
you've been traveling between the two realms collecting Moon Bugs.

850
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,440
You're actually collecting

851
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,550
the primordial spirits they swallowed,

852
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,320
aren't you?

853
00:39:59,230 --> 00:39:59,840
You're

854
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,320
risking your life.

855
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,530
Mr. Jiu,

856
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,160
you're quite sharp.

857
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,810
Take it then.

858
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,100
Why are you helping me?

859
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,670
Then why did you help me?

860
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,490
Everything happens

861
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,510
for a reason.

862
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,030
Let's just say I'm repaying

863
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,030
your kindness.

864
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,190
Thank you.

865
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,790
I almost forgot.

866
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,620
My son is about to get married.

867
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,600
I need to hurry back to fix the roof.

868
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,440
These dishes are untouched.

869
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,130
Eat them for me.

870
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,130
Don't waste them.

871
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,190
Who?

872
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,420
A man.

873
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,950
He's about this tall,

874
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,920
with thick eyebrows, big eyes,

875
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,000
and a well-shaped nose.

876
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,130
He's very handsome.

877
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,090
I remember now.

878
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,280
There was someone like that.

879
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,540
But he's already left.

880
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,820
When did he leave?

881
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,020
He left last night.

882
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,630
He seemed to be in Guangping on business.

883
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,670
Once it was done,

884
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,800
he left.

885
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,490
Thank you, sir.

886
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,660
It's nothing.

887
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,510
[Jude Hotel]

888
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,480
My Lady,

889
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,960
that man has already left.

890
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,360
Let it go.

891
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Let's go back.

892
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,470
I want to walk around a bit.

893
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
You can go back first.

894
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,150
But...

895
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,740
It's fine. Go back.

896
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,610
Alright then.

897
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,200
Take this umbrella.

898
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,730
The sky is overcast. I'll head back first.

899
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,060
Don't stay out too long.

900
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,880
Don't worry.

901
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,000
[Wu's Hoto Noodles]

902
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,800
I'm off now.

903
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:31,920
My books!

904
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,710
I'll pick them up.

905
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,150
Okay.

906
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,150
I'll pick them up.

907
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
Let's go take shelter from the rain.

908
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,230
Last night,

909
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,510
I had that dream again.

910
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,030
Uncle Jiu once told me

911
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,590
that people and things in dreams

912
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,800
are reflections

913
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,400
of what we've seen and experienced in reality.

914
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,260
They don't appear out of nowhere.

915
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,190
But I don't know why

916
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,090
I dream so much.

917
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,230
I always have strange dreams.

918
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:02,960
They feel so familiar,

919
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,080
yet so unfamiliar.

920
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,480
Like déjà vu,

921
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,540
but with no clear reason.

922
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,700
Like something from a past life.

923
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Mr. Man Ying.

924
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,650
Do you think there's really

925
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,990
Tea of Oblivion in this world?

926
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,690
Because I didn't drink enough of it,

927
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,690
I didn't forget

928
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,640
what happened in my previous life.

929
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,210
Have you really never seen me before?

930
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,870
Do we really not know each other?

931
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,370
Have you ever had

932
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,360
strange dreams

933
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,440
where someone

934
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,770
kept calling your name,

935
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,410
telling you to forget them?

936
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,110
Do you really have no impression

937
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:50,920
of me at all?

938
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:52,850
No, I don't.

939
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,720
Alright then.

940
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,300
Maybe I'm having hallucinations again.

941
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,110
Have I ever told you

942
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,800
that my family thinks

943
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,510
I'm mentally ill

944
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,470
and often hallucinate?

945
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,710
Since I was young,

946
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,780
I've been taking medicine

947
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,730
and seeing physicians, but nothing ever worked.

948
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:30,420
Maybe it's time for me

949
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,110
to take more pills.

950
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:34,160
I know a little about medicine.

951
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,960
It's not a big issue.

952
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,440
As long as you eat well,

953
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,920
sleep well,

954
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,240
and rest well,

955
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,000
you'll get better with time.

956
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,530
Don't take medicine recklessly.

957
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,690
Okay.

958
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,670
Sorry for the trouble.

959
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
I'll be going now.

960
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,470
It's still raining.

961
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,420
Take the umbrella.

962
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,870
♫Just sobered up after a dream, sighing for my life♫

963
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,880
♫In this desolate mortal world♫

964
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,910
♫The other side sees fantasies fading into obscurity♫

965
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,700
♫Is it a blessing or a calamity?♫

966
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,000
♫I'm all alone♫

967
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,900
♫Braving the snowstorm♫

968
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,580
♫Struck by sudden amnesia♫

969
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,700
♫Wait until the last peach blossom falls♫

970
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:46,280
♫Glance back with love for 10,000 years♫

971
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,070
Are you really not

972
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,530
coming back to Guangping?

973
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,010
It's a long journey.

974
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,360
Hard to travel back and forth.

975
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,590
♫If there were no regrets♫

976
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,230
I won't come back.

977
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,670
♫Why would the starlight still remain♫

978
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,680
♫To illuminate the world?♫

979
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,710
All right.

980
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,680
♫Coated in starlight, holding gleaming swords♫

981
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,930
♫Before daybreak♫

982
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,030
I wish you

983
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,030
a safe journey,

984
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,960
♫May you have no regrets♫

985
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,190
a smooth life,

986
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,550
♫Together, through seas and mountains♫

987
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,420
♫If all must fade away and be forgotten♫

988
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,980
freedom from fear and sorrow,

989
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:09,800
and joy that lasts.

990
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:12,040
♫I'd keep it all to myself♫

991
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,950
♫If we luck out♫

992
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:19,740
♫Let's reunite once again beyond the time♫

993
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,630
Thank you.

994
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,710
♫If there were no regrets♫

995
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,740
♫Why would the starlight still remain♫

996
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,350

♫May you have no regrets♫

1000
