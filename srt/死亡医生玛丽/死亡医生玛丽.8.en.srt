00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,990
This drama deals with the sensitive topic of euthanasia
and may be disturbing for some viewers.

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Mom.

3
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,370
I'm sorry, Mom.

4
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,630
Forgive me, Mom.

5
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,300
The patient was brought
to the emergency room this morning.

6
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,300
His condition seems to have stabilized
a bit now.

7
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,600
Thank you.

8
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,330
Are you Ye-na?

9
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
Yes.

10
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,370
Where did you go yesterday?

11
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,070
I went to see Mom.

12
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,870
Is she okay?

13
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,700
Same as always.

14
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
Except this time, a lot of weeds
had grown.

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,350
Everything was a mess.

16
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,730
Why does Mom keep making us feel bad
even after she's gone?

17
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,930
I miss Mom too.

18
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,600
Ye-na,

19
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,630
is it okay if I...

20
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,930
go to Mom first?

21
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,400
Our mother...

22
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,800
hasn't she been alone for too long?

23
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,600
She must be so lonely.

24
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,130
I'll go to her.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's make sure
you do your part too.

26
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,700
You can stay here.

27
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,010
Stay here for a long time.

28
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,820
A long, long time.

29
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,270
Then come join us,

30
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,500
okay?

31
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,500
I'm sorry,

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
I didn't know you wanted this so much.

33
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,100
I didn't know how hard you were trying.

34
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,470
Then just do what you want.

35
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,900
Go to Mom,

36
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,450
and take good care of her for me.

37
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,200
Understood?

38
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,170
I'll talk to Dr. Woo.

39
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,300
Thank you.

40
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,360
We received a consultation request.

41
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,570
We don't have medication right now,
so we can't accept it.

42
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,130
But the patient is very anxious...

43
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,800
Who's the client?

44
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,030
My brother.

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,960
{\an8}Although the body
was found in the lake,

48
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,900
{\an8}There's no water in the lungs.

49
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,670

{\an8}EPISODE 8

51
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,130
{\an8}As you can see, the victim was shot.

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,330
{\an8}Cause of death was exsanguination
from a gunshot wound to the head.

53
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,030
{\an8}In addition,
traces of gunpowder and gas were found.

54
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,570
{\an8}It appears the shot was fired at close range.

55
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,400
{\an8}Speculation is that he suffered cardiac arrest

56
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,700
before the car sank into the lake.

57
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,560
{\an8}Did the autopsy confirm the type of weapon?

58
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,600
{\an8}The weapon appears to be...

59
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,100
{\an8}A homemade gun.

60
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,100
All those things are things I really like.

61
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,270
All those things are things
that I really, really like.

62
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,470
As soon as I feel a little better, I want to eat.

63
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,600
But lately, I can't even taste them.

64
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,030
I wanted to shove all this in my mouth.

65
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,170
To feel the meat juices running down.

66
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,330
Chewing the meat.

67
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,170
If I'd known it would be like this,
I would've eaten more when I was healthy.

68
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,480
It's a shame.

69
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,800
I love all those things too.

70
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,570
Your taste in food

71
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,600
is exactly the same as mine.

72
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,270
But...

73
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,000
What motivated you to make me
such a generous offer?

74
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,460
I heard the medicine is not only hard to get,

75
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,730
but also quite difficult to handle.

76
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,900
You're my godfather.

77
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,800
Wasn't it you who gave my brother and me so much help?

78
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,470
I heard your trip to Switzerland was canceled.

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,070
It really broke my heart.

80
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,470
So I asked around.

81
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,200
But I didn't expect
to get the medicine so easily.

82
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,470
First, let's confirm
if it guarantees a painless death.

83
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,300
We can discuss the terms later.

84
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,130
How are we going to confirm that?

85
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,430
Do you have any friends...?

86
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,930
Who'd volunteer to die as a guinea pig?

87
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,850
Then, in the presence of my lawyer,

88
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,230
administer the medicine.

89
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,590
After he confirms my peaceful death,

90
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,450
the agreement will be fulfilled by my lawyer.

91
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,860
And the amount will be given to you,
on my behalf.

92
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,900
How much are you asking for this?

93
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,670
Now, in front of CEO Jin...

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,170
In a situation like this...

95
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,000
How much can you offer?

96
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,150
Any amount you want.

97
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,770
If you want my money, it's yours.

98
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,600
If you want my building, it's yours.

99
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,300
Make your decision.

100
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,530
Anyway, I'm already a dying man.

101
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,100
In fact, there's nothing left for me to hold onto.

102
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,060
All I want

103
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,800
is to die without pain.

104
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,760
That's enough for me.

105
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,430
- You're here.
- Was the trial good?

106
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
Just a moment.

107
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,530
Here's Dr. Woo.

108
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Thank you for coming.

109
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,330
Well, I'm sorry,

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
but we don't have the medication right now,

111
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,300
so I don't know when it can be administered.

112
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,250
Ah, okay.

113
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,330
Ye-na has already agreed as well,

114
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,330
and the doctor promised to do it.

115
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,390
I just have to wait a little longer and this pain will end.

116
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,549
Thinking like that makes me feel better.

117
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,430
Until then, Mr. Geon-soo...

118
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,600
If there's anything you want to do, do it.

119
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,060
Then...

120
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,000
while you're looking for the medication,

121
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,800
can I travel with Ye-na?

122
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,230
You want to travel?

123
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Yes.

124
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,380
I want to go to Gangwon-do to see the sea.

125
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,250
It might be difficult to get there, is that okay for you?

126
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,960
Ye-na, you're a skilled nurse. You'll take good care of him.

127
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,360
Before we go, let's visit Father Yang's hospital.

128
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,930
I'll prepare everything we need.

129
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Okay.

130
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Thank you.

131
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,590
- My little So-song looks so cute today.
- So-song, So-song.

132
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,010
- Are you going to have fun?
- Yes.

133
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

135
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,260
So-song, is there anything you want to do today?

136
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,600
Or any place you want to visit, just tell me.

137
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,900
And I will grant your wish.

138
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,060
To that place.

139
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,930
That... place?

140
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,900
Okay, let's go to that place.

141
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,200
Don't worry about things here.

142
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,060
Have a great trip with your brother.

143
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,910
I feel bad that you're so busy and I'm leaving alone like this.

144
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,100
I'll work even harder when I get back.

145
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,700
You're already doing so much for us.

146
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,160
We're very grateful to you.

147
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,160
We'll take care of everything here.

148
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,060
Enjoy your time with your brother
and come back happy.

149
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,400
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

150
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,930
Come with me to the medical supply store later.

151
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,660
The patients are running out of bandages and medicine.

152
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,010
It completely slipped my mind.

153
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,990
I'm as happy as if I'd seen the Lord himself.

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,860
I need to go in and check
what supplies we need.

155
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,600
Then we'll be off.

156
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,000
Go ahead and take the basket
and check the items.

157
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,810
Okay, take care.

as soon as I have the medication.

163
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, thank you.

164
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,930
We're leaving.

165
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,030
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

166
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,300
Is this where you wanted to come, So-song?

167
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,310
Yes.

168
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
So-song,

169
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,260
as soon as we sell everything,

170
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,460
we'll go home.

Two, right?

174
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,700
Enjoy.

175
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,530
Did you come to get the blanket, So-song?

176
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,050
Yes.

177
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,280
So you were waiting here
until Mom finished selling everything?

178
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Come on.

179
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,660
Shall we take the blanket?

180
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,230
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,140
Wow, you look so pretty.

183
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,990
Let's go.

184
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
Isn't the girl's mother working?

185
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,650
She left her here and hasn't come to pick her up
in a long time.

186
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,190
If she stays here,
I'm going to have to throw the cart away.

187
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,960
Besides, she still owes me money.

188
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,030
Well, some things happened...

189
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,830
I'll cover the costs.

190
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,700
It's 50,000 won a month, right?

191
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,680
It's 100,000 won a month.

192
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,410
The price went up.

193
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,450
It went up quite a bit.

194
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,060
Well, okay.

195
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,160
Please watch the cart for now.

196
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,530
- Okay.
- Yes.

197
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,280
So-song, play hide-and-seek
with your uncle for a bit.

198
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,710
- Okay?
- Okay.

199
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Watch your head.

200
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,950
Sir,
could you take her to the place I mentioned?

201
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,910
Sure, no problem.

202
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,150
So-song, you go first.

203
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,290
You really are a troublemaker, huh?

204
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,950
Makes me want to slap you.

205
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,550
Let's go.

206
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,280
Why didn't you bring the little one?

207
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,790
Wouldn't it be better to have her close?

208
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,510
There's a patient who needs to see Woo So-jeong.

209
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,550
She promised me before...

210
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,780
That to get the medicine, she'll do anything.

211
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,540
And I already gave her a dose.

212
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,490
What was the little girl's name?

213
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,830
She... her name is So-song.

214
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,860
Yes, whether it's So-song or whoever...

215
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,150
Do you think her mother's death was simple?

216
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,330
Woo So-jeong has gone crazy,
saying she wants to choose her own patients.

217
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,580
But that's ridiculous.

218
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,200
If she rejects my orders again, no,

219
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,250
if she dares to defy my orders again,

220
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,830
I won't be able to do anything more for her.

221
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,030
So, if you want to save your friend,

222
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,290
what do you think you should do?

223
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,860
Convince her, bring her here.

224
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,990
Yes, I...

225
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,280
No, no, wait.

226
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,440
Sir.

227
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,940
I can try to do that.

228
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,290
You?

229
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,010
Who are you trying to fool?

230
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,750
Are you a doctor, by any chance?

231
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,660
I'm discussing an important matter with the chairman.

232
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,310
Continue.

233
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Right, um...

234
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,010
Euthanasia...
I was the one who started this business first.

235
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,710
After my medical license was revoked.

236
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,930
When my hands were shaking so much
that I couldn't do plastic surgery anymore,

237
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,080
that's when I started doing this.

238
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,870
I can do that.

239
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,400
Can you really?

240
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,050
- Are you sure?
- I am.

241
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,290
But I need your help to get the police off my back.

242
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,710
I may not be like Woo So-jeong,
but nothing will be detected in the autopsy.

243
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,160
But you just need to hold back the police.

244
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,770
Knock, knock, knock. Hey.

245
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Little cheater.

246
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,560
Are you enjoying the sea?

247
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,700
Yes, it's nice.

248
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,700
Where do you want to go now?

249
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,250
What else do you want to do?

250
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,310
There's something special I really want to do.

251
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,010
What is it?

252
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,460
We're going to visit Dad.

253
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
I miss him.

254
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,240
You wanted to come all the way to Gangwon-do just to see him?

255
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,140
Dad's in a nursing home near here.

256
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,320
I know he's hiding from loan sharks.

257
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,060
He's been living there since last year.

258
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,140
We barely made it all the way here.

259
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,050
Do you really need to see him?

260
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,180
I just want to resolve everything I feel guilty about,

261
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,550
so I can leave in peace.

262
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,540
I know you're upset,

263
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
but come with me.

264
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,240
After all, it's the last chance, right?

265
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,440
From over there to here.

266
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,310
There, there.

267
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,840
Take them all.

268
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,010
That one, that one.

269
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,860
This one and that one, too.

270
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,030
Bring the leather shoes.

271
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,490
Pack all the leather shoes on the right.

272
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,700
Take that Thom Browne.

273
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,170
This is the doctor who will help him.

274
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,900
He used to be an excellent plastic surgeon.

275
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,580
Now he's a good Samaritan.

276
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,360
Like a gentle assassin.

277
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,030
His task is very simple:

278
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,970
Make sure Representative Jin rests in peace without pain.

279
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,220
He's also a patient who meets Dr. Woo's and your requirements.

280
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,490
Set the date as soon as the property

281
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,770
transfer documents are ready.

282
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Understood, sir.

283
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,190
I will deliver the documents only after

284
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,650
confirming Mr. Jin's peaceful departure.

285
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,900
If he dies in pain, the contract is canceled.

286
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,110
If he dies in agony,

287
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,860
the contract is canceled.

288
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,780
If he screams in pain during the process,

289
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,970
or even frowns after death,

290
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,160
the payment will definitely not be made.

291
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,360
And, of course, we won't be able to guarantee your safety.

292
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,180
Don't worry. I absolutely won't tolerate...

293
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,450
that happening.

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,050
Now you've decided to stay at the door, scaring my family?

295
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,780
Did you forget that I can report you for harassment?

296
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,150
We found Kim Si-hyun's body.

297
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,470
The prime suspect is missing.

298
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,740
Are there no more leads to find the criminal?

299
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,180
Is this what you wanted?

300
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,020
You only came to me

301
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,570
Because you shouldn't have any leads.

302
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,530
I want to find who killed Kim Si-hyun

303
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,280
because you could be the next target.

304
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,960
Can the police say that to such
an important suspect?

305
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,350
Do you want me to confess out of fear?

306
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,500
The children could be in danger, too.

307
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,830
And I'm not here to investigate anything.

308
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,030
How about...

309
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,070
if we go home?

310
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,080
Let's go see Dad.

311
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,040
I had to pay the bills
for the nursing home,

312
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,690
so I saw him occasionally.

313
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,600
I didn't want to take you there
and make you uncomfortable,

314
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,230
that's why I was against it.

315
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Thank you.

316
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,430
What are you doing?

317
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
They saw that the owner of Kim's car fled.

318
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,240
It's time to close this case.

319
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,460
Don't pretend you're working hard.

320
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,580
I know you contacted Interpol on purpose
to make a scene.

321
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,030
I'm going to close the case soon.

322
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,940
Where are my things?

323
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,500
I'll give them back to you as soon
as the case is closed.

324
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,030
I'm very busy.
I don't have time to waste.

325
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,550
Hey!

326
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,920
Bring me my things immediately.

327
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,870
I need them for tonight.

328
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
How much?

329
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,120
Detective Bu checked the scene.

330
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,540
If it's a large amount,
it could be difficult.

331
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,570
Besides, much of the evidence
has already been processed.

332
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,490
I had to work hard
to keep the subordinates quiet.

333
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,170
Very little is left.

334
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,990
You can use a similar powder to mask it,

335
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,840
just put the real substance
on top.

336
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,020
Anyway, the evidence analysis is already done.

337
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,560
It won't need additional confirmation.

338
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,710
If you don't solve this,
we'll not only lose our jobs.

339
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,420
We're all going to die.

340
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,470
Okay.

341
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,900
We're being led
by a gang of criminals...

342
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,870
We need to find
a solution quickly.

343
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,680
At this rate,
we'll soon be in danger too.

344
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,350
How are you?

345
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,690
Hey, you finally decided to come.

346
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,900
I've been here for so long,
and you only visit now.

347
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,440
Ye-na must have told you I was here.

348
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,700
I didn't tell him.

349
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,360
He's sick. I didn't want to worry him.

350
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,120
Always exaggerating...

351
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,180
Your brother's always saying he's sick.

352
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,550
He really is sick.

353
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,530
Seriously sick.

354
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,020
Why are you yelling?

355
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,280
You brat!

356
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,760
Did you come here to cause trouble?

357
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,220
I just need some money.

358
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,260
Why don't you take care of this yourself?

359
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,050
I'm not sick, I'm just hiding from loan sharks.

360
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,020
You damn ingrate.

361
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Ye-na...

362
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,410
It's okay, it's okay.

363
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,450
I'm sorry.

364
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,380
I'm not healthy enough to earn money,

365
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,170
and I also get help from Ye-na.

366
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,300
So I don't have money to help you.

367
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Dad...

369
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,500
What is it?

370
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
I'm about to die.

371
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,120
Since you were a kid, the doctors said you wouldn't live long,

372
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,400
but you've lived until now.

373
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,960
So stop talking nonsense!

374
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,360
I'm really going to die soon.

375
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,570
I probably won't make it past this month.

376
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,060
That's why I came to see you.

377
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Dad...

378
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,710
I...

379
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,260
I don't hate you.

380
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,310
You shouldn't.

381
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,990
After their mother passed away,

382
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,860
I raised you two alone. I endured so much suffering.

383
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,110
Thanks to me, you grew up and became adults,

384
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,240
so you can't be ungrateful.

385
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,960
I think you're very pathetic, Dad.

386
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,760
What?

387
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,710
I have a wish.

388
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,780
It's my last wish before I die.

389
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,240
You must promise me one thing.

390
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,610
What is it?

391
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,660
Please apologize...

392
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,440
to Ye-na.

393
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
What?

394
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,430
Are you asking me to apologize to this girl?

395
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Yes.

396
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,430
I don't hate you.

397
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,000
And you don't have to apologize to me,

398
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,740
but you must apologize to Ye-na.

399
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,940
Our Ye-na will have to live alone from now on.

400
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,240
She needs to forgive her father.

401
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,010
Only then will she be able to live with that strength.

402
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,200
Holding a grudge against someone

403
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,560
won't give her a good life.

404
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,010
So...

405
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,110
for Ye-na's sake,

406
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,210
even if everything's okay now,

407
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,410
please, apologize.

408
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,590
You two are crazy.

409
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,830
It's been a while since you've visited,
and you come empty-handed.

410
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,410
And now you're saying...?

411
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,090
- You little...!
- What's wrong?

412
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,490
Is he going to hit us again?

413
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,690
You brat!

414
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,990
Dad.

415
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,090
What are you looking at?

416
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,800
Oh, I'm sorry about yesterday.

417
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,260
I felt like someone was following me.

418
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,790
So I sent So-song home first.

419
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,090
Who was following you? Is it the chairman?

420
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,090
No, it was just my imagination.

421
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,950
Did something happen? Where's Ye-na?

422
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,790
We need to help her brother.

423
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,260
Ye-na agreed too.

424
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Really?

425
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,710
For Geon-soo, it's very lucky somehow, isn't it?

426
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,700
But the problem is that we don't have pentobarbital.

427
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,960
Is there any way to get it?

428
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,300
Let me try.

429
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,440
I have a feeling I can get it.

430
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840
You're not...

431
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,360
going to ask Mr. Koo, are you?

432
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,110
We have to hide this matter
about Geon-soo from Mr. Koo.

433
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,590
If he finds out, he'll charge Geon-soo a huge fee.

434
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,390
He'll make absurd demands again.

435
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,410
When can you get the medication?

436
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,390
Geon-soo's condition isn't good.

437
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,350
It should be within one or two weeks.

438
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,940
When I have the exact date,

439
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
I'll contact you immediately.

440
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,230
(Unknown number)

441
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,450
So-jeong, I'm getting a call.

442
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,940
I'll call you later.

443
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,010
Okay.

444
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,550
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.

445
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,010
Mr. Koo asked me to call you.

446
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,390
It'll be this Saturday.

447
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,980
Where should I go?

448
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,600
I'll send you the address.

449
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,310
Prepare well.

450
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,990
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,240
I probably made things complicated for you, didn't I?

452
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,390
Don't worry about it.

453
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
- Bro...
- Yeah.

454
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,090
Last time, Dad said

455
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,190
that the people who truly love me are my family.

456
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,360
It's not about blood ties.

457
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,190
So, look...

458
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,900
Gather those you really want to see and who deeply love you.

459
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,460
People who are like family to you,

460
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,660
and let's have a party.

461
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,640
Your band can perform.

462
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,760
And we can enjoy delicious food. It'll be great, right?

463
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,490
How about having a funeral before dying?

464
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,830
Sure, a living funeral sounds good.

465
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,090
I heard they also do this ceremony abroad. Let's do it.

466
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,410
I'll take care of the preparations.

467
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,490
Sounds good, right?

468
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,690
Yeah.

469
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,010
Don't worry about me.

470
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm going to live well.

471
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,390
Even without Dad's apology.

472
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,560
I've always had such a wonderful brother,
how could I not live well?

473
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,460
So don't worry about me.

474
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,860
Yeah, you'll definitely be okay.

475
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
And now...

476
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,490
- Time to hug Ye-na!
- Don't even think about it.

477
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,240
- How absurd.
- How clingy.

478
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,010
Are you planning to have a funeral and a show
on the day of his death?

479
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,810
Yes.

480
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,940
I know there might be a lot of trouble that day because of the people.

481
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,510
But I really want to do this for my brother.

482
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,810
He can't see his friends often because of his illness.

483
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,690
I want him to say goodbye and see everyone one last time.

484
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,780
Most of them are musicians.

485
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,240
They can gather to sing and perform on stage.

486
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,450
It'll be more like a celebration.

487
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,390
Everyone having fun and ending everything in a happy way.

488
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,900
We have plenty of time.

489
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,010
With proper preparation, everything should go well.

490
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,560
I hope you and your friends have fun.

491
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,890
When it's time to go, we'll help you.

492
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,160
We should receive the medication by then.

493
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,210
I'll bring the medication at 7 p.m. on Saturday.

494
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,490
Thank you.

495
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,730
I'm going to book a place nearby,

496
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,840
prepare some food, and the stage.

497
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,690
Let's have a joyful celebration together.

498
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,900
Since it's a farewell celebration,

499
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,700
we could prepare a spicy beef stew.

500
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,510
What do you think? It'll be great, right?

501
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,100
Spicy beef stew sounds a little sad,

502
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,440
but whatever you want to eat, I'll help you make it.

503
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,000
Don't worry about the preparations.

504
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,310
Geon-soo, you should focus on preparing for your presentation.

505
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,190
Thanks.

506
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,030
(Announcement)

507
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,870
(Rock band 'Rounders' performance)

508
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,670
I don't want to cry today.

509
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,700
I'll do my best to make sure my brother leaves happy.

510
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,250
Okay.

511
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,370
Kyung, take off your hat.

512
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,770
Don't take it off.

513
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,770
- Your friend is here.
- Who is it?

514
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,710
Hey, here comes the artist.

515
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,389
You guys come here.

516
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,260
If it wasn't a funeral,
you wouldn't even have come, would you?

517
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,300
Why do you say that?

518
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,540
Today we'll have a band performance.
Let's have fun.

519
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,909
Just enjoy.

520
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,400
Great, I'm going to replace the condolence money with this.

521
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,550
I drew your portrait.

522
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,250
It looks just like you.

523
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,460
You finally captured my beauty.

524
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,270
It's good to see you while I'm still alive.

525
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,850
Yes, it really is.

526
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,010
Is this Jin-suk?

527
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,260
Are you Jin-suk?

528
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,909
Hey, how long has it been since we last met?

529
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I brought a guitar too.

530
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,409
Are you going to sing for me?

531
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,820
Yes, I'm going to sing your favorite song.

532
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,310
Great, we're going to perform too.

533
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,040
Not just us. If any of you want to sing,

534
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,389
feel free to come up on stage.

535
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,620
I'm definitely hoping to hear several songs today, okay?

536
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,990
Awesome.

537
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
- Thanks, guys.
- See you later. You can sit anywhere.

538
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,670
- Okay.
- Go on, go on.

539
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Having a funeral before dying is wonderful.

540
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,970
Before departing,

541
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,800
being able to meet the people you miss,

542
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,510
and sharing a delicious meal together is amazing.

543
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,100
Everyone will be very grateful to see you one last time.

544
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Yes.

545
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,460
After I'm gone, the kind of funeral where people gather to cry,

546
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,970
won't be as good compared to this.

547
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,790
Here, for you.

548
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Your spicy beef stew.

549
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,190
Eating spicy beef stew at my own funeral...

550
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
Only I would think of that, right?

551
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,950
- Eat slowly.
- Yes.

552
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,470
- How is it?
- Very salty.

553
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Is it really salty?

554
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,150
It seems like it needs more water.

555
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,320
That's how I imagine the end should be.

556
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,770
It seems kind of pointless...

557
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,970
having to say goodbye to your loved ones...

558
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,500
in the midst of pain, losing consciousness from painkillers.

559
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,770
You're right.

560
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,300
Everyone has their own way of saying goodbye...

561
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,420
And dying in a hospital seems a bit miserable.

562
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,460
But I can't do that now.

563
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,600
It's too dangerous.

564
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,570
That crazy guy...

565
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,000
He could be watching us somewhere.

566
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,300
I know.

567
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't want to get involved with that guy either.

568
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Ye-na.

569
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,970
Your father is here.

570
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,620
Why is he here?

571
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,020
I needed to talk to you both.

572
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:43,950
I heard Geon-soo is dying, that he's about to pass away.

573
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,070
So, as your father,

574
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,870
I have to tell you... one last thing.

575
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,150
I'm sorry.

576
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,070
Back then,

577
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,450
I was also in a difficult situation.

578
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,600
I had to raise you alone.

579
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,120
It was exhausting.

580
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,990
Anyway, I'll leave it at that.

581
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
I'm sorry.

582
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,720
You should apologize to Ye-na.

583
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,300
I'm sorry.

584
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,430
I'm really sorry.

585
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,910
I'm so sorry.

586
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,620
Thank you, Dad.

587
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,230
Thank you, Dad. Thank you.

588
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,390
Thank you, Dad.

589
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,570
I'm sorry.

590
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,290
Thank you, Dad.

591
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,310
Wow.

592
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,720
That's a nice pile of money.

593
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,010
Wow, you're being a very good daughter.

594
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,420
Thank you.

595
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,810
Be careful.

596
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,020
The loan sharks might still be looking for him.

597
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,400
I'll take care of that myself.

598
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,830
But...

599
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,980
Is Geon-soo really going to die?

600
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,190
Yes.

601
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,570
Gosh, he's so young.

602
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,030
Who did he get his weakness from?

603
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
Please, go away.

604
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
By the way...

605
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,860
Ye-na.

606
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,740
I shouldn't be saying this, but after taking your money...

607
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,560
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,500
You once told me,

609
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,430
that what we should do

610
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,430
is let our loved ones

611
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,840
go without worries.

00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,570
- Be careful.
- Yes.

624
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,210
I'm on the street...

625
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,870
Tell me the location, I'll go right now.

626
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,420
Don't get nervous.

627
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,420
I'm going to use this opportunity to pay off the debt

628
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,530
that So-jeong owes Lee Yun-hee.

629
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,450
As soon as I'm done, I'll leave immediately.

630
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,260
I left in the middle of an event. If I don't get back quickly, it'll raise suspicion.

631
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,250
Starting today, we must act decisively.

632
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,370
And you know, right?

633
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,690
If this person suffers even a little bit, you, immediately...

634
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,960
Don't make any mistakes.

635
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,150
{\an8}(Contracting party personal information: Jin Yeom-soo)

636
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,060
{\an8}(Registered under the name: Jin Yeom-soo)

637
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,750
{\an8}(Registered owner: Gwang Asset Operations)

638
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,170
It can't be.

639
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,160
We personally verified it and brought it here.
How could it disappear?

640
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,490
I also thought it should be here,

641
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,080
so I asked the Narcotics Department.

642
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,920
Of the seven kilos confiscated,
the pentobarbital has been missing from the start.

643
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,030
Why wasn't it there?

644
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,000
What are you talking about? We confirmed those vials.

645
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,030
Seven kilos?

646
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,000
At first glance, there was a huge pile.
How could it only be seven kilos?

647
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,960
Two people were caught at customs.

648
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,140
What they were hiding was seven kilos.

649
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,220
But if what was transported by truck
was also recorded as seven kilos,

650
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,560
it just doesn't make sense.

651
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,680
Someone from the inside must've taken it.

652
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,450
They definitely took it from a blind spot.

653
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,330
Or it was taken during a security break.

654
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,400
Unbelievable.

655
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,700
The investigation isn't even over,
and they already took it?

656
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,110
Are they brave or crazy?

657
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,490
Probably both.

658
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,590
I don't know who it is,
but there must be supervision, right?

659
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,580
Should we report this to the captain?

660
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,590
No.

661
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,330
It's not yet clear who's involved in this.

662
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,470
The stuff taken from here must've been sold on the market.

663
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,110
We need to find them through known drug dealers.

664
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,900
Let's track them down later.

665
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,960
Even if I shove everything in my mouth like a madman,

666
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,090
I still can't taste anything.

667
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,270
I don't know if it's the illness or the medication,

668
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,190
but everything tastes bitter.

669
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,320
Did you say goodbye to your family already?

670
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,900
At this point,

671
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,950
my wife is probably arguing with my mother

672
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:50,140
about who gets the biggest share of the inheritance.

673
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,660
They don't know I'm dying.

674
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,360
No one's going to be heartbroken over me.

675
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,860
You can do it without worrying.

676
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,970
Woo So-jeong's vehicle location has been confirmed.

677
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:35,720
Where?

678
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,370
They say it's on the outskirts of Ocheon.

679
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,220
It's an area with many houses and hotels.

680
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,330
Send me the location.

681
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,340
Yes.

682
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,860
What the hell.

683
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,910
I'm contacting her family immediately.

684
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,720
I'm leaving now.

685
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,950
Wait.

686
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,560
That's just the beginning. You'll have to follow my instructions.

687
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,540
And don't do useless things.

688
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,740
Choi Dae-hyun,

689
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,650
keep a cool head, okay?

690
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,460
Sure.

691
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,400
Fix everything.

692
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,420
Mr. Jin,

693
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,450
you should leave in peace,

694
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,440
and carrying all this would be too heavy.

695
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,680
And now,

696
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,320
here's today's main act

697
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,850
who's also the lead vocalist of 'Rounders.'

698
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,280
Our beloved

699
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,750
Choi Geon-soo, please come up on stage and sing.

700
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,380
Thank you all for waiting for me.

701
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,100
Yes.

702
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,450
Today...

703
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,070
I'm truly grateful for everyone's company.

704
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,930
The song I'm about to sing

705
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,560
is one that I adore.

706
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,880
And as our final farewell,

707
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,160
I think it's very fitting.

708
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,060
Today...

709
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,700
I feel so blessed by everyone's presence.

710
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,470
I hope everyone can be happy.

711
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,210
I hope that all of us,

712
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,210
in the distant future,

713
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,660
can be in a wonderful place

714
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,790
and meet again.

715
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,500
I'm just gonna take this off.

716
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,290
Okay, okay.

717
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,540
That feels good.

Of course.

Much later.

preparing for death,

755
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,610
because you know winter will always come.

756
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,200
As for me,

757
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,220

I got Dad's apology.

762
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,880

Ye-na,

764
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,930
you must live well.

765
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
I'm so sleepy.

766
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,860
So sleepy.

767
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,840

773

Everyone's recording them,
so just say whatever you want.

774
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,940
Recording.

775
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,260
Choi Ye-na,

776
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,030
What?

777
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
I'll record alone.

778
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,410
Why?

779
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,900
I can be more relaxed alone.

780
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:05,970
I'm shy, just go already.

781
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,930
But I can't leave you alone.

782
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,860
Come on, hurry.

783
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,320
Let's go.

784
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,330
Hurry.

785
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,270
Quick, quick.

786
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,760
- I'm going to play, I'm going to play.
- I'm going to watch you record.

787
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Go further away.

788
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,840
Choi Ye-na.

789
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,900
Well...

790
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,660
I'm really going to say

791
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,300
that I don't know what to say.

792
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,450
You...

793
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,480
were born on the same day as me,
at the same time.

794
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,940
My twin.

795
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,990
That's why...

796
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,400
since we were little...

797
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,040
even before I said it out loud,

798
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,290
you already knew what I was thinking.

799
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,450
You know it now too, right?

800
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
Right?

801
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,440
Ye-na.

802
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,780
Me, your brother...

803
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,690
I haven't been well since I was a kid.

804
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,660
I haven't done much for you. I'm sorry.

805
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,130
Please, forgive me.

806
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,770
You are...

807
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,620
my everything in the world.

808
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,580
Ye-na,

809
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,470
as always,

810
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,700
you must be strong

811
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:35,940
and live confidently.

812
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,530
I'll be in heaven with Mom,

813
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,770
watching over you.

814
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,080
Okay?

815
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,250
I love you.

816
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,970
Thank you,

817
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,680

821
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,390
{\an8}I'd like to give you some advice.

822
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,090
{\an8}This time, I can offer you more money.

823
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,350
{\an8}Please, let me die. I beg you.

824
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,560
{\an8}Please, release me from this pain.

825
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,380
{\an8}Why are you doing this?

826
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,090
{\an8}If you want to kill someone, just kill me.

827
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,060
{\an8}I don't know how I could kill you.

828
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,340
{\an8}You're too good to die.

829
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,980
{\an8}I want to talk to the police.

830
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,450
{\an8}Do you know Jin Yeom-soo?

831
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,320
{\an8}Where were you when Jin Yeom-soo died?

832
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,420
{\an8}Choi Dae-hyun, you told him, didn't you?

833
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,090
{\an8}Things turned out this way

834
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,820
{\an8}because you chose to deceive me.
