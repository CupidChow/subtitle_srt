1
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,919
This drama deals with the sensitive
subject of euthanasia

2
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,990
and may be disturbing
for some viewers.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,307
My sister, who's very close to me,
once performed in North Korea.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,640
I heard that instead of saying
'Cheers!' when toasting,

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,130
they say 'A toast!'

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,660
Let's do the same: 'A toast!'

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,860
Aren't you going to drink?

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,620
Anyway,

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,020
when I saw you practicing euthanasia,

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,520
I really thought you were amazing
at that moment.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
Very sexy.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,760
Want to see it again?

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,960
Give me the pentobarbital,
and I'll show you.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,090
This?

15
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,860
Did you bring what I asked for?

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,690
Where's Gu Gwang-chul?

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,220
Today's your lucky day.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,377
Hey, hit harder.

19
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,460
That's it.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Woo So-jeong!

21
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
Hey!

22
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,730
There's an antidote in the bag.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,590
Here? Wait, wait.

24
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,720
Where exactly?

25
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,860
Hey, this...

26
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,710
Hey.

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,820
Was this your plan?

28
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,720
Hey, hey, wait. Stop it.

29
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,837
An electronic ankle bracelet?

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,937
You're really a damn bastard.

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Damn it.

32
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,720
I'm going to grant your wish.

33
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,720
Mr. Park Min-sung.

34
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,390
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Ms. Bae Mi-young.

35
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,307
You have the right to remain silent

36
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,870
and you can call a lawyer.

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,137
We got you, didn't we?

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,220
What is this?

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,720
Nobody move!

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Arrest everyone.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,940
Wake up, Woo So-jeong!

42
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,660
MARY <font color="#ff0000">KILLS</font> PEOPLE

43
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,259
(ICU, 5 hours earlier)

44
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:49,416
Please...

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,161
EPISODE 11

46
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,120
{\an8}Kill me.

47
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,820
{\an8}Does she really want that?

48
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,890
{\an8}When you...

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,930
{\an8}said you wanted me to kill her
a few moments ago,

50
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,212
{\an8}I felt like I was back to the moment
when your husband

51
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:11,120
{\an8}She recognized me and
begged me because of it.

52
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,370
{\an8}I felt a mix of emotions.

53
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,870
{\an8}Back then,
even though you wanted to die...

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,980
{\an8}there was still some hesitation.

55
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,620
{\an8}As a doctor...

56
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,090
{\an8}did you notice my internal conflict?

57
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
{\an8}Yes.

58
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,120
{\an8}What happened that made you sure?

59
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,270
{\an8}In the ambulance,
on the way to the hospital...

60
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
{\an8}The paramedics...

61
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,300
said it was a miracle I wasn't dead.

62
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,510
They said I survived
because I hit a tree mid-fall.

63
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,920
They said being alive was a blessing.

64
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,160
They...

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,820
kept repeating it to me
while I was confused.

66
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,320
They told me to keep living.

67
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,560
To live with intention.

68
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,260
Hearing them...

69
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,930
I remembered my husband.

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,990
The doctor said...

71
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,230
that he's coming here today.

72
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,080
I want you to do something for me.

73
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Tell me.

74
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,930
What do you want me to do for you?

75
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,590
Just...

76
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,190
enjoy the sunlight on a beautiful day,

77
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,150
listen to the rain when it falls.

78
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,620
Do that...

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,520
and feel the little things a little more.

80
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,290
Then I'll be waiting...

81
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,991
so that later...

82
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,560
you can come and stay with me.

83
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,620
Life isn't just about
enjoying the big things.

84
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
That's why...

85
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,890
I want you to...

86
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,790
keep...

87
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,210
trying to live.

88
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,020
That man...

89
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,190
really hoped that I would keep living.

90
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,890
So I kept that in my head.

91
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
I...

92
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,420
what should I do now?

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,920
If it moved you,
it means you should keep living.

94
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,780
Even though my body has broken down,

95
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,190
and I don't know how
much longer I can hold on,

96
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,190
I...

97
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,720
should keep living, right?

98
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,290
Of course.

99
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,270
I'm certain your husband
will be supporting you.

100
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,707
Ye-na, where are you? I have an emergency.

101
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,207
Choi Dae-hyun and I saw the news.

102
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,877
Is it true that Park
Tae-hyung and his wife died?

103
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,420
Bae Mi-young is still alive,

104
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,837
but she's in very critical condition.

105
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,860
Someone is trying to kill her.

106
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,577
I'd like to ask you to look after her.

107
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,677
Yes, of course.

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
Where should I go?

109
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,040
Woo So-jeong, you can't escape.

110
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,710
Please, give me a little more time.

111
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,870
If you swear to never again

112
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,560
assist any patient with euthanasia,

113
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,750
I'll help you.

114
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,620
Bae Mi-young is still alive.

115
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,650
Wasn't she declared dead?

116
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,060
There was a mix-up of names
when she was admitted to the hospital.

117
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,560
She's in the ICU now.

118
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,877
If word gets out that she's alive,
someone might hurt her. Protect her.

119
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,537
And exactly who should we be wary of?

120
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Tell me.

121
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,720
If word gets out that
Bae Mi-young is still alive,

122
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,270
Gu Gwang-chul and Park Min-sung,
who are worried about her whereabouts,

123
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,990
will come to hurt her.

124
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,980
I want to save her. Please, help me.

125
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,830
Okay, about Ms. Bae Mi-young,

126
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,560
Park Min-sung might end
up coming to the hospital.

127
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,200
But the main problem is CEO Gu.

128
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,980
To prevent him from escaping,

129
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,410
we must catch him making a drug delivery.

130
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,450
I have a way to make Gu Gwang-chul...

131
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,860
give me the pentobarbital.

132
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,260
This is the video of Choi
Kang-yoon during the euthanasia.

133
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,307
If I say I want to leave this with him,

134
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,700
Gu Gwang-chul must
believe we're on the same side.

135
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,330
Is there anyone else in the video?
Like you or Choi Dae-hyun?

136
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,050
Only the patient.

137
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
That's enough.

138
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,990
I need more medicine.

139
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,790
Bae Mi-young is still alive.

140
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
I'm coming to see you now.

141
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,237
Where is Bae Mi-young?

142
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Wait a bit.

143
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,130
Let's meet first, and then we'll
talk about how to deal with her.

144
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,120
Where should I go?

145
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Nurse.

146
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,977
Why are you here at this hour?

147
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,907
Dr.
Woo asked me to take care of something,

149
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,660
but I don't think I can do it alone.

150
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,700
Please, help me.

151
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Did Dr. Woo ask you to do this?

152
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,190
Yes.

153
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Ji-hoon!

154
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,637
Is Bae Mi-young really still alive?

155
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,400
Yes, but...

156
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,890
Park Min Seong or someone
else might come to kill her.

157
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,777
You have to protect Ms. Bae
and arrest that guy.

158
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,107
Me? Alone?

159
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,340
Seriously?

160
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,390
Yes.

161
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,360
Woo So-jeong is here.

162
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,177
Deal with your aunt yourself.
She already has one foot in the grave.

163
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,040
You can handle that alone, right?

164
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,790
I'm hanging up.

165
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,220
Is it cold outside? How about some cognac?

166
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,957
To prove the clients' consent

167
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,950
to undergo euthanasia,
I've been recording videos.

168
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,860
You have to be sure, right?

169
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,290
That's very like you.

170
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,130
Let me see...

171
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,090
<i>I'm Choi Kang-yoon.</i>

172
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,590
<i>I'm going to end my life now.</i>

173
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,600
<i>This whole process is my own choice.</i>

174
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,230
<i>I feel very happy</i>

175
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,250
<i>and satisfied at this moment.</i>

176
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,090
You know this could become your guarantee,

177
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,337
or it could become evidence
of your crime, right?

178
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,400
They might find out about other
euthanasias they don't know about yet.

179
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,590
Although I'm not sure if
it would be valid in court...

180
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,520
but the patients' families

181
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:30,707
always want to understand
the feelings of the deceased.

182
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,270
I hope it won't be necessary
to use these videos.

183
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,230
Are you giving me...

184
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,920
something as important as this?

185
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,030
It's proof that I trust you.

186
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
I'll leave you responsible
for keeping all these videos.

187
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,750
But, why...

188
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,830
did you suddenly change
your mind about us?

189
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,340
The situation is out of control...

190
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,180
and everything is becoming very dangerous.

191
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,697
If Bae Mi-young wakes up soon

192
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,850
and tells the police the truth,

193
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,780
it will be difficult to
predict the magnitude

194
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,080
that things will take.

195
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,150
A lot has happened during this time,

196
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,710
and I'm very tired.

197
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,000
That's why I need a
partner to work with me.

198
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,567
What about Choi Dae-hyun?

199
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,490
He already turned
himself in to the police.

200
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,110
I feel insecure and I can't
keep working with him like this.

201
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,950
I need someone to help me
get the medication

202
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,210
and protect me from the police.

203
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,650
What you said...

204
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,220
I understand and it makes sense,
but I don't know.

205
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,490
The proposal is good, but...

206
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,900
I strangely feel a little overwhelmed.

207
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,600
Even though I don't
want to face reality...

208
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,470
I think you're the only one
who can protect me.

209
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,200
Of course, I... don't.

210
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,673
Here's someone who can protect you.

211
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,650
But the choice is yours.

212
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,470
I don't want to pressure you.

213
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Woo So-jeong...

214
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,110
That's it!

215
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,400
I'm glad you came
to surrender to me.

216
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,700
Welcome to my world!

217
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,690
Woo So-jeong!

218
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,210
Hey!

219
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,570
There's an antidote in my bag.

220
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,490
Here? Wait, wait.

221
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,930
Where is it?

222
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,330
Tell me exactly where it is!

223
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,420
It's this...

224
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,220
Hey, was this your plan?

225
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,470
How cute, you're so cute.

226
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,807
I really want to bite your neck
and give you lots of bites.

227
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,080
Hey, seriously!

228
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,790
You think you can do this to me,
after I promised to protect you?

229
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,137
Woo So-jeong!

230
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,640
Woo So-jeong, get up!

231
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,127
Woo So-jeong!

232
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,910
Wake up, Woo So-jeong!

233
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,430
Woo So-jeong.

234
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,930
Are you okay?

235
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Woo So-jeong!

236
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,210
Wake up!

237
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,320
(Bunseong Police Department,
Regional Investigation Unit)

238
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
The serial numbers match.

239
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,340
We checked. It's the same pentobarbital
from the evidence locker.

240
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,130
What is this?

241
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,980
Hey, isn't this how we package
evidence for storage?

242
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,890
It even has the evidence number.

243
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,250
Do you have proof that I was the one
who diverted the evidence

244
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,470
and smuggled it?

245
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,647
As soon as you blocked
the security footage,

246
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,190
the drugs disappeared.

247
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,750
It must be just a coincidence.

248
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,376
They didn't disappear then,
they were just reported missing.

249
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,020
Am I wrong?

250
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,930
It happens.

251
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Okay.

252
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,320
You know him, don't you?

253
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,650
No, I don't know him.

254
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:00,583
He already confessed everything
and said that the diverted drugs

255
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,040
were traded with you.

256
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,020
It's all over.

257
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,800
So, tell us.

258
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,220
Who ordered you to do this?

259
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
This gang of bastards...

260
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,810
They've got a lot of nerve
barging in here like this.

261
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,870
In Gu Gwang-chul's office,

262
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,423
we found all the money
he received from you all this time.

263
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,550
We already have all the evidence.

264
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,490
(Arrest warrant)

265
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,687
(Bunseong Police, Captain Ahn)

266
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,770
Ahn Tae-sung.

267
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,940
Luxury goods, car transactions,
and golf club connections.

268
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,320
We finally found the connection
between Gu Gwang-chul

269
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,770
and Captain Ahn.

270
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,560
My relationship with him
was to get information.

271
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,477
While the young officers
work hard to arrest criminals,

272
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,630
the captain is too busy
making connections, right?

273
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,337
I didn't know Gu Gwang-chul
was involved in crimes!

274
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,820
Sir, that's enough.

275
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,367
The head of the Drug Division
has already confessed everything.

276
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,910
He said he acted under your orders
to do business with Gu Gwang-chul.

277
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,720
Save your apologies for
the formal investigation.

278
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,020
I refuse to answer.

279
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,620
This is unbelievable.

280
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,210
Mr. Park Min-sung...

281
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,580
you were arrested by me, red-handed.

282
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,768
You were still the lawyer
for the Gu Gwang-cheol case,

283
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:43,800
the one responsible for
Jin Yeom-soo's death.

284
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,420
Do you think refusing
to talk will solve things?

285
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,500
I refuse to answer.

286
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,590
I'll say everything in court.

287
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,380
Aunt, are you okay?

288
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,680
Why are there police
officers guarding your room?

289
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,870
Didn't you suddenly faint while working?

290
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,470
I said that on purpose because
I was afraid you'd get scared.

291
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,410
Actually, I'm facing some legal issues.

292
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,830
After I recover,

293
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,900
I might have to go
through an investigation.

294
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
What's going on?

295
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,310
There's a type of death called euthanasia.

296
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:40,950
And I think patients who
suffer a lot need euthanasia.

297
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,840
That's why I've been
doing this kind of work lately.

298
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,760
But something happened
during this process.

299
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,980
Is it serious?

300
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,100
If it's investigated,
I could end up in jail.

301
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,440
But that was a choice I made.

302
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,580
Even if punishment awaits me,
I have to accept it.

303
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,470
However,
I'm worried about you and Chae-yoon.

304
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,250
Because of my principles,

305
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,150
you two might end up
facing criticism from others.

306
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,870
And you might also end up
taking care of Chae-yoon for me.

307
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,728
I'll ask Father Yang for help,
but probably...

308
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,500
it'll still be very hard.

309
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,830
I'm so sorry.

310
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,780
I've always had many secrets

311
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,280
and I didn't explain them to you properly.
I imagine you're upset.

312
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,350
But I couldn't tell you that secret.

313
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,600
If you believe that's the
treatment the patients need,

314
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,590
I understand.

315
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,060
I know you're a good doctor.

316
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,500
No matter what others say,

317
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,560
I truly believe you don't
have bad intentions.

318
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Thank you.

319
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,480
How many are there in total?

320
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,060
I've already seen the other tapes.

321
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,860
They're all recorded.

322
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,880
They're evidence to prove
the client chose euthanasia.

323
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,440
<i>I, Choi Kang-yoon,</i>

324
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
<i>am going to end my life now.</i>

325
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,337
These tapes were in Gu Gwang-chul's house.

326
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,667
Which means all the cases were led by him.

327
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,777
For Woo So-jeong and Choi Dae-hyun,

328
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,240
this is proof of their crimes.

329
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,440
Although they may be
evidence of the crimes,

330
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,330
the videos prove that
the clients did it voluntarily.

331
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,220
So they can also justify euthanasia.

332
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,496
In court, this could reduce the sentence.

333
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,520
They were probably used for blackmail.

334
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,476
Gu Gwang-chul used pentobarbital
to try to kill Woo So-jeong,

335
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,960
he even pointed a gun at her.

336
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,047
If you had been late to save Woo So-jeong,

337
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,640
she would have died.

338
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Hey, Do-gun.

339
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,227
Call the hospital and check if
Woo So-jeong has recovered.

340
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,367
Interrogate her if it's possible.

341
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,450
Okay.

342
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,850
I also found the video of
Assemblyman Baek's son.

343
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,367
As soon as the investigation
progresses further,

344
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,150
we'll take this to him.

345
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,660
He doesn't know that Gu Gwang-chul

346
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,170
killed his son.

347
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Yes.

348
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,750
That's why he was
protecting Gu Gwang-chul too.

349
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,670
Exactly.

350
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,397
Judging by Mr. Baek's request to us,

351
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,017
He probably doesn't know anything.

352
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,477
Once he knows the whole truth,

353
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,060
it'll be a shock.

354
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,550
Chief,
it's time to interrogate Choi Dae-hyun.

355
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,280
I'm on my way.

356
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,127
Since Kim Si-hyun's death,

357
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:11,140
Gu Gwang-chul has been
leading the euthanasia procedures.

358
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,627
So, you and Woo So-jeong
were being threatened by him

359
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,340
to perform the procedure?
Is that what you're saying?

360
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,680
No, Gu Gwang-chul
forced me to do it all alone.

361
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,430
What...

362
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,040
You mean all of this...

363
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,217
You did it all alone?

364
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,210
I owed Gu Gwang-chul
from when I was using drugs.

365
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,700
That's how he forced me...

366
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,470
to perform euthanasia on the patients.

367
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,010
Here's the proof that I
did these things alone.

368
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,690
In the patient video you have...

369
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,740
only the client appears, and no one else.

370
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,877
But in this audio file,

371
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,400
there's my voice and the
voices of those who were present.

372
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,600
The whole situation at that
moment is recorded there.

373
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:03,545
Check it, and you'll see.

374
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:06,336
Woo So-jeong had nothing to do with this.

375
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,620
Let's go.

376
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,150
Like you said yourself, it's not a video,
it's an audio recording.

377
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,427
Whenever Gu Gwang-chul
performed euthanasia,

378
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,410
he asked the clients to record
videos documenting their consent.

379
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,367
Wasn't it like that?

380
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,190
Yes, but the client that day,
Jin Yeom-soo, didn't agree.

381
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,810
I secretly recorded it myself.

382
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,410
<i>I don't know if it's the
illness or the medication...</i>

383
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,290
<i>but everything tastes bitter.</i>

384
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,240
<i>Have you said goodbye to your family yet?</i>

385
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,160
<i>By now,</i>

386
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,150
<i>my wife is probably arguing with my mother</i>

387
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:52,810
<i>about who gets the biggest
share of the inheritance.</i>

388
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,257
Woo So-jeong...

389
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,740
only advised me to turn myself in.

390
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,840
If she's guilty of anything,

391
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,190
- it's only for not reporting me.
- Choi Dae-hyun.

392
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,857
You helped Gu Gwang-chul many times.

393
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,660
It'll be hard to consider
this forced assistance.

394
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,707
Gu Gwang-chul has a gun!

395
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,077
It's probably an illegal gun,
but he joked that he'd shoot me.

396
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,307
That's why I couldn't refuse his requests.

397
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,390
For God's sake.

398
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,510
If you admit you did all this alone,

399
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,757
your sentence could be much longer.

400
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,640
Have at least a little common sense!

401
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,710
Let's take a break.

402
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,890
Yes, that's for the best.

403
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,060
Ban Ji-hoon, please, help me.

404
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,010
I'll take full responsibility
for everything.

405
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,777
Woo So-jeong won't agree to that.

406
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,710
Yes, I know.

407
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,877
But the truth is,
So-jeong has to raise her nephews.

408
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
And I've already been involved with drugs.

409
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,490
I don't have a good record anymore.

410
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,110
Please, let me take care of this.

411
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,390
Ever since I went to see Gu
Gwang-chul at that abandoned factory,

412
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,660
I've been preparing for this.

413
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,510
I beg you.

414
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,110
Before they take you in for questioning,

415
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,940
Woo So-jeong,
there's something you should know.

416
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,690
Tell me.

417
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,790
I'm ready for anything.

418
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,110
Choi Dae-hyun...

419
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,490
confessed that he did all of this alone.

420
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,060
That can't be.

421
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Things got out of control.
He can't take all the blame.

422
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,060
He's prepared to use the Jin
Yeom-soo case to support his story.

423
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,690
He even prepared
evidence that he acted alone.

424
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,227
When they interrogate me tomorrow,

425
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,864
I'll confess everything
and correct all the mistakes.

426
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:00,960
Park Min-sung died in prison today.

427
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,760
They said it was an
incident between prisoners.

428
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,590
But we can't help but be suspicious.

429
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,560
No matter how it seems right now,

430
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,760
there must be someone we
missed giving orders out there.

431
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,210
If you're also arrested in this situation,

432
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,610
it will be very dangerous.

433
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,960
For the children too.

434
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,227
Even so,
I can't run from my responsibilities.

435
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,610
Wait until everything is really safe.

436
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,140
At that moment,
confess and take responsibility.

437
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,310
Consider this as
helping the investigation.

438
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,860
This isn't a choice that many people have.

439
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,110
The doctor has a great friend.

440
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,250
Choi Dae-hyun even brought evidence,

441
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,910
proving that he did all of this alone.

442
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,810
Woo So-jeong, to protect Bae Mi-young,

443
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,490
you contacted Detective
Ban to ask for help.

444
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,777
And you even helped us with Gu Gwang-chul.

445
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,010
I acknowledge all of that,

446
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,510
but you're still a highly
suspicious person.

447
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,610
I have no intention of
evading responsibility.

448
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,160
You know they don't have
any evidence against you.

449
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,110
That's why you're standing your ground,
right?

450
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,660
Okay.

451
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,339
Gu Gwang-chul,
Ahn Tae Sung, and Choi Dae-hyun.

452
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,240
The investigation must conclude
with them as the culprits.

453
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,690
But please, be careful...

454
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,440
We'll keep an eye on you.

455
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,540
You can end it now.

456
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,710
Ah, yes.

457
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,560
Congratulations on the hard work.

458
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,400
<i>Now, regarding the Bunseong
pentobarbital murder case,</i>

459
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,306
we will give the investigation report

460
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,484
on the prime suspect.

461
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,127
We noted that the use of pentobarbital...

462
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,427
intensified the severity
of the murder case.

463
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,160
A large-scale search has been
conducted from the beginning.

464
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,057
And during our investigation
into the smuggling of pentobarbital,

465
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,010
the person receiving high amounts
was suspect A in this case.

466
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,560
We received a report from the scene
and went to the location in Gangnam.

467
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,750
<i>The police announced that A was passing
internal information to the deceased K,</i>

468
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,527
<i>who was also accused of selling drugs.</i>

469
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,400
<i>These drugs were being held as evidence.</i>

470
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,390
<i>This suspect was found to be
Police Captain Ahn.</i>

471
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,960
<i>The head of the Drug Division,
Officer Kim, was also arrested.</i>

472
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,890
How are you?

473
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm watching the sunlight
coming through the window.

474
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,090
Even in winter,

475
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,210
the sunlight is warm.

476
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,590
I'm so grateful to you.

477
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,610
Because you stopped me then,

478
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,490
today I can appreciate
such beautiful sunlight.

479
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,610
You made the right decision.

480
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,290
Dr. Woo...

481
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,790
I think this is the most

482
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,890
painful and difficult time of my life.

483
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,836
But my will to live
is even stronger.

484
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,141
It's strange, isn't it?

485
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,843
Not at all.

486
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,539
If you feel that way,
you have to keep living.

487
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,660
I know the future treatments
will be painful,

488
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,190
but I really want to live.

489
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,240
Don't worry.

490
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,040
The entire medical team
will do their best.

491
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,656
Every day I live,

492
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,499
feels like a gift from my husband.

493
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,870
Today, the social worker
contacted me.

494
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,847
According to regulations,

495
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,140
So-song has to be sent
to daycare.

496
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,043
That's right.

497
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,290
I heard that Gu Gwang-chul,

498
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,590
that devilish person, is dead.

499
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,840
So is it all over now?

500
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,590
Or will it be...?

501
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,990
Today, I was with someone
who chose to jump off a building.

502
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,706
He spent his whole life wishing for death.

503
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,260
But in his most painful
and difficult moments,

504
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,590
he suddenly wanted to live again.

505
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,270
I think the desire to live...

506
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,120
can arise in an instant.

507
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,370
In some unexpected way.

508
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,770
Do you regret what you've done so far?

509
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,070
Having the strength to keep living...

510
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,670
is really something to
be grateful and happy for.

511
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,920
But I feel so confused.

512
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,990
Could it be that I was wrong before?

513
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,790
Well,

514
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,303
you probably thought that
for patients who are suffering,

515
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:55,420
death could become a form of peace.

516
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,420
But no one knows the right answer, really.

517
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,420
Isn't there a proverb about that?

518
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,298
'Just as when humans are born

519
00:36:03,382 --> 00:36:05,890
and use all their strength to
come out of their mother's womb,'

520
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,640
we also fight to live until
the end in the face of death.'

521
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,070
What kind of death
would be the right choice?

522
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,220
Should it be something we can choose?

523
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,590
No one knows.

524
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,657
We can only ask questions.

525
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,870
And then ask even more questions.

526
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,470
Regarding So-song's situation,
I'll tell you what I think:

527
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,140
Dr. Woo...

528
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,127
I hope you can let go of the idea

529
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,470
that you have an obligation
to make So-song happy.

530
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,090
You don't have to
feel responsible for her.

531
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,420
There's an unexpected
warmth in this world...

532
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,070
and So-song is a smart girl.

533
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,670
No matter where, she'll grow up healthy.

534
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,837
Of course...

535
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,070
we have to keep supporting
and encouraging her.

536
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,790
That idea I have of being responsible for
everything, it's very arrogant, isn't it?

537
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,970
Not at all.

538
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,290
Worrying about someone

539
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,620
and wanting to take care of others,

540
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,420
is what we call love.

541
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,640
Maybe she sees herself as a cold person,

542
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,120
but I don't see her that way.

543
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,970
She's warm and caring.

544
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,170
I resigned from the hospital today.

545
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,120
Please, I'm asking you to let
me work in your hospital, Father.

546
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,620
Even if I can't be forgiven, it's okay.

547
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,490
Just let me work here.

548
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,170
So-song.

549
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,470
From now on, you'll have to live here.

550
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,570
That's what the social worker demanded.

551
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,430
I'll be in the hospital
next door with the Father,

552
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,920
and I'll go there every day for work.

553
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,480
So,

554
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,480
we can meet anytime.

555
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,760
I'll come see you often with my nephews.

556
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Okay.

557
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,540
No, even better.

558
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,830
I'll come see you every day.

559
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,320
It's a video your son left behind.

560
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,040
I think you should see it.

561
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,820
<i>I, Baek Hyun-seong,</i>

562
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,840
<i>am going to end my life.</i>

563
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,440
<i>This whole process is of my own choosing.</i>

564
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,630
<i>At this moment,</i>

565
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,160
<i>I feel happy and content.</i>

566
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,610
<i>Can I talk a little more?</i>

567
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,580
<i>If this video gets out,</i>

568
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,480
<i>my family might end up seeing it, right?</i>

569
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,370
<i>There's something I want to tell you:</i>

570
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,910
<i>No matter how hard you tried,</i>

571
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,020
<i>I was going to end up like this anyway.</i>

572
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,790
<i>So forget about the clinical trials.</i>

573
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,200
<i>Forget about the other treatments.</i>

574
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,820
<i>And also the last year
the doctor promised me.</i>

575
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,340
<i>Dad.</i>

576
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,490
<i>I know it'll be hard for you to accept,</i>

577
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,220
<i>but I really chose this willingly.</i>

578
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
<i>You've already done so much for me.</i>

579
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,320
- I'm sorry.
<i>- You two...</i>

580
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,190
<i>did your best for me, I know.</i>

581
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,656
I'm so sorry you had
to go through this alone.

582
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,632
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

583
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,390
<i>So please, accept this with an open heart.</i>

584
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,010
<i>Please remember that.</i>

585
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,620
<i>I really love you both.</i>

586
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,710
Jae-yeon.

587
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,467
I heard the deadline to report the bullying
passed, and you didn't want to pursue it.

588
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,230
What happened?

589
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,490
Did you know that the victim of
bullying can't be with their bully?

590
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,907
Did you arrange this meeting
so Woo-mi could explain herself?

591
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,950
You two used to be very close.

592
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,307
Just make peace.

593
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,020
It'll be better for both of you,
don't you think?

594
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,100
It seems like Woo-mi is
taking some strange medicine.

595
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,240
Are you trying to spread ridiculous
rumors about Woo-mi again?

596
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,490
I'm saying this because I'm worried.

597
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,120
This is the medicine Woo-mi is taking.

598
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,180
She told her friends they were
vitamins to improve concentration.

599
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,100
But it's nothing like that.

600
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,987
You shouldn't come here anymore.
It's not exactly a good place.

601
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:35,160
Having to wear the same clothes
is embarrassing.

602
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,520
I wanted to come here.

603
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,250
You know, I like you.

604
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,540
How can you confess your feelings
during a prison visit?

605
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,070
God.

606
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,180
Have you been well?

607
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,887
Yes, I'm working at the hospital
with Dr. Woo and Father Yang.

608
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm currently a grief counselor.

609
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,240
Even though the salary
is like a part-time job,

610
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,410
I've never been so happy working.

611
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,570
You even look more cheerful.

612
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,710
Dr. Woo asked to see you.
Why did you reject all the visits?

613
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,200
She's really worried about you.

614
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,770
So-jeong is very responsible.

615
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,557
If I agree once,
she'll come here day and night.

616
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
That wouldn't be good.

617
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,687
She has hospital matters,
with her nephews and So-song...

618
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,296
I don't want to become someone

619
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,976
that So-jeong
also has to take care of.

620
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,860
She needs to focus
on her own life.

621
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,170
Well, I brought you a letter
from Doctor Woo.

622
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,177
I heard you even returned the letters.
Don't do that anymore.

623
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,350
Wow, there's no escaping Woo So-jeong.

624
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,297
I'll find someone
to deliver them,

625
00:43:58,381 --> 00:43:59,266
you should read them.

626
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:00,525
Yes.

627
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,613
What are you doing?

628
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,620
Where's my medicine?

629
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,307
Where are my diet pills?

630
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,180
They're not diet pills!

631
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,400
It's a new kind of drug.

632
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:29,540
- Drugs?
- I asked a detective I know.

633
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,220
They say it's a drug
that's circulating among students.

634
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,630
Everyone says it's to improve
concentration or lose weight.

635
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,540
You can't take that ever again.

636
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,570
How could you throw them away?

637
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,017
Since I can't contact the person
who sells them, I'll go crazy.

638
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,597
How could you?

639
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,380
Who was it?

640
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,530
Who sold you that drug?

641
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,650
Are you trying to lose weight?

642
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,390
I don't think she's listening to me.

643
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,380
Are you trying to lose weight?

644
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,067
Eating is such a good thing.

645
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,487
Someone once said
that people who love to eat,

646
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,210
can be happy
at least three times a day.

647
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,237
Enduring so much happiness
must be very painful.

648
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,387
I'm busy, I'm leaving now.

649
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,730
Wait a moment.

650
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,740
Here, these are diet pills.

651
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,630
A little gift.

652
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,787
Even if you eat all you want,

653
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,910
you'll still lose weight.
Trust me and just take them.

654
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,400
Good luck.

655
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,260
It was someone from the neighborhood.

656
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,930
I'll go find her.

657
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,990
Woo-mi.

658
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,060
Go study abroad.

659
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,870
Because of the bullying, it'll be hard
for you to even take the entrance exam.

660
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,170
Just leave.

661
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,100
You can't keep doing this.

662
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,030
React, Woo-mi!

663
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,350
Yes?

664
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,340
All the luggage has already been sent.

665
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,460
My husband will take
the children to the airport.

666
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,920
I won't be back to Korea for a while,
so help me sell the house.

667
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,910
As soon as you sell it,
just transfer the money to my account.

668
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,270
Wait a minute, ma'am!

669
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,590
Wait there!

670
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,240
How cute.

671
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,350
Even the youngest ones
know quality when they see it.

672
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,550
Dae-hyun.

673
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,000
Today,
I visited Bae Mi-young's hospital room.

674
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,650
She, going through the
most painful period of her life,

675
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,250
showed me the happiest smile.

676
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:40,110
Dae-hyun,

677
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,490
in a moment of life's despair,

678
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,870
when no one expected it,

679
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,320
that person who wanted to commit
suicide seemed to gain a will to live.

680
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,620
Wanting to commit suicide,

681
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,130
while trying to understand all this,

682
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,840
she wanted to keep living
for an unexpected reason.

683
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,550
I think that's humanity.

684
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,460
The miracle of life.

685
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,210
Is that why life is so beautiful?

686
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,720
Don't you have any more questions?

687
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,420
You must be busy,

688
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,430
so I'll leave.

689
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:47,300
(3 years later)

690
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,370
It's so cold.
Do you really want to stay here?

691
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,330
Even here,

692
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,660
it feels suffocating
because I can't breathe.

693
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,140
In there

694
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,920
it's very suffocating.

695
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,370
(Gu Gwang-chul)

696
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,600
My release and return to the
country happened at the perfect time.

697
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,780
The ways of destiny.

698
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,590
I have something to show you.

699
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,727
The day CEO Gu died,
the police couldn't identify

700
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:22,850
one of our cars in front of the building.

701
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,820
This is the dashcam footage from that car.

702
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,827
In the bag Woo So-jeong was carrying,

703
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,710
there were videos of those
who requested euthanasia, right?

704
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,310
Yes.

705
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,802
The police say
it was my brother's crime

706
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:49,263
and that was the main evidence.

707
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,107
But what if my brother
had nothing to do with it?

708
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,260
(Gu Gwang-chul)

709
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,990
That would be so unfair.

710
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,880
Look at this.

711
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,150
Following CEO Gu's instructions,

712
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,680
we used this to threaten Woo So-jeong,

713
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,310
but the original disappeared.

714
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,907
It seems these people
tricked my brother,

715
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:19,730
and they messed everything up themselves.

716
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,577
As we suspected,
she left the country 3 years ago.

717
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,760
Gu's family
recently returned to the country.

718
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,427
His sister, Gu Hye-rin,

719
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,280
along with her husband Kim Myung-seok
and their son also returned.

720
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,627
They liquidated all their assets
three years ago

721
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,910
and left as if they were running away.

722
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,587
It's speculated

723
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,302
that they were also
involved in the pentobarbital

724
00:52:43,386 --> 00:52:45,347
murders.

725
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,880
Yes, Gu Hye-rin was always
a full-time housewife,

726
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:52,187
but Kim Myung-seok actually
did business with Gu Kwang-cheol.

727
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,270
That's right.

728
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,558
It's believed that Kim Myung-seok
is still trafficking from abroad.

729
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:57,401
When they returned,

730
00:52:57,485 --> 00:53:00,090
they enrolled their son
in a local school.

731
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,507
It seems they're planning
to settle back in Korea.

732
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,420
It's suspected that they'll start
doing business again.

733
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,977
The Special Investigation Team
has now been reformed.

734
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,430
From what I know, Captain Ahn obstructed
the investigation back then.

735
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,167
That's why it was
difficult to arrest them.

736
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,987
As your captain this time,
I promise to fully support you.

737
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,954
So, all of you
must get evidence

738
00:53:20,038 --> 00:53:21,497
of their crimes and arrest them.

739
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,527
You must search and find,

740
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,250
including in the case of the pentobarbital

741
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,910
murder three years ago,

742
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,767
the final piece of the puzzle.

743
00:53:31,851 --> 00:53:33,225
Yes, sir.

744
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,540
(A better tomorrow, lit by hope)

745
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,560
Doctor!

746
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,960
- Thank you for your hard work!
- Ah...

747
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:02,730
I appreciate it.

748
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,307
I brought tofu cookies.

749
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:08,450
Eating tofu prevents
you from coming back to places like this.

750
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,520
This is also tofu.

751
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:11,930
Help yourself.

752
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,770
Oh, thank you.

753
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,831
Dr. Woo couldn't make it

754
00:54:19,915 --> 00:54:21,880
because there are too many patients
at the hospital.

755
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,530
Let's head over there too.

756
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,330
The doctor is waiting for you.

757
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,120
Okay.

758
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,737
A lonely elderly person passed away.

759
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,210
They were a terminal patient.

760
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,590
But everything seemed peaceful.

761
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,750
Terminal patient?

762
00:54:40,939 --> 00:54:41,369
Yes.

763
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,137
Check the security footage.

764
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,220
Understood.

765
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,357
(Charity Hospital)

766
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,510
(Director Woo So-jeong)

767
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,150
(Director Woo So-jeong)

768
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,220
It's been a while.

769
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:50,407
Do you work here?

770
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:01,326
We haven't been formally introduced.

771
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:05,567
Oh, right.

772
00:56:07,278 --> 00:56:09,228
We've only met once.

773
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,049
It's just that I hear so
much about the doctor,

774
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:15,233
that I feel like we're close.

775
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,441
Nice to meet you.

776
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:20,808
My name is Gu Hye-rin.

777
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,230
I'm Woo So-jeong.

778
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,031
Why are you here?

779
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:34,398
I'm here to make a donation...

780
00:56:36,621 --> 00:56:38,551
and also to find someone.

781
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:42,757
Gu Gwang-chul.

782
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:45,844
You knew my brother, didn't you?

783
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:51,966
You...

784
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:55,238
practiced euthanasia together,
but you still pretend you don't know him.

785
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:02,365
Euthanasia?

786
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,587
I don't know what you're talking about.

787
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:07,670
That day...

788
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:10,959
my brother was the target
from the beginning, wasn't he?

789
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,270
That's why you took
that bag full of evidence, right?

790
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:20,253
I think there must be some mistake.

791
00:57:20,968 --> 00:57:23,058
That has nothing to do with me.

792
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:28,248
My brother is dead.
How will you compensate me for the damage?

793
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,058
I already said I have
nothing to do with it.

794
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,670
How could I compensate you?

795
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,890
You took something important from me,

796
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,540
so grant me a wish.

797
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:48,801
What you did with my brother,

798
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:52,115
start doing it with me now.

799
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,430
I don't do those kinds of things.

800
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:31,453
Taking care of this hospital
keeps me busy enough.

801
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,680
Then there's nothing to be done.

802
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,735
Just you wait...

803
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,221
...what I'll do to you in the near future.

804
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:48,838
See you later.

805
00:59:07,101 --> 00:59:09,101
{\an8}Thanks to actor Park Sung-geun
for his special appearance.

806
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,010
MARY <font color="#ff0000">KILLS</font> PEOPLE

807
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:34,207
{\an8}Mom, that's why you need
to keep up with your treatment.

808
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,890
{\an8}- Sir!
- Sister Young?

809
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,947
{\an8}Get me some doses of pentobarbital.

810
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,760
{\an8}On whom did you perform the experiment?

811
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,975
{\an8}Doctor, can't I choose

812
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:45,667
{\an8}my own final destiny?

813
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,427
{\an8}Please, help me.

814
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,787
{\an8}She wants to be euthanized.

815
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,067
{\an8}It's the same as Lee Yoon-hee, right?

816
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,787
{\an8}The final journey should
at least be peaceful.

817
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,687
{\an8}Wow.

818
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:58,910
{\an8}There must be patients
who need euthanasia.
