00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:40,684
You are being arrested as the suspect
in the murder of Ms. Lee Eun-hee.

00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:43,120
You are under emergency arrest.

12
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,071
Just a moment.

13
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:04,675
I'll go with you.

14
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,077
I was here the whole time.

15
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,480
Detective, you didn't actually see anything, did you?

16
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,150
I will go to the police station with you.

17
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:15,953
In return,

18
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:19,657
please give us time to comfort the
deceased's soul and send her off.

19
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,264
Lord.

20
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:35,406
May you grant Lee Eun-hee eternal rest.

21
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,595
Ms. Woo Chae-young.

22
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,832
Why did you change your name?

23
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,603
You strongly denied that you
were the one who killed your mother.

24
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,739
Because everyone thought I was the culprit.

25
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:11,776
Just like you're doing now, Detective.

26
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,211
So you changed your name
and moved away?

27
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,583
However it started,

28
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:23,254
weren't you the one who tied
your mother's hands, Ms. Woo So-jeong?

29
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:31,896
My mother taught art to the children
at a nearby orphanage.

30
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,632
She had a class that morning too.

31
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,602
I thought she was going
to play with the children.

32
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,972
You really believed that?

33
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,642
You were 16 then.

34
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,912
Your mother, who attempted suicide whenever
she had the chance, made such a request.

35
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,480
Didn't you think it was strange?

36
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,530
Maria.

37
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,032
I can't see my mom.

38
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:10,067
At that time, Dr. Woo...

39
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:15,339
No, Chae-young was trying to help her mother.

40
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,441
It's true that she tied
her mother's hands at her request.

41
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,945
But that was to try and stop
her from committing suicide.

42
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:59,450
Whether her mother turned
on the gas or cut her wrists,

43
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,086
she had to stop her from harming herself.

44
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,389
It had happened a few times before.

45
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,922
Chae-young was just
helping her mother,

46
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,708
who was trying to resist her suicidal
urges by any means necessary.

47
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,426
Although sadly, it was no help.

48
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,671
Mom, Mom.

49
00:06:28,105 --> 00:06:29,406
Mom.

50
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:40,151
Hey! In the water!

51
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,353
Search carefully.

52
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:48,559
You need to get in the water too.
Let's each search a different area.

53
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:20,191
But this is a very old case,

54
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,827
and it's been closed.
Why are you asking about it again?

55
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,831
Ms. Woo So-jeong is currently

56
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,201
arrested as a suspect at the
murder scene of Ms. Lee Eun-hee.

57
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,603
That alone is enough.

58
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,040
Look here.

59
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,309
I think you're misunderstanding something.

60
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,479
Ms. Lee Eun-hee died of a chronic illness.

61
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,453
Dr. Woo.

62
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:52,523
I will prepare.

63
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:58,335
As for Dr. Woo, except for a brief
moment when I left to prepare for prayer,

64
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,697
she was with me the entire time.

65
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,032
I see.

66
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:04,201
I understand, Father Yang.

67
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:16,747
Where is that bitch, Woo So-jeong, now?

68
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,350
I need to see that crazy bitch.

69
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,018
She's being questioned right now.

70
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:22,787
What is there to question?!

71
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,489
We arrested her at the scene.

72
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,992
Doesn't that settle everything?

73
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:30,093
Both Woo So-jeong and
the priest who was with her

74
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:32,363
are insisting that Lee Eun-hee
died of a chronic illness.

75
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,899
They're holding their ground.

76
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:44,208
The syringe?

77
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,112
The money that bitch took,
that must be evidence, right?

78
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,748
It doesn't seem like
she took money this time.

79
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:54,385
The victime was a street vendor with
one child, a welfare recipient.

80
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:59,023
What?

81
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:01,592
Is she playing the angel?

82
00:09:01,592 --> 00:09:04,395
Or has murder become her hobby?

83
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,739
Do it right.

84
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:18,442
If you let her get away this time,

85
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,978
instead of that bitch,

86
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:24,148
you'll be the one to die.

87
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,219
Yes, I understand.

88
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,449
Why are your steps so heavy?

89
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:03,821
What's so strange about
a citizen visiting the police?

90
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,323
Maybe I have a complaint
to file against you.

91
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:08,793
Woo So-jeong.

92
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:11,629
I heard you caught Woo So-jeong.

93
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:13,798
She was arrested at the scene.
There was no other option.

94
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:15,733
Hey, hey!

95
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:19,503
I'm not here to ask you

96
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:21,605
how Woo So-jeong was caught.

97
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:22,673
Hello.

98
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,442
Hello.

99
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,679
Release Woo So-jeong.

100
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:38,689
Besides you, there are plenty of people
who can transport the goods.

101
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,092
You're just one of them.

102
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:43,127
Goddamn it, you bastard.

103
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:45,529
But Woo So-jeong is different.

104
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,799
She's the only one. She's special.

105
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,267
You don't get what I'm saying, do you?

106
00:10:52,436 --> 00:10:53,637
Release Woo So-jeong.

107
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,423
- What?
- Why so serious?

108
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:46,857
What are you looking at?

109
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:49,860
What is this?

110
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:51,862
I told you, didn't I?

111
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:54,365
There's no way she's been living quietly.

112
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:03,174
You scared me.

113
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:06,343
We're from the regional investigation unit.
You're Choi Dae-hyun, correct?

114
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:07,178
Yes.

115
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:08,913
Police.

116
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,467
Hello.

117
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,937
- How have you been?
- Fine.

118
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,238
Let's talk for a moment.

119
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,140
Do you

120
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:40,711
have no intention of speaking further
about your mother's death?

121
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,216
Fine.

122
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:48,886
Then, can you tell me about the incident
that happened two years ago?

123
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,489
The Bunsung General Hospital incident.

124
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:53,724
Ms. Kwon Gyeong-mi.

125
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:01,832
According to the police records,

126
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:06,170
the doctor who last treated this woman's
daughter before she died was you.

127
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:11,175
And, as if by another coincidence,
that daughter died by assisted suicide.

128
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,179
Was that the beginning?

129
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:20,518
You think I did everything that
happened around me?

130
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:22,219
I'll ask you again.

131
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,521
The Kwon Gyeong-mi case.

132
00:13:23,988 --> 00:13:25,656
Was that your doing too?

133
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,097
You're exercising your right to remain silent.

134
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,400
Fine.

135
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,669
Well, the autopsy is in progress,

136
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,539
and from the priest to Choi Dae-hyun, the head nurse,

137
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:42,807
and even Ms. Kwon Gyeong-mi,

138
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:45,242
we've already secured all
the people who can testify.

139
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:48,579
Oh, these people, they
didn't even kill anyone,

140
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,781
but they're trembling
more than you right now.

141
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:52,450
If all goes well,

142
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:55,086
this might be over sooner than expected.

143
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,427
Come to think of it,

144
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:07,198
after experiencing
Ms. Gyeong-mi's case two years ago,

145
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,267
Dr. Woo did change a lot around that time.

146
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:13,437
She used to be a brighter,
more motivated person.

147
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:19,376
I did once ask
Dr. Woo So-jeong to kill my daughter.

148
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,349
I don't know Woo So-jeong.

149
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:29,153
But I know Choi Dae-hyun.

150
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:31,055
What's your relationship with Choi Dae-hyun?

151
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:34,825
He was a VIP customer at the
establishment where I used to work.

152
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:37,895
My friend probably met
Dae-hyun around then too.

153
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,831
That friend died two years ago.

154
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:44,168
She was terminally ill, and I heard
the hospital had given up on her.

155
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,637
In the end, Dae-hyun took care of her.

156
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:48,339
I was very grateful.

157
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,741
That friend had no family,

158
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,311
but her ex-boyfriend, Dae-hyun,
even took care of her funeral.

159
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,715
My ex-girlfriend, Mi-na,

160
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,050
her death had nothing to do with me.

161
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:05,856
She was already terminally ill, and I
understand she died of multiple organ failure.

162
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:07,504
What on earth happpened...

163
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,729
with Woo So-jeong two years ago?

164
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:25,299
{\an8}[2 Years Ago]

165
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:25,743
- Hey.
- You're here.

166
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:28,012
What is it? Barbecue?

167
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,880
- Hello.
- Oh, hello!

168
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,949
Oh, Jae-yeon, Jae-yoon, hello.

169
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:34,185
Give me a hug.

170
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:41,325
Mister, why do you keep
coming to our house to eat?

171
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:42,660
Kim Jae-yoon.

172
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:46,097
After you got fired as a doctor,
did you become a real beggar?

173
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,135
Not quite a beggar,

174
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:52,870
but I'm scheduled to be one.

175
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:56,173
Hey, you shouldn't talk to adults like that.

176
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,242
Jae-yeon's the best.

177
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:01,545
Jae-yeon, should I maybe
give you some math tutoring?

178
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,147
I'm going to art high school.

179
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:05,416
Oh, right. Jae-yeon is a really
good piano player, isn't she?

180
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:08,853
I do art.

181
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,492
Right, Jae-yeon is...
I mean, she's a really good drawer.

182
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:15,860
Come here, I need to talk to you.

183
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:17,728
- Why?
- Come here.

184
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:29,340
What?

185
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:31,942
What do you want?

186
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:33,410
The kids are here.

187
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:36,113
Why do you keep touching me?

188
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:37,948
Huh?

189
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:39,250
You want me to undress?

190
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:42,386
I have a blood test kit at home.
Let's do a blood test.

191
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:43,220
Wait.

192
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:47,892
Is this why you keep
inviting me for meals?

193
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:51,395
Should I skip the blood test
and just report you to the police?

194
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:56,867
You don't need to feel any
responsibility towards me, okay?

195
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:02,206
Doing drugs and then
losing my medical license,

196
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,641
it's not your fault, okay?

197
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:04,975
So don't feel sorry.

198
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:09,313
The only thing you should be sorry about
is rejecting my feelings since college.

199
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:10,347
I'm just worried.

200
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:13,017
I know you have a high capacity for empathy,

201
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:15,386
but sometimes you get too emotionally involved

202
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,954
and make unintentional mistakes.

203
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,022
Even though you'll regret it right away.

204
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:20,391
If you're so worried, then just live with me.

205
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:21,225
Oh, come on!

206
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,961
Promise me.

207
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,329
That you'll tell me if you're struggling.

208
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,630
And don't look for other ways.

209
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:31,402
Okay.

210
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,304
Go on, eat.

211
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:38,042
Let's eat quickly.

212
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:39,510
Let's eat!

213
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,312
- It's good, right?
- It's delicious.

214
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,286
You punk.

215
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:50,521
You agreed to pay,

216
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:52,923
so how could you not pay, you bastard!

217
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:54,925
Because I'm the one who's been wronged.

218
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:06,804
Goodness, me.

219
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:09,106
I can drive myself home.

220
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:11,275
Yes.

221
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:13,944
It's my first time driving a truck. It's fun.

222
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,081
And don't overdo it for a while.

223
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,317
The place where the glass shards were removed
could get infected.

224
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,787
Okay.

225
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:26,123
By the way, the swing in your yard,

226
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:27,591
I need to fix it quickly.

227
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:30,361
It's just not easy to find
that one part.

228
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:31,896
Jae-yoon must be waiting eagerly.

229
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:34,131
It would be nice if it's fixed,
but it can't be helped.

230
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,467
But even if he can't ride the swing now,

231
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:39,737
he's playing well, holding onto the bar,
hanging, climbing.

232
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:41,338
Don't worry.

233
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:43,908
Age 27, female.

234
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,731
She was hospitalized
for pancreatic cancer,

235
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,578
discharged yesterday
morning, but she's back.

236
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:49,947
She was discharged with a week's
prescription of opioid painkillers,

237
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:51,749
but she said it had no effect
even after taking almost all of it.

238
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,584
Is there a surgical record?

239
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:55,052
It's stage 4, so she couldn't.

240
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,555
She agreed to chemotherapy
and new drug treatment,

241
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:58,889
but the results weren't good.

242
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:09,133
- Please wipe the blood from her mouth.
- Yes.

243
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,267
Is there a wound in her mouth?

244
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,471
It's because she's clenching
her teeth to endure the pain.

245
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:17,908
Ma'am, you need to open your mouth.

246
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,977
If your mouth keeps filling with blood,
 it'll be hard to breathe.

247
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:21,679
Don't bite what's inside, spit it out.

248
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:36,864
{\an8}[Fentanyl: A narcotic painkiller.
IV (Intravenous Injection): An injection directly into a vein.]

249
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,390
Please prepare an IV of Fentanyl,

250
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,725
and quickly check if there's a room available.

251
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,127
- Yes.
- No.

252
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:39,196
We... we're not being admitted again.

253
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:41,899
Neither my daughter nor I want it anymore.

254
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:44,935
Doctor, please just give us some painkillers.

255
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,837
We'll just take the medicine and go home.

256
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:52,777
My child, she would rather die
than live at a hospital, Doctor.

257
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:54,678
You used up a week's worth in one day.

258
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,147
You can't go home like this.

259
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:01,152
The attending physician thought
she would be back soon,

260
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:02,720
so they kept her room.

261
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:06,123
It seems they were against her discharge
from the beginning, knowing this would happen.

262
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,659
They kept the hospital room.

263
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,394
We'll move to the room right after the medication.

264
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,495
No!

265
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:12,863
I can't stand it here anymore.

266
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:15,566
I don't want to be here! I'd rather die!

267
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,268
I'd rather die!

268
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:19,270
My child can't live at a hospital
anymore. She can't do it anymore.

269
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,771
She can't do it anymore. She can't do it.

270
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,107
- I said she can't do it anymore!
- Ma'am, please calm down.

271
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:25,509
- Ji-won, Ji-won, she can't do it anymore.
- Ma'am!

272
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:26,710
Just give me the medicine!

273
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,379
Just give me the medicine.

274
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:29,580
Ma'am, please calm down.

275
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:49,633
Ma'am.

276
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:05,282
Thankfully, she's sleeping a little.

277
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:06,717
Yes.

278
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,155
Doctor.

279
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,792
Doctor.

280
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,864
Can you cure my child's illness?

281
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,238
Everyone is doing their best.

282
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:37,548
All the doctors said that my child
won't live for more than three months.

283
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,221
When a doctor determines
that a patient cannot be saved,

284
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:47,091
what can be done for them?

285
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:50,861
We provide treatment to alleviate the pain.

286
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:52,163
For three months,

287
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:55,933
if she endures all that
suffering and then dies,

288
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,603
will my daughter's death
be a more meaningful one?

289
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,174
If the time until death is long,

290
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:06,110
is that more faithful to human dignity?

291
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:17,054
Dr. Jin and the other medical staff

292
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:20,458
are looking for ways to
effectively manage the pain.

293
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:23,994
Medical technology is said to have advanced,

294
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,996
but you people,

295
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,898
you're not saving people
with that technology,

296
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,591
you're torturing them.

297
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,368
Even though you can't save them,

298
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,540
you're making them suffer longer.

299
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:42,513
You people are arrogant.

300
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:49,253
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:50,087
Then...

302
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:52,723
please let my child die.

303
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:55,960
What?

304
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,428
If you can't save her,

305
00:22:57,928 --> 00:23:00,564
and you feel sorry for
leaving her in this pain,

306
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:02,933
then let her die.

307
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,770
In a less painful way.

308
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,175
I'm a doctor. That's impossible.

309
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:14,211
You said a doctor is someone
who reduces a patient's pain.

310
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:17,214
If death is the only way left,

311
00:23:17,915 --> 00:23:19,717
shouldn't you do it?

312
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,673
Ah, this, this.

313
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:44,308
My goodness.

314
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,544
Did you make this yourself, sir?

315
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:51,081
Well... luckily, it fits well.

316
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,552
I don't know how to thank you
at times like these.

317
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:56,620
No need to thank me.

318
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:59,857
When I said I couldn't
fix the swing last time,

319
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:01,692
Jae-yoon was crying so sadly,

320
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,462
it weighed on my mind, so I just made it.

321
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:07,498
Jae-yoon, come here. Try it out, okay?

322
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:12,036
I made it so it won't break even when
Jae-yoon becomes an adult and rides it.

323
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:15,706
Sir, didn't you have a doctor's appointment?

324
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:16,874
Oh, today.

325
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,876
I was going to go as soon
as I woke up this morning,

326
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:21,078
but I had a lot of work,
so I'm planning to go this afternoon.

327
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:22,780
I'll treat your wound now.

328
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,783
There's a house where the sink drain burst.

329
00:24:25,783 --> 00:24:28,319
It's a house where an old
lady lives alone, so I have to go.

330
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:31,455
Make sure you go to your appointment today.

331
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:33,190
Okay.

332
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,160
I ran out of medicine anyway,
so I was planning to go today for sure.

333
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,996
If you happen to miss your
appointment time today,

334
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,064
come to the ER later.

335
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:40,931
I'll take a look.

336
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:42,233
Okay, thank you.

337
00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:46,170
Ride to your heart's content.

338
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:52,143
The patient's mother,
a high school Korean teacher,

339
00:24:52,143 --> 00:24:53,788
had become pessimistic
about her daughter's situation

340
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:55,913
when her daughter was suffering

341
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,415
after being diagnosised
with pancreatic cancer.

342
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,184
Did a famous person come
to our hospital?

343
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:03,120
Doctor, didn't you see the news?

344
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,089
A murder happened at our hospital.

345
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:06,924
A murder?

346
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:08,859
Who?

347
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:11,328
Do you remember the
patient with pancreatic cancer?

348
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:14,265
She was killed by her guardian.

349
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:21,138
Police ruled assisted suicide
illegal under current law

350
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:24,742
and charged her with aggravated
murder of an ascendant.

351
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:44,762
Mom.

352
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,331
Please.

353
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:52,970
I want to rest now.

354
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:57,741
Help me.

355
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:06,117
I'm sorry for asking this.

356
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:29,974
If she endures all that
suffering and then dies,

357
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:33,744
will my daughter's death
be a more meaningful one?

358
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,786
Medical technology is
said to have advanced,

359
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:44,755
but even with that technology,

360
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:47,558
you're not saving people,
you're torturing them.

361
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:49,593
Even though you can't save them,

362
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:53,931
you're leaving them to suffer longer.

363
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,208
You people are arrogant.

364
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:28,933
Hello.

365
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,536
What are you doing?

366
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:33,571
I told you, let's go to work.

367
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,508
Forget it.

368
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:39,743
I can make a living just
working in this neighborhood.

369
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:41,278
What do you mean, forget it?

370
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:43,214
You think making a
living on your own is easy?

371
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:46,417
You're already in a mountain of
debt from your wife's hospital bills.

372
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,351
What are you so confident about?

373
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:49,053
Because of my injured leg,

374
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:51,088
I have to go to the hospital
to get my prescription today.

375
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,791
Just close your eyes and
come with me starting today.

376
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:57,194
You can get your medicine
tomorrow during your lunch break.

377
00:27:57,194 --> 00:27:58,028
My goodness.

378
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:00,898
Doing odd jobs without
getting paid properly,

379
00:28:00,898 --> 00:28:02,733
you're not doing volunteer work.

380
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,635
Go to a construction site,

381
00:28:04,635 --> 00:28:06,637
work for a few months and make a lump sum.

382
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,939
Then you can get a shop somewhere else.

383
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:16,213
So, if I work for just three months,
they'll give me that money?

384
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:22,486
This doesn't count as being sick.

385
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:23,521
Is that so?

386
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:27,491
It's a burn patient. A burn patient.

387
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:28,959
Move to beds 3 and 4.

388
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,028
Front bed 3, back bed 4. Move quickly.

389
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,165
It's a burn patient.

390
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:36,834
Doctor, he was welding in a container box,

391
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,636
and a fire broke out from the sparks.

392
00:28:38,636 --> 00:28:40,738
He was trapped inside
and suffered severe burns.

393
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:42,640
It's difficult for our hospital
to handle two burn patients.

394
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,108
We were thinking of splitting them up,

395
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,977
but you treated them so well
last time and saved them all.

396
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:48,779
Please get Dr. Kim quickly.

397
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:49,880
One, two, three.

398
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,415
One, two, three.

{\an8}[Intubation: Placing a breathing tube.

00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,327
Yes.

409
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:43,067
The patient has passed away.

410
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:58,682
So-jeong.

411
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,923
So-jeong.

412
00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:14,198
It hurts.

413
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:20,738
It hurts so much.

414
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:25,776
Ride to your heart's content.

415
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,379
Ride with all your might.

416
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:38,789
Mister?

417
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:46,163
Kill me, please.

418
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:17,027
Kill me, please.

419
00:31:17,027 --> 00:31:19,330
Calm down. You can live.

420
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,498
It hurts.

421
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:23,667
It hurts. It hurts so much.

422
00:31:24,902 --> 00:31:26,837
- Bring morphine.
- Yes.

00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:28,861
{\an8}[Morphine: A narcotic painkiller.]

424

So-jeong, I'm in so much pain.

426
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:39,416
Kill me.

427
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,085
You have to live.

428
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:42,520
You're a strong person.

429
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,655
No, I'm not.

430
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:47,124
I just want to die.

431
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:57,501
You're in so much pain right now that
your judgment is clouded.

432
00:31:57,935 --> 00:31:59,537
I will definitely save you.

433
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,206
So please just bear it a little longer.

434
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:26,697
Why are you making such a big fuss?

435
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:33,704
What?

436
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:35,539
Long time no see, Dae-hyeon.

437
00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:37,608
Yeah, long time no see.

438
00:32:38,342 --> 00:32:39,176
Good to see you.

439
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:40,377
Don't be nervous.

440
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,279
I didn't come here to ask you out again.

441
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,514
Oh.

442
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,183
That's disappointing.

443
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:50,054
But what should I do?
I can't practice medicine these days.

444
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:51,522
I'm in such a mess.

445
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:53,324
I'm taking a break for a while.

446
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:54,458
Then that's even better.

447
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:11,542
I know you lost your
medical license because of drugs.

448
00:33:13,043 --> 00:33:14,779
So you do illegal procedures here?

449
00:33:16,614 --> 00:33:18,582
Rumors have spread among the girls at the bar.

450
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:20,885
That you're skilled and affordable.

451
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,422
But are you an alcoholic this time?

452
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:25,890
Yes.

453
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:28,325
You know me well.

454
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:32,763
Once the money runs out,
the alcoholism will cure itself.

455
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,601
When I start practicing again, I'll let you know.

456
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,639
I don't have time to wait.

457
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:43,107
My condition...

458
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:45,843
is worse than yours.

459
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:49,613
Are you sick somewhere?

460
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:58,823
Anyway, I'm just someone
who can give Propofol shots.

461
00:33:58,823 --> 00:34:01,725
I can't do surgery for a while.
No, I don't think I can ever do it again.

462
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:05,629
A shot.

463
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:08,265
That's all I need.

464
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:14,939
Give me a shot that will let me sleep

465
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,075
for a long time.

466
00:34:21,278 --> 00:34:22,346
A very long time.

467
00:34:24,215 --> 00:34:25,950
Treatments can be very painful,

468
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,452
so everyone keeps saying they'd rather die.

469
00:34:29,086 --> 00:34:33,224
This person is still saying it, even when
their consciousness is clouded by morphine.

470
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:36,093
Their will to die is
stronger than the will to live.

471
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,997
Does this person have no family?

472
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,799
He never had children,

473
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,502
and his wife died of cancer two years ago.

474
00:34:45,161 --> 00:34:47,567
This is the most difficult kind
of case, even if we save him.

475
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,475
Even if he makes a miraculous recovery,

476
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:53,878
there's almost no chance
he'll return to a normal life.

477
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:55,513
Dr. Kim, what do you think?

478
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,518
We'll have to treat him for a
few years to know the results.

479
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:02,887
Don't say that. Just save him.

480
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,488
And don't say he has no family.

481
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:06,090
The medical bills are also a problem.

482
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,125
The company that hired him is unlicensed.

483
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:10,728
Forget compensation, I don't
think he'll even get treatment costs.

484
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:12,830
I'll cover that for now.

485
00:35:13,998 --> 00:35:15,800
- Dr. Woo, you will?
- Yes.

486
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,936
I promised I would definitely save him.

487
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:22,072
So if there are any expenses to
be processed, please contact me.

488
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:28,245
Okay.

489
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:32,016
- Dr. Kim, do your best.
- Yes, yes, I will.

490
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:33,818
And Dr. Woo,

491
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:35,886
don't come here for a while.

492
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,622
If he sees you, he'll just
beg you to kill him more.

493
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:43,561
If the patient gets agitated,
it's not good for him either.

494
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:45,729
Okay.

495
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:49,066
Please use whatever treatment you can.

496
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,134
I'll leave him in your care.

497
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:03,814
Go home.

498
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:07,218
How long are you going to stay here?

499
00:36:09,086 --> 00:36:10,387
I said I can't do it.

500
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:16,594
If you keep staying here,

501
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:19,497
I'll report you for trespassing.

502
00:36:20,331 --> 00:36:25,169
Then I'll report you to
the drug investigation unit.

503
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:29,507
Not right now.

504
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:43,087
Tell the police that.

505
00:36:45,556 --> 00:36:46,924
No matter what you say,

506
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:49,360
I can't grant that request.

507
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,462
I'm terminally ill.

508
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:54,131
I only have a few months to live anyway.

509
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,269
But that's still murder.

510
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:01,305
Then...

511
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,875
can you cure my illness?

512
00:37:05,643 --> 00:37:07,044
Can you save me?

513
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,947
How can I kill you?!

514
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:11,348
I'm not asking you to kill me.

515
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:14,785
I'm asking you to help me.

516
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:19,657
It's what I want.

517
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:23,027
Please help me, Dae-hyeon.

518
00:37:53,624 --> 00:37:55,593
So...

519
00:37:55,893 --> 00:37:59,296
you reluctantly helped her
because of her persistent requests?

520
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:02,600
No, I felt sorry for her,

521
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:05,936
but I sent her home.
That was the last of it.

522
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,554
Why isn't it done yet?!

523
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,032
It'll be over soon.

524
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:22,468
I'll wrap it up perfectly by
organizing the autopsy results.

525
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:26,105
Take care of it before sunrise tomorrow.

526
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:29,041
The article about that bitch
needs to be in the morning paper.

527
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,944
Only then is your job done.

528
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,312
Yes.

529
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,781
You can go home
and wait for the morning paper.

530
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,084
When the autopsy results come out,
call me, no matter how late.

531
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,587
Don't you dare think of making excuses.

532
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:42,421
Yes.

533
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,757
Damn it!

534
00:39:11,584 --> 00:39:12,418
Representative Gu.

535
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,188
I checked through my contact
at the National Forensic Service.

536
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,390
It seems Benpo won't show up.

537
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,226
Yes, I'll contact you again.

538
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:33,339
Assemblyman Baek might get us fired,

539
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:35,608
but Representative Gu

540
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:37,910
will really kill us.

541
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:54,327
Do you think this makes sense?

542
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:56,662
We're in the middle of an investigation.
How can you be so reckless?

543
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:58,998
What kind of world is this?

544
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,134
Choi Dae-hyun!

545
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:02,001
Wait a minute.

546
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:04,370
- Where are you?!
- You can't do this!

547
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,505
What are you doing?!

548
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:06,906
Why aren't you maintaining proper security?

549
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:07,874
I'm sorry.

550
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:14,547
Choi Dae-hyun promised not to contact
Woo So-jeong for a while and to cut ties.

551
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:16,616
If you give us more time,
Choi Dae-hyun will cooperate,

552
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,751
and we can even secure
evidence at the scene.

553
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,919
Bringing him in like
this without a warrant

554
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,021
and questioning him
without a lawyer's consent,

555
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:23,689
that is a clear mistake.

556
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:24,524
Ma'am.

557
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:26,826
There's no need for this anymore.

558
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:30,263
Woo So-jeong was arrested
at the scene of a death,

559
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,397
and is already being questioned.

560
00:40:31,397 --> 00:40:32,598
Wait, wait a minute.

561
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,767
So-jeong was arrested at the scene?

562
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,338
The one arrested at the scene was Woo So-jeong.

563
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:40,540
Not Choi Dae-hyun.

564
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,375
I'm taking Choi Dae-hyun with me.

565
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,544
If you want to question him,
come back with a warrant.

566
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,312
Who is the deceased?

567
00:40:46,312 --> 00:40:47,413
You're curious, aren't you?

568
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:48,981
Then stay and be questioned a little longer.

569
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:52,385
After questioning him illegally,
are you now trying to persuade him?

570
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:53,814
We have no legal
obligation to disclose

571
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:55,721
information about another
person's investigation.

572
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:58,524
But since Mr. Choi Dae-hyun is curious,

573
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,026
I'm just doing my best

574
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:01,928
to offer some advice.

575
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:06,065
- Let's go quickly.
- I'll be questioned.

576
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:06,899
In return,

577
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:09,068
please tell me who died.

578
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:10,169
Mr. Choi Dae-hyun.

579
00:41:10,169 --> 00:41:13,072
I'm going to be questioned anyway,
so I'll be questioned.

580
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,710
Depending on your statement,
Ms. Woo So-jeong could be at a disadvantage.

581
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,678
Just because you cooperate unconditionally

582
00:41:18,678 --> 00:41:20,313
doesn't mean you're helping her.

583
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,381
Let's just go for today,

584
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:25,751
and I'll assess the situation later and
reschedule with the police.

585
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,422
Let's talk again later.

586
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:31,757
Let's go.

587
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:33,159
Since you'll find out anyway,

588
00:41:34,694 --> 00:41:38,231
I'll tell you who died.

Are you waiting for your mom?

Your mom...

604
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,908
Mom isn't in pain anymore, right?

605
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:02,215
She's not in pain anymore, right?

606
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:10,790
Yes.

607
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,093
Your mom isn't in pain anymore.

608
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:26,038
Mom.

609
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:49,195
Mom.

610
00:43:50,596 --> 00:43:52,431
Mom.

611
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:57,470
If the detective came to see you,
you should have told me right away.

612
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,028
You should have exercised
your right to remain silent

613
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:00,868
or held out until a lawyer arrived.

614
00:44:00,893 --> 00:44:04,377
This makes you a
useless card to the police.

615
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:07,113
Do you know how
disadvantageous this is for you?

616
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:10,416
Can't I just say I did it?

617
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:14,086
The police were already tracking
your location through your phone.

618
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:17,123
They already know you
weren't near the crime scene.

619
00:44:17,456 --> 00:44:19,692
Now you have to give up on being found
innocent of the murder charge.

620
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:23,329
Since it's come to this, we have no choice but
to focus on reducing your sentence.

621
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,567
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

622
00:44:30,603 --> 00:44:32,939
I need to go back and confess.

623
00:44:34,774 --> 00:44:36,042
I told you.

624
00:44:36,042 --> 00:44:38,077
That kind of lie won't work.

625
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:40,880
It's not a lie.

626
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,574
That guardian is at the hospital room
today for a crime scene reenactment.

627
00:45:11,477 --> 00:45:12,712
Oh, she's out!

628
00:45:14,814 --> 00:45:16,415
Please step aside for a moment.

629
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:23,356
Is it true that you committed murder at
the request of your deceased daughter?

630
00:45:23,356 --> 00:45:25,258
Your daughter's suicide
note was found at your home.

631
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:26,792
Why didn't you submit it earlier?

632
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,461
You've become a murderer
who killed your own child.

633
00:45:28,461 --> 00:45:29,562
Do you have any regrets?

634
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:31,964
I have no regrets.

635
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,035
Because my child is free from suffering.

636
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:38,938
That's enough for me.

637
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:06,165
Doctor Woo, you need to come quickly.

638
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:09,902
Was there a problem during treatment?

639
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:11,304
No, he's been fine lately.

640
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:13,773
I thought he was receiving treatment well.

641
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:14,607
Come quickly.

642
00:46:15,074 --> 00:46:17,210
Excuse me, please, excuse me.

643
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:32,625
Sir, what are you doing?

644
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:34,927
Doctor.

645
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:37,897
Please let me out.

646
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,534
Sir.

647
00:46:46,272 --> 00:46:47,740
Let her go,

648
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:50,109
and talk to me. Talk to me.

649
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:53,679
I'll listen to everything
you have to say.

650
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:58,518
You don't want anyone
to get hurt either, do you?

651
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:16,669
Doctor.

652
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:23,242
I don't care if I die like this,
so just let me out of here.

653
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,382
I know it's hard for you,

654
00:47:31,317 --> 00:47:33,352
but if you leave now, the risk
of infection is high, so you can't.

655
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:38,424
I don't care about any of that.

656
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:43,262
If you just endure it a little longer,

657
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,433
I'll discharge you after
your treatment is over.

658
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:48,801
Treatment?

659
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:52,438
When does it end?

660
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:56,275
After I'm dead?

661
00:47:57,376 --> 00:48:00,213
I told you to kill me!

662
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:01,047
Sir.

663
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:05,218
I kept begging you to kill me!

664
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:07,887
I... I...

665
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:11,057
I can't leave here until I die, right?

666
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:18,931
I know it's hard to get treatment.

667
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:23,035
But I genuinely want you to live.

668
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,639
Jae-yoon also prays for you every night.

669
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:31,677
And many of the neighbors
are probably doing the same.

670
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:34,747
I'll do my best.

671
00:48:35,515 --> 00:48:36,916
So just get a little more treatment and...

672
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,886
Just being kept alive,
is that really living?

673
00:48:40,353 --> 00:48:45,124
In this state, just breathing,
is that what you call living?

674
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:47,393
I...

675
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,129
I can't even cry anymore.

676
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:53,933
It's all burned away.

677
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:04,710
Doctor.

678
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,922
Thank you for everything!

679
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:19,926
But...

680
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,398
this place is too much of a hell.

681
00:49:42,815 --> 00:49:45,084
After that patient passed away,

682
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:47,787
Dr. Woo was going through a lot emotionally.

683
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:51,924
How could someone like that be involved
in the murder of Ms. Kwon Gyeong-mi?

684
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:57,330
Dr. Woo is a person who does her
best to save patients, more than anyone.

685
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,966
How heartbroken she was
when she lost that patient.

686
00:49:59,966 --> 00:50:01,567
To help my daughter,

687
00:50:02,335 --> 00:50:04,103
she tried very hard.

688
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,205
Although it was in vain.

689
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,411
But what is Dr. Woo being accused of?

690
00:50:13,846 --> 00:50:17,016
She is accused of assisting
in the suicide of patients.

691
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:19,785
Is there any evidence?

692
00:50:25,992 --> 00:50:27,560
It seems there's no evidence.

693
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:33,733
The interview is over.

694
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:39,739
Isn't that a relief?

695
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:45,278
When you heard it wasn't
Dr. Woo who killed my daughter,

696
00:50:45,611 --> 00:50:47,914
you looked relieved, Detective.

697
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,090
In the past, there was no evidence,
shielding her might have helped,

698
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:12,291
but it's different now.

699
00:51:12,758 --> 00:51:14,994
An autopsy of Ms. Lee Eun-hee is underway.

700
00:51:16,629 --> 00:51:18,642
When these results come
out, we can prove

701
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,933
Ms. Woo So-jeong's crime even
without your testimony, Father yang.

702
00:51:22,635 --> 00:51:24,637
Well, I don't know
what you're looking for,

703
00:51:25,804 --> 00:51:27,740
but whatever the
autopsy results may be,

704
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,977
will that be direct evidence proving
Ms. Woo So-jeong's guilt?

705
00:51:34,413 --> 00:51:35,748
'Direct evidence.'

706
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,686
You said that when
Ms. Lee Eun-hee passed away,

707
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:44,823
only Ms. Woo So-jeong and yourself were there.

708
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:46,358
Yes.

709
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:47,660
Then if it wasn't Ms. Woo So-jeong,

710
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:49,828
are you saying you did it, Father? Yang

711
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:56,769
Persuade Ms. Woo So-jeong

712
00:51:58,337 --> 00:51:59,738
and help her confess.

713
00:52:00,873 --> 00:52:03,142
As things stand, reducing
her sentence is the best option.

714
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:06,378
Dr. Woo did not kill Ms. Lee Eun-hee.

715
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:08,013
So what are you asking
me to persuade her to do?

716
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:11,417
Oh my, it's late.

717
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:13,786
Let him go. He has to go, man.
 He has to pray.

718
00:52:13,786 --> 00:52:14,954
What were you doing so late?

719
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:16,155
You can go.

720
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:19,558
What happens to Dr. Woo?

721
00:52:19,925 --> 00:52:21,927
The questioning is over,
so you can go now.

722
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:22,995
No, I mean...

723
00:52:23,629 --> 00:52:24,763
What about Dr. Woo?

724
00:52:26,632 --> 00:52:29,902
If Dr. Woo can't leave, then I'll stay here too.

725
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,004
Father Yang.

726
00:52:32,404 --> 00:52:36,075
Do you think Woo So-jeong is under
suspicion only because of Ms. Lee Eun-hee?

727
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:40,245
What do you mean?

728
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,253
Is she involved in other cases too?

729
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,989
The autopsy results will be out soon,

730
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:51,557
so stop it and go.

731
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:54,727
If you're curious about what
happened, watch the news.

732
00:52:55,194 --> 00:52:56,695
It'll be noisy for a while.

733
00:53:03,836 --> 00:53:04,870
You should go.

734
00:53:06,572 --> 00:53:07,706
What if I did it?

735
00:53:14,513 --> 00:53:15,347
Yes.

736
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:19,184
I killed Ms. Lee Eun-hee.

737
00:53:20,953 --> 00:53:21,954
I killed her.

738
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:31,997
Stop it.

739
00:53:32,598 --> 00:53:34,466
Even if you do that,
you can't help Ms. Woo So-jeong.

740
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:35,634
No, right now,

741
00:53:36,368 --> 00:53:38,837
I'm confessing to my lawyer.

742
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:42,741
Not just this time,
but I did all the previous cases.

743
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:45,044
You know it too.

744
00:53:45,044 --> 00:53:47,980
How could someone like
Woo So-jeong get Benponarbital?

745
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,115
She's never even done drugs.

746
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:53,085
You know Benponarbital

747
00:53:54,553 --> 00:53:57,022
is not a drug you can get at a hospital.

748
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:00,659
Euthanasia.

749
00:54:03,228 --> 00:54:04,430
I started it.

750
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:07,499
My ex-girlfriend.

751
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:09,535
Mi-na.

752
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,271
I killed her.

753
00:54:59,118 --> 00:55:01,754
Ugh, the smell.

754
00:55:04,757 --> 00:55:06,525
A living corpse is still a living person,

755
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:09,795
but how can the smell of a corpse be so strong?

756
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:20,105
A gift.

757
00:55:31,884 --> 00:55:32,718
With a syringe?

758
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:45,864
Most of them drink it with alcohol.

759
00:55:47,566 --> 00:55:49,602
Injecting it intravenously is the surest way,

760
00:55:50,235 --> 00:55:53,305
but that leaves a mark on the body.

761
00:55:54,173 --> 00:55:57,910
Benponarbital is mixed with the various
drugs the patient is already taking

762
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,212
plus alcohol, and drink it.

763
00:56:15,227 --> 00:56:18,397
Well, in this state,
you can't make her drink it.

764
00:56:19,465 --> 00:56:20,866
So through the respiratory tract... oh.

765
00:56:27,006 --> 00:56:27,973
Wait a minute.

766
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:50,229
Is she dead?

767
00:56:51,964 --> 00:56:53,065
Wow.

768
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:57,970
Like slowly drifting off to sleep,
taking a nap, they just go like that?

769
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:00,439
Oh.

770
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:03,275
Wow, that's amazing.

771
00:57:05,277 --> 00:57:06,445
You should go.

772
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:11,650
This is the last gift you give
to those incurable people

773
00:57:11,984 --> 00:57:13,886
you were talking about?

774
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,988
People will be coming.

775
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:20,152
Mom!

776
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:53,912
{\an8}Get your k-fix @ SinFlix!

777
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:53,912
QC by Linja

778
00:58:53,941 --> 00:58:56,669
[Special thanks to actors Jeong Gyeong-sun
and Moon Hee for their special appearances.]

779
00:59:16,276 --> 00:59:17,677
You can go home now.

780
00:59:17,677 --> 00:59:19,746
Someone has come forward saying
they killed Ms. Lee Eun-hee.

781
00:59:19,746 --> 00:59:21,748
Father Yang didn't kill anyone.

782
00:59:21,748 --> 00:59:24,250
You already think you're innocent anyway.

783
00:59:25,819 --> 00:59:27,854
Please give me that treatment too.

784
00:59:27,854 --> 00:59:30,457
What are you talking about?
You should have said of course not.

785
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:33,827
Is it okay to ignore such suffering
because you fear criticism?

786
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:37,330
We received a tip that the merchandise is
coming in under Kim Si-hyun's name tonight.

787
00:59:39,466 --> 00:59:41,034
The situation right now
is a bit strange.

788
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:44,471
The fact that Kim Si-hyun had the drugs
the police lost is strange.

789
00:59:44,471 --> 00:59:45,739
Maybe there's an informant.
