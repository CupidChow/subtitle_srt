From now on,

9
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:20,769
the three of us will be doing this work together.

10
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,199
Yes, okay.

11
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:24,069
Nice to meet you, Ye-na.

12
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:25,769
It's nice to meet you.

13
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,639
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,579
Ah, yes.

15
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,349
A female member is always welcome in any group.

16
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:34,449
It's nice to meet you.

17
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,079
Before we begin this work,

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,389
I'll state the criteria clearly one more time.

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,549
Firstly,

20
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:44,289
the client must have a diagnosis of
being incurable from three or more doctors.

21
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:45,929
And after that,

22
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,729
they must be in a state of unbearable physical disability.

23
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,099
And finally,

24
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:54,439
the pain must be uncontrollable
by any form of medication.

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,139
These are the three criteria.

26
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,669
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

27
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:02,339
Yes, I see.

28
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:05,679
Then as the sole man here,
I've prepared something special. Here.

29
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,149
Here we go.

30
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:11,649
Okay.

31
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:15,689
From now on, we'll be mixing Benponarbital in this

32
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,489
and providing it to our clients.

33
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:24,629
Of course,

34
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:26,799
there's nothing in it right now. It's fine.

35
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:35,309
So, to us.

36
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:38,449
Let's do a good job.

37
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:50,239
Based on the original Canadian series 'Mary Kills People'.

38
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,912
[Episode 2]

39
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,009
She was fine before the performance.

40
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,009
But as soon as she got on stage, she suddenly...

41
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,539
It could be because she was nervous.

42
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,579
I'm going to check her eyes.

43
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,659
Is there a problem?

44
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,789
I'll run some tests first.

45
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,129
Please wait outside for a moment.

46
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,829
I'll let you know once the tests are done.

47
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,799
Okay.

48
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,639
It's mydriasis.

49
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,739
{\an8} [Mydriasis: The abnormal dilation of the pupils, often caused by trauma, illness, or certain drugs.]

50
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,139
I'll know for sure once I see the test results,

51
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,579
but it looks like a sedative overdose.

52
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,189
Are you feeling a bit better?

53
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,419
You're at a hospital.

54
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:33,859
Do you remember collapsing during your performance?

55
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,129
Did you take any medication before that?

56
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,269
- I'll take it from here.
- Okay.

57
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,149
Woo-mi.

58
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,719
I know you get nervous,

59
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,949
but you shouldn't be taking drugs.

60
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,089
Can you tell me what you took?

61
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,429
We'll find out anyway when the test results come back.

62
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,999
Tell me now.

63
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,699
Is my mom here too?

64
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,009
Yes, she should be in the waiting room. Should I get her?

65
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,669
Please don't tell my mom.

66
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,279
I just...

67
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:26,079
I drank it thinking it was medication that helps with anxiety.

68
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,779
What kind of medication?

69
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,719
Benponarbital.

70
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,059
I found it in the storage shed at your house.

71
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,069
By chance.

72
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:54,309
Does Jae-yeon know?

73
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:55,809
We saw it was there together,

74
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,809
but she doesn't know I drank it.

75
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,319
I actually have stage fright.

76
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:07,589
Please keep it a secret from my mom. If she finds out,

77
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:11,089
she'll send me off to a boarding school abroad.

78
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,899
I have to tell her.

79
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,569
The test results will come out, and I can't lie.

80
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,509
You have to keep the patient's symptoms confidential.

81
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,409
You're a doctor, aren't you?

82
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,549
You sound just like a lawyer.

83
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:35,449
I don't know exactly what kind of drug that is,

84
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,349
but if my mom finds out, she won't let it go.

85
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:43,159
My mom is a capable lawyer.

86
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,429
You know what "capable" means, don't you?

87
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,199
You, me, and Jae-yeon...

88
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,399
It will become a huge pain for all of us.

89
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,809
Woo So-jeong and Choi Dae-hyun were college classmates.

90
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,679
Then how did Choi Ye-na get involved?

91
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,049
Yes, Choi Ye-na.

92
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,719
After her mother died in a car accident when she was young,

93
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:12,389
she grew up under an alcoholic father
with her twin brother.

94
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:13,849
Her brother, Choi Geon-su,

95
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:23,019
{\an8}[Cystic Fibrosis: A hereditary systemic disease that causes widespread dysfunction of the exocrine glands.]

96
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,219
has a genetic disease called cystic fibrosis.

97
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,259
The father's domestic violence was so severe
that the two of them mostly relied on each other.

98
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,459
- Where is Choi Yeong-jun?
- Who are you?

99
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,159
He racked up debt, so where did he go?

100
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:25,929
- Who are you?
- So you're sick, huh?

101
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:27,329
If you have no money, you can't afford to be sick.

102
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,539
Let's talk outside. I said let's talk outside.

103
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,339
Get out, you piece of...

104
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,779
What are you doing?

105
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,079
Who the hell is Choi Yeong-jun!

106
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,589
Don't come any closer. I'll fucking kill you.

107
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:47,719
Move.

108
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,089
The father left home seven years ago,

109
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,829
and all contact has been lost.

110
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:56,199
As her brother, Choi Geon-su, was repeatedly hospitalized,

111
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,229
Choi Ye-na also cared for him,

112
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,269
naturally spending most of her time at the hospital.

113
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,699
During that period,

114
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,369
it is understood that she formed a close bond with Woo So-jeong.

115
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,369
Currently, after graduating from college,

116
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,809
she is employed as a nurse at Bunseong Hospital.

117
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,409
Due to her brother's medical bills,

118
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:13,379
it's understood that she has a significant amount of private debt.

119
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,249
The Benponarbital supplier, Kim Si-hyeon.

120
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:19,819
Hyung, let's eat.

121
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,659
When Choi Dae-hyun was imprisoned for a medical accident

122
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,889
after taking drugs, they were cellmates.

123
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,059
At the time, he was a petty criminal,

124
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:30,399
but he later secured a distribution network in Cambodia

125
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,999
and became a huge figure.

126
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:33,929
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:35,599
He definitely has someone backing him.

128
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,109
I don't know who's protecting him,

129
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,939
but the special investigation team has been chasing him for years,

130
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,579
and they haven't found a single trace.

131
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:43,009
Does Kim Si-hyeon

132
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,809
know that the drugs he supplies are being used for euthanasia?

133
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,219
Well, it's not certain,

134
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,919
but from Kim Si-hyeon's perspective, the volume
of Benponarbital transactions is so small

135
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,719
that it's highly likely he's unaware.

136
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,819
The fact that he has his underlings
handle the transactions also suggests that.

137
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,989
But now that our investigation is
underway, pressure will be applied,

138
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:00,929
so it's only a matter of time before he catches on.

139
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:04,569
If he finds out his drugs are being
used for something this dangerous,

140
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,469
Kim Si-hyeon won't let Woo So-jeong go either.

141
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,239
Get to Woo So-jeong before Kim Si-hyeon does.

142
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:12,509
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,479
Judging by her euthanasia skills,

144
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,639
Choi Dae-hyun, who caused a medical accident,

145
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,579
and Choi Ye-na, who's still an inexperienced nurse,

146
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,349
are likely just assistants.

147
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:25,589
The key isn't the money,

148
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,189
but the one working with a crazy conviction,

149
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:28,719
Woo So-jeong.

150
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,189
First, tail Choi Dae-hyun and see if he's using drugs again.

151
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:34,189
Sir.

152
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,399
That might become a problem later on.

153
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,599
Do you think our current investigation methods are legally sound?

154
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,199
What about the autopsy results for Choi Kang-yoon?

155
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:45,869
They'll be out soon.

156
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,909
And Choi Kang-yoon's wife is in the interrogation room right now.

157
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:49,739
Okay.

158
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,209
Prepare the materials well.

159
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,449
That woman's cooperation is crucial in arresting Woo So-jeong.

160
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,169
His name is Jo Su-yeong. He's a boy.

161
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,469
Stage 4 colon cancer, and he's still in high school.

162
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:20,139
As you'll see in the file, he's been given a terminal diagnosis.

163
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:22,479
What about his parents?

164
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,779
Did his family agree to our consultation?

165
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,409
The boy wanted it first.

166
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:28,979
His mother lost contact after the divorce,

167
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,089
and his father was surprisingly easy to persuade.

168
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:36,659
They say he has about two weeks left.

169
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,659
Time is short.

170
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:48,839
As soon as I heard,

171
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,669
I thought of my uncle.

172
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:54,539
I've never met him,

173
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,939
but my grandmother always talked about him.

174
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:59,579
Right after he started high school,

175
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:04,349
my uncle died of colon cancer in less than two weeks.

176
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,049
So, take care of your health.

177
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,989
I heard that so much it was sickening.

178
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:12,759
And that crappy gene...

179
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,329
it exploded in me.

180
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,169
So, when you got sick,

181
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:27,269
had you already thought about getting a consultation like this?

182
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,079
Who thinks about
this kind of crappy thing in advance?

183
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:32,349
Especially at my age?

184
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,349
The doctor told me.

185
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,219
That having two weeks left

186
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,629
doesn't mean I have two weeks to get my affairs in order.

187
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:48,199
During the time that's left,

188
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,169
I'll experience a level of pain

189
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:55,499
completely different from what I've felt before. It was a warning.

190
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,239
So I want to die quickly.

191
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,809
It's unfair enough that I'm dying,

192
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,239
but I don't want to go through that too.

193
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,419
You know Woo So-jeong from Bunseong General Hospital, don't you?

194
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,119
Yes.

195
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,319
She's an ER doctor.

196
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,929
When I was first admitted to that hospital through the ER,

197
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,459
I think I met her then.

198
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,169
But what does she have to do with my husband's death?

199
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:31,209
By any chance, did you see your husband
contacting Woo So-jeong separately?

200
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:36,009
Any kind of private memo or text between them,

201
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:38,809
or did your husband have a
flip phone you hadn't seen before?

202
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:43,319
If you're so suspicious,
then get a warrant and do a search.

203
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,199
I'm sorry if I offended you.

204
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:04,409
Are you suspecting me of hiding something?

205
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,139
I'll be honest with you.

206
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,409
At this point in time, we are not suspecting you as the wife.

207
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:15,419
We are focusing on Woo So-jeong.

208
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,819
She has been involved in similar cases.

209
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:28,099
I...

210
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,069
She and my husband,

211
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,099
how close of a relationship they had,

212
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,309
I don't know.

213
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,239
I see.

214
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,809
But unfortunately,

215
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,649
if no evidence emerges that points to Woo So-jeong,

216
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,049
then...

217
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,789
we will have no choice but to place you on the list of suspects.

218
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,389
So please, try your best to remember everything.

219
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:03,029
Oh, you're out?

220
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,299
Okay.

221
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:06,929
The autopsy results are in.

222
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,069
Then I'll just go check the results.

223
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,159
The patient seems like he doesn't even know what it means to die,

224
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:36,759
and the father looks half-dead from guilt.

225
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,669
You also made a promise to Cho Hyun-woo, didn't you?

226
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:40,969
Yes.

227
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,399
But I think Su-yeong has to be the priority.

228
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:46,709
Yes, right. Su-yeong doesn't even have time to think.

229
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,739
Geez, does this even make sense for a kid?

230
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,179
When you have time, can you look for Su-yeong's mom?

231
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,079
In the files his father gave you,

232
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,949
there should be some information that could be a hint.

233
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,749
You're good at finding people on the internet, Dr. Choi.

234
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:02,489
I'm very good at that.

235
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,629
Time is tight, but I'll give it a go.

236
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:09,459
Oh, and I moved the Benponarbital to Father Yang's clinic.

237
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,629
Keeping it at home is risky with the kids around.

238
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:12,569
That's a good idea.

239
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,939
After what happened, we need to be careful.

240
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,869
Did you hide it well in the cabinet?

241
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:17,969
Yes.

242
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,769
I even put a combination lock on it.

243
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,839
- I'll be in charge of it for now.
- You did great.

244
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,109
Good job.

245
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:28,379
The cause of death has been confirmed as asphyxiation.

246
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,589
It's also a fact that Benponarbital was detected in the body.

247
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,149
Yes, it's true he ingested it,

248
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,189
but it was not a lethal dose at all.

249
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,989
Then...

250
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,459
does that mean we can't turn the Choi
Kang-yoon death case to a full investigation?

251
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,829
Yes, sir. This time it's different.

252
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,829
If it were Woo So-jeong, she would have gotten the dosage exactly right.

253
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:50,069
Asphyxiation can also be murder.

254
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,009
Just start the investigation by saying the wife is suspicious.

255
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,109
We can't.

256
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,379
We checked the wife's dashcam footage.

257
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,979
She went grocery shopping, found the body as soon as she arrived,

258
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,379
and immediately called the police.

259
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,649
The timeline makes it impossible.

260
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,459
What about the possibility
that the wife killed

261
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,289
her husband beforehand
and then went shopping?

262
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,959
While the wife was shopping at the supermarket,

263
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,459
there's a record of Choi Kang-yoon talking
on the phone with his daughter in Seoul.

264
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:11,659
Okay, Ji-yu.

265
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,359
Be good in kindergarten.

266
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,429
Listen to your grandmother.

267
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:18,669
Be well.

268
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,099
While the wife was grocery shopping,

269
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,769
Choi Kang-yoon was definitely alive.

270
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,139
As you can see, sir,

271
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,149
the National Forensic Service

272
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:36,409
{\an8}[Multiple Organ Failure: A critical condition where the function of multiple organs is severely impaired or lost.[

273
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:34,179
is viewing the possibility of death due to
respiratory distress from multiple organ failure

274
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,449
as the most likely scenario.

275
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,219
Unfortunately, it seems it'll be impossible to link

276
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:42,859
the Choi Kang-yoon death case to Woo So-jeong.

277
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:53,929
Send her away.

278
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,669
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

279
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,939
I'm sorry, I was wrong. I'm sorry.

280
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:29,499
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,849
Who are you trying to seduce?

282
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:45,089
Crazy bastard.

283
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,199
The stuff headed for Japan,

284
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,729
he said the police seized it and gave it to him,

285
00:16:57,729 --> 00:16:59,569
so he had no choice but to take it.

286
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,339
Go to the underlings

287
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,509
and tell them to be more selective about the stuff they take.

288
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:06,969
Just because the cops hand it over,

289
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:10,379
they shouldn't just take whatever they're given like beggars.

290
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,879
Yes, I'm sorry.

291
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,349
You're sorry? Then why do something to be sorry for?

292
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,359
You're the CEO, after all.

293
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,889
Manage your people a little.

294
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,389
Bang!

295
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:27,559
Bang, bang, bang!

296
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,959
What is wrong with you, seriously!

297
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,299
What are you looking at?

298
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:33,499
What are you looking at?!

299
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,039
How did you handle Dr. Choi?

300
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,409
Well, the broken seal, the diluted stuff,

301
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,009
he made a huge fuss, saying he'd checked it all,

302
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,479
so I just gave him a new one for now.

303
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,719
That bastard, judging by how he knew the condition of the product,

304
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:54,089
it doesn't seem like he's just passing it on.

305
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,019
It looks like he's administering it himself.

306
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,389
Look at this bastard.

307
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,429
Who's he giving it to?

308
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,129
He's probably doing illegal procedures.

309
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:05,129
What else could it be?

310
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:06,529
Are you an idiot?

311
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:09,799
He's using Benponarbital for cosmetic surgery?

312
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,639
There's tons of cheaper, easier to get stuff like propofol.

313
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,679
Still, Dr. Choi pays the best for the drugs.

314
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,509
He never haggles.

315
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,779
From now on,

316
00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:22,779
don't do business with him.

317
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,019
What great bond do you have

318
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,319
that you're taking such good care of a former cellmate?

319
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:29,759
What's your relationship?

320
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:40,099
From now on, if he calls, don't you dare answer.

321
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,279
Never, ever give my stuff to him again.

322
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,679
Understand?

323
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:00,519
Thank you.

324
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:03,319
Oh, Dr. Woo, you're here.

325
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,399
Hyun-woo, why are you...

326
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:09,799
One moment.

327
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,759
Yes, ma'am.

328
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:17,239
You told me to think about what I really want to do.

329
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,239
After thinking about it,

330
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,439
I wanted to organize my surroundings.

331
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,149
These are things I won't need soon,

332
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,279
and I wanted to share them with people who need them.

333
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,789
We're not proceeding immediately.

334
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,919
My friend needs to find a suitable location for you,

335
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,389
and we have to coordinate the schedule with other patients.

336
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:41,759
It might take some time.

337
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,599
Okay.

338
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,929
But just the fact that you promised,

339
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,269
I think I can endure it.

340
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:52,869
Please, just don't be too late.

341
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:59,849
Thank you.

342
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,319
- Follow me, please.
- Okay.

343
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,719
The intubation tube was blocked, so he couldn't breathe.

344
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,219
I performed a tracheotomy,

345
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:45,899
{\an8}[Suction: The procedure of clearing blood and
fluids from the airway to restore breathing.]

346
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:43,259
so if you suction through here, it will be easier for him to breathe.

347
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,089
Phew.

348
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:45,909
That's a relief.

349
00:20:47,489 --> 00:20:48,329
Doctor.

350
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:51,169
It's alright now.

351
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,709
Thank you, Dr. Woo.

352
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,139
Since we don't have a resident doctor,

353
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:03,739
it's always like this.

354
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,149
The sisters were so flustered,

355
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:09,319
they just called you blindly, even though it's not your volunteer day.

356
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,089
I was planning to come by anyway, I had something for you.

357
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,089
Please take this. It's a donation.

358
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,989
My goodness, what is all this?

359
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,399
I'll accept it gratefully.

360
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:26,869
I'm doing it for my own peace of mind.

361
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:29,369
I'm doing it for selfish reasons, so please don't feel burdened.

362
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,809
Is that so? Then from now on, should I only bow this much?

363
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:33,969
Thank you.

364
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,709
I have tomorrow off.

365
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:38,609
Since I'm here, I'll see some of the other patients before I go.

366
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:40,949
Oh, would you? That would be great.

367
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:42,619
But what should I do?

368
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,949
I have a visitor downstairs.

369
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:47,649
Don't worry, I can manage on my own.

370
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:49,359
But still, I should help you.

371
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,689
It's a friend I haven't seen in a very long time.

372
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,359
He's a friend who used to live at the orphanage where I worked.

373
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:57,699
He just showed up suddenly after so long.

374
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,599
My goodness, I was so happy to see him.

375
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,239
He's become so cool.

376
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:05,169
Tall and handsome.

377
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:09,309
Are you by any chance talking about Cho Hyun-woo?

378
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:12,349
Yes, Hyun-woo.

379
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:15,619
My, Dr. Woo, how do you know Hyun-woo?

380
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,519
He briefly stopped by our hospital for treatment.

381
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:21,759
Really?

382
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:27,159
Wow, what a coincidence.

383
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,459
Goodness. Well then, I'll...

384
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:32,869
By the way,

385
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:34,999
is anything wrong

386
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,299
with Hyun-woo?

387
00:22:39,439 --> 00:22:40,269
Oh.

388
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:43,309
It was something minor.

389
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:45,679
Go on downstairs. He must be waiting.

390
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:47,109
Ah, yes.

391
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,519
Thank you.

392
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,839
I think my eyes are going to fall out.

393
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,839
Why is Jo Su-yeong's mother's name so common?

394
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,879
Among all these Lee Ji-yeongs,

395
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,579
how am I supposed to find Jo Su-yeong's mom? Seriously.

396
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:20,309
Why are you sitting here?

397
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:23,239
Is the pain severe?

398
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,409
No, the pain is fine now.

399
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,349
My vision suddenly became blurry on my way down.

400
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:32,649
It's been happening often lately.

401
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:36,619
It's because the tumor is pressing on your optic nerve.

402
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,359
I heard.

403
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:40,329
That it will get progressively worse.

404
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,329
You can go on ahead.

405
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:43,929
It'll take me a little longer.

406
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:56,739
Let's go down together.

407
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,249
I know you're the type of
person who can't rely on others.

408
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:07,349
I'm a similar type of person,

409
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,359
but let's go down together.

410
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:42,489
Why do you do this work?

411
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:46,259
Helping people who are dying.

412
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,899
I think that people

413
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:56,199
should be able to choose their life and death.

414
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,869
Because death is not a crime.

415
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:07,209
We help people spend their final moments

416
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:11,219
in the place they most want to be.

417
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:16,089
When you think of your happiest place, Hyun-woo,

418
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,429
contact me.

419
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:22,329
I will.

420
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:49,589
- Para-para-para-pam!
- Hey, stop.

421
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:51,729
- Stop, don't do that.
- Oh, okay.

422
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:57,899
Did your dad really buy
you this expensive motorcycle?

423
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,129
Then, your fa...

424
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,469
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

425
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:02,669
Oh, no.

426
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,539
Gosh.

427
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,609
It seems like your dad is feeling
really sorry to spend this much.

428
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:11,179
How about you just talk it out and make up?

429
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,389
What?

430
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,319
It's my funeral portrait.

431
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:27,689
It's true I said I wanted to take it first,

432
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:29,859
but who wants to take it in a school uniform?

433
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,899
I know, right? Your school uniform is pretty crappy.

434
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:35,099
Some kids would probably transfer just because they hate wearing it.

435
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:35,939
Right?

436
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:37,569
If that's the case, they might as well

437
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,239
just use my student ID photo for the portrait.

438
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:43,309
My father wants his way with everything.

439
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,009
Then you should have said so when you were taking the picture.

440
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:46,409
That you wanted to wear different clothes.

441
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:52,019
There was one time I was secretly riding a motorcycle

442
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:53,989
and ended up in the hospital with a broken leg.

443
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,259
As soon as he came to the hospital, he immediately...

444
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:04,099
That was a bit too much on your father's part, isn't it?

445
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:06,969
He beat me so badly for riding the motorcycle before,

446
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,399
and now that I'm dying,

447
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,169
he suddenly buys me this expensive motorcycle.

448
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,769
Aren't you riding this motorcycle because you like it?

449
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:16,979
This motorcycle...

450
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,779
it's something I really dreamed of, so I rode it.

451
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:23,119
It's something I wanted to ride so badly,

452
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:26,219
but riding it while I'm sick, it wasn't fun at all.

453
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,619
That made me even angrier.

454
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:31,429
That he's buying it for me now,

455
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,129
when I can't even ride it anyway.

456
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,359
So you suddenly want to die?

457
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:38,399
Without even talking to your father?

458
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,899
Didn't he say to just let me do what I want?

459
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,169
Hey, still, you have to tell your father.

460
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,709
If you just go like this, how difficult will it be for him?

461
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:47,909
Can't you just...

462
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,379
can't I just die in peace?

463
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:51,509
Are you on such good terms with your own father?

464
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,479
Let's just do it for him.

465
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,429
I won't force you to make up with your father.

466
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:07,059
But do you have any regrets?

467
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,559
Things that weigh on your mind,

468
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,299
or things you need to sort out?

469
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,929
Are you okay with leaving just like this?

470
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,339
It's a shame that I've never

471
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,839
dated a girl, but...

472
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,669
Wait a minute.

473
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:25,509
No way, you've never had any experience at all?

474
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:27,819
Like kissing or s-s...

475
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,359
So you're saying that until now

476
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:32,849
that mouth of yours has only
been for eating and talking,

477
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,089
and you've never done anything else?

478
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,759
There was a girl I wanted to date, but...

479
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:37,289
It's that age, you know.

480
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,489
Hey, hey, hey! He can't do it!

481
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,399
He can't die. He says he's a virgin.

482
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,429
How can we let a kid like this die?

483
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:43,899
I can't. I absolutely can't.

484
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:46,999
His regret will be so deep, he'll start
appearing in my dreams the very next day.

485
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,369
What are we supposed to do?
I don't even have time to confess.

486
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:50,939
Why don't you have time?

487
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:54,639
If you just tell her honestly, you and her right now...

488
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,339
you could do anything except get married.

489
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:58,879
- No way.
- No way?

490
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,879
You know,

491
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,589
women have something called a maternal instinct.

492
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:06,419
She...

493
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,189
She's my college classmate,

494
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:12,229
and because of that,

495
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,359
she's been sticking with me all this time.

496
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,399
She's practically my mother.

497
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,699
- Mo-mother?
- A mother.

498
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:20,599
What are you going to do?

499
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,369
Leave it to a professional.

500
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:27,169
- Go.
- Where?

501
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:29,679
Go call her right now.

502
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,149
No need to add anything, just tell her the situation as it is.

503
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:33,449
Say you like her,

504
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,919
and that you want to see her before you die.

505
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,849
Will she really come?

506
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:40,919
Don't doubt it.

507
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:42,159
In the process,

508
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,319
if any questions come up, as a man, call me.

509
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,559
I'll get you whatever you need, whether it's medicine or advice.

510
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,459
Can't you just go with me?

511
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:50,799
- Should I?
- Yes.

512
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,929
Let's go.

513
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:17,859
There's a place I want to go with you, doctor.

514
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,359
Until I became an adult and independent,

515
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,469
I lived in this orphanage.

516
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:31,739
Were you happy when you lived here?

517
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:41,819
When I first left here, I moved out to a
small, cheap, one-room accommodations.

518
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:45,089
When I lay down to sleep at night,

519
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,289
it was strangely too quiet.

520
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:51,289
Being alone...

521
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:53,929
I realized that

522
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:58,229
when I lived at the orphanage, I wasn't lonely.

523
00:31:58,229 --> 00:31:59,799
That's what I thought.

524
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:24,729
You told me to think of my happiest place,

525
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:26,889
but I'm not sure about that.

526
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:29,529
When I was young,

527
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,599
there's a neighborhood nearby where I lived with my parents.

528
00:32:33,069 --> 00:32:35,639
It's about to be redeveloped, so there are a lot of empty houses.

529
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,109
I think I can rent one for a month.

530
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:43,039
You want to go there?

531
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:51,449
Hey, hey, hey.

532
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:54,719
You should have told me she might have a late-night study session.

533
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,859
I told you, didn't I?

534
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:58,729
Hye-jeong is different from me.

535
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,759
She's good at studying,

536
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,499
and she's good at drawing.

537
00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:06,629
Most importantly, unlike me, she has something she wants to do.

538
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,339
She's not an easy person to approach.

539
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:11,869
Hey, have you...

540
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:13,469
did you make some big mistake when you fought with her before?

541
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,709
Did you make a big mistake?

542
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,579
No, it wasn't anything like that.

543
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:20,679
We've been friends since we were young,

544
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:23,819
but we got into a fight when she told me not to hang out with certain kids.

545
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:26,419
I argued with her.

546
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,019
She was right.

547
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,789
Well then, you can just confess to her.

548
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:32,289
She probably doesn't even know I like her.

549
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:33,689
How absurd would that be for her?

550
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,199
Confessing right before I die.

551
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:37,359
So, without even trying, you're going to d...

552
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:40,469
...to leave?

553
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:41,939
Well?

554
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,839
I've had a long history of unrequited love, so I know.

555
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,869
Listen, Su-yeong, listen, okay?

556
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,279
When it comes to confessions, there's something called timing.

557
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,249
Mister, you like that doctor lady, don't you?

558
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,579
I missed the timing.

559
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,489
Jeez, the things I'm saying.

560
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:02,619
When will this late-night study session end?

561
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:04,219
I'm so bored I could die.

562
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:05,559
Seriously!

563
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,329
Saying "I could die" in front of someone who is dying is a bit...

564
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,399
Sorry, sorry.

565
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,939
Sorry, that was a bit thoughtless of me. I'm sorry.

566
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:23,709
Oh, she's out. Hye-jeong.

567
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:27,149
Where? Who, who, who?

568
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,319
Over there, there, there. The one pushing the wheelchair.

569
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:35,419
Oh?

570
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:38,759
Hey.

571
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:39,829
Hey, you...

572
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:42,899
you've got some serious taste, kid.

573
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,369
That friend's wheelchair,

574
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:49,799
Hye-jeong has been pushing it since elementary school.

575
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,469
Wow.

576
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,869
Isn't she cool?

577
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:55,109
That's totally admirable.

578
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:55,939
Hey.

579
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:58,509
It's not that you're lacking in ability,

580
00:34:58,509 --> 00:35:01,049
it's just that your standards are a little high, huh?

581
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:03,379
If that's the reason, then the fact you've been single all this time,

582
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:05,589
I can totally understand.

583
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:11,629
Wow, she's so nice. Where is she going?

584
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:13,189
Huh?

585
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,099
She's leaving right away.

586
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:17,829
Hey, hey, hey, Su-yeong, you have to stop her. Stop...

587
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:20,569
Su-yeong, Su...

588
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:22,369
- Su-yeong, Su-yeong!
- Wait a minute.

589
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,509
- What?
- Just a second.

590
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,449
Do you not want to see your mother?

591
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,519
You can't find her.

592
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:39,549
She went into hiding because she hates my dad.

593
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:41,889
Should I try to find her?

594
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:43,589
Don't bother.

595
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:46,559
We were separated when I was young, so I don't even remember her well.

596
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:24,619
This was the only place open at this hour.

597
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,789
I'm fine, but you...

598
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,399
Here, eat up.

599
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,369
If it's not enough, just ask for more, okay?

600
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:39,799
This is nice. The smell of the rice is nice too.

601
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:41,869
I'm glad.

602
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,679
I just saw you smile for the first time.

603
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:50,849
Oh.

604
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:57,719
Thinking that it's all over now makes me feel at ease.

605
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,729
If the headaches get bad, tell me anytime. Don't endure it.

606
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,199
Okay.

607
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,669
Looking at your documents,

608
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:16,469
from new drugs to clinical trials, there's nothing you haven't tried.

609
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:23,179
After trying so hard to live,

610
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:26,349
why did you suddenly want euthanasia?

611
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,789
Because I tried everything.

612
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,359
I tried everything, but nothing worked.

613
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,429
Because I tried everything,

614
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:44,839
that's why I am able to give up.

615
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:56,379
Thank you.

616
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:01,219
Dig in.

617
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:19,939
If I look further,

618
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,509
maybe there's a clinical trial with meaningful results.

619
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:23,709
Stop it.

620
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:25,839
You've seen all the data.

621
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,279
He's tried everything he could.

622
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:30,249
And didn't you already promise Cho Hyun-woo you'd do it?

623
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:32,549
He probably didn't give up because he really wanted to.

624
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,989
It was because there was no other way.

625
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:37,659
Aren't you the one who can't give up?

626
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:45,729
I know you feel sorry for Cho Hyun-woo and that's why you're so invested,

627
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:49,299
but it's time to let him go.

628
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,699
He had a stronger will to live than anyone.

629
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,569
This isn't the first time you've
misunderstood a patient's wishes.

630
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,399
That's right, Cho Hyun-woo
received chemotherapy

631
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:12,519
and participated in
clinical trials with us.

632
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:14,649
The progress is just as you saw.

633
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:16,889
We couldn't even slow down the rate of progression.

634
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:18,889
You said the last time he received it was three months ago, right?

635
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,389
So in that time, is there anything new he could try,

636
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,029
like a new treatment method?

637
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,329
Even something still in the research phase.

638
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,799
Live here for a month and if you want to live longer, let me know.

639
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,869
It will be great once you start living here.

640
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:37,339
- Is it a deal?
- Yes.

641
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:45,749
It's really delicious.

642
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:47,549
Did you use your day off yesterday for this?

643
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:49,449
Oh, of course.

644
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:52,459
Food has a perfect temperature, you know.

645
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,429
So you could eat it before you left work,

646
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,759
I steamed them at home right on time.

647
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:58,329
And these sweet potatoes,

648
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,899
Dr. Woo bought them for me from Gangwon-do.

649
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:05,569
Wow, this really brings back childhood memories.

650
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:08,769
I'd eat sweet potatoes my grandma steamed,

651
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,509
and if she made barley rice for dinner that night,

652
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,409
I'd just mix it all up and eat it.

653
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:14,749
It's almost lunchtime.

654
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:16,479
Shall we all head to a barley rice place next?

655
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:18,679
- Sounds good.
- Right?

656
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,549
My treat. Shall we all go together?

657
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,349
That sounds great.

658
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:24,559
I...

659
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:27,259
You're not going to say you're not coming, are you?

660
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:29,429
I have a personal matter I need to take care of urgently.

661
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:32,029
Just a moment.

662
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,929
I steamed all these sweet potatoes,

663
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,739
and now my arm feels like it's about to fall off.

664
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:38,939
Are you really going to do this?

665
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,239
I want to make you the head of ER,

666
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,039
and I want to become the head nurse.

667
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,979
If you're so uncooperative,
we'll become rainy-season pigs.

668
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:48,709
Rainy-season pigs?

669
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,379
Haven't you seen the 10 o'clock news?

670
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:52,219
The ones swept away by the floodwaters during the rainy season,

671
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,019
not even knowing where they're being carried off to,

672
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:56,019
the pigs that are endlessly swept downstream.

673
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:58,459
Unlike dogs, pigs have short limbs,

674
00:41:58,459 --> 00:41:59,659
so they can't swim well

675
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:02,259
and are just carried away by the unknowable current.

676
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:06,029
Simply put,

677
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:07,799
at this rate, you and I,

678
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:11,669
won't get promoted and will be pushed out of the hospital.

679
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:14,269
Personnel changes are coming up,

680
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:17,439
so please, just cooperate for a few hours.

681
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:20,239
Okay.

682
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:24,249
Did you find the paper I asked for?

683
00:42:24,249 --> 00:42:26,319
Not a paper, but there's a clinical trial.

684
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,119
It's a study in the US, and they're looking for applicants now.

685
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,359
From what I can see, it looks quite promising.

686
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:34,789
Really? What kind is it? When does it start?

687
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,589
Because of security protocols, it's difficult over email.

688
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:38,959
If you have time to come by, I'll show you the data they sent.

689
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:40,299
Okay.

690
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:42,299
I'll head to the research lab right now.

691
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,169
Huh?

692
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,799
I'm sorry, I have something urgent.

693
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:48,309
Enjoy your meal. I'm sorry.

694
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:50,439
Hey, wait, Dr. Woo! Dr. Woo!

695
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:51,909
But...

696
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:01,889
- Yes?
- Where are you now?

697
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:04,459
I just finalized the contract for that house.

698
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:06,519
Okay, then I'll come to you.

699
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:20,299
Where are we going now?

700
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:24,109
The person in charge of the clinical
trial you were in was someone I knew.

701
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:26,539
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,679
I got the call so suddenly,

703
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:29,379
I didn't have time to tell you.

704
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:32,819
They're looking for applicants for a new clinical trial in the US.

705
00:43:33,149 --> 00:43:34,389
The treatment is free,

706
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:36,919
and I can cover the living expenses in the US.

707
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:38,519
So let's go together and listen to what they have to say.

708
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,819
That...

709
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:40,689
you want me to do that again?

710
00:43:40,689 --> 00:43:42,459
There's a chance this time.

711
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:44,799
The first trial showed meaningful results.

712
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:47,299
It couldn't even get rid of the tumor, it just ruined my body.

713
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,029
The only healthy thing in my body right now is the tumor.

714
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,239
I know.

715
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:53,669
But it's a waste of all the effort you've put in so far.

716
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:55,669
- Just one more time...
- Stop it.

717
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,009
I said stop it.

718
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:03,579
You know very well how much I'm suffering.

719
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:05,419
How can you suggest that to me so easily?

720
00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:11,319
I think I misjudged you.

721
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:17,429
- Stop the car.
- Hey, I...

722
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:32,409
I know it's hard, but please think about it again.

723
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:34,279
You're just like all the other doctors.

724
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:36,079
You say you understand,

725
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,679
but you don't care how hard it is for
the patient or how much pain they're in.

726
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,619
I'll handle my own life.

727
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:43,289
Let's end the consultation here.

728
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:46,059
You're the one who wanted to live so badly

729
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,559
that you went through all those clinical trials.

730
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:48,989
So why are you suddenly

731
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:50,559
trying to give up everything so easily?

732
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,999
I did want to live.

733
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:53,999
But not anymore.

734
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,599
I brought some porridge.

735
00:45:29,629 --> 00:45:30,899
Want to get up and eat some?

736
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:32,769
I'm sleepy.

737
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,939
I'll eat it later.

When Cho Hyun-woo came into the ER,

00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:42,469
the owner of the delivery company was listed as his guardian.

750
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:57,209
All I got was a call saying he quit.

751
00:47:57,209 --> 00:48:00,049
He did write down an address when he started working,

752
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:02,489
but I don't know if he still lives there.

753
00:48:03,649 --> 00:48:06,559
He just disappeared without a word,

754
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,089
so I kept his room empty for now.

755
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:10,289
Is something wrong?

756
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:13,359

Ah, I remember this person.

759
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,709
He came in with a sudden fever,

and he asked for an ibuprofen-based one.

764
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:10,489
I remember him because not many customers are that specific.

Yes.

If your eyes don't close,

780
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:29,599
it can lead to vision damage later.

Do you know he is sick?

It's not a fatal illness or anything, is it?

790
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:24,489
It's a brain tumor. It's very serious.

He's still so young, I thought no way. Goodness.

Do you happen to know where Hyun-woo lives?

I can't get in touch with him right now either.

Yes, that's her, that woman.

- Move it.

Hey, what's wrong with you? Damn it.

849
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:34,379
Can't I even beat my own wife?

850
00:54:34,379 --> 00:54:36,779
- Go quietly, quietly.
- Seriously.

851
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:38,189
Let's go to the station and talk.

Were you working again?

859
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:05,879
Yes.

860
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:08,719
I have to earn money.

861
00:55:12,819 --> 00:55:14,319
I went to the place you used to live.

862
00:55:18,029 --> 00:55:18,929
I moved.

863
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:21,629
I spend more time lying down now,

864
00:55:21,629 --> 00:55:23,499
so I figured there was no need to live in Seoul.

865
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:28,569
But I came because I felt I should stop by here at least once.

866
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:33,339
I was sorry about last time.

867
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:36,179
Without asking for your consent,

868
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,349
I asked you to try a treatment again.

869
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:42,479
I made a mistake.

870
00:55:44,749 --> 00:55:45,749
No, it was me.

871
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:48,459
I was being sensitive.

872
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,089
I'm sorry for getting angry.

873
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:55,229
Thank you for today.

874
00:55:57,129 --> 00:55:57,969
But...

875
00:55:59,029 --> 00:56:01,299
from now on, don't get involved
in dangerous situations like this.

876
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,569
Do I have a "next time"?

877
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:10,579
It's right for someone like me
to step up in situations like this.

878
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:23,319
Your hair looked uncomfortable.

879
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:25,729
It's nothing.

880
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:30,299
I just saw it while I was making a delivery and bought it.

881
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:32,169
Take it.

882
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:43,479
Thank you.

883
00:56:49,149 --> 00:56:49,979
Is that how

884
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,389
you want to end it?

885
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:56,159
Do I still

886
00:56:57,729 --> 00:56:59,459
not meet your criteria, doctor?

887
00:57:02,859 --> 00:57:03,699
No.

888
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:07,199
Hyun-woo, you perfectly meet

889
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,469
my criteria for consultation.

890
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:13,809
You've been diagnosed as incurable by three or more doctors.

891
00:57:15,609 --> 00:57:19,979
You have unbearable physical and mental suffering.

892
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:24,179
And you're experiencing pain that isn't reduced by medication.

893
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:29,019
Then why do you keep hesitating?

894
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:34,529
These numbers...

895
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:39,029
they all say that you're going to die.

896
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:48,309
But I want you to live.

897
00:57:51,379 --> 00:57:54,379
Even though I know all too well

898
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:56,549
what a terrifying story these numbers are telling,

899
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:03,189
I still want you to live.

900
00:58:18,669 --> 00:58:20,209
Hey, hey, Hyun-woo!

901
00:58:22,209 --> 00:58:23,439
Hey, Cho Hyun-woo!

902
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:24,749
Oh, I'm sorry.

903
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,159
Hey.

904
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:00,109
Cho Hyun-woo.

905
00:59:08,389 --> 00:59:18,389
{\an8}Get your k-fix @ SinFlix!

906

QC by Linja

907
00:59:19,938 --> 00:59:22,629
[Guest Appearance: Park Won-sang, Lee Won-jung]

908
00:59:42,032 --> 00:59:44,572
- Choi Kang-yoon's wife came to see me.
- What?

909
00:59:44,572 --> 00:59:47,572
I think we need to be careful for a while. We only have one dose of the drug left.

910
00:59:47,872 --> 00:59:49,342
When that bitch brings the drug,

911
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:52,242
make sure to ask her about the euthanasia process first.

912
00:59:52,242 --> 00:59:53,842
Cho Hyun-woo, who was admitted

913
00:59:53,842 --> 00:59:54,912
to the hospice, has disappeared.

914
00:59:54,912 --> 00:59:57,212
I just want to die today.

915
00:59:57,212 --> 00:59:59,612
I desperately need Benponarbital right now.

916
01:00:00,752 --> 01:00:03,182
I want to handle Hyun-woo's departure by myself.

917
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,992
Fine. You two probably need to get your affairs in order.

918
01:00:05,992 --> 01:00:08,292
I'll send you off at the place you want.

919
01:00:09,642 --> 01:00:11,212
What should I do first?
