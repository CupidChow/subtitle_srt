00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:31,861
Mi-na, are you... are you okay?

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,095
Are you okay?

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,768
What the hell are you doing?

12
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,405
I wanted to end it, but...

13
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:45,441
I kept failing.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,652
What are you doing?

15
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:58,988
You were home, so why didn't
you show up for our dinner date?

Don't tell me you were
trying to commit suicide.

19
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:16,772
- No, it's not suicide.
- Then what?

20
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:21,243
Who are you trying to kill?

21
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:23,946
I'm going to kill someone, but...

22
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:27,717
it's not murder.

23
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:57,280
You said it too.

24
00:01:58,214 --> 00:02:01,250
That for someone in great pain,
death might be a better choice.

25
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:04,787
It's too dangerous.

26
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,689
I'll take you to the hospital.

27
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:10,426
It's hell.

28
00:02:12,662 --> 00:02:14,363
I don't want to live, not even a little.

29
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:19,168
Every single second is so painful.

30
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,571
Please help me.

31
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,891
You said you used to live in this
neighborhood when you were young.

32
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:44,660
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,965
That was...

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,636
when my family was at its poorest,

35
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:58,574
but it was also the happiest.

36
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:05,548
Thanks, Dae-hyeon.

37
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,967
Go outside and keep an eye on the alley,
see if anyone comes.

38
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:27,570
It won't take long.

39
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:37,079
Goodbye.

Mi-na.

44
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:16,812
I killed her.

45
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:23,219
So get out of the way.
I don't need a lawyer anymore.

46
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,720
Get a grip.

47
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:28,724
The reason Woo So-jeong was arrested
is because of Lee Eun-hee's death.

48
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:31,060
Even if you admit to the issue
with your ex-girlfriend,

49
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,161
it won't change anything.

50
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:35,064
I started it all.
How many times do I have to say it?

51
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,501
I was the one who got
the drugs from Kim Si-hyun,

52
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,436
and I'll say that I ordered everything.

53
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,875
If you're going to confess,

54
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,743
call them yourself.

55
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:52,782
No one in your family
wanted to let you know,

56
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:56,185
but your younger sister is getting
married at the end of this month.

57
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,356
The reason your parents paid
me a large sum to represent you

58
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:02,758
wasn't because they
believe you didn't do drugs.

59
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,362
It was to keep you out of jail,
at least until your sister's wedding.

60
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:08,531
"I don't want to see you again,"

61
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:10,600
"but at least, as my brother, please stay quiet."

62
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,270
That was the message
your sister asked me to give you.

63
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:28,884
You can go home now.

64
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:30,853
Why are you letting me go all of a sudden?

65
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,989
Because someone came forward,
saying they killed Ms. Lee Eun-hee.

66
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,927
Father Yang?

67
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:45,268
In what way did you kill her?

68
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,105
I used drugs.

69
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,040
What kind of drugs did you use?

70
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:57,179
I don't know that. I just...

71
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,348
I used various drugs from the hospital.

72
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,019
I saw what the doctors used in emergencies,

73
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:04,420
so I did the same.

74
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,957
You're saying you're the culprit without
even knowing what kind of drug you used?

75
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:09,425
I was in such a state of panic.

76
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,961
Ms. Lee Eun-hee was in so much pain,

77
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:13,496
and I just grabbed whatever I could.

78
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,465
Father Yang.

79
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,335
Get a grip.

80
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:22,672
The one who sinned is me.

81
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:25,241
Yes.

82
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:27,443
I killed her.

83
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:31,948
As a matter of investigative principle,
since someone has confessed,

84
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,283
we'll send you home for now.

85
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,484
It wasn't the priest.

86
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:37,787
Then are you going to confess that you killed Ms. Lee Eun-hee?

87
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:39,922
Father Yang didn't kill anyone.

88
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:44,427
If you're not going to admit to it yourself,

89
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:47,096
just go.

90
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,031
You know Father Yang didn't kill her!

91
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:52,101
You already think you're not guilty anyway.

92
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:55,338
Ms. Woo So-jeong

93
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:00,610
believes that what she did is not a crime.

94
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,645
So what can you do?

95
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:09,151
Have you ever considered that your misguided
beliefs will harm those around you?

96
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,492
I'll stay here too until the
autopsy results come out.

97
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:23,899
Are you so sure that Benponarbital
won't show up in the autopsy?

98
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:32,942
Is it out?

99
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:06,909
You can go.

100
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,445
Father Yang will be released soon too.

101
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,714
You've worked hard.

102
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:16,852
Ms. Woo So-jeong,

103
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:21,057
you've just missed
your last chance to stop.

104
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:30,733
I have no intention of stopping.

105
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,660
Have you seen Song-yi?

106
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,029
Now that you mention it, I haven't seen her.

107
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,597
She probably hasn't eaten lunch yet.

108
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:04,667
- I'll look around some more.
- Okay.

109
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,162
Why are you here?

110
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,197
Aren't you hungry?

111
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,305
Were you scared?

112
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,648
I have a brother.
A twin brother, five minutes older.

113
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:57,620
When we were scared,
we often hid in places like this.

114
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,558
But my brother taught me,

115
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,095
when you're scared, rather
than hiding in places like this,

116
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:09,231
going outside and playing with
friends is much less scary and better.

117
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:13,636
What do you think?

118
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,440
Want to go outside with me?

119
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:29,919

Doctor Woo.

129
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,109
You know Ye-na has a twin brother, right?

130
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,046
Since he was young,
he was often hospitalized here,

131
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,547
so you'll probably recognize
him if you see his face.

132
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:35,851
Yes, I think I've seen him before. But why?

133
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:38,821
He was brought into the ER,
and now he's admitted.

134
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,023
He says he wants to see you.

135
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,293
Ye-na's brother?

136
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:48,064
It seems he didn't know Ye-na had quit.

137
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:50,299
I think he wants to ask about that.

138
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,535
You volunteered with Ye-na,

139
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:55,037
so you're somewhat close to her.

140
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,850
I didn't know Ye-na had quit the hospital.

141
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:15,791
That's something I think you
should hear from Ye-na herself.

142
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:18,060
Okay.

143
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:22,765
Even without Ye-na, there's something
I need to tell you today, Doctor Woo.

144
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:31,207
You would have heard from
Ye-na that I have cystic fibrosis, right?

145
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:33,848
{\an8}[Cystic Fibrosis: A genetic disease causing severe,
full-body organ failure.]

146
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:33,848
Yes.

147
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:37,146
Then you must also know
that it has many complications,

148
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,381
so I'll get straight to the point.

149
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,816
I was in severe pain recently,

150
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:41,951
so I had a check-up,

151
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:45,288
and I was told I have
about three months left.

152
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:48,758
Does Ye-na know?

153
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,294
No.

154
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:58,501
I know what kind of
work you and Ye-na do.

155
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:03,472
Ye-na once left her phone
behind when she was taking care of me.

156
00:14:06,342 --> 00:14:10,112
I'm definitely not trying to blame you.

157
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:14,817
It may sound like an excuse,

158
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:16,919
but for patients who are incurable

159
00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:20,790
and whose pain cannot be
controlled even with painkillers,

160
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,758
we give it serious consideration.

161
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,394
Yes, I know the principles well.

162
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:27,863
So from the moment I
decided to meet you,

163
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,231
I've been preparing.

164
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,709
I know exactly what documents are needed.

165
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:44,847
Please give me that treatment, too.

166
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,731
Hello.

167
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,766
- Hello.
- Oh, you're here.

168
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,968
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

169
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:07,570
Were you worried?

170
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:10,506
- No.
- Oh.

171
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,541
You look good, thankfully.

172
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,443
Oh, really? Thank you.

173
00:15:14,443 --> 00:15:16,145
We received a lot of donated items.

174
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,480
A lot came in this time.

175
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,482
I should organize them well
and give them to those in need.

176
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:20,316
Okay.

177
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,353
Where's Song-yi?

178
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:26,055
Should Song-yi eat this?

179
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:31,193
- Wow, what's this?
- No, stop.

180
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:33,596
- Isn't this uncomfortable?
- I said, stop.

181
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:35,498
This is my mom's!

182
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:37,733
Oh, Song-yi.

183
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,838
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,955
It's not possible without Ye-na's consent.

185
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,796
Ye-na was saving up money because
she wanted me to have a lung transplant.

186
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:11,000
If you refuse me just
because I'm an acquaintance,

187
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,435
isn't that reverse discrimination?

188
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:18,007
I started this work with Ye-na.

189
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:21,310
And Ye-na has only ever performed
that treatment on patients who consented.

190
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:25,815
- First, try to persuade Ye-na.
- Doctor Woo.

191
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:28,317
I know you grew up with
just Ye-na, without parents.

192
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:30,820
As far as I know,

193
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,624
Ye-na is someone who has no other desire
except to take care of you, Geon-su.

194
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:39,528
If you made this decision alone,
she'll be shocked.

195
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:44,834
Geon-su, Ye-na needs
to know your choice, too.

196
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,438
You know she won't be able to accept it.

197
00:16:52,842 --> 00:16:53,676
I'm sorry.

198
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:03,753
Choi Geon-su!

199
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:06,822
Geon-su!

200
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:26,876
We received a tip the merchandise
is coming in under Kim Si-hyun's name tonight.

201
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,312
Kim Si-hyun will show up.

202
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,513
We have to catch him.

203
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,782
Don't worry about that.

204
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,951
After Kim Si-hyun was
caught and broadcast on TV,

205
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:39,088
we've received a lot of
prank-like tips using that name.

206
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,490
We've actually come up empty many times.

207
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:46,495
The tip this time is quite specific,
so I think we should check it out.

208
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:50,766
The narcotics unit already checked.

209
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,568
If that much drugs is coming in,

210
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:55,371
there should be some movement
from the big players, but there's none.

211
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:58,574
The guy who was caught smuggling
himself out was a Kim Si-hyun impersonator.

212
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:02,945
He even made the news as a big shot.

213
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:05,948
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry is
using the name Kim Si-hyun.

214
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,318
There's no certainty that
Benponarbital is coming in.

215
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:13,322
Leave the Benpo distribution
related stuff to the narcotics unit,

216
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,491
and just track Kim Si-hyun's
 disappeared car.

217
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:19,295
We still haven't figured
out the car's route.

218
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:23,699
Yes, sir.

219
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:28,037
If you wish, your team can
go and check it out once.

220
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,677
If anything suspicious
comes up, then by all means,

221
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:36,612
request backup.

222
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:41,083
Thank you.

223
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:58,266
[Detective Bu]

224
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:03,906
Yes, Detective Bu.

225
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:06,042
This is your last chance.

226
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:10,980
Persuade Choi Dae-hyun so that we
can catch Woo So-jeong at the scene.

227
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:13,282
Okay.

228
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:20,723
U-mi! I have to go out.

229
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,025
There's porridge, so go ahead and eat.

230
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,134
Choi Dae-hyun, where are you right now?

231
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:40,209
Ye-na doesn't know about her
brother's condition, does she?

232
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,278
No.

233
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:47,283
She's a friend who's
terribly good to her brother,

234
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,285
but if she hasn't come yet,

235
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:51,320
it seems she doesn't even
know he's hospitalized here.

236
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:55,491
Should I contact Ye-na?

237
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,226
It seems a guardian is needed.

238
00:19:57,893 --> 00:19:59,528
I'll meet her on my way home from work.

239
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,597
That would be good.

240
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:05,201
If you explain her
brother's condition to her,

241
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:07,703
it might be a little
easier for her to accept.

242
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:11,741
No matter how you explain
it, it will be hard to accept.

243
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:21,984
Song-yi, do you like the clothes?

244
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:25,354
Thank you for buying me the clothes.

245
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,658
Next time, I'll buy you
even puffier clothes.

246
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:36,799
Here, drink up.

247
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:41,671
Are you crazy?

248
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,439
How could you bring the child here?

249
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,740
She's Lee Eun-hee's daughter.

250
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,344
She has some separation anxiety
due to the shock, so I couldn't help it.

251
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:51,647
I think you're the
one with separation anxiety.

252
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:54,750
Right?

253
00:20:56,452 --> 00:21:00,556
Can single people not adopt?

254
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,691
Is it still like that?

255
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:06,562
Even if you're married, no country
gives drug offenders the chance to adopt.

256
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,367
If you want to take care of this child,

257
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,769
you know you can't be arrested, right?

258
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:18,841
The police said they'd give you another chance.

259
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:21,911
If you cooperate, you can get out of it.

260
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:23,980
Forget it. That conversation is over.

261
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,084
Think about it carefully.

262
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:34,023
It seems this child needs you
more than Woo So-jeong right now.

263
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:42,865
Hello, you're here.

264
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,339
Just in case, I didn't say anything,

265
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,175
but the hospital room Lee Eun-hee
used that day was all cleaned up,

266
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:54,844
and the items were
disinfected and disposed.

267
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:58,281
It was strange the portable oxygen
tank changed location, so I took care of it.

268
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:59,817
{\an8}[Portable O2 Tank: Allows patients with chronic lung disease to breathe outside of a hospital setting.]

269
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:02,051
Thank you.

270
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:07,757
Ye-na.

271
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:09,859
Yes?

272
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:17,166
Your brother collapsed, and he's
currently hospitalized in our hospital.

273
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,168
Is he in bad shape?

274
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,837
If he was sick, he should have called me.

275
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:24,073
Was he brought in alone?

276
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:31,147
You know that cystic fibrosis is a
disease with many complications, right?

277
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:33,549
Yes.

278
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:38,921
Not just the lungs, but pancreatic
function can also be greatly reduced.

279
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:41,223
Did he have a complication
with his pancreas?

280
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:46,128
Or has it progressed to cancer?

281
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:51,467
Oh.

282
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,569
No wonder.

283
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:56,505
I've had a feeling he's
been avoiding my calls lately.

284
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,408
It must have been because he
had a hard time telling me this.

285
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:03,913
Ye-na.

286
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:07,016
Yes.

287
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,884
Geon-su

288
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:12,459
knows what kind of work...

289
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,659
we do.

290
00:23:17,994 --> 00:23:18,828
And...

291
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,934
the treatment we're doing right now...

292
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:28,638
he wants us to use that treatment on him.

293
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:29,872
No.

294
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,574
No.

295
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,745
I know it's a shock.

296
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:38,814
But the person who is suffering
the most right now is Geon-su.

297
00:23:40,182 --> 00:23:42,251
Did you say you would do it?

298
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:43,452
No.

299
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:46,589
I said I couldn't without your consent.

300
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:49,225
What are you talking about?
You should have said of course not.

301
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,594
For my sake, at least,

302
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:54,463
you should have said you'd find a
way to save him, no matter what.

303
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:57,967
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,568
I know it's hard,

305
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:04,173
but I think it would be good for
you to have a talk with Geon-su.

306
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,275
He's the one who's suffering the most.

307
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,564
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,000
You've gone through a lot because of me.

309
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:34,737
I have something to tell you.

310
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,709
Lee Eun-hee's daughter will
be staying with me for a while.

311
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,645
Rather than staying here
at the hospital or the church,

312
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:45,548
I think she'll be more
comfortable at my house.

313
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:48,317
Dr. Woo.

314
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:52,388
You don't need to come
to our hospital anymore.

315
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:57,927
Dr. Woo, you acted in a way
that could be misunderstood,

316
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:00,563
and you've caused a lot of
trouble for those around you.

317
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,999
You did something you shouldn't have.

318
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:09,171
I don't want the patients and nuns at this
hospitble to get into trouble because of you.

319
00:25:09,572 --> 00:25:12,174
So don't come to this hospital ever again.

320
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:14,343
Got it?

321
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:19,048
And...

322
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:21,083
Dr. Woo,

323
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:22,852
absolutely

324
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:25,755
do not do anything that
could be misunderstood.

325
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,228
What if it's not a misunderstanding?

326
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:33,362
I said, don't do it.

327
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:35,531
Okay?

328
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:38,034
Dr. Woo.

329
00:25:39,235 --> 00:25:41,470
You must not get involved
in something like this again.

330
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:44,073
The thing the police mentioned...

331
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,645
what if I really did it?

332
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:00,823
I think it was a mistake.

333
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:02,758
Yes.

334
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:07,330
Does looking away make you feel better?

335
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,599
Because death is in the realm of God.

336
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,603
Humans shouldn't meddle in it.

337
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:18,140
Father Yang, you've conducted
many final prayers, so you know.

338
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:20,209
Before death,

339
00:26:20,776 --> 00:26:23,980
how many patients suffer
pain that is close to torture.

340
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:29,085
Because you're afraid of being blamed,

341
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:32,254
is it okay to ignore such suffering?

342
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,424
Just because you pretend not to see it,

343
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,295
does that mean the people
who are suffering disappear?

344
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:41,564
That is a sin.

345
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:45,768
I'll say it again.

346
00:26:46,435 --> 00:26:48,204
If something like this
happens one more time,

347
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:50,606
then I will step forward
and report you, Dr. Woo.

348
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,642
I will go out and testify.

349
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:54,243
So...

350
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:57,113
don't do it.

351
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,385
You're irresponsible,
just like back then.

352
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:10,860
The first person my mom
asked for help was you, Father Yang.

353
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:16,365
You did nothing back
then, either, Father Yang.

354
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:21,524
You just stood by, even as I realized that as
a child, I had no choice but to help my own mom.

355
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:39,622
What are you doing over there?

356
00:27:39,622 --> 00:27:41,958
What? What did you say?

357
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,992
You scared me.

358
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:45,661
- What are you doing over there?
- What? Oh.

359
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:49,365
I was drinking water.

360
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:50,933
I was thirsty.

361
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,609
What's wrong wth him?

362
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,378
Why are you like this?

363
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:05,481
Why are you drinking water so fast?

364
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:14,090
Come on! Yes!

365
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,659
The tip came in again, just
with a different time and place.

366
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:18,828
The informant's tip is very specific.

367
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:21,118
They know that the drugs
the police had reported missing

368
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:23,432
were inside Kim Si-hyeon's vehicle.

369
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:28,137
But the narcotics unit have
ruled the tip itself as false.

370
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:32,308
They just told us to keep digging
into the disappearance of Kim Si-hyun.

371
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:34,510
I heard they're crazy about
their performance record.

372
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,811
That's strange.

373
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:37,480
The situation is a bit strange right now.

374
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:41,751
The fact that Kim Si-hyun had
the drugs the police lost is strange.

375
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:43,886
Maybe there's an informant.

376
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:46,589
If the narcotics unit won't go,

377
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,491
we'll go.

378
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:51,427
Hey, if the narcotics
unit ruled it as false,

379
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:52,595
there'll be no support.

380
00:28:52,928 --> 00:28:54,330
It's too dangerous for us alone.

381
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,265
If we go and need it,
we'll request support then.

382
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:00,603
Let's just do it ourselves.

383
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:03,406
Information could leak
from inside the police force,

384
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,975
let's say we're leaving early,

385
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:08,277
and meet up again later.

386
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:09,645
No.

387
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:11,480
Let's do it.

388
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:14,283
- No.
- Let's do it.

389
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,852
No. Where are you going again?

390
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:19,021
Where are you always going?

391
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,323
Let's do it.

392
00:29:20,623 --> 00:29:22,725
Song-yi, come down. Careful.

393
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:24,226
Here.

394
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:28,931
Song-yi, you have something on you.

395
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:31,300
- Where?
- Cuteness.

396
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,370
Wow, Song-yi has become so pretty.

397
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,938
We just came from the department store.

398
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:37,273
I was just waiting for you.

399
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:38,574
I was going to take Song-yi.

400
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:40,743
Now? You're taking her already?

401
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:44,146
Yes, I think it's better for her to
stay at my house than to stay here.

402
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:46,916
Oh, okay.

403
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,751
Jae-yoon will be there too. That's better.

404
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:53,756
Song-yi, I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

405
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,524
Be good at Dr. Woo's house, okay?

406
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,294
Oh, can I take Song-yi
out a little tomorrow?

407
00:29:58,294 --> 00:30:00,896
If the kids go to school,
Song-yi might be bored.

408
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:02,865
Okay, I'll tell her.

409
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:03,699
Okay.

410
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:07,036
But where did Ye-na go?

411
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:14,877
Ye-na's brother has requested my services.

412
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:17,213
Does Ye-na know?

413
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,415
Yes.

414
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,851
She's having a hard time.

415
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:35,464
Why didn't you tell me
about the complications?

416
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,234
Sorry.

417
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:46,375
Sorry?

418
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:49,979
I'm the one who should
be sorry for not knowing.

419
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:52,848
Starting tomorrow, I'll
look into things more.

420
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:55,551
If we look, maybe we'll
find a new treatment.

421
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,487
Can't we just stop?

422
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:06,829
Sorry.

423
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:11,267
I really want to stop now.

424
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,171
Why?

425
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:19,375
Why?

426
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:22,745
Why are you being so weak?

427
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:25,481
Don't you remember when you were young?

428
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:28,184
The hospital said you wouldn't live past 10.

429
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:29,919
But you're still alive now.

430
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:32,722
If we look into it further...

431
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:35,791
if we look into it further,
maybe another miracle will happen.

432
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,526
Living this long is the miracle.

433
00:31:38,494 --> 00:31:39,495
The miracle you made.

434
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:41,931
But...

435
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:44,000
I hate that miracle now.

436
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:46,502
I just want to be at peace.

437
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,137
Why are you like this, really?

438
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:52,441
You're a strong person.

439
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,812
You've endured worse than this, haven't you?

440
00:31:58,514 --> 00:32:00,783
Why is someone like that acting this way?
Is it because it's too hard?

441
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:03,319
Ye-na, please.

442
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:08,157
Just let me stop the treatment.

443
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:09,525
Aren't you being too much?

444
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:14,697
How have I lived until now?

445
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,502
You and I, from our mother's womb,

446
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:23,272
born at the same time
from the same womb,

447
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:26,375
how have we lived until now?

448
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,879
How can you do this to me?

449
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,682
How can you say that so easily?

450
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:38,020
What on earth am I to you?

451
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,722
I'm sorry, Ye-na. That's not what I...

452
00:32:39,722 --> 00:32:40,790
Forget it.

453
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:44,927
Don't bring it up again.

454
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,618
[The Late Lee Eun-hee]

455
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,126
There's no picture of your mom.

456
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:20,896
Next time we come,

457
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:23,165
let's draw a picture
of her face and bring it.

458
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,008
Mom is resting here now, without any pain.

459
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:36,879
So you can come see
her whenever you miss her.

460
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,549
Is this Mom's room now?

461
00:33:41,784 --> 00:33:42,618
Yes.

462
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,621
Then do I get to live here now too?

463
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:52,695
This is a place where people
like your mom come to rest.

464
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:55,765
But Song-yi, rather than just resting,

465
00:33:55,765 --> 00:33:58,334
you need to play, and study too,

466
00:33:58,334 --> 00:33:59,969
you have a lot to do, right?

467
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:02,772
So...

468
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,574
let's go to my house together.

469
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:08,911
To your house?

470
00:34:09,712 --> 00:34:10,546
Yes.

471
00:34:10,913 --> 00:34:13,683
I just want to go to my house.

472
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:19,355
Well, at my house, there's a
big sister and a big brother too.

473
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:22,658
- A big sister?
- Yes.

474
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:25,995
A very smart and kind big sister.

475
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:29,131
And the big brother is
about the same age as you.

476
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:30,633
It'll be really fun if you play together.

477
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:39,875
To the big sister and
big brother, I'm their aunt.

478
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:43,512
But to Song-yi...

479
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:45,781
I'll be your mom.

480
00:34:50,086 --> 00:34:55,558
I promised your mom that I
would take good care of you.

481
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,161
My loving mom, I'll do your hair.

482
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,530
Okay, what kind of hair
do you have, Song-yi?

483
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,272
Are you unable to leave because
you're worried about the child?

484
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,444
I'll take good care of the child.

485
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,413
I promise.

486
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,618
So rest easy and go.

487
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:31,227
So don't worry,

488
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:33,296
and let's go to my house.

489
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:50,212
I'm here because I received
a call from the social worker.

490
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:53,182
Yes.

491
00:35:53,182 --> 00:35:54,550
I got a call too.

492
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,890
Are you planning to take
her in, Ms. Woo So-jeong?

493
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:03,459
Yes.

494
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,996
Even if it's temporary, there
will be conditions for a guardian.

495
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:09,231
It could be a problem.

496
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,201
Yes.

497
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:14,503
But...

498
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,006
for the sake of the child,

499
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:20,309
I want to take care of her for a while.

500
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:29,151
Does taking care of the
child lessen your guilt?

501
00:36:30,419 --> 00:36:31,954
No matter how much you try to help,

502
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:35,925
when the child grows
up and learns about this,

503
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:38,194
do you think she won't resent you?

504
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:41,964
I don't care about that.

505
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:44,734
And I don't expect otherwise.

506
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,003
Just for now,

507
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:51,507
all I'm thinking is that my home might be
the most comfortable place for the child.

508
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,310
A social worker will contact you soon.

509
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,379
It will be impossible to
keep her permanently.

510
00:36:58,314 --> 00:37:00,383
There are problems, but if I
look into it, there will be a way.

511
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:06,255
You were a suspect in
Ms. Lee Eun-hee's death just a few hours ago.

512
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:10,926
To clear your name,

513
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:13,362
it's fine to think I'm
acting hypocritically.

514
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:15,298
Today,

515
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:18,200
please let me take the child home.

516
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:21,470
I'm asking you.

517
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:31,480
- Yes?
- Sir! I've arrived.

518
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,615
When are you coming?

519
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:49,420
Hey, Hye-rim, it's me.

520
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,046
That CEO we golfed with last time,
the terminal stomach cancer patient.

521
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:56,627
Oh, CEO Jin Young-soo.

522
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:59,196
Did he go to Switzerland?

523
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:00,464
He couldn't go.

524
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:02,633
His condition suddenly got
much worse, so he couldn't go.

525
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:04,802
It was almost impossible
from the beginning.

526
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:08,606
Going to Switzerland in such a
sick state, getting evaluated, and waiting.

527
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,410
Why are you suddenly so
curious about CEO Jin's condition?

528
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:14,412
Oh, well...

529
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:18,582
I think we might be able
to help him with Benpo.

530
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,084
Huh?

531
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,392
You said Benpo was hell last time.

532
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:29,727
You said it was hell.

533
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:33,898
I found someone with incredible
skill who can control Benpo perfectly.

534
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:34,765
A doctor.

535
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:41,706
Auntie.

536
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,942
I'll take Song-yi and
have her sleep in my room.

537
00:38:44,942 --> 00:38:47,111
You have frequent night shifts anyway.

538
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:53,651
If Song-yi is here, Jae-yoon
won't bother me to play with him.

539
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:55,720
I think it'll be more comfortable for me.

540
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,127
I feel like you're always
helping me out more.

541
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:05,096
Thank you.

542
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:35,426
Hide here for a minute.

543
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:37,862
- What are you doing?
- Think of it as hide-and-seek.

544
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:39,530
Open the door, you bitch!

545
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,000
You absolutely can't come
out until I open it, okay?

546
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,770
I said open the door!
Open the door, you bitch!

547
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,339
Hey! Open the door!

548
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,108
I said open the door!

549
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:54,045
Open the door! Shit!

550
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:57,348
You rotten bitch!

551
00:39:57,348 --> 00:39:59,050
- What are you doing?
- Bear with it.

552
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,952
You didn't get enough of
a beating today, did you?

553
00:40:00,952 --> 00:40:02,353
Is that it?

554
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:03,421
You want to die today?

555
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:05,523
Huh? Want to die?

556
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:07,625
Want to die?

557
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,327
Want to die?!

558
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:14,865
[Mourning]

559
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:39,724
Ye-na!

560
00:40:40,992 --> 00:40:42,526
Dad's here.

561
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:49,467
Geon-su.

562
00:40:50,968 --> 00:40:52,336
Open the door.

563
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:54,805
What are you doing not opening the door?

564
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,975
- Litte shits, today I'm gonna...
- Hide here for a minute.

565
00:40:57,975 --> 00:41:00,311
I'm going to kill you all! Open the door!

566
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:03,714
- Geon-su, Ye-na!
- Just think of it as hide-and-seek.

567
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:06,317
Until I open it for you,

568
00:41:06,317 --> 00:41:10,087
- you absolutely can't come out, got it?
- Open the door! You little shits.

569
00:41:11,455 --> 00:41:13,457
I'm going to kill you all today!

570
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,593
Open the door, you little shits!

571
00:41:17,828 --> 00:41:20,197
Little shits, so young and impudent.

572
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:22,967
What are you staring at, bastard?

573
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:24,268
You little shit!

574
00:41:24,268 --> 00:41:25,870
Little shit!

575
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,672
You prick, I'm your father!

576
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,776
- Father, stop it.
- You're going to die today!

577
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:33,577
Look down, you little shit!

578
00:41:40,418 --> 00:41:41,986
Geon-su.

579
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:52,330
It's okay.

580
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:00,471
It's okay, it's okay.

581
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:16,053
Sorry.

582
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,862
I was just thinking about
how I'd live without you.

583
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:27,932
And I just got angry first.

584
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:34,505
You'll do well.

585
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:39,143
Just... do whatever you want.

586
00:42:39,777 --> 00:42:40,945
Just live like that.

587
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:44,882
There's nothing I want.

588
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:50,655
I told you my wish was to live
happily with you for a long, long time.

589
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:52,857
Hey.

590
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:58,996
I was always sick and causing you trouble. What
do you like so much about a brother like me?

591
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:01,565
I do like you.

592
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,903
You're still my brother,
so of course I like you.

593
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:17,548
Sorry.

594
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,086
I'm sorry.

595
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:32,930
You...

596
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:37,001
do you really want to stop?

597
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:42,473
Are you serious?

598
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:49,113
Desperately.

599
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:54,719
Truly desperately.

600
00:43:56,687 --> 00:43:57,521
I want to.

601
00:44:31,222 --> 00:44:32,256
They're here, they're here.

602
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:45,670
Is that it?

603
00:44:46,671 --> 00:44:47,505
What's that?

604
00:44:47,972 --> 00:44:49,240
What's with the blonde guy?

605
00:44:53,544 --> 00:44:55,313
- You been well?
- Yes.

606
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:57,148
Right, your second child is a boy?

607
00:44:57,148 --> 00:44:58,416
A girl.

608
00:44:58,416 --> 00:45:00,184
I saw the picture and thought it was a boy.

609
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:01,352
- This is it?
- Yes.

610
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:16,067
They're opening it, they're opening it.

611
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:17,935
Hey, is it drugs?

612
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:27,178
What?

613
00:45:28,913 --> 00:45:29,780
What's this?

614
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,615
Damn it.

615
00:45:34,652 --> 00:45:36,621
- Did you order a late-night snack?
- No, I didn't.

616
00:45:36,621 --> 00:45:38,723
Are you here for a delivery? What is it?

617
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:40,491
Hey! Blondie!

618
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:41,659
Wow.

619
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:43,361
One, two, three.

620
00:45:43,728 --> 00:45:45,129
- Three of you?
- Yeah.

621
00:45:45,763 --> 00:45:47,298
Team! Move in!

622
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:49,634
Team, move in!

623
00:45:51,702 --> 00:45:52,937
Oh, shit.

624
00:45:57,074 --> 00:45:58,576
Should I call for backup?

625
00:45:58,576 --> 00:45:59,644
Didn't you call earlier?

626
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:01,345
No, you didn't say anything, so I...

627
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:03,447
Shit.

628
00:46:04,749 --> 00:46:07,518
What, are you scared?

629
00:46:08,486 --> 00:46:11,322
The helicopter is a little late.

630
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:12,823
Wow, there are a lot of them.

631
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,459
What the hell?

632
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:17,695
- Move in!
- Oh, shit.

633
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,801
It hurts, you bastard.

634
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:25,436
Easy, easy.

635
00:46:25,436 --> 00:46:26,604
Hey, grab it, grab it.

636
00:46:33,844 --> 00:46:34,679
Shit.

637
00:46:37,782 --> 00:46:40,184
It hurts, it hurts, you bastard.

638
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:42,920
Shit.

639
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:48,059
It hurts.

640
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,764
Crap.

641
00:46:53,764 --> 00:46:55,466
Crap, run! Let's go!

642
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:12,850
Shit.

643
00:47:25,229 --> 00:47:26,063
It's blocked.

644
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,732
What? Something flew at us. What's this?

645
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,370
Hey, hey, move the car! Move it!

646
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,738
It won't open, you bastard!

647
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:34,905
Hey, move, move!

648
00:47:35,506 --> 00:47:36,641
Hey, hey, shit!

649
00:47:37,008 --> 00:47:38,476
Move, move the car!

650
00:47:38,476 --> 00:47:41,312
Stop the car, you bastard! Get out!

651
00:47:42,013 --> 00:47:43,781
What are you doing? Hey, hit the pedals!

652
00:47:59,497 --> 00:48:00,665
Scared, you shit.

653
00:48:00,665 --> 00:48:02,466
Hey, shit!

654
00:48:11,475 --> 00:48:13,044
You crazy bastard.

655
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:18,549
- Shit!
- Cheol-su!

656
00:48:18,549 --> 00:48:19,584
Do-gun!

657
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,686
Shit!

658
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,123
Shit!

659
00:48:26,123 --> 00:48:27,792
I told you to request backup.

660
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:29,060
It's different from the movies.

661
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,661
Shit! Would it be the same?

662
00:48:31,028 --> 00:48:31,862
Shit.

663
00:48:49,413 --> 00:48:50,414
Get in quick.

664
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:56,387
Shit, you bastards!

665
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:00,524
I should have used this sooner.

666
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:10,701
- You okay?
- I'm alive, I'm okay.

667
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,210
Let's go! Where? Which way?

668
00:49:31,756 --> 00:49:33,591
Civilian car ahead. I'm sorry.

669
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:34,959
Sorry.

670
00:49:37,428 --> 00:49:39,230
Over there, over there. Ahead.

671
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,301
Those bastard cops.

672
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:46,570
- Stop the car, you bastard!
- Stop the car!

673
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:47,605
Sir, hit them.

674
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:49,440
Block this bastard!

675
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,208
Stop the car, you son of a bitch!

676
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,777
You think I'd stop, you bastard?

677
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:56,180
- Bring it on, you bastard.
- Come on, come on!

678
00:50:05,056 --> 00:50:07,291
- Stop!
- Hey, ahead, ahead!

679
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:08,125
What?

680
00:50:08,526 --> 00:50:10,494
Oh, shit, we're stuck.

681
00:50:12,496 --> 00:50:14,665
Look at this, you bastard! Step on it!

682
00:50:14,665 --> 00:50:17,368
Die, die, okay?

683
00:50:38,222 --> 00:50:40,625
- Up ahead.
- Oh, shit.

684
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:41,993
Dammit, shit.

685
00:50:53,471 --> 00:50:54,972
Shit!

686
00:51:12,273 --> 00:51:13,908
We may have lost them,

687
00:51:14,308 --> 00:51:15,610
but we secured the drugs,

688
00:51:16,778 --> 00:51:19,047
so we'll find another lead.

689
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,582
The narcotics unit showed
up after everyone was gone.

690
00:51:23,418 --> 00:51:25,486
How could they have known
about a drug shipment of this size

691
00:51:25,486 --> 00:51:27,188
and ruled it as false?

692
00:51:28,356 --> 00:51:31,025
I need to look into this again.

693
00:51:31,025 --> 00:51:32,460
Now that you mention it, that is strange.

694
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:38,466
- Yes.
- Detective Ban.

695
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:42,103
Vehicle 2123 was caught on
security camera on Route 1034.

696
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:43,538
Hey, Ji-hoon.

697
00:51:43,538 --> 00:51:44,839
Oh, shit.

698
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,862
I have a request.

699
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,370
I'm out of the drug right now,
so I can't take on any requests.

700
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,139
But the patient is in a hurry.

701
00:52:25,847 --> 00:52:28,349
It's a male patient,
born in '98, 27 years old.

702
00:52:29,317 --> 00:52:30,918
He has cystic fibrosis,

703
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:33,755
and has been given a terminal
diagnosis due to complications.

704
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:38,059
The family was against euthanasia,
so the patient continued to suffer,

705
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:41,696
but now the family has been
persuaded and made the request.

706
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:50,104
Who is the client?

707
00:52:53,307 --> 00:52:54,442
My brother.

708
00:53:03,484 --> 00:53:05,186
This is the last security camera footage.

709
00:53:08,523 --> 00:53:12,694
This road is the last place the vehicle
with license plate 27Na 2123 was captured.

710
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:16,297
From this fork in the road,
there's no more security footage.

711
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:19,934
Has anything else been
confirmed since then?

712
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:24,105
There are no security cameras
for about 80km from here,

713
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:25,707
but even after that,

714
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:28,943
vehicle 2123 was never captured on either road.

715
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:33,348
What about this way?

716
00:53:33,348 --> 00:53:35,116
There's a large lake this way.

717
00:53:35,116 --> 00:53:36,351
Then let's go this way.

718
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,320
If the car disappeared within a 100km radius,

719
00:53:40,121 --> 00:53:41,622
that's the only place it could have gone.

720
00:53:42,223 --> 00:53:43,925
Yes, sir.

721
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:19,560
Please send some divers here.

722
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:22,397
I'll text you the location.

723
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:28,836
Are you mentally prepared?

724
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:33,574
My brother desperately wants it.

725
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:38,513
What about you, Ye-na?

726
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:45,453
I've learned how much my
brother has been suffering,

727
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,223
so I promised I'd do it.

728
00:54:51,459 --> 00:54:52,727
Did I do the right thing?

729
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:12,747
I know how hard this is for you, Ye-na.

730
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:17,285
You'll probably keep thinking about it.

731
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:21,155
'Was this what my brother really wanted?'

732
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:24,359
'Did I do the right thing back then?'

733
00:55:30,064 --> 00:55:31,499
Since having this illness,

734
00:55:34,268 --> 00:55:35,770
Geon-su...

735
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,474
probably hasn't slept peacefully once.

736
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:49,717
Ye-na.

737
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,588
When I was young,

738
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,026
do you know what
choice my mother made?

739
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,875
My mother...

740
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:16,511
wanted death her whole life.

741
00:56:19,414 --> 00:56:21,315
And when she finally
got what she wanted,

742
00:56:24,452 --> 00:56:27,155
I was sad, but also resentful.

743
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,861
'She didn't think about us,
who would be left behind.'

744
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:48,910
But that wasn't it.

745
00:56:51,446 --> 00:56:53,414
My mom had prepared beforehand.

746
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:56,117
For the daughter she would leave behind.

747
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:02,523
That's when I realized.

748
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:06,694
Until I was that age,

749
00:57:07,895 --> 00:57:09,997
my mother

750
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,835
might have held on.

751
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:17,772
Mom is sorry.

752
00:57:19,741 --> 00:57:20,975
I love you.

753
00:57:27,148 --> 00:57:28,649
Only then did I feel sorry.

754
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:32,954
I made a sick person worry about me.

755
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:44,632
The reason Geon-su was able to
endure that difficult treatment process

756
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:50,038
was probably because he was worried
about leaving you behind alone, Ye-na.

757
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,741
The only thing we can do,

758
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:58,112
when the people we love are leaving,

759
00:58:01,616 --> 00:58:04,152
is to make sure they don't
have to worry about us.

760
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:07,455
That's all there is.

761
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:11,325
Yes.

762
00:59:01,149 --> 00:59:11,149
{\an8}Get your k-fix @ SinFlix!

763
00:59:01,149 --> 00:59:11,149
QC by Linja

764
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:27,969
I think I need to help Ye-na's brother.

765
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:29,404
Ye-na agreed too.

766
00:59:29,404 --> 00:59:30,838
Do you really have to meet that person?

767
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:32,607
You bitch!

768
00:59:32,607 --> 00:59:35,076
He wants to have a funeral before he dies.

769
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:37,412
Right, a living funeral is a good idea.

770
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:39,914
- How much can you give me?
- As much as you want.

771
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:43,518
Now that I'm at death's door,
what do I have to save?

772
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:46,654
It's just the beginning. Just do as I say.

773
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:49,757
Well, you could say I've
become a sort of good killer.

774
00:59:50,124 --> 00:59:51,793
Woo So-jeong's vehicle
location has been confirmed.

775
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:54,896
What have you done now?
