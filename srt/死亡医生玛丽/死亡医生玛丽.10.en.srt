1
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,937
This drama deals with the sensitive
issue of euthanasia

2
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,990
and may be disturbing
for some viewers.

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,330
Mr. Choi Dae-hyun.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,960
I need to speak with you in private.

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,430
You went there that day.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,260
To get medicine from him, right?

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,460
I have nothing to say.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,690
The supplier won't just stand by.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,260
If you tell me
about the drug dealer...

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,660
The police will also
keep it a secret.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,120
I'll help you.

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,660
So, can you accept my conditions?

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,860
I'll cooperate only if you promise me.

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,160
The bag you gave me last time...

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,260
Dr. Woo took it from me.

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,725
He had personally donated it.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,560
This is Chairman Gu Gwang-chul.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,325
Woo So-jeong wants to help
someone die.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,225
This is the day the client
has been waiting for.

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,960
So don't try to interfere.

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,025
Don't try to convince Woo So-jeong.

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,460
If you mess this up...

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,260
This time, you'll really die.

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,310
Woo So-jeong won't be safe either.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,610
If you and So-jeong want to do this...

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,895
Then bring us the medicine yourself.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Why?

28
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,925
I can give the medicine to the client
in advance.

29
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,960
Tell Woo So-jeong that you'll send
the medicine to the client.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,560
Then bring the drug yourself.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,210
Then So-jeong will know.

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,390
Anyway...

33
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,290
it's absolutely impossible.

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
It makes sense.

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
It's a good idea.

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,510
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

37
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,725
This isn't just your problem.

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,460
If you don't stop,
we could be in real danger.

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,390
I'll go too.

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,295
Let's go together.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,020
Choi Dae-hyun said he'd help
with the investigation.

42
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,855
He'll wear microphones and cameras.

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,260
Woo So-jeong, the main culprit.

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,755
Choi Dae-hyun is her accomplice.

45
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,225
Don't charge them with drug trafficking.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,660
Sure, I understand.

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,955
I'll go in with the mic, but...

48
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,990
I should be the main culprit.

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,455
That day, So-jeong did it
for the first time.

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,230
I did everything before that.

51
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,920
I did everything.

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,190
And that day...

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,220
they have to arrest...

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,320
the trafficker.

55
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,855
And please, keep your promise.

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,690
Anyway...

57
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,520
I always keep my promises.

58
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,020
I will.

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,160
Just stay by my side.

60
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,090
Where are the drugs?

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,960
Why can't I see them?

62
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,895
Wait until Woo So-jeong is ready.

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,495
The trafficker personally
takes them to her house.

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,090
This time, we'll arrest
the traffickers red-handed.

65
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,090
Why aren't you answering?

66
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,220
It's nothing.

67
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,320
Hello? Yes.

68
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,025
If you hadn't found me, you'd be dead.

69
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,925
Are you okay? No.

70
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,980
Yes, it's better if you die there.

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,590
It's easier that way, isn't it?

72
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,060
What's wrong?

73
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,390
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,480
MARY <font color="#ff0000">KILLS</font> PEOPLE

75
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,315
EPISODE 10

76
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,097
{\an8}What the hell?
Did he cover the camera with his clothes?

77
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,280
{\an8}The listening device was tampered with.

78
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,590
{\an8}Just say you're tired.

79
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,660
{\an8}I'm a little tired today.

80
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,860
{\an8}Today's session ends here.

81
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,860
{\an8}- Okay.
- Okay.

82
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,195
{\an8}This is better.

83
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,420
{\an8}Then today I'll just
write the session report.

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,995
Choi Dae-hyun.

85
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,495
Crazy bastard.

86
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,795
Do you think I'm an idiot?

87
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,995
This guy really...

88
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,590
Team leader, do you
know what you're doing?

89
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,690
What are you doing?

90
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,440
Woo So-jeong, what are you doing?

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,930
I'm giving a consultation.

92
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,614
CONSULTATION

93
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,665
The patient wants to be
transferred to a mental health center.

94
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,190
I just filled out the documents.

95
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,325
I'm leaving now.

96
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,490
Where are you going?

97
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,490
If the doctor is giving a
consultation to a patient,

98
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,595
why is the police working so hard?

99
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,760
It seems that...

100
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,940
It seems there's been a misunderstanding.

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
I just...

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,390
I want to ask Dr. Woo
to come to my house, please.

103
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,460
I don't know why you came here.

104
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,780
Please, before you leave,
apologize to both of them.

105
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,160
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

106
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,290
- Make yourselves at home.
- Sure.

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,020
You agreed to cooperate.

108
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,030
Are you pulling our leg?

109
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,195
Because I want to catch the dealers too.

110
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,925
I let him go to the scene,

111
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,230
but they already knew and escaped.

112
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,625
The situation is a mess.

113
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,595
What did you do without permission?

114
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,260
I was the first to suggest
this to Choi Dae-hyun.

115
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,420
Why don't you inform me?

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,390
You don't even trust me.

118
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,790
Is that why things are like this?

119
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,255
I screwed up.

120
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,795
Just arrest me.

121
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
Hey.

122
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,090
Shut up.

123
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,860
Please, arrest Choi Dae-hyun!

124
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,820
I'm no longer Choi Dae-hyun's lawyer.

125
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,525
He lied to the police and his own lawyer.

126
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,820
Arrest him.

127
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,290
Mr. Choi Dae-hyun.

128
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,260
You messed with the wrong person.

129
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,260
From now on, I'll do whatever
I want with Woo So-jeong...

130
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,160
because I'm no longer your lawyer.

131
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,990
Lawyer.

132
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,860
If you reveal information you
obtained during the defense...

133
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,690
it's illegal.

134
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,390
That's right.

135
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,820
You know the law well.

136
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,330
Defend yourself then.

137
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,260
Aren't you ashamed?

138
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,025
It's obvious that it was all your idea,

139
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,995
but you put all the
blame on Choi Dae-hyun.

140
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,722
As a lawyer, aren't you ashamed
to cooperate with the police

141
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:56,460
in an undercover operation?

142
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,960
Why are you so sure?

143
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,025
Well, it doesn't matter if
your friend dies like that.

144
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,760
Is it okay for us to let him go?

145
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,340
Choi Dae-hyun

146
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,860
is now in the police interrogation room.

147
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,420
It was Dae-hyun who
cooperated with the police.

148
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,960
I can't accept this responsibility.

149
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,690
I...

150
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,290
as Choi Dae-hyun's
lawyer, I've been patient,

151
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,490
But I won't tolerate it anymore.

152
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,225
A murderer lives next door.

153
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,990
How can I just sit back and watch?

154
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,790
And the children...

155
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,425
Are you threatening me?

156
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,920
Even if attorney-client
privilege is a joke,

157
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,740
my daughter must be compensated
for the harm she's suffered.

158
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,490
Don't touch the girl.

159
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,010
We'll see what happens.

160
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,960
Let's see what the outcome is.

161
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,055
Orders are coming from above.

162
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
Suspect of drug use.

163
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,540
Immediately arrest Choi Dae-hyun
for ruining the investigation.

164
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,225
If you want to avoid immediate arrest,

165
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,260
you just have to
cooperate with the police.

166
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,260
Tell me who the dealer is.

167
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,290
This is your last chance.

168
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,225
If you deceive us again...

169
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,425
this time, you'll really die.

170
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,410
Woo So-jeong won't be safe either.

171
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,060
Detective.

172
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,270
Please, give me another chance.

173
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,055
Let me out.

174
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,225
I'll help you arrest him, no matter what.

175
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,295
You haven't given any
leads about the dealer.

176
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,555
How can I trust you?

177
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,610
Investigate the people related
to the deceased Jin Yeom-soo.

178
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,206
There must be someone among
them who is under the protection...

179
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:32,760
of the police.

180
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,410
A drug-dealing cop...

181
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,460
How deeply are you involved?

182
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,455
It's better if you're arrested here.

183
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,195
But if you get out, the
dealers will take revenge.

184
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,840
Your life is probably in danger.

185
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,380
I know I can't have a
peaceful life anymore.

186
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,290
So let me out.

187
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,390
Let me be the bait again.

188
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,090
I'll help you arrest him, no matter what.

189
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,860
Why didn't you do it?

190
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,020
Why didn't you do it?

191
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,955
The police are suspicious.

192
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,790
They've become suspicious.

193
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,855
When can it be done?

194
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,425
The police are watching
Park Tae-hyung and his wife.

195
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,190
Should the assisted suicide
be done in this situation?

196
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,990
It's very dangerous, I'm hesitant.

197
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
I...

198
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,895
I'll double the down payment.

199
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,025
I'll give you double.

200
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,920
So please, do it as soon as possible.

201
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,690
- Double?
- Yes.

202
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,220
We checked, Attorney Park.

203
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,090
You took out a huge loan
with high interest rates.

204
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,720
The interest isn't low.

205
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,920
I'll help you sort it out.

206
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,890
But...

207
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,860
give me half the inheritance.

208
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,320
I knew it.

209
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,390
Okay, hurry up.

210
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,490
Please, do it quickly.

211
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,160
Okay, I accept.

212
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,280
This newspaper...

213
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:54,446
(High-ranking official allegedly accepted
a bribe to settle a case)

214
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:55,820
You don't have much time.

215
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,610
The next report will be published
with the real name.

216
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,790
Before that, get out of there.

217
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,890
You...

218
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,320
Were you recording?

219
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,960
Although I'm only here
thanks to you, Mr. Baek...

220
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,255
The fact that I've gotten this far...

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,390
is partly thanks to me.

222
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,820
Maybe you don't remember.

223
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,090
I can play it back for you.

224
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,190
Are you threatening me?

225
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,120
How would I dare threaten you?

226
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:52,021
During this time,
even though I've investigated a lot

227
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,485
following your orders...

228
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,433
there are more dirty secrets to cover up.

229
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,420
Many things have piled up.

230
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,420
I'm also under pressure.

231
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
You...

232
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,035
Since the report hasn't
published the real name yet...

233
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,145
Is that why it still doesn't feel real?

234
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,350
Then, publish the real name.

235
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,970
Then, I'll hold a press conference.

236
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,180
Because I'm afraid of being alone.

237
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,610
Even if I die,
I have to take someone with me.

238
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,415
With your behavior...

239
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,540
Did you already prepare an escape route?
We agreed to die together.

240
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,112
What other escape route do I need?

241
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm asking you one last time.

242
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,320
Keep the agreement.

243
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,080
There's a reason they say you shouldn't
give wings to the ambitious.

244
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,650
Please, give me a little more time.

245
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,230
Please.

246
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,070
But I have a condition.

247
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,510
You can leave, but put this on.

248
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,630
Dr. Woo...

249
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,050
Can I see her again?

250
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,390
Yes.

251
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,820
I'm angrier that you lied to me.

253
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,950
You deceived a patient.

254
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,650
Well, maybe I lost my mind.

255
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,830
Do you know how long those patients
had been waiting?

256
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,290
Don't you know how desperate
Park Tae-hyung is right now?

257
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,220
But I think Gu Gwang-chul
put us all in danger.

258
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,990
I'm only thinking about how to arrest him.

259
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,160
I didn't think about the others.

260
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sorry, I didn't think things through.

261
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,200
Let's not see each other much for now.

262
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,730
Wait a moment.

263
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,350
I have to tell you something.

264
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,410
I don't want to talk to you right now.

265
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,380
I don't want to hear any of your excuses.

266
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,710
I'm leaving.

267
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,090
We meet again, Detective Ban.

268
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,360
What are you doing here?

269
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,880
This is my uncle's house.

270
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,890
Are you his nephew?

271
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,985
Do you have any questions?

272
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,710
Park Tae-hyung and his wife are suspected
of being at the euthanasia site.

273
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,220
We came to investigate.

274
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,255
Please, help us.

275
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,450
I don't accept it.

276
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,405
You don't have a warrant or any evidence.

277
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,120
They're not well anymore.
We can't tire them out any further.

278
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,250
We just want them admitted
to the palliative care ward.

279
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,300
I asked Dr. Woo for help.

280
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,355
Also, it seems you entered
without permission yesterday.

281
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,440
I can sue you for trespassing.

282
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,430
My uncle's condition has worsened.

283
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm leaving.

284
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
Let's go, Aunt.

285
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,330
The people involved
in Jin Young-soo's death...

286
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,065
All need a more thorough
and in-depth investigation.

287
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,505
Talk to Captain An.

288
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,020
Go to Gu Gwang-chul's office
and get a search warrant.

289
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,095
Why are you doing this?

290
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,345
Jin Yeom-soo's office,

291
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,050
is now being used by Gu Gwang-chul.

292
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,920
It needs to be confirmed.

293
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,726
The search and seizure warrant
for Gu Gwang-chul's office

294
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,780
was not approved.

295
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,565
I've said this before.

296
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,630
Mr. Gu is a businessman close
to Assemblyman Baek.

297
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,185
Jin's lawyer, who was involved
in a failed euthanasia attempt,

298
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,500
is Park Tae-hyung's nephew.

299
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,215
He must have a close relationship
to the Woo So-jeong case.

300
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,450
So, Jin's building,
which is under Gu Gwang-chul's name,

301
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,880
We could see it as a deal.

302
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,365
If you have doubts,
start by investigating your nephew.

303
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,150
Don't make unnecessary inspections.

304
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,360
Or what will happen to my reputation?

305
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,985
Investigate the people related
to the deceased Jin Yeom-soo.

306
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,510
There must be someone among
them who is under police protection.

307
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,580
Everything has been quiet since
the last time the police came.

308
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,920
Doctor, are you all right?

309
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,110
I'm fine.

310
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,740
If you have any problems,
please contact me.

311
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Okay.

312
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,569
What our nurse Choi Ye-na is doing...

313
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:34,500
Is it the same...
as what Dr. Woo So-jeong did?

314
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
Correct.

315
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,720
How did she convince
you to do this with her?

316
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,160
This wasn't something
that Dr. Woo suggested.

317
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,820
I was the one who approached
her and suggested we do this.

318
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,670
Why?

319
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,320
At first, it was for lack of money.

320
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,730
After...

321
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,490
Because I think people really need this.

322
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,940
How do you know they need it?

323
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,490
The families are suffering.

324
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,300
But I can't do anything, you know?

325
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,100
Even if it's just for a moment...

326
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,920
I want them to be free from the pain.
That's what their families think.

327
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,950
We cannot fully understand God's will.

328
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,860
How long do you think you can do this?

329
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,380
Until I can't.

330
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,640
I'll do my best.

331
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,120
Jae-yeon came to see me this morning.

332
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,160
She says Woo-mi is isolating herself.

333
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,015
Just listening to Jae-yeon's
one-sided words...

334
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,785
It's not right to send the girl to
the School Violence Committee.

335
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,575
One is in the fine arts group
and the other in the dance group.

336
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,460
It's not like we see each other much.

337
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,070
After listening to the girls...

338
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,930
I think Woo-mi has
really isolated herself.

339
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,325
Afterward,
I checked the camera recordings.

340
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,170
I found out that Woo-mi
doesn't let anyone near Jae-yeon.

341
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,804
If she gets involved in school violence,
it will be difficult for her to go to college.

342
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,680
If she wants to avoid a forced transfer...

343
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,610
She must have a serious
conversation with Jae-yeon's aunt.

344
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,892
(Lawyer Park)

345
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,600
(The police came)

346
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,550
Hmm.

347
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,160
It'll be done today.

348
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,280
Park Tae-hyung and
his wife will die today.

349
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,890
It's under investigation now.
This is dangerous.

350
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,460
That's why I called you beforehand.

351
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,423
We'll make that couple's death

352
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:00,815
look natural.

353
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,790
So, tell me...
how are you going to end this?

354
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:05,200
Get ready.

355
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Honey.

356
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,310
I saw a bird.

357
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,380
It was so beautiful, I followed it.

358
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,490
Wait.

359
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,470
Hello?

360
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,700
The doctor said she'll do it today.

361
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,200
Dr. Woo, you have a package.

362
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,490
Who sent it?

363
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,456
It only has your name on it.

364
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,600
(Woo So-jeong)

365
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,125
<i>Did you get what I sent you?</i>

366
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,610
Such a compromising photo...

367
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:16,967
is very pretty.

368
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,945
It's so nice,
I don't want to see it alone.

369
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,310
I wish I could see it like
the people at the hospital.

370
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,995
What the hell are you exactly going to do?

371
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,710
Stop pretending, Woo So-jeong.

372
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,090
That detective and Choi Dae-hyun.

373
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,440
They can't protect you.

374
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,110
I'll protect you.

375
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,160
I know you're coming from work.

376
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,700
Come to Park Tae-hyung's house.

377
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,840
I don't need your protection.

378
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,290
I love you.

379
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,550
I have to tell you something.

380
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,190
The house is full of kids.

381
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,690
I have to take care of them.

382
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,725
I'll wait for you at the art supply
store in front of the station.

383
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,760
You said you were going to buy paint.

384
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,610
Why should I listen to you?

385
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,590
You have to come out...

386
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,140
or you'll regret it.

387
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,710
What is this?

388
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,160
I heard about your aunt.

389
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,490
She's a suspect in a murder case.

390
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,340
It seems my mother's firm took her case.

391
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,740
Where did you get this video?

392
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,640
I'll keep the secret.

393
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,110
Forget about my school violence report.

394
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,040
If what you're saying is true,
my aunt is really a suspect.

395
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,075
If she's going to defend her,

396
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,690
your mother is also in danger.

397
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,695
You think I'll fall for that?

398
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,960
You know lawyers have a
duty of confidentiality, right?

399
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,590
If you reveal the video
and everyone finds out...

400
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,360
Your mother's career will be over.

401
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,795
Are you crazy?

402
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,860
You.

403
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,840
If you show this video to anyone...

404
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,790
I won't back down either.

405
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,940
Na Woo-mi.

406
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,240
You don't believe me now, do you?

407
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,775
So, is it true or a lie?

408
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,960
Call your aunt and my mom
to confirm it.

409
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,675
Now that it's come to this,

410
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,190
both of them should be present.

411
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,395
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,590
I'm sorry.

413
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,460
I want my parents
to pay the compensation.

414
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:02,810
What?

415
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,290
Excuse me.

416
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,190
You're Jae-yeon, right?

417
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,745
Who are you?

418
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,960
My aunt's boyfriend.

419
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,610
Actually...

420
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,690
I'm just a friend.

421
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,710
I'm sorry, I'll pay for the damages.

422
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,325
Excuse me, please pay with this.

423
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,660
You...

424
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,510
Be more careful next time.

425
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,558
There are many things here
that can break.

426
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,695
Are you really her aunt's friend?

427
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,625
If you're not,
why should I pay you compensation?

428
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,410
I'm not a charity.

429
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,410
Neither are you.

430
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,895
You should change your attitude.

431
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,510
The world doesn't revolve around you.

432
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,650
What nonsense are you talking about?

433
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,710
Jae-yeon.

434
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,845
Aunt.

435
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,025
I accidentally broke something
in the art store.

436
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,045
You weren't hurt, were you?

437
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,095
No.

438
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,790
But your friend at the art store...

439
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,510
paid for the damages.

440
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,040
My friend?

441
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,540
He...

442
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,560
It's me.

443
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,625
Don't touch the girl.

444
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,195
It seems you didn't
understand what I said,

445
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,840
so I'll say it again.

446
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,195
Park Tae-hyung,

447
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,360
is in very bad shape right now.

448
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,125
So, if you can...

449
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,960
I hope you go to that house right now.

450
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,660
Send the girl home.

451
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,690
You come to Park Tae-hyung's house too.

452
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
See you later.

453
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,240
I know your aunt very well.

454
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,240
Doctor.

455
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,710
Honey.

456
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,790
Dr. Woo is here.

457
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,240
Did you get hurt seeing him too?

458
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,290
Yes.

459
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,910
But...

460
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,740
it doesn't matter.

461
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,390
Now...

462
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,290
She's here, Doctor.

463
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,190
Please, help us, Doctor.

464
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,295
Help them.

465
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
Look how sincere they are.

466
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,990
I prepared the will
and the sleeping pills.

467
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,360
She told the others that her
husband died of a disease.

468
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,595
A woman grieving the death of her husband,

469
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,425
wrote a suicide note.

470
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,126
It's very clean.

471
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:30,431
I'm not cut out for this.

472
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,640
Don't kill healthy people out of spite.

473
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,495
The choice is ours.

474
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,790
You just follow the instructions.

475
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,360
Say what you want,
Bae Mi-yeong can't do this.

476
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,325
She's healthy.

477
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,925
I can't kill someone like that.

478
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,045
It goes against my principles.

479
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,060
Start right now.

480
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,960
No matter how much
you disguise it as suicide.

481
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,060
If Bae Mi-yeong dies,
you may be questioned too.

482
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,445
You're the heir.

483
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,910
So you'll be the prime suspect.

484
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,290
It's okay.

485
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,410
Just do it.

486
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,990
Please, just do it for my husband.

487
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,090
Honey...

488
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,810
It's okay.

489
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,440
I'm okay.

490
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,110
Doctor...

491
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,360
Please, just help my husband.

492
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,340
Accept it.

493
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,387
Please...

494
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,860
Give us time to say goodbye.

495
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,210
I've been sick my whole life.

496
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,410
Thank you for always taking care of me.

497
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,640
If it weren't for you...

498
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,190
I wouldn't have lived to this age.

499
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Thanks to you...

500
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,160
I lived well.

501
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,260
Thank you.

502
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,040
I'm sorry.

503
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,525
I'll take responsibility...

504
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,190
...for the rest of my life.

505
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,890
I'll live a good life.

506
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,640
Don't worry.

507
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,910
We...

508
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,460
...will see each other soon.

509
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,260
He's dead.

510
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,490
Are you sure?

511
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,625
Mi-young wasn't mentioned before.

512
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,210
So what? You're just a killer.

513
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,510
Wait.

514
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,960
He's gone now. No need to get sentimental.

515
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,460
Calm down.

516
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,710
By the way.

517
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,890
As you wanted, Bae Mi-young is not dead.

518
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,760
Woo So-jeong, don't be so dramatic.

519
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,710
Calm down, calm down!

520
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,325
Is that why you need me?

521
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,590
To kill ordinary people?

522
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,510
Woo So-jeong, it's all over.

523
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,565
It's all over?

524
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,830
No, there's a problem.

525
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,510
Bae Mi-young suddenly committed
suicide by jumping off the balcony.

526
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,890
She's dead.

527
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,275
This wasn't what we agreed on.

528
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,176
There's a suicide note.

529
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:34,246
The method of suicide...

530
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:38,180
...changed from taking anti-anxiety meds to
jumping off a balcony. No one will suspect a thing.

531
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,585
Wait for the police to arrive.

532
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,740
Just finish it.

533
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,610
Understood?

534
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,940
Damn it.

535
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,260
Okay.

536
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:58,905
Ji-hoon.

537
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,970
Yes.

538
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,015
Park Tae-hyung and his wife are dead.

539
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,100
What does this mean?

540
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,625
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

541
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,800
<i>Don't linger around here.</i>

542
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,295
<i>Excuse me. Please, come in.</i>

543
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,240
I heard your uncle passed away.

544
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
You?

545
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
Watch your expression.

546
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
You're in mourning. You should look sad.

547
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,560
What should I do?

548
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,150
What should I do?

549
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,900
What's going on?

550
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,886
Well...

551
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,825
after her husband passed away
from an illness...

552
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,080
the wife made an extreme decision.

553
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,940
There was a suicide note
written beforehand.

554
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,965
Was she waiting for her husband to die?

555
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,155
Yes, she was wearing shoes
when she jumped off the balcony.

556
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,890
It must have been something impulsive.

557
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,074
But since she left a suicide note,
it seems like it was planned.

558
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,121
It should be investigated further.

559
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,695
Are you sure only they
were in the house?

560
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,340
That needs to be investigated further.

561
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,290
How did you get here?

562
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,890
What's the reason you came here?

563
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,843
The bereaved is an acquaintance of mine.

564
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,655
When I told him I was Jin's lawyer,

565
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,481
he didn't say that.

566
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,390
You didn't mention Park Min-sung's
name in your report.

567
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,375
I want to know beforehand
even the things you didn't report.

568
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,960
Are you avoiding your acquaintances?

569
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,130
You must have taken a big hit.

570
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,970
We'll sort this out, go get some rest.

571
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,645
The funerals will be soon.
It's going to be very difficult.

572
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,790
Thank you.

573
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,595
Secure the scene as soon as possible.

574
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,730
Help the grieving family
with the funeral arrangements.

575
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,530
Be careful.

576
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,680
Oh, Uncle.

577
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,331
Suspects for aiding suicide.

578
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,240
Woo So-jeong, Choi Dae-hyun, Choi Ye-na.

579
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,550
After Jin's death,
he changed the pentobarbital supplier.

580
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,800
Gu Gwang-chul.

581
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,776
Jin Yeom-soo and Park Tae-hyung.

582
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,092
Park Min-sung, the middleman
who introduced Gu Gwang-chul.

583
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
And also...

584
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,950
police colleagues.

585
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,360
Ahn Tae-sung.

586
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,120
The clues are taking shape.

587
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,710
It's been a while since you've been
to the hospital, so I came to see you.

588
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,260
You must be very busy.
Why did you come?

589
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,525
I only feel relieved
when I see that you're okay.

590
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:15,950
<i>Next news story.</i>

591
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,005
<i>In a luxury apartment in Gangnam,</i>

<i>For this reason,

597
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,525
It seems this is Park Tae-hyung's
apartment.

598
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,932
<i>According to her family, Bae
suffered from depression.</i>

599
00:43:34,016 --> 00:43:36,860
Park Tae-hyung and his wife died?

600
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,660
They both died?

601
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,590
Doctor, you look very tired.

602
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,300
What's going on?

603
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:50,786
Thank you.

604
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:53,365
The atmosphere in the hospital
is strange these days.

605
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,076
Doctor.

606
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:56,395
All the patients who arrived yesterday
have been admitted.

607
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,135
But there's still someone who hasn't
decided whether to be hospitalized or not.

608
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,980
You need to go take a look.

609
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,060
Choi Jin-kyung is 65 years old.

610
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,750
Next is Bae Mi-young's body.

611
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,510
What?

612
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,885
Are you sure that the body
is Bae Mi-young's?

613
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,695
Since she committed suicide
by jumping off a building,

614
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,465
she's very swollen and bruised.

615
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:42,940
She may not look familiar.

616
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,310
I see.

617
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,300
Please help us, Doctor.

618
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,980
Reiterate the patient's identity to me.

619
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,130
Choi Jin-kyung is 65 years old.

620
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,445
She's a cleaner.

621
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,830
She said she accidentally fell
while cleaning the rooftop.

622
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,534
She was found quite late,

623
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,680
so she was sent to the ER
after midnight.

624
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,990
I'll be in charge
as Choi Jin-kyung's attending physician.

625
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,825
She has no family.

626
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,045
Let me take care of her
until she regains consciousness.

627
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,110
Okay.

628
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,890
(Funeral Home)

629
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,680
It's not Bae Mi-young's body.

630
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,255
What? What do you mean?

631
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,750
It's not Bae Mi-young's body.

632
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,355
Could it be that Bae Mi-young's body
turned into a zombie?

633
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,365
Did she walk out? What do you mean?

634
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:57,120
How am I supposed to know?

635
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
You hang up first.

636
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,110
A very young person.

637
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,060
Jo Soo-yeong had stage 4
colon cancer.

638
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,560
This was a case that my
grandmother reported to the police.

639
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,550
Please, sit down.

640
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,390
My Soo-young...

641
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,220
peacefully went to heaven.

642
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,330
Soo-young's grandmother
must have misunderstood.

643
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,430
But I don't blame her

644
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,200
because I'm not a helpful father.

645
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,760
That's why she suspects me.

646
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,270
Now that someone called the police,
we're investigating.

647
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,820
Okay.

648
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,830
Do you know Dr. Woo So-jeong
from Baesung General Hospital?

649
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,830
My son...

650
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,620
was hospitalized in that hospital.

651
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,920
Then maybe you've seen her.

652
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,760
But why are you asking me...

653
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,030
about this person?

654
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,820
She's a suspect in this case.

655
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,160
A suspect?

656
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:45,543
For what?

657
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,760
Suspected of performing
euthanasia on terminally ill patients.

658
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,450
Do you have any relevant information?

659
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,130
(Intensive Care Unit)

660
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,190
I'm sorry.

661
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,950
My mother was in a similar situation.

662
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,560
She had the same illness.

663
00:48:58,028 --> 00:48:59,958
She always wished to die.

664
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,710
When I was a child...

665
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,940
I didn't know what my mother's
last wish was, so I helped her.

666
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,340
It's been almost twenty years.

667
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,850
I still want to ask her...

668
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,890
if my choice was right at that time.

669
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,940
Is that really what Mom wanted?

670
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm sorry.

671
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,220
That's why I couldn't help you.

672
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,630
Thank you.

673
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,030
I let my husband...

674
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,510
pass away peacefully.

675
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,370
Thank you.

676
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,900
You said you didn't want to live
anymore after your husband's death.

677
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,760
I thought that statement was very simple.

678
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,580
I'm sorry.

679
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,850
There was...

680
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,900
a suicide note.

681
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,275
Let me call the others.

682
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,450
Before that...

683
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:19,890
I need your help with something.

684
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,050
Tell me.

685
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,887
Please...

686
00:50:27,856 --> 00:50:29,010
kill me.

687
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:43,665
Ye-na, where are you?

688
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,290
I urgently need your help with something.

689
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,030
Come, let's talk.

690
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,965
It's all over.

691
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,876
Is this an emergency arrest?
Do you have an arrest warrant?

692
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:56,607
The day Choi Geon-soo died,

693
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:58,735
Choi Dae-hyun wanted Jin Yeom-soo
to receive euthanasia.

694
00:50:58,819 --> 00:50:59,909
He got the drug.

695
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,950
The lawyer Park Min-sung
also knows about it, right?

696
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,640
I'm not aware of that.

697
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,615
If it's Dae-hyun's fault,
the police will take care of it.

698
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,730
The supplier of pentobarbital,
Gu Gwang-chul.

699
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,170
You don't know him?

700
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,365
I can't believe anything from
someone who has lied to me so much.

701
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,550
What about Jo Soo-young?

702
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,330
I went to see the student's father.

703
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,550
Jo Soo-young's father...

704
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,260
was questioned for the murder
of his own son.

705
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,680
Soo-young's father is innocent.

706
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,050
If Dr. Woo So-jeong...

707
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,240
is accused...

708
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,900
of killing my Soo-young...

709
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,745
I'll turn myself in.

710
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:52,810
No.

711
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,190
In fact, I sent...

712
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,140
my Soo-young off.

713
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,060
In my arms.

714
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,250
Are you going to make a false confession?

715
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:07,710
Why are you protecting
Woo So-jeong so much?

716
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,930
Thanks to the doctor...

717
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:17,760
my Soo-young...

718
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,820
confessed his feelings
to his first love...

719
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,530
and reconciled with me.

720
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,320
Even if you don't believe it...

721
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,860
he was truly at peace...

722
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,000
when he passed.

723
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,040
If it weren't for the doctor...

724
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:40,900
my Soo-young...

725
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,500
would have never been able to tell me
how much he loved me.

726
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,010
Officer.

727
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,466
Do you know what it's like...

728
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:52,693
to see a family member sick?

729
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,470
My Soo-young...

730
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,950
even with enough painkillers...

731
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,400
he was still in pain.

732
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,295
But euthanasia is a crime.

733
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,640
Euthanasia isn't the answer
for all deaths, but...

734
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,120
there are definitely patients
who need it.

735
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,840
Like my Soo-young.

736
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,020
Don't hold a grudge against the world
in your short life.

737
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,230
Calm your heart.

738
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,000
Love someone.

739
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,440
That was all.

740
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,480
So Dr. Woo isn't guilty.

741
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,200
Please, sir...

742
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:41,490
If you can't forgive Dr. Woo...

743
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,700
then punish me.

744
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,120
Since you're Soo-young's father...

745
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,370
everyone wants to protect you.

746
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,760
You already...

747
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,160
have nowhere to hide.

748
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,650
Please, give me some time.

749
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,795
Why do you call me so easily?

750
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,965
You're very brave.

751
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,820
I found a client.

752
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,380
He said he'll pay more than
Park Tae-hyung and his wife.

753
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,350
I need the medicine.

754
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,330
Does Woo So-jeong know about this too?

755
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,560
No, I told you first...

756
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,380
Because I can't work
without your permission.

757
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,840
Okay, let's meet.

758
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,570
<i>Come see me before midnight
at the address I sent you.</i>

759
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,720
I need the medicine.

760
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,170
Bae Mi-young is still alive.

761
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,190
I'm on my way there now.

762
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,410
Bae Mi-young is in the emergency
room at Bonsung Hospital right now.

763
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,215
You have to do as I say.

764
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,575
What do I have to do?

765
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,000
Woo So-jeong will come
to pick up the medicine.

766
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,600
I'll call you again, wait.

767
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,180
Understood.

768
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,910
The situation has become dangerous.

769
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,710
It's getting out of control.

770
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,880
I need a partner to work with.

771
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,320
Where is Choi Dae-hyun?

772
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,750
He already turned himself
in to the police once.

773
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,370
Since I feel unsafe,
I can no longer cooperate with him.

774
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,920
I need someone who can help me...

775
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,600
with the medicine and
protect me from the police.

776
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,690
It's your decision.

777
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,010
I don't want to force you.

778
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,240
Woo So-jeong.

779
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,240
Where is Gu Gwang-chul?

780
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,395
Mr. Gu Gwang-chul...

781
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,650
hasn't had dinner yet.

782
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,010
Right, he went to the bathroom.

783
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,230
Finally...

784
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,630
Today is your anniversary...

785
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,400
because you're going to die, you bastard.

786
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,500
I'm helping you fulfill your wish.

787
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,230
I'm glad you came to surrender to me.

788
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,760
<i>Welcome to my world.</i>

789
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,939
{\an8}Thanks to actor Park Won-sang
for his special appearance.

790
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,030
