Come on out.

10
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:34,566
What the hell are these two doing?

11
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,000
Wow, this is a big fight.

12
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:38,503
Is this the first car accident you've ever seen?

13
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:43,386
Detective Ban Ji-hoon.

14
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:52,628
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

15
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:54,897
One more person is coming later.
Let's eat together then.

16
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:58,034
Who's coming?

17
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,937
It's time you came back to the field.

18
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,191
Have a drink.
Aren't you done with work?

19
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,827
Smells good.

20
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:09,661
Hey, sir.

21
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,329
Oh, you're here?
I ordered ahead.

22
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,330
Intestine soup is okay, right?

23
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:14,366
Ah, I can't eat stuff like that.
It's gross.

24
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,167
Then just have the broth.

25
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:18,737
Oh, say hello.

26
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:23,541
This is the detective.

27
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:28,346
His name is Cho Hyun-woo.

28
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,416
Brain tumor, brain cancer.
He was given six months to live.

29
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:33,084
Due to minor incidents since he was young,

30
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:35,186
he's been in and out of prison.
That's how we met.

31
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:38,123
Like you, he grew up in an orphanage and was lonely.

32
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:40,792
Of course, the circumstances of how you grew up are completely different.

33
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:44,496
His build, height, age,
they're all similar to yours.

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,531
So, Ji-hoon.

35
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:50,735
From now on, you're going to become Cho Hyun-woo,

36
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,804
and do a job with me.

37
00:01:56,307 --> 00:01:59,144
Hey, why are you eating
so fast again? Damn it.

38
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,947
- Are you okay?
- Not again!

39
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,585
You want me to do another undercover investigation, don't you?

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,922
I got kicked out to the traffic division because of that.

41
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,990
This time is different.

42
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,858
You know Assemblyman Baek, right?

43
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:17,462
The one who was a prosecutor.
The multi-term Assemblyman Baek.

44
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,230
We have him.

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,532
The backing is different this time.

46
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,702
Someone died because of that.

47
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:24,969
Hey, Park Kyung-soo, that son of a...

48
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,306
Park Kyung-soo, that bastard.

49
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:30,408
He was caught for the crimes he committed, wasn't he?

50
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:31,643
How long are you going to let Park Kyung-soo...

51
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:34,813
Ji-hoon.

52
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,981
Let's just trust me and do this, okay?

53
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:38,416
You have to come back to the Violent Crimes Unit.

54
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,819
How long are you going to
stay out on the street, huh?

55
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,787
Hey, everyone's waiting for you.

56
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,993
Ji-hoon.

57
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,262
Hey, Ban Ji-hoon.

58
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,733
Our team won't be complete until you're back.

59
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:31,102
The prime suspect is Woo So-jeong.

60
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,537
She's an emergency medical doctor.

61
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,539
Under the pretext of counseling,

62
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,441
she's euthanizing terminally ill patients.

63
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:40,478
She's a psycho who thinks she's God.

64
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,048
Go to the ER where Woo So-jeong is.

65
00:03:43,782 --> 00:03:46,084
Tell her the pain is driving you crazy, and to kill you.

66
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,788
That bitch needs to be put in a situation

67
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:52,691
where her true self is about to be exposed to those around her.
Then she'll get desperate.

68
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:59,331
If you end up taking opioid painkillers, use this as an antidote.

69
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,814
Let's set up a location.

70
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,651
Find an old house in a remote, deserted place.

71
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,686
Don't get soft.

72
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:24,255
No matter how you sugarcoat it,

73
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:25,824
that woman is a murderer who killed someone.

74
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:27,292
When you see how she cares for her patients...

75
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,027
It's okay, it's okay.

76
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:31,896
I don't know.
It seems so sincere.

77
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:36,067
I know full well what a scary story
these numbers are telling.

78
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,202
I know that,

79
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,639
but I still want you to live.

80
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,557
Oh, my. My bag, my bag.

81
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,059
Where is my bag? Oh!

82
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,727
Oh, here it is.

83
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,829
I left this behind, my goodness.

84
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:20,812
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,051
I tried my best to find a way.

86
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,057
I don't believe in God,

87
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:37,529
but the only thing I can do for you is pray.

88
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,466
It's okay.

89
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,005
I'll let you go

90
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,943
at the place you want to leave.

You must bring Woo So-jeong
to the house we set up, got it?

94
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:20,638
There's no need to feel guilty.

95
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,140
Think about it carefully.

96
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,309
You're not telling a complete lie.

97
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,945
You were an orphan and you were lonely too, right?

98
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,948
Just think of it as telling your own story.

100
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,373
Welcome.

101
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:56,875
Would you like to see?

102
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:09,187
Hello, sir.

103
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,189
Oh, you're here.

104
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:14,192
Did Su-yeong run away from home again?

105
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,026
No, not at all.

106
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:18,330
Thanks to you persuading Su-yeong back then,

107
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,798
he's doing fine at home.

108
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:21,066
I see.

109
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,235
Then why did you want to meet today?

110
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,940
I heard you were looking for Su-yeong's mother.

111
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,876
Oh, it's just a quick look at social media.

112
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,046
How did you know?

113
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:37,449
I heard from Su-yeong's mother.

114
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,254
Hello.

115
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,624
My child had some tests done here in the ER a few days ago.

116
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:49,127
I need the test result documents to submit to our insurance.

117
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:49,961
Her name?

118
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:51,896
Na U-mi, born in 2008.

119
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,436
There are no test results here.

120
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,940
I'm sure she had all her tests done here before being discharged.

121
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,675
There's no record of any tests on that day.

122
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,478
You'll have to check directly

123
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,013
with the ER or the lab.

124
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:10,949
Okay.

125
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:16,054
She's already married to someone else

126
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,623
and is a professor in the United States.

127
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:22,794
She has lectures and children to take care of.

128
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,030
She feels bad,

129
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,466
but she said she won't be able
to come see Su-yeong.

130
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,437
I'm sorry.
I should have told you earlier.

131
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,240
You have nothing to be sorry for.

132
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,944
So, you're asking me not to let
Su-yeong know, right?

133
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:42,881
Yes.

134
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,251
He doesn't say it,

135
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:51,823
but he thinks very warmly of the mother he's never met.

136
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,594
I can't let him die feeling
like he wasn't loved

137
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:00,098
by his mother as well.

138
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:03,401
I understand.

139
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,309
She said it was contaminated during collection,

140
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,845
so Dr. Woo So-jeong requested its disposal.

141
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,553
Why didn't you come pick me up?

142
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,689
I was busy at the hospital.

143
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,057
Aunt Jae-yeon's hospital.

144
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,663
Why'd you go there all of a sudden?

145
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:34,933
Because I heard a rumor at school that you
collapsed after taking some strange pills.

146
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,536
Who's spreading such ridiculous rumors?

147
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,371
Was it Jae-yeon?

148
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,939
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

149
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,675
I'm just going to go ask
her aunt anyway.

150
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,215
Mom, I'm sorry.

151
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:52,951
I was just so scared.

152
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:55,520
You know I have stage fright.

153
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,923
I really thought it was a tranquilizer.

154
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:03,361
Is that why you asked her aunt
to hide it for you?

155
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,497
No, that's not it.

156
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:07,332
I really didn't buy any drugs.

157
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,267
Then where did you get the pills?

158
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,505
I found them by chance
in Jae-yeon's family's storage.

159
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,743
I was so shocked and scared too.

160
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,646
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

161
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,621
I don't think Cho Hyun-woo will
participate in that clinical trial.

162
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:31,489
If he doesn't want to,
we can't force him.

163
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,957
Sorry for making you go to the trouble.

164
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,426
I kind of expected it.

165
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:38,063
As I recall, he looked so
exhausted at the end.

166
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:41,533
Thanks for looking into it.

167
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,714
Hello.

168
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,819
I went to the hospital yesterday
to get U-mi's test results.

169
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:05,423
You got rid of all of U-mi's test results.

170
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,894
Were you trying to hide the Benponarbital
that you were keeping in your own home?

171
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:29,014
Right.

172
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,450
The evidence has to be this solid.

173
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,753
- That way she can't get away.
- Yes, sir.

174
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,088
Check for any blind spots.

175
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:38,990
I can install more security cameras if we need.

176
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,759
When that bitch brings the drug,

177
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,396
make sure the first thing you ask about is the euthanasia process.

178
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:46,798
Even if something goes wrong in the middle,

179
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:50,235
we need her confession recorded.

180
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,703
Don't worry, sir.

181
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:55,473
The guy in charge of this case
was excellent at getting confessions before.

182
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:59,978
Although the suspect did commit
suicide out of a sense of betrayal.

183
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,649
What time did she say she's coming?

184
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,419
If you'd like to come and watch,
I'll prepare a spot for you.

185
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,824
Hey.

186
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,994
Use your head once in a while.

187
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:19,364
You should be having dinner
with your family at this hour.

188
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,534
It's an undercover sting operation.

189
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:25,270
If the chief knew about it beforehand,

190
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:27,706
wouldn't that cause problems later?

191
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:31,109
I'm sorry, sir.

192
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:36,514
Call me when it's all over.

193
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:40,852
Call me when you think you've caught the suspect.

194
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,053
Yes, sir.

195
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:45,123
Gosh.

196
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:04,709
You keep Benponarbital
for euthanizing stray animals?

197
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,344
Do you really think I'll believe that?

198
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:09,748
I looked it up, and its import is banned.

199
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,352
So what do you want to do?

200
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:18,890
Do you want to report me
and find out how I got it,

201
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,625
and how U-mi came to take it?

202
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,760
Is that what you want?

203
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,794
Even if it was a mistake,

204
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:25,997
the fact that my child took drugs
because of you makes me so angry.

205
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:28,166
I can't just let it go.

206
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,369
I'll make you pay for it one way or another.

207
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:35,340
It's true that U-mi took it without my knowledge,

208
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:39,477
and I apologize for not managing the drug properly.

209
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,579
I want to do something about it right now,

210
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,582
but I'm not stupid enough to do
something that would harm my child

211
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:47,018
by dragging her in and out of the police station.

212
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:50,055
Find another way to resolve this.

213
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,128
I did something unnecessary.

214
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,664
Su-yeong's father had his
mother's contact all along.

215
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:00,799
- Thank you.
- Yes.

216
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,500
He asked you not to tell Su-yeong, right?

217
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,102
- Just pretend you couldn't find her.
- Okay.

218
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,638
I feel so bad for Su-yeong.

219
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,707
I'm going to try and help him out more actively.

220
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,908
How?

221
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:11,876
- You're going to persuade the mother?
- No.

222
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:16,614
Su-yeong still hasn't confessed
to that girl yet.

223
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:17,449
So?

224
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,584
Today,

225
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:22,554
I'm going to make sure he succeeds in his confession.

226
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,856
Forget it.
I'd rather just die without meeting her.

227
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,395
Hey.

228
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:33,565
The rumor at school is that you're dying.

229
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,000
You said she probably knows too, right?

230
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,402
Then you can just confess right away.

231
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:39,938
Even if the confession fails,
you have nothing to worry about. Why?

232
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,707
Death covers everything up, you know?

233
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,376
That's the one good thing about death.

234
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,478
Nobody speaks ill of the dead.

235
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:48,346
If they do, they're the bastard.

236
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,281
No, I still can't.

237
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,350
I'll be remembered so pathetically.

238
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,485
What's pathetic about it?

239
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,021
I'll coordinate everything for you. Here.

240
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:00,025
I even bought a men's cushion compact foundation.

241
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,394
I'll turn you into a K-pop idol.

242
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,429
That's not the problem.

243
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,797
Then what is?

244
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,902
I smell.

245
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:13,838
What?

246
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:17,342
My grandmother had this smell
before she died.

247
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:20,345
Even I find my own smell
so repulsive.

248
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,882
I can't bring myself to ask Hye-jeong to meet me.

249
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:30,121
When a person smells like this,
does it mean they're dying?

250
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:48,306
Will this really get rid
of the smell?

251
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:49,908
Yes.

252
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:31,349
Hi, Hye-jeong.

253
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:35,120
Oh? It's Hye-jeong.

254
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:36,554
Oh, hi.

255
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:38,189
Hey, I'm Jo Su-yeong.
You don't remember me?

256
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:39,557
Hey, it's so good to see you.

257
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:42,894
Wow, this is really, really awkward.

258
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:46,131
No, wait. First, let's just spray some perfume.

259
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,465
Here, here, here.

260
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:50,735
She's not even doing night study today.

261
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,473
Oh, Dr. Woo.

262
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:58,610
After the funeral,

263
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,212
she's been seeking out the people
who took care of Player Choi

264
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:03,481
to express her gratitude.

265
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,086
Thank you.

266
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:11,056
I gave gifts to all the other doctors,

267
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:16,394
but I thought I wouldn't see you
today, Dr. Woo, so I left it in the car.

268
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:17,829
It's nothing special,

269
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,466
but would you accept it as a token of my gratitude
for taking care of my husband?

270
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,672
Coming empty-handed feels
a bit awkward.

271
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:30,342
I'll go to the convenience store.
Lend me 20,000 won.

272
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,243
It's fine.

273
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:34,579
Hello.

274
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,749
I've already bought everything
and taken care of whatever's needed.

275
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,119
- Get well soon.
- Hello.

276
00:17:42,706 --> 00:17:43,910
[Cho Hyun-woo]

277
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:49,928
Call the nurse.

278
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:50,929
Yes, sir

279
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,776
[Detective Bu]

280
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:03,041
I told you to call when it's over. Is there a problem?

281
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:05,944
Cho Hyun-woo, who we had hospitalized in the hospice, has disappeared.

282
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:25,430
Did he go peacefully?

283
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,941
I didn't realize how desperately
he wanted it.

284
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,079
I feel sorry I couldn't grant his wish.

285
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:55,260
I was scared of all the guilt I would feel later.

286
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:59,497
While saying I loved him,

287
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,935
the only thing I could give
the person I love was death.

288
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,705
I didn't want to admit that.

289
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:11,076
I regret it a lot.

290
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,380
If I had granted his request back then,

291
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,117
when he was falling asleep,

292
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:23,388
I could have at least
held his hand.

293
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:38,269
It's a diffuser. I gave them to all the other doctors, too.

294
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,173
Inside here,

295
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,210
a Serenity Foundation pamphlet,

296
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:48,279
materials related to euthanasia, your business card,

297
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,349
and a cell phone I didn't know about are all in here.

298
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:55,053
I found them while sorting through my husband's belongings.

299
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,056
I didn't know how I should get rid of them.

300
00:20:06,364 --> 00:20:07,699
Don't worry.

301
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:10,535
As of today,

302
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:14,072
I will erase Woo So-jeong
from my memory.

303
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,346
For helping my husband,

304
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:24,949
thank you.

305
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,258
Thank you.

306
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,896
Hey, you're dying. Why are you here?

307
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,098
You don't have time, you should be out having fun.

308
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,666
You never came before, so why are you here?

309
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,634
Yeah, well...

310
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,837
I started having regrets.

311
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:21,606
I wanted to learn one more thing

312
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,308
before I go.

313
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,243
Is that really how you feel?

314
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,344
Uh, yes.

315
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:28,646
- Hey guys.
- Hello.

316
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,482
Hey, why isn't Hye-jeong here?

317
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:32,350
She quit because it clashes
with her math academy schedule.

318
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:34,419
Study hard, and don't have regrets.

319
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,188
- Hey, hey, where are you going?
- Hey, hey!

320
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:59,644
- Welcome.
- Hello.

321
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,885
What should we eat?

322
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:08,987
I'm going to have this.

323
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:18,430
Su-yeong?

324
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:20,532
Hye-jeong.

325
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:26,071
You go on ahead first.

326
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,809
W-what are you doing here?

327
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:33,712
I go to the math academy in this building.

328
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:35,880
Oh, right, right.

329
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:37,582
Oh, I see.

330
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:39,617
I heard the news.

331
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:42,587
Are you okay?

332
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,157
I don't know.

333
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,360
Well, it hurts,

334
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:50,829
but I doubt I'll die from this.

335
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:52,731
It doesn't feel real.

336
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,302
Are you really dying?

337
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,173
The doctor said I have two weeks left.

338
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:11,750
Su... Su-yeong!

339
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:24,029
Uh, Hye-jeong, I...

340
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:30,468
I...

341
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:34,005
I missed you.

342
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:35,807
What?

343
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:37,075
Ah, that is...

344
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:38,943
if you have time, maybe later..

345
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,546
No, I mean, I don't have much time, so...

346
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,448
Do you want to hang out?

347
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:48,486
My mom is coming
to pick me up right away.

348
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:50,655
Oh, okay.

349
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,192
Oh, okay, then, well...

350
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,761
Yes, okay, then you should go.

351
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,063
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

352
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,265
I have tutoring tomorrow,
but I can postpone it.

353
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,767
You'll be okay until tomorrow, right?

354
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:06,771
Yes.

355
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,240
Okay, then let's meet tomorrow.

356
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:10,508
Okay.

357
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:14,813
Player Choi Kang-yoon's wife came to see me.

358
00:24:14,813 --> 00:24:16,848
What? Did she report it?

359
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,050
No, I don't think so.

360
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:21,886
I don't know why, but it seems like
she knows and is covering it up.

361
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:24,422
Anyway, we should be careful for a while.

362
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,990
We only have one dose of the drug left.

363
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,892
What? Why?

364
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:29,361
We had a whole box.

365
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,834
There was a physical fight at the hospital,

366
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:37,268
and the whole cabinet was knocked over.

367
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:45,110
I'll go to Hyun-woo's place alone.

368
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:47,412
Won't it be too much for you alone?

369
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:50,615
It might be too much on my own,

370
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,486
but I want to say goodbye
to Hyun-woo by myself.

371
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:00,992
Right, well, you two probably need
to say your final goodbyes.

372
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:02,560
Be careful on your way.

373
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,832
Anyway, I have to go with Su-yeong

374
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:10,135
to meet his girlfriend.

375
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:11,369
Tomorrow's the big day.

376
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:12,937
We don't have time.

377
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:14,305
That's a shame, but give up.

378
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,840
Don't stop me.

379
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:18,276
I have my pride as an expert.

380
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,288
You have something on you.

381
00:25:32,457 --> 00:25:33,625
What's on me?

382
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:44,703
Oh? Hy-Hye-jeong.

383
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,609
Let's go over there. Yes, over there.

384
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:17,088
How could I not know?

385
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:19,591
You knew I liked you?

386
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,993
When we were in elementary school,

387
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,763
you ate all the broccoli and bell peppers
from my school lunch,

388
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,898
and if I didn't bring my indoor slippers, you gave me yours

389
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:28,833
and walked around barefoot.

390
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:32,170
There's no way I didn't know.

391
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:35,206
That was when we were kids.

392
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:40,345
Damn, I can't hear. Shit.

393
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:43,882
If we'd had time,

394
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:45,917
do you think you would have come to like me?

395
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:48,887
Not like you do now.

396
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:50,722
Well...

397
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:54,159
Honestly, since we've never dated, I don't know.

398
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:57,228
Right.

399
00:28:58,596 --> 00:28:59,864
We don't have time.

400
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:17,449
I cried a lot after hearing your story.

401
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:23,955
Ha, they held hands.

402
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:29,828
Are you being nice to me

403
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:31,963
because I'm going to die?

404
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:33,932
That could be part of it.

405
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:37,268
But...

406
00:29:40,338 --> 00:29:42,474
if it was someone else dying,

407
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,810
I wouldn't be this sad.

408
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:21,579
Are you okay?

409
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:29,621
Are you okay? Oh my god, Su-yeong.

410
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:32,490
Oh, what do I do?

411
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,293
- Su-yeong.
- Who are you?

412
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:38,997
I'm Su-yeong's doctor. I was worried, so I was nearby.

413
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,967
I'm sorry.

414
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:44,869
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:46,771
I had fun today.

416
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:48,973
I'll get going.

417
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,087
No, this won't do.

418
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:03,321
I'll carry you, okay?

419
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:04,856
Wait, wait.

420
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,826
Hye-jeong is watching.

421
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:10,929
I want to be remembered looking cool.

422
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,102
Okay, okay, grab onto me.

423
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:18,570
Here.

424
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:24,809
You look cool, you look cool.

425
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:30,415
Su-yeong!

426
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:34,719
Let's definitely meet here again tomorrow.

427
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:36,554
You'll come, right?

428
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:48,266
Let's go now.

429
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:50,402
Let's go.

430
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:09,154
Wow, Su-yeong.

431
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:11,489
I'm so damn jealous of you, you know?

432
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:13,658
You're better off than me, really.

433
00:32:13,658 --> 00:32:16,361
You did great with your confession, you did great with everything.

434
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,364
Right?

435
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:22,300
I was pretty cool today.

436
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:26,871
When we get home,
I'll give you a painkiller shot.

437
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:29,908
Let's go on a proper date
with Hye-jeong tomorrow, okay?

438
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:37,315
- Dae-hyeon.
- Yes?

439
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:44,022
I just...

440
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,058
want to die today.

441
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:53,398
Why?

442
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,335
I've done everything

443
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,439
that I've wanted to do.

444
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:05,610
Please, just do it today.

445
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,884
Ji-hoon, this is just in case.

446
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,911
If any problems arise, take this.

447
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,463
These numbers are telling
me that you're going to die,

448
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,499
but I want you to live.

449
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:09,033
Hello, Dr. Woo.

450
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:12,771
Another priest
received a call from the hospital.

451
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:14,706
A call about what?

452
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,909
Hyun-woo is
at the hospital right now.

453
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:22,680
Inside the subway station,

454
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,450
a body was found lying down, covered in newspaper.

455
00:34:26,084 --> 00:34:26,918
That...

456
00:34:27,452 --> 00:34:29,187
Well, I was hoping he was okay,

457
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:33,358
but they say Hyun-woo is dead.

458
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:48,540
Are you sure?

459
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,309
Yes.
His identity has been confirmed.

460
00:34:54,145 --> 00:34:56,014
Damn it.
Who is she on the phone with? Shit.

461
00:34:57,715 --> 00:34:59,384
I'm in a situation where
I can't go right now.

462
00:34:59,384 --> 00:35:01,486
Dr. Woo, could you please go instead?

463
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,822
I'm sorry.

464
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:06,991
I have something to do right now.

465
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:10,395
I'll call you back later.

466
00:35:17,302 --> 00:35:18,369
Is something wrong?

467
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,345
A patient I cared for

468
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,280
apparently passed away.

469
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,027
I guess I was a little nervous.

470
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,731
I'll just have a glass of water first.

471
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:05,917
What?
Is this the only angle we have?

472
00:36:06,418 --> 00:36:08,286
Looks like they didn't install one over there.

473
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:09,187
Damn it.

474
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:32,914
[Pain & Fever Reducer
Acetaminophen 650mg]

475
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:37,282
Oh, I remember this person.

476
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,050
He said he had an allergy,

477
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,619
so he couldn't have acetaminophen-based fever reducers,

478
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,922
and asked for an ibuprofen-based one.

479
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,417
[Pain & Fever Reducer
Acetaminophen 650mg]

480
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:20,391
Here, let's go.

481
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:42,247
You have some too, Hyun-woo.

482
00:37:45,183 --> 00:37:46,518
Let's do it after you've calmed down a bit.

483
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:54,726
Did she already put something in the water?

484
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:56,127
- Did she spike it?
- I don't know.

485
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:57,729
We couldn't see. There was no angle. Shit.

486
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:14,813
Now, what should I do first?

487
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:23,088
Just a moment.
I left something in the car.

488
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:32,197
She's leaving?

489
00:39:44,202 --> 00:39:46,571
Ah, shit. Damn it.
It's blown.

490
00:39:53,611 --> 00:39:54,512
What the?

491
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:15,533
It's me. Is everything okay?

492
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:18,503
Why was your phone turned off?

493
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:19,604
I think...

494
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:22,273
I think I have to send
Su-yeong off now.

495
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:23,608
Can you bring me the drug?

496
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:26,744
I'm sorry, I don't have the drug right now.

497
00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:28,880
Cho Hyun-woo.

498
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,948
Damn it.

499
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:31,983
That guy was a cop.

500
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:33,885
What?

501
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:35,887
Are you okay?

502
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:37,322
I'm fine.

503
00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:40,024
Shit.

504
00:40:40,258 --> 00:40:41,292
What should we do?

505
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,161
I need to go get the drug,

506
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:45,730
but Su-yeong is here alone right now.

507
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,966
His father is on his way.

508
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:51,169
Does Su-yeong want it now?

509
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:52,003
Yes.

510
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:53,538
He's vomiting a lot.

511
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:56,040
He could go into shock if we're not careful.

512
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,142
It's now or never.

513
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:04,382
Then you stay and look after Su-yeong, Dr. Choi.

514
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:06,184
Give me the contact info,
I'll go get the drug myself.

515
00:41:06,184 --> 00:41:09,053
But the people I've been dealing with
haven't been answering for a few days.

516
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:10,121
Then what about someone else?

517
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:11,890
Is there no one else who might have the drug?

518
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,958
Representative Gu probably has it,

519
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:16,895
but no, no. It's too dangerous for you to go.

520
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:18,363
I've always told you.

521
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:20,698
When a dangerous moment comes,
I'll take responsibility for everything.

522
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:23,701
No, you can't.

523
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:27,338
It'll be too much for you to handle
those drug addicts alone.

524
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:28,473
I'm a doctor.

525
00:41:28,973 --> 00:41:30,308
You said Su-yeong is in pain.

526
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:31,543
We don't have time.

527
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:33,077
Hurry up and tell me where to go.

528
00:42:15,887 --> 00:42:17,122
Did you forget something?

529
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:27,132
The number you have dialed is not available.

530
00:42:49,988 --> 00:42:51,189
You're Dr. Choi's friend?

531
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:55,126
I believe he took a box
not long ago.

532
00:42:55,126 --> 00:42:56,494
He used it all up already?

533
00:42:58,129 --> 00:42:58,963
It's urgent.

534
00:42:59,964 --> 00:43:01,433
I'll give you however much money you want.

535
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:04,469
Money is a given, of course.

536
00:43:09,307 --> 00:43:10,175
Do you even know

537
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:13,144
what a dangerous mistake
you're making right now?

538
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:16,681
To trade this stuff, you have to be tight-lipped.

539
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:19,184
But you just show up out of the blue like this,

540
00:43:19,484 --> 00:43:22,754
running your mouth so casually
and asking for the goods?

541
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:26,624
If things go wrong, you could rot in prison
for the rest of your life.

542
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:30,695
I'm sorry.

543
00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:33,498
The secret won't leak out.

544
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:36,434
If word gets out, it becomes a big problem for us, too.

545
00:43:44,576 --> 00:43:45,543
Whatever you want,

546
00:43:46,544 --> 00:43:47,612
I'll give you everything.

547
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:49,514
Right now,

548
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:51,783
I absolutely need Benponarbital.

549
00:43:54,138 --> 00:43:56,273
You weren't answering, I was going crazy.

550
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:58,108
- Was everything okay?
- I got the drug.

551
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,244
We'll talk details later. Is Su-yeong okay?

552
00:44:46,957 --> 00:44:47,958
Are you ready?

553
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,697
Yes.

554
00:44:59,169 --> 00:45:00,738
Please come and help me.

555
00:45:42,613 --> 00:45:43,514
I'm sorry.

556
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:46,684
I tried,

557
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:49,653
but I couldn't find your mother in the end.

558
00:45:50,688 --> 00:45:51,956
I'm so sorry.

559
00:45:53,357 --> 00:45:54,525
She dislikes me.

560
00:45:55,426 --> 00:45:57,361
It seems your mother went into complete hiding.

561
00:46:00,664 --> 00:46:01,598
I see.

562
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:05,703
Dad.

563
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:08,305
I have a favor to ask.

564
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:12,343
Of course. Tell me, anything.

565
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,044
Okay.

566
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,982
You know Hye-jeong, right?

567
00:46:18,515 --> 00:46:20,084
My friend since kindergarten.

568
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:25,122
She'll be waiting for me at the park tomorrow.

569
00:46:26,924 --> 00:46:28,325
Please explain it to her nicely.

570
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:30,327
So she doesn't get scared.

571
00:46:37,935 --> 00:46:38,769
Su-yeong.

572
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:43,340
Are you really not going to see her?

573
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:47,745
If we give you medication,
you can hold on until tomorrow.

574
00:46:48,912 --> 00:46:50,147
If I see her tomorrow,

575
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:53,250
Hye-jeong will definitely fall in love with me.

576
00:46:54,785 --> 00:46:56,353
Then I'd feel too sorry for her.

577
00:46:59,123 --> 00:47:00,457
You're right.

578
00:47:00,457 --> 00:47:03,360
Hye-jeong would
definitely fall in love with you.

579
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:07,965
Tell her for me, Dad.

580
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:09,333
Okay.

581
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:11,001
I will.

582
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:15,072
- Su-yeong.
- Yes.

583
00:47:17,841 --> 00:47:18,876
I'm sorry.

584
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:24,281
Your father couldn't give you a healthy body.

585
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:34,758
It can't be helped.

586
00:47:37,328 --> 00:47:40,097
You have to take good care of your health, Dad.

587
00:47:40,531 --> 00:47:41,365
I will.

588
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:45,669
I...

589
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:48,906
I really love you, Su-yeong.

590
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:52,042
I was always scolding you,

591
00:47:53,677 --> 00:47:54,612
and getting angry.

592
00:47:58,115 --> 00:47:58,949
But...

593
00:48:02,653 --> 00:48:05,923
I did that because I thought
it would help you.

594
00:48:07,324 --> 00:48:08,792
If I hurt you,

595
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:11,695
I'm truly sorry.

596
00:48:15,132 --> 00:48:15,966
Really?

597
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:17,568
Yes.

598
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,071
I thought you...

599
00:48:21,905 --> 00:48:23,374
I thought you were ashamed of me.

600
00:48:26,744 --> 00:48:28,479
I'm so grateful to you.

601
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:30,881
You are

602
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:34,451
such a good grandson to your grandmother,

603
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,754
and you are good to me, too.

604
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:39,757
Even without a mother,

605
00:48:40,524 --> 00:48:43,794
you never complained and put up with so much.

606
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:45,296
I alread knew.

607
00:48:47,464 --> 00:48:48,299
Thank you.

608
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:57,007
Dad.

609
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:03,981
Su-yeong.

610
00:49:06,684 --> 00:49:07,718
You and me,

611
00:49:08,919 --> 00:49:11,422
let's just spend one more day together, okay?

612
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:15,659
Dad.

613
00:49:17,227 --> 00:49:18,062
Dad.

614
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:26,804
Dad.

615
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:29,673
Yes?

616
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,011
I'm sorry.

617
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:42,653
I don't want to do that.

618
00:49:44,888 --> 00:49:46,357
Since I was diagnosed,

619
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:51,095
there hasn't been a day as happy as today.

620
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:55,833
I want to leave now.

621
00:50:21,692 --> 00:50:22,660
That...

622
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:25,062
Not that cup.

623
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:32,069
When I was young, our family
made a cup together at the amusement park.

624
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:35,873
It has our family picture on it.

625
00:50:37,174 --> 00:50:38,742
I want to drink from that cup.

626
00:51:52,683 --> 00:51:53,684
Su-yeong.

627
00:51:53,684 --> 00:51:55,886
Don't be scared.

628
00:51:57,454 --> 00:51:58,656
Dad is here.

629
00:52:00,457 --> 00:52:03,694
It's okay, Dad is here.

630
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:06,897
Don't be afraid, Su-yeong.

631
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:08,766
My son.

632
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:12,836
You won't hurt anymore.

633
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:20,210
It's okay.

634
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:22,746
It's okay.

635
00:52:28,919 --> 00:52:29,887
It's okay.

636
00:52:32,189 --> 00:52:34,024
It's okay, it's okay.

637
00:52:46,236 --> 00:52:47,137
It's okay.

638
00:52:48,606 --> 00:52:50,207
He's gone now.

639
00:52:54,278 --> 00:52:55,412
You can cry now.

640
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:52,269
Hello.

641
00:53:55,306 --> 00:53:57,541
Su-yeong left his cell phone with me.

642
00:54:00,544 --> 00:54:03,213
I thought I should give it to you.

643
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:09,520
Bye now..

644
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:25,462
Dad.

645
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,001
I wasn't going to leave a message,

646
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,239
but I thought I should at least say thank you.

647
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:40,077
Thank you for lying to me.

648
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:43,047
To be honest,

649
00:55:44,048 --> 00:55:45,716
I know about Mom's social media,

650
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:48,352
and I have her phone number.

651
00:55:48,986 --> 00:55:49,820
I found everything.

652
00:55:51,722 --> 00:55:53,057
You didn't want me to be upset.

653
00:55:54,491 --> 00:55:55,759
So I know that's why you said you couldn't find her.

654
00:56:01,165 --> 00:56:02,833
I was upset, but...

655
00:56:04,168 --> 00:56:05,002
Well...

656
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:09,073
Mom has,
I guess my younger sibling?

657
00:56:10,774 --> 00:56:11,609
Well, anyway,

658
00:56:12,443 --> 00:56:13,911
she has other kids.

659
00:56:18,015 --> 00:56:19,049
It can't be helped.

660
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:23,087
I understand.

661
00:56:25,022 --> 00:56:27,791
So please don't hate mom, okay, dad.

662
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:36,166
For me,

663
00:56:38,902 --> 00:56:40,604
I have a good dad.

664
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,275
That's enough for me.

665
00:56:51,815 --> 00:56:53,884
Thank you, Dad.

666
00:57:48,806 --> 00:57:51,542
Su-yeong couldn't make it?

667
00:57:54,678 --> 00:57:56,013
My Su-yeong

668
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,249
said he's sorry he couldn't keep his promise

669
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,285
to meet you here again today.

670
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:11,028
We promised to see each other here again today.

671
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:15,566
I know.

672
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:21,372
It just happened so suddenly.

673
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:25,109
I'll apologize on his behalf.

674
00:58:27,344 --> 00:58:28,812
And...

675
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:32,349
I'm so thankful you were such
a good friend to my Su-yeong

676
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:34,285
until the very end.

677
00:58:35,552 --> 00:58:37,421
You gave him such a wonderful memory.

678
00:58:39,256 --> 00:58:43,260
I'm so grateful that you created
such a good memory for him.

679
00:58:44,194 --> 00:58:47,931
Did Su-yeong leave peacefully?

680
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:51,535
Because he met you,

681
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:54,571
he said it was a really wonderful day.

682
00:58:55,306 --> 00:58:57,474
He was smiling as he fell asleep.

683
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:01,278
Peacefully.

684
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:04,648
Just like he was sleeping.

685
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,719
Is Su-yeong really dead?

686
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:10,866
Yes.

687
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:20,251
{\an8}Get your k-fix @ SinFlix!

688
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:20,251
QC by Linja

689
00:59:20,249 --> 00:59:22,894
[Special thanks to actress Kwak Sun-young for her special appearance.]

690
00:59:42,308 --> 00:59:43,809
What you're doing right now

691
00:59:43,809 --> 00:59:45,144
is insane.

692
00:59:45,144 --> 00:59:46,679
How did you end up like this?

693
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:48,681
As long as you achieve your goal,
even by deceiving others, it's okay?

694
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:51,217
Now they're going to come after us openly.

695
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:53,085
Euthanasia.

696
00:59:53,085 --> 00:59:55,354
- It is euthanasia, isn't it?
- What do you want?

697
00:59:55,788 --> 00:59:58,257
Don't mess with me, Woo So-jeong.
Do as I say.

698
00:59:58,257 --> 01:00:00,426
I'll take responsibility.
I can do it.

699
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:02,628
Which room number are you in?
I said, which room number?

700
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:07,032
What you're doing right now is murder.

701
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,034
I'm going to catch you, no matter what.
