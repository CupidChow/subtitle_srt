00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:24,693
Nice weather.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,864
Hey.

10
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:31,299
Everybody, relax.

11
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,836
Should we all go somewhere and eat, like,
spicy freshwater fish stew?

12
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,799
How about chicken soup?

13
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:21,843
You have to do this much
for them to believe you were threatened.

14
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:24,046
Don't be a baby.

15
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:26,381
You're a doctor, you know.
This kind of thing won't kill a person.

16
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:30,285
Act like you're in a total panic.

17
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,954
The driver and everything,
Say you don't remember any of it.

18
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:35,924
If you say it was a man in his mid-20s,

19
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,627
they'll think it was
one of Kim Si-hyun's men.

20
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:43,965
Kim Si-hyun and his gang planned all this.

21
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:47,836
Dr. Woo, knock knock.

22
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:48,970
Hello.

23
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:50,038
Listen carefully.

24
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:52,474
Go in there like a skilled actor

25
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:55,744
and play your part well,
just like I told you.

26
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:29,200
Based on the original Canadian series 'Mary Kills People'.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,790
[Episode 5]

28
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:37,953
What the...?

29
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:48,096
Ms. Woo So-jeong.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,834
Hey.

31
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:55,170
Are you okay?

32
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,170
I was threatened.

33
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,439
It wasn't of my own free will.

34
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,142
We'll make that judgment after the investigation.

35
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,073
Oh, Ye-na, Ye...

36
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:08,877
What the hell? If you saw me, you could've helped.

37
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:10,612
What's her problem?

38
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:34,369
It's okay, I can do it by myself.

39
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,537
Dr. Woo.

40
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,073
I heard that she was kidnapped by a patient
at Bunsung Hospital

41
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:39,508
and came back injured.

42
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:42,110
Kidnapped?

43
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,147
How badly was she hurt?

44
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,517
The criminal took a hostage
and escaped the hospital,

45
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:50,318
but nothing was caught on CCTV.

46
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,588
Can we really think
this is a coincidence?

47
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,191
There's no close-up footage,

48
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,225
and at crucial moments,

49
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,728
he only moved through camera blind spots.

50
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,231
And the camera at the final exit

51
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,199
was under repair.

52
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,468
I was a hostage.

53
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:12,307
I don't know how Kim Si-hyun evaded all that.

54
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:15,944
Kim Si-hyun had only been hospitalized for a few days.

55
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:18,447
The possibility that he could have
figured out and planned all this,

56
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,116
how likely do you think that is?

57
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,659
Are you trying to say that my
movements were all planned?

58
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,963
Is that why you handcuffed a patient?

59
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:38,367
I apologize for that.

60
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,872
I mean, Kim Si-hyun escaped so easily,
leaving the hospital with almost no trace.

61
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:46,908
The detective on our team mistook Dr. Woo

62
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:49,144
for Kim Si-hyun's accomplice.
That seems to be the case.

63
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:52,814
Did you not check the CCTV
from inside the ICU?

64
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:55,350
The footage of how I became a hostage

65
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,651
and what happened should have been recorded.

66
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,520
Oh, I saw it. Yes, I saw it.

67
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,257
I saw everything, but...

68
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,060
Anyway, it's a relief you came back safely.

69
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:11,533
How did Kim Si-hyun get a hold

70
00:07:12,634 --> 00:07:14,603
of the medical scissors that was used as a weapon?

71
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:20,242
I don't know.

72
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,579
You detectives should find out
where he got the weapon.

73
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,947
And...

74
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:28,817
while police were stationed at the hospital,

75
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:32,154
the fact that they couldn't control
an escaping suspect,

76
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,257
as the victim, I'd like to ask
who is responsible for that.

77
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:47,502
You shouldn't keep the patient sitting up
and talking for a long time.

78
00:07:47,502 --> 00:07:49,304
Will you take responsibility if her condition worsens?

79
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:51,473
I'm sorry, but the culprit is on the loose.

80
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,808
I just need to ask a few questions quickly.

81
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,177
You don't seem to understand, even when I explain.

82
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,913
The patient right now

83
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:00,749
is in a state that requires absolute rest.

84
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:03,418
She's under extreme stress
and undergoing treatment.

85
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:05,087
Stress?

86
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:07,089
Even now,

87
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:08,490
like this,

88
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,325
do you see how her hand is shaking like this?

89
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:11,793
To keep reminding a patient,
who is trembling in fear like this,

90
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:15,564
of the criminal situation
is a truly violent act.

91
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,265
She is shaking a lot.

92
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,301
You should lie down too, Doctor.

93
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:20,869
Goodness, really.

94
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:21,770
Let's go, let's go.

95
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,905
I'll ask some questions later.

96
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,040
Get well soon.

97
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,941
Hey, let's go.

98
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:34,316
Are they crazy or something?

99
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:36,885
They let a criminal escape,

100
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,087
and then they hold on to an injured person and investigate.

101
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:41,156
An apology wouldn't be enough.

102
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:44,259
But...

103
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:47,362
I feel like I've seen that young
detective somewhere before.

104
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:51,967
Oh, that's right.

105
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,536
He came to our hospital's ER

106
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,538
and then disappeared. Isn't that him?

107
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:27,302
Shit.

108
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:29,705
Let go!

109
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,874
Woo So-jeong, you did that, didn't you?

110
00:09:33,408 --> 00:09:35,744
Like a little squirrel. You filming 'Indiana Jones'?

111
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,946
Leave him be. Can't you see he's a weakling?

112
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:45,721
Well?

113
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:48,590
You did that to Kim Si-hyun, didn't you?

114
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:51,293
You killed him to get rid of him, did you?!

115
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:05,540
This is what happens when you
don't listen to me and act on your own.

116
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,875
You see it clearly now?

117
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,711
Good. Come and see.

118
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,285
Go closer and have a look.

119
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:28,130
You said you were taking the drugs alone.

120
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,532
Do I have to report every little thing?

121
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:38,240
This...

122
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:42,511
looks like a toy, doesn't it?

123
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:46,548
But this thing kills dogs, cows, and humans.

124
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:53,155
The fact that Kim Si-hyun was caught,

125
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,157
drawing the attention of the police,

126
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:59,795
the root cause of it all is you two.

127
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:01,496
Now, I'm in danger too.

128
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:03,198
So why should I have to put up with it?

129
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,100
Huh?

130
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:08,403
This bastard.

131
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,240
The emotional

132
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:15,143
and financial damage I've suffered,

133
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:20,949
what are you going to do about it?

134
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,488
If it's money you want,

135
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,524
we'll compensate you somehow.

136
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:32,561
But if you mess with Woo So-jeong one more time,

137
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,464
I won't just stand by.

138
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,268
Do you really think I'm doing this
over some pocket change?

139
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:43,338
- Then what do you want?
- Good question.

140
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,681
A very good question.

141
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,584
Why...

142
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:59,187
are you two running around doing all this?

143
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:09,765
Representative Gu,

144
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:12,134
in this world,

145
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:15,470
there are plenty of people who
don't want to die while suffering.

146
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,639
And, well, of course, it's illegal now,

147
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:20,042
but as time goes on,

148
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:23,045
it could become a matter of choice,

149
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:24,146
and that could become

150
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:26,848
a human right.

151
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:31,653
You're good at presenting,
for someone who went to med school.

152
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,591
The cause is good, it makes sense.

153
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,461
But if it makes so much sense,

154
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:42,297
couldn't it be turned into a big business?

155
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:43,665
The rich, no, wait.

156
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,068
Starting with me,

157
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:49,905
I think I'd pay a lot of money
to choose euthanasia.

158
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:52,974
Isn't this a completely different game
from dealing with drug addicts?

159
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:56,678
It's a perfectly sleek business item.

160
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,915
Well, I've never worked
with that thought in mind.

161
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:03,685
- Cut the crap and bring the champagne.
- Yes.

162
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:37,119
Drink.

163
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,290
What do you think you're going to do later,
all clean by yourself?

164
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:47,262
You've never taken any of the drugs
you got from me, have you?

165
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:49,097
Drink.

166
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:54,536
Drink!

167
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:11,887
Down it.

168
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:21,863
Beautiful.

169
00:14:22,864 --> 00:14:23,932
You listen well.

170
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:29,404
You'll feel good in no time.

171
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:32,140
You'll get even higher since it's been a while.

172
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:34,576
Right?

173
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:35,237
- When's your day off?
- I don't have one.

174
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:37,139
- Tomorrow?
- I said I don't have one.

175
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,607
Do you go to the movies

176
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:39,975
and have meals on your days off?

177
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,110
I'm in an ER.

178
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,078
I'm talking too much, aren't I?

179
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,146
Yes.

180
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:51,720
Yes, Father Yang.

181
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,723
The situation is urgent, and
I can't get in touch with Dr. Choi right now.

182
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:58,660
- Has Ms. Yun-hee's condition worsened?
- Yes.

183
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:02,664
I understand.

184
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:04,433
I'll try to contact Dr. Choi again.

185
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,911
How much of that drug did
that bastard put in?

186
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:26,521
So-jeong, I can't talk right now.

187
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,789
So you won't be shocked.

188
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:29,958
Shit.

189
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,362
I think I'm screwed, but
why do I feel so good?

190
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:52,214
As time goes by, you'll get more anxious
and depressed, you know?

191
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:54,549
Your self-esteem will hit rock bottom.

192
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,732
Where are you going?

193
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,869
If you just leave like that, I'm the one who gets in trouble.

194
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:15,337
Team leader.

195
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:18,040
Where are you going at this hour?

196
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,344
Do I have to report to you wherever I go?

197
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,979
I'm not a criminal or a suspect.

198
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,148
I'm just worried about you.

199
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:27,749
You were held hostage,

200
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:30,218
and the person who took you hasn't been caught yet.

201
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:37,659
An emergency patient has come to the
hospital where I volunteer,

202
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,061
and they say there's no medical staff.

203
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,464
But you're a patient yourself.
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

204
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:44,266
A patient is waiting.

205
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,267
Then...

206
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,036
take her and come back.

207
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:52,140
Go with her and protect her as well.

208
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,421
Wait a moment, Father Yang.

209
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:11,393
Song-yi, Song-yi.

210
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:12,761
Song-yi.

211
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:15,997
You're here.

212
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:19,835
Song-yi, you can't be here, okay?

213
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:20,802
It's okay.

214
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,972
Dr. Woo, thank you.

215
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:25,607
It's okay, it's okay.

216
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,650
You'll be okay.

217
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:41,590
Just bear with it a little longer.

218
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,192
It's okay, Song-yi. It's okay.

219
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,336
Oh, Lord.

220
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:57,706
Please look after this poor soul
who is wandering,

221
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,809
unable to draw near to you.

222
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:03,879
It's okay.

223
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:31,940
You're not Hyun-woo? You're Mr. Ban Ji-hoon?

224
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:38,413
It's a relief that you're alive,

225
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:43,151
but I feel sorry and ashamed
towards the real Hyun-woo who died.

226
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,355
Because I couldn't even recognize his face.

227
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:47,923
I'm sorry.

228
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,863
I heard the police are investigating.

229
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,600
What is Dr. Woo's crime?

230
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,001
Well?

231
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:03,605
If the police are hiding their identity
and pursuing someone,

232
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:06,675
it's not something like a traffic violation, is it?

233
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:07,542
What is it?

234
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:10,746
What Ms. Woo So-jeong is doing right now,

235
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:16,685
whatever her intentions may be,
is something that should not be done.

236
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,155
If you think it's a dangerous matter,

237
00:20:20,856 --> 00:20:22,457
please contact us, Father Yang.

238
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,462
I don't know what you're talking about.

239
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,801
I don't know what you're talking about,

240
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:37,239
but anyway, it's not Dr. Woo, okay?

241
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,441
Dr. Woo is a good person.

242
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:42,744
I've known her for a long time.

243
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,751
There must be some misunderstanding.

244
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,795
The painkillers aren't working for you.

245
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,200
The fact that it has subsided
now is because you're exhausted.

246
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:10,105
Did the child see everything?

247
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:21,149
When I collapse from the pain
and lose consciousness at home,

248
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,220
there are times my child
has to clean up my waste.

249
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:28,256
If we keep living like this,

250
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:31,026
when they think 'Mom',

251
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:35,597
the first thing that will come to
mind is that smell, wouldn't it?

252
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:39,101
Since the child is still young,

253
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:43,405
having her mother by her side
will be a great comfort emotionally.

254
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,443
The child is already afraid of me.

255
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:53,281
Adults...

256
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,653
comfort me by saying I'm
distancing myself before I die.

257
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:01,556
But I...

258
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:10,799
I don't want to die being
hated by my own child.

259
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:24,279
So...

260
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:28,650
when the moment comes
when I feel like I'm going to die,

261
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,287
please don't try any harder to save me.

262
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:37,426
If you can kill me,

263
00:22:39,027 --> 00:22:40,462
I'd be even more grateful.

264
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,034
I'm a doctor.

265
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:59,448
I was diagnosed with stomach cancer,
but I had no money for treatment.

266
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:05,087
I  have a child,
so I couldn't just die.

267
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:10,058
I thought I had to live, no matter what,

268
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:12,461
so I looked around for options,

269
00:23:14,296 --> 00:23:16,164
and at the word 'free',

270
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:19,368
at a company that develops new drugs,

271
00:23:20,335 --> 00:23:23,005
I received immunotherapy treatment.

272
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:31,613
That drug produce worse results
for people at high risk for diabetes.

273
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,648
It seems so.

274
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,852
Have you spoken to the pharmaceutical company?

275
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,855
Since I consented,

276
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,392
they say it's not their fault.

277
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,801
Excuse me.

278
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,736
I'm sorry,

279
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:59,641
but when I die,

280
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,412
could you please

281
00:24:06,848 --> 00:24:09,785
send my child to an orphanage?

282
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:16,491
The priest will know of a good place.

283
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,694
Thank you.

284
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:22,798
Thank you.

285
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:47,789
Dr. Woo.

286
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:50,058
What is it?

287
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:54,162
Are you hurt somewhere?

288
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:57,199
Wait.

289
00:24:58,266 --> 00:24:59,201
Are you okay?

290
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:00,402
Can I help you with anything?

291
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:02,704
I'm fine. I've finished everything.

292
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:05,574
Are you really okay?

293
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:11,480
I'm so sorry.

294
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:15,417
Not knowing your situation, Dr. Woo,
I made an unreasonable request.

295
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:16,485
It must have been very hard for you.

296
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:18,553
For now, go inside and get some rest.

297
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:19,821
Why won't you ask?

298
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:21,957
What?

299
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:23,759
He's not Cho Hyun-woo.

300
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,695
He's a detective who's after me. You know that.

301
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:34,102
You've never lied to me, Dr. Woo. Not once.

302
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:36,772
Of course,

303
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:39,641
when you didn't want to speak honestly,

304
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,077
you just kept your mouth shut.

305
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:46,081
If you're able to speak honestly,
I'd like to ask too.

306
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:47,983
What's going on?

307
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:56,458
He thinks I killed someone.

308
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:02,431
Like... medical malpractice?

309
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:06,001
If you want an honest answer,

310
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,773
it wasn't an accident.

311
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:22,284
I'll tell you everything as things get sorted out.

312
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:31,760
Ms. Lee Eun-hee doesn't have much time left.

313
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:34,763
The next few days will be the most painful.

314
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,865
I'll stay until tonight.

315
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,936
Dae-hyun may be careless,
but he's a responsible guy.

316
00:26:41,336 --> 00:26:42,404
He'll probably come tomorrow.

317
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:25,614
Excuse me, Doctor.

318
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:27,783
Doctor.

319
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:30,752
Doctor, please open the window.

320
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:44,032
- What's happening?
- A seizure.

321
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:46,768
I think the pain caused delirium.

322
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:51,343
{\an8}[Delirium: A state of severe confusion marked
by agitation, hallucinations, and tremors.]

323
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:48,370
Please make sure she doesn't fall off the bed.

324
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:01,350
Can seizures be this severe?

325
00:28:04,486 --> 00:28:05,987
The sedatives aren't working.

326
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:25,207
You can go.

327
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:28,276
I'll be here anyway,

328
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:29,811
and anything that might worry you, Detective,

329
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,680
I can't and won't do for a while.

330
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,284
What will happen to her?

331
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:37,953
If the seizures continue like this,

332
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:41,156
it will be hard for her to endure.

333
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,145
[Detective Bu]

334
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:08,450
I'm a neighbor, please open the door.

335
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,951
Why is it so noisy?

336
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,188
Who are you?

337
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:15,257
Excuse me.

338
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,927
- I didn't say you could come in.
- Police.

339
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:20,762
Oh.

340
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:23,498
You're Choi Dae-hyun?

341
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:25,167
Yes.

342
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:28,303
But I heard you fell asleep
on the road yesterday.

343
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:33,308
I started a new job after
a long time, so I dozed off.

344
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,113
It's not like there was an accident.
Is drowsy driving punishable?

345
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:40,449
It is not.

346
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:47,923
But you have a drug conviction.

347
00:29:50,258 --> 00:29:51,793
Let's go to the station for confirmation.

348
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,067
Am I being tortured?

349
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:01,670
I'll talk when my lawyer arrives.

350
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,006
Sorry to bring you to such a humble place.

351
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,908
You met player Choi Kang-yoon, didn't you?

352
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:08,443
Five days before he passed away.

353
00:30:09,344 --> 00:30:10,178
Yes.

354
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,613
Why did you meet him?

355
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,082
Counseling, of course.

356
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:16,818
To help ease his pain.

357
00:30:18,253 --> 00:30:19,921
Is talking also illegal?

358
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:21,690
It is not.

359
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,992
Illegal, illegal, you're very
sensitive about the law.

360
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:30,399
The preliminary test came
back positive for drugs.

361
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,233
Right?

362
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,108
It's just a preliminary test, isn't it? Preliminary.

363
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:40,942
So...

364
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:44,279
we're going to do a formal test as well.

365
00:30:46,448 --> 00:30:47,749
Still not going to talk?

366
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:50,385
Yes. I'll talk when my lawyer arrives.

367
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:52,020
Your mother wasn't answering her phone.

368
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:54,156
She must be very disappointed in you.

369
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,924
Do your worst.

370
00:30:57,392 --> 00:30:59,494
I won't say a word until my lawyer arrives.

371
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:02,297
Lawyer, lawyer, you're like a damn parrot.

372
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:06,435
Try calling his mother one more time.

373
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:10,405
Tell her her son is begging
like a bird to be saved.

374
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:11,707
Yes.

375
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:39,468
The sedative isn't stopping the seizures.

376
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,703
There's nothing more that can be done?

377
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:46,441
You've tried your best.

378
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,911
I'll be with her when she passes.

379
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,513
Get some rest.

380
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,917
The child is so scared of her mother that
she can't even come near.

381
00:31:57,853 --> 00:32:00,422
A mother who wouldn't spend money for her insulin

382
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:04,493
so she could save even a single meal's
worth of money for her child.

383
00:32:07,496 --> 00:32:09,965
Will the child remember
her as that kind of mother?

384
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:17,606
Do you remember when you said
before that all suffering has a reason,

385
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:23,378
so we should endure it?

386
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:27,582
Yes.

387
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:29,084
Then for a person who learns

388
00:32:29,584 --> 00:32:31,420
nothing from that suffering,

389
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:35,090
is that person a sinner?

390
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:39,127
Well...

391
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:42,597
what I can tell you is that

392
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,703
life and death are in the realm of God.

393
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:50,672
I've heard that God acts
through the hands of humans.

394
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:55,243
That is God's way of acting.

395
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:58,847
You are a doctor who deals with life,

396
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,615
but such a thought is arrogant.

397
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:01,817
It's irresponsible.

398
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:08,690
A life of submission is also
not an easy choice.

399
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:13,295
For a patient whose treatment is difficult,

400
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:16,598
the only thing a doctor can do
is to alleviate their pain.

401
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,670
If the only way to do that is death,

402
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:25,907
should such treatment not be given?

403
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:36,918
You said you wanted to
know why I'm a suspect, right?

404
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:44,092
For a patient who has nothing left but pain,
if the only treatment I can give is death,

405
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:49,031
I want to give that treatment, Father Yang.

406
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:49,865
Maria.

407
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:54,436
I'm not Maria anymore.

408
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,073
I don't believe.

409
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:08,056
Finally.

410
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:11,893
The lawyer you've been so
desperately waiting for has arrived.

411
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:18,266
Well, at least it seems his mother
hasn't completely abandoned him.

412
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:21,136
Hiring such a famous lawyer from this area.

413
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,744
You were a successful plastic surgeon,

414
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:31,546
but you operated while high on drugs

415
00:34:31,546 --> 00:34:33,181
and on a famous singer's face...

416
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,918
Public opinion turned against you,
so you lost your license?

417
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:42,924
I decline any personal interest.

418
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,460
It's pretty.

419
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:47,896
The necklace, that is.

420
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:50,332
Not my face?

421
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:54,135
You're pretty too.

422
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:55,870
As you know better than anyone,

423
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:57,806
most doctors, even after being punished,

424
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:00,609
can get their license back after about 3 years by suing.

425
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,345
But you couldn't stay off drugs even then?

426
00:35:03,345 --> 00:35:05,347
You never filed a lawsuit to get your license back.

427
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:06,915
Yes, I've been a bit busy.

428
00:35:07,749 --> 00:35:10,018
You even tested positive on the preliminary drug test.

429
00:35:10,018 --> 00:35:11,686
What were you relying on to be so defiant?

430
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:17,058
Why are you looking at me like that?

431
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:20,462
I'm so sorry, but have we met somewhere before?

432
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:21,897
You look familiar.

433
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:26,902
That's better than the guys who approach me
saying I look like their mother.

434
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:48,990
Jae-yeon's aunt's friend.

435
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:51,593
Jae-yeon's aunt, Woo So-jeong.

436
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:55,263
You are Dr. Woo's friend, aren't you?

437
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:59,000
Do you know So-jeong and Jae-yeon?

438
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:05,440
You've moved your office.

439
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:08,677
No. There are circumstances.

440
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:15,150
Even for an emergency drug arrest,
it's illegal after 48 hours.

441
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,219
Aren't you requesting an arrest warrant?

442
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:18,920
I will.

443
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:22,157
What are you doing?

444
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:25,026
My client is not a drug distributor.

445
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:27,996
He's a person with a relatively solid identity.
Why are you conducting the investigation this way?

446
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:31,066
Choi Dae-hyun isn't a drug offender.

447
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,269
He's facing murder charges.

448
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:38,340
Murder?

449
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,343
Since you're a lawyer who can be reasoned with,

450
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:42,811
I'll be honest with you.

451
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,447
We see Choi Dae-hyun

452
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,916
as an accomplice in a murder case
committed with his medical school classmate, a doctor.

453
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:49,684
That's what we believe.

454
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:53,388
What are you doing?

455
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:56,658
If you're going to detain someone
and investigate them,

456
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:59,427
informing them accurately
about the case is basic, isn't it?

457
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:01,830
That's why I'm telling you now.

458
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,265
Please explain it clearly.

459
00:37:03,798 --> 00:37:06,368
As a lawyer, this is something
I naturally need to know.

460
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:13,208
We...

461
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:16,678
view a doctor named Woo So-jeong
at Bunsung Hospital

462
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,384
as the perpetrator of a murder case
disguised as euthanasia.

463
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,688
And we see Choi Dae-hyun as her accomplice.

464
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,305
Why are you avoiding me?

465
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:47,242
You know I'm avoiding you,
so why talk to me?

466
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:52,547
There's something I need you to do.

467
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:56,117
Go to the dance teacher and tell her I was taking drugs.

468
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:58,453
I collapsed at the performance

469
00:37:58,453 --> 00:38:01,022
and it wasn't because of dieting,
and definitely not because of nerves.

470
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:07,028
Why should I do that for you?

471
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:12,234
The teacher thinks I'm mess up
performances because of nerves,

472
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,469
and she says she's too
worried to give me the lead role.

473
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:17,105
So...

474
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,508
why should my aunt have
to suffer because of you?

475
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:23,778
You took those drugs from
our house without permission.

476
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:26,615
What about your aunt who brought
that kind of stuff into the house?

477
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:27,716
Is she not at fault?

478
00:38:29,484 --> 00:38:31,853
My aunt brought it for euthanizing animals.

479
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,856
You took it without permission,
and you're so shameless about it.

480
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:35,690
Hey.

481
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,727
Your aunt was the one who told me to do it.

482
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,434
It's true that I stole it,

483
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,503
but your aunt was the one
who asked me to keep it a secret.

484
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:50,705
Think about it.

485
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:53,541
A doctor examined me. How
could she not know why I collapsed?

486
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,478
She knew everything and
still lied for you. Do you get it?

487
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:02,951
I don't believe you.

488
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:54,102
Say hello.

489
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,553
Dad is late.

490
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:18,727
Father.

491
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:21,696
Father.

492
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,366
Please deliver me from evil,

493
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:26,034
and deliver me from temptation,

494
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:27,602
please...

495
00:40:39,714 --> 00:40:41,316
Hey, I can't right now.

496
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:42,851
I'm at the church.

497
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:44,986
I'm Michael, you know.

498
00:40:45,587 --> 00:40:47,355
I was baptized.

499
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,493
What?

500
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:54,195
Edible con...

501
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,565
Huh?

502
00:40:57,265 --> 00:40:59,167
Oh, there's a candied fruit flavor?

503
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,969
I'm sorry. Candied fruit.

504
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,944
I'll be right there after my confession.

505
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:10,579
Wait.

506
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:12,847
Don't eat it.

507
00:41:25,393 --> 00:41:26,228
Father.

508
00:41:27,662 --> 00:41:29,931
Please deliver me from my wife,

509
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:32,701
and just don't let me get nailed to the cross.

510
00:41:34,603 --> 00:41:36,004
I'll just have a little taste.

511
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:37,505
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.

512
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:43,445
Excuse me.

513
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:47,249
As my lawyer, you know this better than anyone,

514
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:49,084
but you must maintain client confidentiality.

515
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:50,952
Things regarding Jae-yeon's aunt as well,

516
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:52,287
you must not tell anyone around you.

517
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:56,157
Then I'll speak as your lawyer.

518
00:41:57,058 --> 00:42:00,662
'If you help the police
catch Woo So-jeong, we'll reduce your sentence.'

519
00:42:01,096 --> 00:42:03,131
Of course, they didn't say it outright,

520
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:05,300
but they offered me this deal as your lawyer.

521
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:09,237
For now, don't contact Ms. Woo So-jeong
without my permission.

522
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:11,740
Of course, meeting her is absolutely forbidden.

523
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,508
Say you went on a trip and cut off contact.

524
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:15,544
So-jeong and I,

525
00:42:15,544 --> 00:42:17,445
we only did medical volunteer work together.

526
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:19,047
We counseled during that process.

527
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:21,149
You're facing a murder charge.

528
00:42:24,786 --> 00:42:27,594
I do not want my client's
sentence to increase

529
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:30,425
because he's trying to
protect someone else.

530
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:32,727
If you want me to keep your secrets as a lawyer,

531
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:34,596
do as I suggest.

532
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:37,132
Otherwise, I will not take your case.

533
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:46,274
I can't accept the
conditions the police offered.

534
00:42:47,008 --> 00:42:49,211
Asking me to cooperate in catching Woo So-jeong,

535
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:51,279
don't ever say that again.

536
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,281
I don't need a lawyer who makes such proposals.

537
00:42:54,482 --> 00:42:57,852
Instead, I'll take your advice,

538
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,055
and keep my distance.

539
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,640
You like me, don't you?

540
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:22,077
You like me.

541
00:43:23,378 --> 00:43:25,080
I'm asking you for a favor.

542
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:27,249
You won't do it?

543
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:35,957
I can't let my aunt be harmed because of you.

544
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:45,033
Hey, are you crazy?

545
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:47,269
What, Yun-ji? What is it?

546
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,873
Oh, what should I do!

547
00:43:54,976 --> 00:43:56,578
Hey, what did I just see?

548
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:58,914
No, she suddenly... by force...

549
00:44:01,216 --> 00:44:03,218
She must be crazy.

550
00:44:03,218 --> 00:44:07,122
- I didn't do it!
- Are you okay?

551
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:11,393
Oh, she must be crazy.

552
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,637
Yes, Dr. Woo.

553
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:24,839
Are you calling about Ms. Lee Yun-hee?

554
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:28,176
I was just about to call you.

555
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:32,314
Ms. Lee Yun-hee, just a little while ago,

556
00:44:32,781 --> 00:44:34,616
departed for a better place.

557
00:44:41,756 --> 00:44:43,258
Is there anything I can do to help?

558
00:44:43,525 --> 00:44:44,359
No.

559
00:44:44,759 --> 00:44:46,828
It's okay. The social workers here

560
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:48,930
and I will take care of everything.

561
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:53,335
And I'll send the child to an
orphanage run by a priest I know well.

562
00:44:53,802 --> 00:44:54,636
Doctor.

563
00:44:55,036 --> 00:44:56,404
You've worked very hard.

564
00:44:57,472 --> 00:45:00,108
Don't worry about anything else now,

565
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,244
just get some rest.

566
00:45:05,113 --> 00:45:05,947
Okay.

567
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:19,160
I've checked the CCTV,

568
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,695
but they say there's no recorded footage.

569
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:22,964
Among the hospital patients right now,

570
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:25,700
I'm going to look for more potential witnesses.

571
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:27,769
Yes.

572
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:34,142
When did she go missing?

573
00:45:34,476 --> 00:45:36,177
Did she leave the school grounds?

574
00:45:36,177 --> 00:45:37,445
She left her bag,

575
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:40,282
so I thought she'd be inside
the school, but she's not.

576
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,083
Ms. Woo,

577
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,719
where else might Jae-yeon have gone?

578
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:45,987
The doors are closing.

579
00:45:46,755 --> 00:45:47,923
Is something wrong?

580
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:50,659
What is it?

581
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:52,894
My niece is missing.

582
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:03,538
Get in.

583
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:06,841
Get in, quick.

584
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:22,424
Hey, are you for real?
Do you like girls?

585
00:46:22,424 --> 00:46:23,558
Then will you go out with me?

586
00:46:23,558 --> 00:46:25,460
Hey, do you really like girls?

587
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:39,808
Jae-yeon!

588
00:47:14,442 --> 00:47:15,343
I'm sorry.

589
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:18,647
I didn't realize it was so late.

590
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:22,584
Thank you.

591
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,405
Thanks for today.

592
00:47:44,172 --> 00:47:45,006
No.

593
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:46,975
I'm just glad we found her.

594
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,182
What happened to the patient
who was having severe seizures?

595
00:47:58,019 --> 00:47:59,187
Ms. Lee Yun-hee.

596
00:48:01,356 --> 00:48:02,490
She passed away.

597
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:04,926
I see.

598
00:48:24,145 --> 00:48:25,480
This is my real number.

599
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:29,017
If anything urgent happens
with the kids,

600
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:30,418
you should call.

601
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,255
As a police officer, I can help with this kind of thing.

602
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:41,229
Thank you.

603
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:46,067
Ban Ji-hoon, that's my name.

604
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:49,204
We are already investigating you

605
00:48:49,671 --> 00:48:51,973
under the assumption that you're a criminal.

606
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:56,511
You think of me that way too, don't you?

607
00:48:57,979 --> 00:48:59,614
I will catch you, no matter what.

608
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:07,355
So that you are punished exactly
for the crime you committed.

609
00:49:12,394 --> 00:49:15,363
You are destroying yourself to save others.

610
00:49:34,273 --> 00:49:35,307
What should I do?

611
00:49:35,307 --> 00:49:36,708
The baby's head is already showing.

612
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,610
If we're not careful, she might
give birth while being moved.

613
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,279
Breathe out slowly.

614
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,149
Just a little longer.

615
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:45,117
There, there.

616
00:49:45,117 --> 00:49:47,719
Vitals are normal, SpO2 is 95, Doctor.

617
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,988
Okay, just a little more effort. A little more.

618
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:52,191
Just a little more push.

619
00:49:52,191 --> 00:49:54,226
Take deep, deep breaths. Deeply.

620
00:49:54,226 --> 00:49:56,695
Deeply. Yes, that's it.

621
00:49:56,695 --> 00:49:59,665
Breathe deeply. You're doing great.

622
00:49:59,665 --> 00:50:01,233
Okay, a little more push.

623
00:50:01,233 --> 00:50:03,368
Just a little push. You're doing great.

624
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:07,239
You're doing great.
Okay, okay, just push a little more.

625
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,276
Thank you.

626
00:50:44,276 --> 00:50:45,778
Thank you so much.

627
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:50,916
Thank you, thank you.

628
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:54,219
Su-jin, your little sibling is born.

629
00:51:12,304 --> 00:51:14,273
Oh, Dr. Woo, you're here.

630
00:51:14,273 --> 00:51:17,042
Ah, yes. I wanted to know where

631
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:19,077
Ms. Lee Yun-hee's child is being sent.

632
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:21,113
There's something I want to give her.

633
00:51:21,113 --> 00:51:23,816
Oh goodness.
Where did that child go?

634
00:51:23,816 --> 00:51:28,787
I don't think a specific place
has been decided for her yet.

635
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:31,123
- Uh...
- ♪ Blue sky ♪

636
00:51:31,123 --> 00:51:33,492

Why did you deceive me?

649
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,513
You know very well that medically,
there's nothing more that can be done.

650
00:52:27,513 --> 00:52:28,881
Don't you?

651
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:31,517
Yes.

652
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:34,153
A life of submission is also beautiful.

653
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:37,156
You're being irresponsible, just like back then.

654
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:48,500
- Eat well.
- Okay.

655
00:52:55,507 --> 00:52:59,978
Were you singing that
song just now for your mom?

656
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:01,747
The nun said she would hear it.

657
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:04,950
My mom liked it when I sang.

658
00:53:06,985 --> 00:53:08,086
She did?

659
00:53:14,726 --> 00:53:15,694
Song-yi.

660
00:53:18,597 --> 00:53:19,965
I'm not

661
00:53:22,468 --> 00:53:24,103
skilled enough as a doctor.

662
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:32,444
I don't think I can save your mom.

663
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:35,481
I'm sorry.

664
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:38,183
I know that too.

665
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:43,155
I already think my mom has gone to heaven.

666
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:47,159
Why do you think that?

667
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,495
Because my mom said so.

668
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:54,333
She said that when she's sick,
she's not her real self,

669
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:57,436
so no matter what she says,
I shouldn't be upset.

670
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,876
What was your mom like when she was sick?

671
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,811
She'd scream.

672
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:07,880
Swear.

673
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,481
Get angry.

674
00:54:10,382 --> 00:54:12,084
That's what my mom was like.

675
00:54:12,985 --> 00:54:17,422
She told me to only remember the things
she said when she wasn't sick.

676
00:54:29,868 --> 00:54:30,702
Then...

677
00:54:35,474 --> 00:54:37,109
is it okay to let your mom go now?

678
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:05,337
- I need the drug.
- Fuck.

679
00:55:09,508 --> 00:55:10,476
Dr. Woo.

680
00:55:11,443 --> 00:55:14,746
The one making the
demands is me, not you.

681
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:19,218
She's in too much pain.
I absolutely need the drug.

682
00:55:19,218 --> 00:55:20,219
Damn it.

683
00:55:22,221 --> 00:55:23,055
Get out.

684
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:33,632
Are you crazy?

685
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:37,402
You're being chased by the police
and you're going to do it again?

686
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:42,040
It is because you see blood all the time as
a docor that you've got some serious guts.

687
00:55:42,307 --> 00:55:43,375
Are you insane?

688
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:44,743
I'm begging you.

689
00:55:49,648 --> 00:55:50,649
In this world,

690
00:55:51,784 --> 00:55:54,486
there are plenty of people who
don't want to die while suffering.

691
00:55:54,486 --> 00:55:56,688
And, well, of course, it's illegal now,

692
00:55:57,556 --> 00:55:58,991
but as time goes on,

693
00:56:00,726 --> 00:56:02,194
it could become a matter of choice,

694
00:56:02,194 --> 00:56:03,262
and that could become

695
00:56:03,996 --> 00:56:05,998
a human right.

696
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:09,935
Who's the patient?

697
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,505
The situation is very urgent.
I'll explain later.

698
00:56:13,505 --> 00:56:14,339
Damn it.

699
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,375
Look.

700
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:18,677
Listen carefully.

701
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:23,048
If you want to keep doing that work,
you need my permission.

702
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:28,387
When and where, at what time,
and who you're going to kill,

703
00:56:29,188 --> 00:56:30,856
do it in front of me.

704
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:34,526
The person you say you're going to kill,

705
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:36,895
where is the person you want to kill right now?

706
00:56:38,964 --> 00:56:41,366
The documents you requested
regarding Woo So-jeong have been sent.

707
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:42,301
Please check them.

708
00:57:13,165 --> 00:57:15,100
Where is the person you want to kill right now?

709
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,102
I need to see for myself.

710
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:21,707
That way, whether to use my merchandise or not,

711
00:57:23,008 --> 00:57:26,211
I'll be the one to decide. Not you, me.

712
00:57:28,647 --> 00:57:30,983
"Benponarbital"

713
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,985
This is what Ji-hoon requested.

714
00:57:32,985 --> 00:57:35,621
The documents regarding Woo So-jeong
and Father Yang have come in.

715
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:36,889
Where's Ji-hoon?

716
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:39,591
It seems he left right after checking this.
He's not answering his phone.

717
00:57:39,591 --> 00:57:40,959
What kind of documents are they?

718
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:42,661
It seems Woo So-jeong and Father Yang

719
00:57:42,661 --> 00:57:44,797
have known each other
since they were very young.

720
00:57:44,797 --> 00:57:46,632
Since Woo So-jeong was Woo Chae-young.

721
00:57:47,299 --> 00:57:48,700
Who's Woo Chae-young?

722
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,370
Woo So-jeong changed her name when she was 18.

723
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,938
From Woo Chae-young to Woo So-jeong.

724
00:57:52,938 --> 00:57:53,806
Why?

725
00:57:53,806 --> 00:57:56,742
Her mother, who was suffering from cancer,
passed away when she was 16.

726
00:57:56,742 --> 00:57:59,111
Damn, she changed her
name because her mom died?

727
00:57:59,611 --> 00:58:02,714
Woo So-jeong was the prime
suspect in her mother's murder case.

728
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,485
It was concluded as a suicide,

729
00:58:06,485 --> 00:58:09,521
but at first, it was suspected to be a murder.

730
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:12,758
How did she die to be suspected of murder?

731
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:15,060
Where is Dr. Woo So-jeong?

732
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,195
What is it?

733
00:58:16,195 --> 00:58:18,030
Dr. Woo has already left for the day.

734
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:21,200
She died by falling into the lake near her house,

735
00:58:22,101 --> 00:58:24,036
drowned with her hands tied behind her back.

736
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:35,447
When did you realize your mom was gone?

737
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:37,916
I found out in the morning.

738
00:58:38,684 --> 00:58:41,920
I saw her jumping into the lake and went in to save her.

739
00:58:42,988 --> 00:58:44,389
But I failed.

740
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:48,260
She committed suicide.

741
00:58:50,295 --> 00:58:53,298
My mom always wanted to die.

742
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:57,136
You didn't see when or how
she jumped into the water?

743
00:58:58,804 --> 00:58:59,638
No.

744
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:03,108
But she was found with her
hands tied, and behind her back.

745
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:05,244
How do you think she tied them?

746
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:12,351
Did you tie your mother's hands for her?

747
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:15,420
I was trying to save my mom.

748
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:29,240
{\an8}Get your k-fix @ SinFlix!

749
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:29,240
QC by Linja

750
00:59:42,347 --> 00:59:44,650
Ms. Woo Chae-young, why did you change your name?

751
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,352
Weren't you the one who tied your mother's hands?

752
00:59:49,488 --> 00:59:50,489
Mom!

753
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,423
I told you, didn't I?

754
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,158
There's no way she's been living quietly.

755
00:59:53,158 --> 00:59:54,560
Please let our child die.

756
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,229
This place is too much of a hell.

757
00:59:57,229 --> 00:59:58,430
Was that the beginning?

758
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:01,667
The things that happened around me,
you think I did them all.

759
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,869
Now you have to give up on being
found innocent of the murder charge.

760
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:06,705
Please persuade Ms. Woo So-jeong
and help her confess.

761
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:11,176
You are under emergency arrest as the perpetrator
in the murder case of Ms. Lee Yun-hee.
