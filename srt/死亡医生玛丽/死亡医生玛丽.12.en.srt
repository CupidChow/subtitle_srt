1
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,919
This drama deals with the sensitive
subject of euthanasia

2
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,990
and may be disturbing
for some viewers.

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,569
{\an8}FINAL EPISODE

4
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,353
{\an8}He's here.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,941
{\an8}Welcome.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,975
{\an8}Oh, yeah.

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:25,926
{\an8}Hi.

8
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,714
{\an8}- Thanks.
- Welcome back, Uncle.

9
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,633
{\an8}Wow, Jae-yeon, you look great.

10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,953
{\an8}Hi, Uncle.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,988
{\an8}What would you like for dinner?

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,823
{\an8}Jae-yoon isn't happy to see me, but...

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,792
{\an8}that we're having dinner.

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,395
{\an8}No, it's just that my aunt said earlier that
we'd all have whatever you wanted for dinner.

15
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,345
{\an8}Really?

16
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,249
{\an8}Hey, where's Song-i?

17
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,551
{\an8}Looks like he doesn't know where Song-i is.

18
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,227
{\an8}Song-i?

19
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:03,929
{\an8}Are you Song-i?

20
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:07,099
{\an8}Uncle didn't recognize you.

21
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,951
{\an8}You're so beautiful.

22
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:12,136
{\an8}Wow, you've grown up so much.

23
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:14,958
Dr. Choi.

24
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:17,959
Yes.

25
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,345
- The prodigal son has returned.
- Yes.

26
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:23,381
An old prodigal son.

27
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:25,883
Welcome.

28
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:29,621
I'll watch over him like a sheepdog.

29
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,375
- Got it?
- I'll keep that in mind.

30
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,376
- Hello.
- Yes.

31
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,277
Oh, Father.

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,180
But they say the plaque
will arrive at 7:00 p.m.

33
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:39,681
And the event is at 6:00 p.m.

34
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:40,982
What do we do if it arrives at 7:00 p.m.?

35
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:41,783
That's why...

36
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:44,035
Oh, another test.

37
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,521
I'm a little distracted
preparing for the event.

38
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:47,705
See you in a bit.

39
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,893
It seems patient Kim Seon-ju's
pain is getting worse.

40
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,695
- I'll go check on her.
- Doctor.

41
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:55,496
I'll go see the patient.

42
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,415
Ye-na, help the nuns...

43
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,368
with the event preparations.

44
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,869
Ah, yes, I will.

45
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,605
Sorry, I have to go too.

46
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:04,355
Yes.

47
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:08,109
I'm glad you're back safe and sound.

48
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:10,311
We'll say hello tomorrow at work.

49
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:11,595
Enjoy your meal with the kids.

50
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,602
Ah, it wasn't my welcome home party.

51
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,522
Uncle, let's go eat.

52
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:22,356
Sure, what do you want?

53
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,292
Auntie left her card a while ago.

54
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,726
Let's go eat something good.

55
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:27,428
Meat, let's go.

56
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:28,845
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

57
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,515
What are you in the mood for?

58
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,353
I gave her a little more pain medication.

59
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,338
She'll feel good now,

60
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,657
but she might feel worse
in the early morning.

61
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:43,877
I have an event today,
so I'll be at the hospital late.

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,512
Let me know then.

63
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:47,263
Thank you, Doctor.

64
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:49,341
Doctor.

65
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,035
You don't offer hormone therapy here,

66
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,836
or radiofrequency hyperthermia treatments,
right?

67
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:55,437
No.

68
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,057
Without charging a penny,

69
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,326
and she treats us so well.

70
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,613
Don't talk nonsense.

71
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:04,866
What about bone scans, CT scans, or MRIs?

72
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,034
If we suspect a spinal fracture,

73
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:09,718
we can take X-rays.

74
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,621
I don't need any of that.

75
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,507
I've already had radiation therapy,

76
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,876
and that hyperthermia thing too,

77
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,244
and nothing worked for me.

78
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,895
It was no use.

79
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:22,347
Here...

80
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,532
I like that the doctor makes
me feel comfortable.

81
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:25,927
I like it.

82
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:27,689
It's comfortable.

83
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:34,358
I can prescribe medication
to reduce the risk of fractures.

84
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,662
And through the volunteers
who come during the week,

85
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:40,414
I'll arrange physical
therapy to relieve the pain.

86
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,423
Sorry, I had it on silent.

87
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:52,193
I'll give it to you this
weekend without fail.

88
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:56,664
I'm sorry, Doctor.

89
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:00,551
She thinks she couldn't
pay the medical bills,

90
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:03,704
and that's why I switched to this hospital.

91
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:07,458
That's why she feels
bad and acts like this.

92
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,943
Because of the treatment costs,

93
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,086
I think she even borrowed
money from loan sharks.

94
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,683
I'm okay,
I understand how your daughter feels.

95
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:18,552
Thank you.

96
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,895
Yes, the Lord

97
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,950
said that the act of sharing
bread with others...

98
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,502
is charity.

99
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,948
Thank you for your consideration

100
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,466
and for your donations.

101
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:34,752
Thanks to you all, over the past year,

102
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:36,254
at the Bendición de María Hospital,

103
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:39,707
we were able to save and treat many people.

104
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,167
I want to thank all the sponsors again

105
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,194
and volunteers who joined us today.

106
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:46,764
So, let's give them a round
of applause for their work!

107
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:48,182
Yes, thank you.

108
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:56,524
Mom, Mom.

109
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:59,193
Mom, are you okay?

110
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:04,064
That's why I'm telling you
to get proper treatment!

111
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,050
Mom.

112
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:08,736
I'll get more money,
no matter what it takes.

113
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,240
So let's go for more treatments
at the previous hospital, okay?

114
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:17,261
- Yes.
- Thank you.

115
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:20,681
- It's nothing.
- Thank you.

116
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:23,801
Thank you for coming to this
year's sponsorship event.

117
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:26,571
Even though it's late,
congratulations on becoming the director.

118
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:27,538
Thank you.

119
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:28,806
I know you're busy,

120
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,575
but you come every year.

121
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,610
You even keep donating.

122
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,062
Well, thanks to that, I do good deeds too.

123
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,670
So, at least once a year,

124
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:41,368
we see each other and confirm it.

125
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,660
I also know about these
things from experience.

126
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:47,508
After Dae-hyun went to prison for drugs,

127
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,293
I was like that too.

128
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:52,646
Using food as an excuse,
we'll meet up to see each other in person.

129
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,716
Mr. Jo Jeong-ho,

130
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,285
whom you went to care for,

131
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:00,387
passed away.

132
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,430
It seems he started
drinking again after I left.

133
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:10,948
Yes.

134
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:12,297
In the autopsy,

135
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,816
there was nothing problematic,

136
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:15,694
but still,

137
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,675
be careful when making house calls.

138
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:19,849
Woo So-jeong,

139
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,775
if there are suspicious deaths around you,

140
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:24,477
you know it's dangerous, right?

141
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:28,782
How do you feel after looking around?

142
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,650
Do you feel more at ease?

143
00:06:33,486 --> 00:06:34,671
Doctor.

144
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:36,456
My mom has gotten worse.

145
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:39,859
Yeong-eun?

146
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,014
Ji-hoon?

147
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:44,798
Noona.

148
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,602
My Ji-hoon.

149
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,240
Oh, look how much my Ji-hoon has grown.

150
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,193
Have you been well?

151
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:57,010
Yes.

152
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:58,678
You...

153
00:06:59,245 --> 00:07:00,764
You became a cop?

154
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:01,598
Yes.

155
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,750
Well done, I'm so proud.

156
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:09,072
For growing up so wonderfully…

157
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:13,143
You've endured so much
suffering all this time.

158
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,694
Oh, how admirable.

159
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,465
If your aunt and uncle were here…

160
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:21,834
How much would they have loved it?

161
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:23,836
That's right.

162
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:27,824
When you were a kid, you were so weak.

163
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,092
When you went out to play…

164
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:33,413
You often ended up coming
home on Young-eun's back.

165
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:37,868
But I'm glad you've grown up
so well and without getting sick.

166
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:39,886
It's a great relief.

167
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:41,921
As a child, really…

168
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:45,308
I was okay because of you, Yeong-eun.

169
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,759
- Yes.
- Thank you.

170
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,762
You don't have to thank me.

171
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:52,298
Auntie…

172
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,233
is sorry…

173
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,036
for sending you to the orphanage…

174
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,972
and not visiting you much.

175
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:02,008
That's not true.

176
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:04,294
Even after I went to the orphanage…

177
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:05,862
you came several times.

178
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,980
I only have grateful memories.

179
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,757
Did you arrive?

180
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,146
Bring me some bottles of pentobarbital.

181
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:24,797
Don't tell my husband.

182
00:08:25,865 --> 00:08:27,116
Maybe…

183
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,667
is it for insomnia?

184
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,953
If so, it's very dangerous.

185
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,087
You better call me.

186
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,905
- I'm not dangerous.
- Oh, my God.

187
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:40,195
It's just that I have
to experiment with something.

188
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:43,048
It's a business matter, so just bring it.

189
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,268
Yes.

190
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:47,952
Go.

191
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:02,217
What am I going to experiment with?

192
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,735
What will I do it with, huh?

193
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:05,603
What will I do it with?

194
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,274
What will I do it with?

195
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:14,512
Ah, yes.

196
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:26,908
Yes, that's right.

197
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:29,310
It's comfortable because
it supports my spine, but…

198
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:31,213
if they do it too strong, it could…

199
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:32,621
get hurt.

200
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,037
Since it's already stretched

201
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:35,306
Move carefully.

202
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,479
And relax.

203
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:38,702
- Thank you.
- Yes.

204
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:43,874
But...

205
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:46,844
Are you always alone in your room?

206
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:48,812
My daughter...

207
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,282
She's busy trying to find money.

208
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,318
I guess she wants her mother

209
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,028
to get better treatment.

210
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:04,995
So, you want to go back
to the hospital you were in before?

211
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:08,711
I never want to go back there.

212
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,501
You can't imagine how much it hurts.

213
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,137
Treatment is supposed to help you live...

214
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,741
I don't know why it has to hurt so much.

215
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:23,113
It's torture.

216
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:28,068
Yes, I understand.

217
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:29,303
Rest.

218
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:30,571
Oh, yes.

219
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:31,989
Thank you.

220
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:46,447
Excuse me, patient.

221
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:47,721
Yes?

222
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:50,306
If you have time,
would you mind taking a walk with me

223
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,560
in the park across the street?

224
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:54,778
Huh? No...

225
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,598
There's a park across the street?

226
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:58,732
Well, when the flowers bloom...

227
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:02,069
there's an incredibly beautiful park.

228
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:03,720
But there aren't any flowers yet.

229
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,912
I'd like to, but...

230
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:08,708
I'm busy.

231
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,710
Will you have time for that?

232
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,346
Yes,
that's why I'm asking you for the favor.

233
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:15,315
The director of this
hospital is a friend of mine.

234
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:18,218
She's very mean and exploitative.

235
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,187
She doesn't give me time to rest.

236
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,339
So I'm going to use it as an excuse
to go to the park across the street and...

237
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:26,109
skip work.

238
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,213
Sure, that's fine with me.

239
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:39,473
Are you going home now?

240
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:41,975
Yes, I worked last night.

241
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:43,243
Good job.

242
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:44,845
- Have a good one.
- Yes.

243
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:48,464
Oh, the lady isn't in her room.

244
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:50,417
Did something happen?

245
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,721
No, Dr. Choi Dae-hyun took her
for a walk in the park across the street.

246
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:55,822
Oh, yes.

247
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:58,191
Since she's alone all day,
I thought she might be frustrated.

248
00:11:58,274 --> 00:11:59,892
I think that's why he accompanied her.

249
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,262
I should have accompanied her.

250
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:03,830
I appreciate it.

251
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:05,922
But is Mr. Choi Dae-hyun...

252
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:08,701
the man who wears a white cardigan?

253
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:10,353
Yes, that's him.

254
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:13,072
Thank you, come in quickly.

255
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,557
- Yes, come in.
- Yes.

256
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:20,363
DOCTOR CHOI DAE-HYUN

257
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,536
MASTERMIND AND ACCOMPLICES ARRESTED
IN PENTOBARBITAL MURDER CASE

258
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:34,710
REAL NAME OF KEY FIGURE REVEALED
IN PENTOBARBITAL MURDER CASE

259
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:47,807
- There's a field of reeds.
- When the flowers bloom here...

260
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,792
it's really spectacular.

261
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:56,316
I wish I could see it again.

262
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,650
Aren't you a little tired?

263
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,918
- Shall we go inside?
- No, no.

264
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,770
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

265
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:03,305
How pretty.

266
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,975
The pine trees are lovely too, so green.

267
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,832
So, the director here...

268
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:16,385
still doesn't accept my feelings.

269
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:18,787
Ah, yes.

270
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:20,422
- Ah, yes.
- Thank you.

271
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,161
Your daughter arrived early today, right?

272
00:13:24,425 --> 00:13:26,874
Then, have a good night.

273
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:30,248
Yes, please help me sneak out next time.

274
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,832
- Thank you.
- Yes.

275
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,388
- Mom.
- Yes?

276
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,839
Don't go out with that man.

277
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:40,975
- Huh?
- That man killed people.

278
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:45,713
It seems he only targeted
sick elderly people.

279
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,566
What are you talking about?

280
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,601
He's such a good person.

281
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:54,121
Saying he would give them euthanasia,
he killed people and was in prison.

282
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,224
I'm telling you it's true.

283
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,379
Do you want me to find the article
and show it to you? There are also photos.

284
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:01,996
Huh?

285
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:05,299
If you don't believe me, ask Ji-hoon.

286
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:08,168
Ji-hoon is a police officer,
so he'll surely know.

287
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:09,269
Huh?

288
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:17,077
The hospital will get a little
noisy because of me for a while.

289
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,981
How long would you have hidden it?

290
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:23,450
I thought the issue would
come to light somehow.

291
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,016
The patient...

292
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,722
or their family, we need to explain
and ask for their understanding.

293
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,993
I think they'll be very surprised.

294
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,062
I would have been too.

295
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:50,443
I like being here.

296
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:54,131
If it's to go to that hospital again,

297
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,982
I'd rather go home.

298
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:58,218
What kind of treatment is that?

299
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:03,574
If it's to receive treatment,
I won't go anywhere.

300
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:06,426
I'd rather die here.

301
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:09,629
If you want to go, go by yourself.

302
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:17,304
I know you're doing this because you don't want me to get
further into debt, and you're worried about money...

303
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:19,406
But enough is enough.

304
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,676
Mom, if you keep doing this,
I'm going to feel really miserable.

305
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,698
How useless must I be at this age

306
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:30,717
to not have money and be unable
to pay for my mom's treatment?

307
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:35,855
My life feels so empty and frustrating.

308
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:37,857
So, please, stop it.

309
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,802
Ji-hoon said he'll come
pick us up in the morning.

310
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:53,840
Mom, I don't like the hospital
you were at before either.

311
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,776
So I'll find a better one.

312
00:15:58,497 --> 00:15:59,732
Let's go somewhere else.

313
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:06,753
It looks like she's going
to switch hospitals.

314
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,841
In the end, that's what she decided.

315
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:13,092
Yeong-eun asked me...

316
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:15,287
if it was true...

317
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:17,427
that Choi Dae-hyun...

318
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:19,417
had gone to prison for something like that.

319
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,167
From his daughter's perspective...

320
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:25,655
it would be hard to accept that
a doctor is involved with euthanasia.

321
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:27,006
It would be hard to accept, wouldn't it?

322
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:29,881
But...

323
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,144
actually...

324
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,334
I think they're just excuses...

325
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:38,017
because from the beginning,
she wanted a hospital with more treatments.

326
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,595
Choi Dae-hyun...

327
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:41,723
is just...

328
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,150
an excuse.

329
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,760
Please prepare what's needed
for discharge tomorrow.

330
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:49,477
Okay.

331
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:01,967
I'm telling you, I can go alone.

332
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,660
You said you were going to get your things.

333
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:05,844
There aren't many.

334
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:08,547
Wait outside,
and I'll take care of bringing them.

335
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:09,782
Let's go together.

336
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:11,416
I'll carry the things.

337
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,620
Thank you, Ji-hoon.

338
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,261
Why isn't it working?

339
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:25,710
Come in with your shoes on.

340
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,267
The floor is freezing.

341
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:34,572
In a little while,
my feet will be so cold they'll hurt.

342
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:39,844
I'll pack the things quickly.

343
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:48,403
Which ones are they?

344
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:49,687
- This?
- No, nothing.

345
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,359
You were very surprised to see how we live,
weren't you?

346
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,706
Because it looks more like
a storage unit than a house.

347
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:00,932
Were you always at the hospital?

348
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:05,236
I kept cutting costs and lived
here without even unpacking.

349
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,505
Because I'm almost always at the hospital.

350
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,661
How did your father pass away?

351
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:14,737
A cerebral hemorrhage.

352
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,749
He just collapsed and left without a word.

353
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:21,914
So we couldn't get the money
that was owed to us,

354
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,887
but everyone came to collect what we owed.

355
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:27,216
We went bankrupt without realizing it,
and we closed the restaurant.

356
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,628
After that, my mom cleaned buildings,
and I worked whatever jobs I could find.

357
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:34,698
And to top it off, my aunt got sick too.

358
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,701
It must've been hard for you all alone.

359
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:41,605
It wasn't hard.

360
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:44,100
I haven't given my mom anything...

361
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,265
and that's what I regret.

362
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:49,379
So...

363
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:52,983
I'll do whatever it takes
to get my mom treatment.

364
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,519
My poor mom.

365
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,589
I want her to live,
even if it's just for one more day.

366
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,648
What?

367
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:20,960
Huh?

368
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,571
Please, have a seat.

369
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,078
Oh, Doctor.

370
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,976
Thank you for everything during this time.

371
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:58,914
I felt really good here.

372
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,901
But we didn't do anything for you.

373
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:07,223
Even though you were very kind to me...

374
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,860
not having to receive that
horrible and painful treatment...

375
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,297
made me very happy.

376
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,892
- Was it very difficult to receive the treatment?
- Yes.

377
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,228
Just thinking about having to go
back to that horrible place...

378
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:26,208
But it's my daughter's wish...

379
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:33,115
And since it's what she wants...

380
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,284
I'll have to go, won't I?

381
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:39,819
Why don't you talk to your daughter?

382
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,365
I shouldn't say this in
front of the Virgin...

383
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:55,004
Can't I decide...

384
00:20:56,372 --> 00:21:00,509
how I want my end to be?

385
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,567
Mom.

386
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:26,935
Mom.

387
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,409
Woo So-jeong.

388
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:36,762
What's going on?

389
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,713
Kim Seon-ju disappeared from the hospital.

390
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:41,382
Yes, Brother.

391
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,615
On the cameras near
the convenience store in Seojin-dong,

392
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:47,822
an elderly woman in a hospital gown who
appears to be Kim Seon-ju was caught on camera.

393
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:20,705
It's early morning.
The bus won't be here for a while.

394
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:22,692
Come with me.

395
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,027
I'm not going there.

396
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,663
What's the point of going?

397
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,065
Young-eun is waiting for you.

398
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:32,287
I...

399
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:36,971
If I go there, I don't think I can
endure another treatment.

400
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:46,814
Ji-hoon.

401
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,793
I have...

402
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:51,485
a wish.

403
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:04,972
Grant it to me.

404
00:23:24,884 --> 00:23:25,664
Young-eun.

405
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm sorry.

406
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:33,037
Mom.

407
00:23:35,362 --> 00:23:37,197
Trust me just one more time.

408
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:41,184
I'll make sure you get
better and live longer.

409
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:43,136
I know I can do it.

410
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:51,178
It's not that I don't trust you,
that's not why I don't want the treatment.

411
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:52,879
Then what is it?

412
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:58,451
It's just that the debts you have now...

413
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:01,220
you'll have a hard time paying
them off your whole life.

414
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,894
You don't want the treatment?

415
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:12,965
How are you going to get rid of this?

416
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,914
What is this?

417
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:32,018
Are you planning to die after I die?

418
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:38,057
You borrow to pay for the hospital...

419
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:42,194
When I die,
are you planning to die after me?

420
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:55,374
Mom.

421
00:25:00,812 --> 00:25:01,680
Let's...

422
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:07,319
let's live together until we die.

423
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:09,855
Let's die together.

424
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:14,113
I can't live without you.

425
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:15,980
I don't even want to live.

426
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:24,736
Young-eun...

427
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:30,058
let me go now.

428
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:31,042
I won't let you go.

429
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:34,263
I can't let you go,

430
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:36,281
not like this.

431
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:42,120
It just hurts so much.

432
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:46,758
If it already hurts this much now...

433
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:50,428
how much more will it hurt in the future?

434
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:53,598
I'm scared.

435
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:57,936
Even at this age, I'm scared.

436
00:25:58,436 --> 00:25:59,637
I'm so scared.

437
00:26:04,776 --> 00:26:06,878
What kind of treatment is this?

438
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,165
They say they're fighting the cancer...

439
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:12,150
but I'm going to die early, Mom.

440
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:21,192
I didn't know it hurt you so much.

441
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,797
I didn't know you were scared.

442
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,901
I'm sorry, Mom.

443
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:35,090
So now...

444
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:37,675
I won't get treatment.

445
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:42,613
I want...

446
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:47,218
I want to see my daughter's face
as much as I can before I die.

447
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:50,188
Yes.

448
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:51,956
All this time...

449
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:56,928
the two of us worked to earn money...

450
00:26:57,562 --> 00:27:01,666
We were so busy that we
couldn't spend time together.

451
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:03,768
Really?

452
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:06,971
Yes.

453
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:09,273
All this time...

454
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:14,912
while I was getting that
painful treatment...

455
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:18,015
do you know how I endured it?

456
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:21,819
After the treatment...

457
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:24,288
at night...

458
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:27,224
when my daughter came...

459
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:30,995
I wanted to see your face.

460
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,931
That's why...

461
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:36,567
that's why I held on.

462
00:27:40,638 --> 00:27:41,872
Now...

463
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:45,293
my daughter's face...

464
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,113
I'll look at it until I'm
tired of it before I die.

465
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,016
I don't want any more treatments.

466
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,436
I don't want to receive those things.

467
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,954
I don't want to.

468
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:06,697
Mom...

469
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:12,002
Mom, I'm sorry.

470
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:19,493
Mom, I'm sorry.

471
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:20,644
Mom...

472
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:26,016
I'm sorry, Doctor.

473
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:28,185
I changed my mind.

474
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:29,953
I want my mom...

475
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:32,823
to continue being treated at this hospital.

476
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:37,694
Thank you for trusting us
and allowing us to treat her.

477
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:40,497
I...

478
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:46,137
I judged you and spoke badly for no reason.

479
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:47,488
I'm sorry.

480
00:28:47,571 --> 00:28:50,774
No, I should have apologized for my work.

481
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:52,709
I'm sorry.

482
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:56,846
Thank you for finding Mom.

483
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,515
It's nothing.

484
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:00,617
Well done, Young-eun.

485
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,993
We'll be able to see
each other often here...

486
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:06,422
and say goodbye to her properly.

487
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:08,224
Okay.

488
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:12,461
Mom...

489
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:15,148
- Yes?
- Should we call the ladies?

490
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:15,882
Huh?

491
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,784
From the last place you worked...

492
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:21,087
You were friends with the ladies
you cleaned the building with.

493
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,414
They sometimes called me.

494
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:26,158
Oh, of course, I'd like that.

495
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,210
I want to see them too.

496
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:30,479
I'll call them then.

497
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,517
Mom.

498
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:37,027
Yes?

499
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:40,889
Tell me if there's anything you want to do

500
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,425
and also what you want to eat.

501
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,094
I want to do that for you.

502
00:29:48,197 --> 00:29:50,365
What do you feel like doing?

503
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:55,755
I'd like to go to the park
across the street...

504
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,190
to walk...

505
00:29:58,273 --> 00:30:00,726
and talk a lot, just the two of us.

506
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:02,811
Yes, let's live like that.

507
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:06,331
Laughing,
let's do everything we want together.

508
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,549
Okay.

509
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:13,054
This place is great, I love it.

510
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:14,773
- Yes.
- That's good.

511
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,074
- When did you come?
- In the spring.

512
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:17,492
- Around that time?
- Yes.

513
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:21,228
Wouldn't it be great to come
when the flowers are blooming?

514
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:23,982
- Over there...
- Yes.

515
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:26,851
- There are a lot of reeds.
- A lot?

516
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:29,086
- That's good.
- Do you like it?

517
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:31,157
Being with you is great.
What more could I ask for?

518
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,845
I love being with you too, Mom.

519
00:30:34,588 --> 00:30:35,556
Of course.

520
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:38,996
Yes.

521
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,732
It's good that everyone is in good health.

522
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:43,634
- Yes.
- That's right.

523
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,218
I missed you, Seon-ju.

524
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,089
Is that boss Kim still so picky?

525
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:52,609
- He always shows off his granddaughter like that.
- Has she grown that much already?

526
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:55,161
- She does it on purpose, unnie.
- She's very cute.

527
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,231
How sweet.

528
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:27,110
The pain level...

529
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,847
from 1 to 10...

530
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,915
is marked here.

531
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:33,383
Tell me how much pain you're feeling

532
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:35,568
and how many hours apart it occurs.

533
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,990
No, it changes constantly.

534
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,592
When I feel strong...

535
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:44,644
A 5?

536
00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:47,564
When it rains...

537
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:49,682
or I worry about my daughter...

538
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,618
A 10.

539
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:53,970
But...

540
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,355
lately...

541
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,425
I'm like this constantly.

542
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,747
That must be very difficult.

543
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,866
It's admirable that you're
still holding on like this.

544
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,335
Thank you.

545
00:32:15,108 --> 00:32:16,976
It changes constantly.

546
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:20,613
When I feel strong, a 5...

547
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:22,715
Yes?

548
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:28,020
What did she say?

549
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:31,757
Huh?

550
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:34,961
Ah, uh, where...?

551
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,317
Being older,

552
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,869
could she have actually
forgotten for a moment?

553
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:47,356
She was only worried about her spine.

554
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:51,194
The sooner we detect it, the more ways
there will be to slow the progression.

555
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:52,978
Let's keep a closer eye on her.

556
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,572
Yes.

557
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:14,133
Thanks to you,
she's been sleeping well lately.

558
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:16,835
Your mother...

559
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,188
is sleeping more?

560
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:20,139
Yes.

561
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:23,676
It seems the pain has decreased a lot.

562
00:33:24,147 --> 00:33:27,406
And since her body has also improved,
she walks better than before.

563
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,496
Kids, come quickly. We have to go.

564
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:50,669
Oh, I'm sorry.

565
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:54,006
Mom.

566
00:34:04,817 --> 00:34:05,884
Mom.

567
00:34:33,178 --> 00:34:34,813
Mom!

568
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:46,742
In the cognitive screening test,

569
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:48,493
abnormal results already came out.

570
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:52,681
Including imaging tests, we'll have
to look for a more precise cause,

571
00:34:52,764 --> 00:34:54,566
but I'm sure she has
a cognitive function disorder.

572
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:57,653
But for her to suddenly
not recognize like this,

573
00:34:57,736 --> 00:34:59,822
even if it's Alzheimer's,

574
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:01,623
isn't it progressing faster than expected?

575
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:04,978
Among the various
medications she's been taking,

576
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,058
there seems to be a cause that
accelerated the progression.

577
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:16,171
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

578
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:17,188
Ji-hoon.

579
00:35:17,722 --> 00:35:18,925
Oh, Ji-hoon.

580
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:21,678
Help me, please.

581
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:25,012
You promised back then,

582
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,849
that you would perform euthanasia on me.

583
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:29,484
What are you talking about?

584
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:30,702
Euthanasia?

585
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,134
Tell the doctor here something.

586
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:38,289
To kill me.

587
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:03,040
It's not easy to adjust the dosage.

588
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:07,772
Making someone leave without
suffering is harder than I thought.

589
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:11,965
Is this why my brother was
obsessed with that woman?

590
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:17,064
Did he promise the patient euthanasia?

591
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:18,517
I haven't promised anything.

592
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:20,570
So, have you been asked to do it?

593
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:22,486
Yes.

594
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:24,154
That night...

595
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:29,219
I have a wish, Ji-hoon.

596
00:36:30,994 --> 00:36:32,029
I...

597
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,798
I want you to help me with euthanasia.

598
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:38,205
What is she saying?

599
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:41,459
Dr. Choi from the Blessing
of Mary Hospital...

600
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:44,241
they say he was arrested...

601
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:46,575
to perform euthanasia.

602
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,695
So, do you know how to do it?

603
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:50,030
That...

604
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:51,781
I want to die like that.

605
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:57,371
So, please, ask him for that favor.

606
00:36:57,454 --> 00:36:59,511
That's murder, a crime.

607
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:02,910
Think of it as you're helping me.

608
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:05,328
Please, just this once, Ji-hoon.

609
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:06,811
Yes?

610
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:09,365
It's just that it hurts so much.

611
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:12,468
I don't want to live anymore.

612
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,933
If she knew what you were thinking...

613
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:20,504
What about Young-eun?
What will happen to your daughter?

614
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:26,215
- Young-eun...
- For her daughter...

615
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:28,702
Cheer up.

616
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,153
My Young-eun...

617
00:37:31,454 --> 00:37:32,451
is in debt.

618
00:37:33,323 --> 00:37:35,925
She's only thinking of taking
her own life after I die.

619
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,729
I want to go without Young-eun finding out.

620
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,713
So my girl won't feel guilty.

621
00:37:44,797 --> 00:37:46,666
I can't tell her this.

622
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:51,559
I'll tell Young-eun not
to overdo the treatment.

623
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:53,752
Don't think about those things.

624
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,505
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

625
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:04,120
The lady wanted euthanasia.

626
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:06,773
But why didn't she tell me?

627
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:08,824
I wasn't going to help her.

628
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:11,010
And I thought that, being here,

629
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:12,995
she had changed her mind.

630
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:14,296
But...

631
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:18,034
now that she has symptoms of dementia,
she's saying those things again.

632
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:21,470
From now on,
she'll lose her memory quickly.

633
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:26,509
Don't tell me...

634
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,378
Are you saying you'll do it?

635
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,248
Don't worry.

636
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:34,950
I'll never do something like that.

637
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:51,667
Yes?

638
00:38:52,734 --> 00:38:55,637
Why are you looking at me like that?

639
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:58,106
Just...

640
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:00,809
I like looking at Mom's face.

641
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:04,680
I like it so much that I want
to see her as much as I can.

642
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:14,456
Mom.

643
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,360
I'll remember it.

644
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:25,968
I'll remember how much my mom loved me

645
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:30,005
and what a good person she was.

646
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:57,732
Mom really asked you that?

647
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:00,968
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

648
00:40:11,012 --> 00:40:12,547
Couldn't we do it ourselves?

649
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,389
Didn't you think Lee Yun-hee
and Song-i were the same?

650
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,460
I thought so from
the first time I saw them.

651
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,502
If Lee Yun-hee hadn't died
and had raised Songi...

652
00:40:31,665 --> 00:40:33,834
Don't you think they would
be living like that too?

653
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,358
You can't solve all
the suffering in the world.

654
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:41,241
Mother and daughter...

655
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:44,044
They never got to do
what they wanted in life.

656
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:45,879
They only lived to work.

657
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,866
They only paid off debts with
money they never got to enjoy.

658
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,250
The mother got sick...

659
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:52,886
And the daughter only takes care of her.

660
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:58,425
At least let her be comfortable at the end.

661
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:00,994
Shouldn't she go in peace?

662
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:10,336
You've already suffered
a lot because of euthanasia.

663
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,357
So, no way.

664
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,975
I've been thinking a lot lately...

665
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,144
about what I've done...

666
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:20,380
about the weight of...

667
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:24,551
euthanasia.

668
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:27,754
There are definitely patients who need it.

669
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:32,376
I'll look for more treatments
to relieve the pain.

670
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:34,227
Euthanasia isn't always the answer.

671
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:35,428
I know.

672
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,734
But, thinking about
Yeong-eun being left alone...

673
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:43,069
please, think about it a little more.

674
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:48,074
If you let her mother go
while she's in pain...

675
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:51,662
it could be even harder.

676
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:53,287
We can no longer confirm

677
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,915
the patient's will.

678
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:59,670
- So euthanasia is out of the question.
- But the pain is too much...

679
00:41:59,753 --> 00:42:03,674
This hospital is funded by
donations to save lives.

680
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:04,808
So...

681
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:06,626
if you're going to say that,
don't come tomorrow.

682
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,960
QUIET, PLEASE

683
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,018
She's going to the General Hospital today.

684
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:50,470
They'll do blood tests and an MRI.

685
00:42:51,304 --> 00:42:53,106
As much as I want to deny it...

686
00:42:54,974 --> 00:42:57,143
I'll get the diagnosis today.

687
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:05,677
I...

688
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:08,338
I couldn't get the money
for the surgery in time

689
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:10,823
and I missed the opportunity
to operate on her several times.

690
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:13,530
Probably,

691
00:43:13,613 --> 00:43:16,296
if she had received
the right treatment in time...

692
00:43:17,597 --> 00:43:19,532
it would have been different.

693
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,809
You did everything you could.

694
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:24,303
I know that very well.

695
00:43:28,574 --> 00:43:31,277
My mom has only suffered.

696
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:35,147
She's only received pain.

697
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,787
Doctor.

698
00:43:43,649 --> 00:43:44,766
Help her.

699
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:51,797
That's right.

700
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:54,900
Right now,

701
00:43:58,337 --> 00:44:00,706
I'm asking you to help her die.

702
00:44:08,414 --> 00:44:09,460
We...

703
00:44:10,713 --> 00:44:13,269
do not perform that kind of treatment...

704
00:44:13,352 --> 00:44:14,153
and...

705
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:17,006
no patient,
no matter how much they want it,

706
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:18,575
can receive euthanasia anywhere.

707
00:44:19,222 --> 00:44:21,160
can receive euthanasia anywhere.

708
00:44:22,528 --> 00:44:25,030
So, are you saying she has to live in pain?

709
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
I'll look for...

710
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:30,387
more ways...

711
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:32,071
to alleviate her pain.

712
00:44:33,973 --> 00:44:35,141
Doctor.

713
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,778
Please, help my mom.

714
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:42,281
I'm serious.

715
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:45,584
Please, don't ignore my mom.

716
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:49,522
Doctor...

717
00:44:52,658 --> 00:44:54,527
help her.

718
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:02,268
Please, help her.

719
00:45:16,911 --> 00:45:18,284
How have you been?

720
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,788
I'll get straight to the point.

721
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:26,058
Adjusting the proportions
is harder than I thought.

722
00:45:30,129 --> 00:45:31,422
Have you been practicing that?

723
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:33,670
No, pentobarbital

724
00:45:33,754 --> 00:45:35,651
is a drug that allows
you to die without pain.

725
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,970
That's all a lie, a sham.

726
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:43,259
If you don't adjust the proportions
correctly, they die in terrible pain.

727
00:45:43,342 --> 00:45:45,294
Who did you experiment on?

728
00:45:45,377 --> 00:45:48,180
Don't worry, I didn't do it on a person.

729
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:52,518
So work with me.

730
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:56,051
Unlike my brother,
I can do it on a large scale,

731
00:45:56,135 --> 00:45:58,189
correctly and much bigger.

732
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,095
Don't ever show your
face in front of me again

733
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:07,498
because I'll never do what you want.

734
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:13,371
Too bad. I'll do it anyway.

735
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:17,125
If you don't help me, well,
nothing can be done.

736
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,243
The clients will die in pain.

737
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,183
And...

738
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:27,485
this is a gift.

739
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,357
I'll give you a chance.
Think about it again.

740
00:47:01,517 --> 00:47:04,437
I have to go home soon.

741
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,390
Young-eun will be waiting.

742
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,393
I have to go there.

743
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:16,799
I have to go home soon.

744
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,837
My Young-eun gets scared if she's alone.

745
00:48:25,106 --> 00:48:25,567
COMMON ROOM

746
00:48:37,044 --> 00:48:37,962
D.O.A.

747
00:48:38,045 --> 00:48:39,099
<i>DEAD ON ARRIVAL</i>

748
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,082
Dead on arrival.

749
00:49:16,117 --> 00:49:18,369
YONHEE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

750
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:20,671
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

751
00:49:20,754 --> 00:49:21,856
Doctor.

752
00:49:23,124 --> 00:49:25,292
Are you uncomfortable?

753
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:29,530
I don't see my Young-eun.

754
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:33,567
You don't know where she is either, do you?

755
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,873
I'm sorry, I haven't seen her.

756
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:43,460
Sometimes,

757
00:49:43,543 --> 00:49:47,231
my memory fails me.

758
00:49:47,314 --> 00:49:48,149
But...

759
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:52,019
But sometimes,

760
00:49:52,853 --> 00:49:54,033
I dream...

761
00:49:54,453 --> 00:49:57,208
that Young-eun gets hit by a car.

762
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:01,195
It feels so real...

763
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,833
that I wake up startled.

764
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:12,573
My Young-eun is okay, right?

765
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:16,443
She'll be okay.

766
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:21,481
I'm just very anxious because
I don't know where she is.

767
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:23,784
I feel very anxious.

768
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:29,056
Doctor, please, find my Young-eun.

769
00:50:39,466 --> 00:50:40,467
Don't tell me...

770
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:43,837
that it wasn't a dream.

771
00:50:45,038 --> 00:50:45,672
No...

772
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,258
Our Young-eun,

773
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:50,060
was she hit by a car?

774
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:51,144
Is she hurt?

775
00:50:51,845 --> 00:50:53,263
She's suffering, isn't she?

776
00:50:53,346 --> 00:50:54,964
Is she in the hospital now?

777
00:50:55,047 --> 00:50:56,582
Where is she?

778
00:50:57,383 --> 00:50:58,017
Huh?

779
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:01,687
I'm sorry.

780
00:51:05,424 --> 00:51:06,259
My Young-eun...

781
00:51:08,394 --> 00:51:10,496
is she very bad?

782
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,797
Huh?

783
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,167
What...?

784
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:17,120
What...?

785
00:51:17,203 --> 00:51:18,888
What am I going to do, my daughter?

786
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:20,223
Where is she?

787
00:51:20,306 --> 00:51:21,140
No...

788
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:23,293
No, my child...

789
00:51:23,376 --> 00:51:24,544
Where is my child?

790
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:27,697
What am I going to do? Poor thing.

791
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,166
What am I going to do, my daughter?

792
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:32,402
Oh, how...?

793
00:51:32,485 --> 00:51:33,452
Let go of me.

794
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:37,874
I, I want to leave too.

795
00:51:37,957 --> 00:51:41,244
Let me go too. Let me go with my daughter.

796
00:51:41,327 --> 00:51:43,913
Why have I lived until now?

797
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:47,083
I've lived to see her face one more time.

798
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:48,451
I can't live.

799
00:51:48,534 --> 00:51:50,503
Please, let me go. I just...

800
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,257
Let me go with my daughter.

801
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,210
Let me go with my daughter. I can't live.

802
00:52:02,147 --> 00:52:04,482
Yesterday,
when she briefly regained her memory...

803
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:09,087
she realized that Young-eun
had passed away.

804
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,290
And even though she immediately
lost her memory again...

805
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:16,995
she said she didn't want to keep
living without her daughter...

806
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,199
and asked me to help her die.

807
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:24,302
Young-eun also made the same request of me.

808
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:27,422
At the time,

809
00:52:27,505 --> 00:52:29,674
I just thought it was
a momentary feeling...

810
00:52:31,843 --> 00:52:33,144
but it seems that wasn't the case.

811
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:35,713
I beg you...

812
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:38,215
for my mom.

813
00:52:41,885 --> 00:52:42,886
Talk...

814
00:52:43,887 --> 00:52:46,223
to that doctor...

815
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:48,359
and make it so my mom...

816
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:52,162
can pass away peacefully.

817
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:53,664
Do it.

818
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,734
Because of my selfishness,

819
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:03,006
my mom has been suffering and only
receiving ineffective treatments.

820
00:53:04,174 --> 00:53:06,109
Now she doesn't know anything anymore...

821
00:53:08,178 --> 00:53:10,947
and she'll forget all her memories.

822
00:53:14,017 --> 00:53:17,454
I can't let her die suffering.

823
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:19,789
Young-eun.

824
00:53:20,757 --> 00:53:21,825
I beg you.

825
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:24,833
Help my mom.

826
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:27,264
Please, help her.

827
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:44,660
Until now, for whatever reason...

828
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:49,286
I thought that giving up one's life
willingly shouldn't be allowed...

829
00:53:51,655 --> 00:53:53,023
but now I'm not so sure anymore.

830
00:53:54,924 --> 00:53:55,717
I just...

831
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,228
wish that Auntie...

832
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:01,064
could feel more comfortable.

833
00:54:11,741 --> 00:54:13,410
I'll be back after work.

834
00:54:14,344 --> 00:54:16,246
Let's talk face to face later.

835
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,386
It seems like she's going
through a very difficult time.

836
00:55:00,122 --> 00:55:01,957
That old woman is really unfortunate.

837
00:55:02,691 --> 00:55:05,827
It seems she has dementia.
Doesn't she know her own daughter died?

838
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,332
- Who are you?
- Me?

839
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,368
I'm my brother's sister.

840
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,338
Gu Gwang-chul.

841
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,241
You know him well, right?

842
00:55:22,577 --> 00:55:25,304
Work with me again, okay?

843
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,067
I want to see your skills before that,
so I'll make you a proposal.

844
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,403
No, I don't accept any proposals.

845
00:55:31,486 --> 00:55:32,420
You know...

846
00:55:34,522 --> 00:55:36,557
Kill my husband, please.

847
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:44,783
Is your husband very sick?

848
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:47,219
No, he's too healthy. That's the problem.

849
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,837
He has so much energy that he
goes around doing useless things.

850
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,119
<i>Didn't you think Lee Yun-hee
and Song-i looked alike?</i>

851
00:56:05,986 --> 00:56:07,638
Kill me.

852
00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:08,839
<i>The mother got sick.</i>

853
00:56:08,922 --> 00:56:10,107
My mom...

854
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,424
has only suffered.

855
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:13,810
<i>The daughter only dedicates
herself to taking care of her.</i>

856
00:56:13,893 --> 00:56:15,362
She's only received pain.

857
00:56:16,563 --> 00:56:18,932
<i>Please, don't ignore my mom.</i>

858
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:22,152
Please, help her.

859
00:56:22,235 --> 00:56:23,036
<i>I...</i>

860
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,038
Can't I say...

861
00:56:26,306 --> 00:56:27,374
how I want...

862
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:30,861
my end to be?

863
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:32,545
<i>At least let her be
comfortable at the end...</i>

864
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,598
<i>Shouldn't she go in peace?</i>

865
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:35,899
<i>I just wish Auntie...</i>

866
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,784
would feel more comfortable.

867
00:56:38,385 --> 00:56:39,586
At the end...

868
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:42,022
if everything goes well...

869
00:56:42,856 --> 00:56:44,591
so I can go in peace...

870
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:47,190
<i>that kind of medicine...</i>

871
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,195
<i>isn't that what's most needed?</i>

872
00:56:51,998 --> 00:56:54,017
<i>Let me go with my daughter.</i>

873
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,386
<i>Why have I lived until now?</i>

874
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:59,789
<i>I've lived to see her face one more time.</i>

875
00:56:59,872 --> 00:57:01,124
<i>I can't live.</i>

876
00:57:01,207 --> 00:57:02,110
<i>Please, let me go.</i>

877
00:57:02,194 --> 00:57:03,041
<i>I just...</i>

878
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:08,247
<i>Euthanasia.</i>

879
00:57:09,716 --> 00:57:11,651
<i>There are definitely patients who need it.</i>

880
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:41,130
So, killing a healthy person...?

881
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:42,982
Are you asking me
to kill you with euthanasia?

882
00:57:43,683 --> 00:57:44,717
Can't you?

883
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,688
Have you never killed a healthy person?

884
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:14,078
TREATMENT ROOM

885
00:58:26,824 --> 00:58:27,858
Dr. Woo So-jeong.

886
00:58:42,906 --> 00:58:43,974
Help me.

887
00:59:06,283 --> 00:59:16,243
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR WATCHING 'MARY KILLS PEOPLE'
