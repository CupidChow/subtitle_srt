00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:28,832
Thanks for taking good care of Su-yeong at the end.

9
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:31,201
It was the natural thing to do.

10
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:35,305
Are you sure nothing happened
with Representative Gu back then?

11
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,378
I messed everything up.

12
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:46,716
I trusted that man too much.

13
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:49,252
Forget it.

14
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:51,521
All that matters is that
you came back safely.

15
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:58,929
Take it off.

16
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:02,532
If we're going to do business,

17
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,935
shouldn't we build some trust with each other?

18
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,203
Don't you think?

19
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,208
Just the top. You can leave the bra.

20
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,389
Nevermind if you don't want to.

21
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:27,624
Bang!

22
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,565
It won't be a blank this time.

23
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,104
You said you needed Benpo.

24
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:43,273
Are you just going to leave?

25
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:45,275
Take it off.

26
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:49,840
What's this?

27
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,475
You're clean.

28
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,279
You really don't do drugs?

29
00:02:58,248 --> 00:02:59,716
Are you satisfied now?

30
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:03,386
Would I be?

31
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,065
A souvenir photo.

32
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:18,969
Kimchi.

33
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:39,222
What kind of bullshit are the two of
you are pulling with my merchandise?

34
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:42,192
I'll give you a chance to
explain it all to me later.

35
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:43,760
Look forward to it.

00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:11,163

38
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,707
Are you sure?

39
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,448
You have some too, Hyun-woo.

40
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,951
Let's do it after you've calmed down a bit.

41
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:15,452
What you're doing right now...

42
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,654
Stop it.

43
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:19,022
It's insane.

44
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:21,591
How did you end up like this?

45
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,027
Is it okay to achieve your goal
even if it means deceiving others?

46
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,999
Confess honestly and stop now.

47
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:34,504
I didn't know counseling sick people
would be a crime.

48
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:37,507
What you're doing is murder.

49
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:39,343
How long do you think
you can keep running away?

50
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,511
As long as people like you are chasing me.

51
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:47,384
I'm going to catch you, no matter what.

52
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,387
You'll never catch me.

53
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,322
Because I'm not guilty.

54
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:00,664
This patient came because they
were dissatisfied with their treatment.

55
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,199
Their complaint is a bit rough.

56
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:04,401
Please take care of it quickly.

57
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:05,468
Yes.

58
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:07,704
Stop it.

59
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:12,542
Let go.

60
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,245
Let go, dammit!

61
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,685
Hey, mister!

62
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:26,256
Goodness. This guy never changes.

63
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:31,127
Jo Su-yeong, hey.

64
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:34,364
Did you arrived safely?

65
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:35,532
Did you meet your grandma?

66
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,668
I really missed you, you know.

67
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,672
Why did you drink so much?

68
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,808
I missed you and all, so
I had a little too much.

69
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,209
Don't make excuses.

70
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:48,678
What excuse?

71
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:53,383
I just really, really missed...

72
00:06:58,188 --> 00:06:59,723
Su-yeong.

73
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,692
Where's Hye-jeong?

74
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,369
Get up. We've got a job.

75
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,094
What the hell!

76
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,502
The Benponarbital supplier, Kim Si-hyun.

77
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:15,706
My man Do-gun caught him
yesterday in Incheon trying to smuggle himself out.

78
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:18,342
He also had a passport
in Kim Si-hyun's name.

79
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:21,411
He could be an impersonator, right?
Pretend he's a big shot over there.

80
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,213
Did you check the fingerprints?

81
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,516
No, sir. It's impossible to
identify him by fingerprints.

82
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:29,719
He completely destroyed his
fingerprints to hide his identity.

83
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:31,655
But even just by looking,

84
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:33,824
his age and appearance are similar,

85
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:37,761
and just like Kim Si-hyun, he has a
Virgin Mary tattoo on his right arm.

86
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:40,263
And the amount of drugs
he was trying to take out is enormous.

87
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:42,499
Then it's him, right?

88
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,935
The Special Investigation Unit must have taken him then.

89
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,470
Damn it.

90
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,772
They should give us
some time to interrogate him too.

91
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:52,676
That's how we'd find the link
between Choi Dae-hyun and Woo So-jeong.

92
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:55,946
That man is not Kim Si-hyun.

93
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,081
- What?
- Why? What did you see?

94
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:59,349
We haven't even examined him yet.

95
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,229
Due to his drug addiction, Kim Si-hyun is missing
all his front teeth, both incisors and canines.

96
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:05,356
But that man tried to
bite his tongue to harm himself.

97
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:02,636
{\an8}[Incisor: The front teeth.]

98
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,931
{\an8}[Premolar: The teeth located between
the canines and molars.]

99
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,398
Well...

100
00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:09,960
He has a lot of money.
He probably has dentures.

101
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,195
Then his dentures would have
fallen out when he was gagged.

102
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,931
No, that's not him.

103
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:18,401
We worked hard to prepared this.
Where are you going?

104
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:27,444
I didn't know
Mr. Cho Hyun-woo was a police officer.

105
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:28,779
The medical records were so convincing.

106
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,114
Because those records belong to the patient Cho Hyun-woo himself.

107
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,885
He contacted me, mentioning Baek Hyun-seung's name.

108
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,152
Said he was referred.

109
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,388
The assemblyman's son?

110
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,893
So he was the connection.

111
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:51,101
That means they've definitely figured out I'm involved.

112
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,442
If the police start an investigation,

113
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,977
just say you were counseling them.

114
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:00,944
To prepare for this moment,

115
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:03,647
we've had speech training and obtained certifications.

116
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,217
The police are very close.

117
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,753
Shred all documents.

118
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,222
For now, we will suspend our activities.

119
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:13,256
And...

120
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:16,626
go volunteer at that hospital
I mentioned before.

121
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:17,661
Okay.

122
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:42,085
Start a raid on Bunsung Hospital.

123
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,889
We still haven't found evidence
related to player Choi Kang-yoon.

124
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,925
Get a search and seizure warrant for a separate case!

125
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:55,632
The case of the construction company CEO who was in trouble
last month for his Propofol dosage.

126
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:58,769
The one where the Bunsung Hospital doctor
said he lost the records.

127
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,971
Go in for a medical law violation.

128
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:04,407
For illegal drug administration.

129
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,513
Evidence on Choi Kang-yoon?

130
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,615
Get in there and find it.

131
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:15,051
You morons.

132
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:37,340
Do-gun.

133
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:40,243
If you're that sleepy,
go get some rest in the duty room.

134
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:43,847
No matter how tired I am,
I can't take naps during the day.

135
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:47,784
Even at night, if I'm in a different bed,
I just can't sleep.

136
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:50,754
You're as sensitive as you look.

137
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:54,624
The media is still blabbering on
as if he's Kim Si-hyun.

138
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,797
The police have urgently arrested
a man in his 40s, Kim Si-hyun,

139
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:05,035
known as one of the three major drug lords
of Southeast Asia, at Incheon Port.

140
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:08,238
After securing a drug production facility
in Cambodia

141
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:10,173
and seizing control of the domestic distribution network,

142
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:12,742
Mr. Kim rapidly grew to become the godfather of the drug world.

143
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:15,412
The police stated that Mr. Kim used
various aliases

144
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:18,815
and frequently changed his residence
in Korea,

145
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,917
which had hindered the investigation until now.

146
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:24,054
However, after obtaining crucial information
that Mr. Kim was preparing

147
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:27,024
to flee abroad, they...
to China from Incheon Port...

148
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:29,359
He's sleeping soundly.

149
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,366
Cut him some slack. He hasn't slept in three days.

150
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:41,705
- I told him to lie down and sleep.
- Let's step out for a moment.

151
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,348
How did a big shot like Kim Si-hyun

152
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:54,284
keep dealing with a doctor
like Choi Dae-hyun,

153
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,153
even if they were cellmates?

154
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:59,523
Well, since Kim Si-hyun was in and out of
prison often for drugs,

155
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,258
he had no family visiting,

156
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:03,393
and no one to put money in his commissary account.

157
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,362
But at that time, Choi Dae-hyun

158
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:07,230
treated him well.

159
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:10,500
Being the son of a rich family, he was generous
with those around him, spending and giving freely.

160
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:12,202
He earned his goodwill.

161
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:16,106
Even after his release,
he received a lot

162
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,908
of financial help from Choi Dae-hyun.

163
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,744
After Kim Si-hyun became a drug dealer,

164
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,979
he repaid that debt.

165
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:25,916
Thinking he needed it for recreational use,
he supplied him with some drugs.

166
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,484
Choi Dae-hyun probably

167
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:29,987
didn't know until now that Kim Si-hyun had become
such a big-time drug dealer.

168
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,321
He wouldn't have dealt with him if he knew.

169
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:32,956
It would make him easier to trace.

170
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,337
The suspect from before,

171
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,039
he was collecting drugs to flee,

172
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,508
and got caught because a large
amount of drugs was moving, right?

173
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,044
He impersonated him to collect them.

174
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:56,813
Then if we look up the list of
people who bought Benpo,

175
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:59,182
don't you think we can find Kim Si-hyun's whereabouts?

176
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,284
Hey, they didn't even buy it
from the real Kim Si-hyun.

177
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:02,352
What can we do?

178
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:05,121
Benpo isn't a drug
that many people look for.

179
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:06,756
Among the buyers,

180
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,492
I'm sure there's someone who dealt
with Kim Si-hyun before.

181
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:12,496
Then, if we just investigate
the droppers well,

182
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,264
won't we find other purchase locations?

183
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:21,338
Yes.

184
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,074
We're on our way.

185
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,176
Let's go to Bunsung Hospital.

186
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,144
The search warrant is out.

187
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:32,349
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

188
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:33,950
Gently, gently, ow, that stings.

189
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,299
- Alright, quiet!
- What's going on?

190
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,368
How can you just barge into
the ER like this?

191
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:52,569
We're from the regional investigation unit.

192
00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:55,906
We're conducting a search and seizure for
violation of the narcotics control act.

193
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,042
If you resist, you can be arrested
for obstruction of justice.

194
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:00,444
Proceed.

195
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:02,379
How can you just
come in here like this?

196
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,314
Let's proceed after our hospital
calls a lawyer.

197
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:06,583
Yes, call one.

198
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,385
- Make the call.
- Yes.

199
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,188
We are treating patients here.

200
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,991
Please proceed carefully
so as not to interfere with treatment.

201
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,859
Yes, let's start.

202
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,941
Since that detective
let me get away right in front of him,

203
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,210
he's going to come after us
openly now.

204
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,212
We'll suspend our work for a while.

205
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:37,247
If you have any drugs that could be a problem,
get rid of them.

206
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:39,015
Okay, I got it.

207
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,152
But is it okay for us
to be together like this?

208
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:45,489
It's an undeniable fact
that we met frequently.

209
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,891
We were careful, but evidence might still come out.

210
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,827
We need to create a reason
for meeting so often.

211
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,062
Let's just date.

212
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,965
I mean, let's pretend
we're dating, okay?

213
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:57,868
We're so in love, missed each other so much,
that we were often together. Okay?

214
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,436
Leaves no room for doubt.

215
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:03,840
We...

216
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:08,278
met again while we were each
volunteering at Father Yang's hospital.

217
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:11,281
We are able to have him
as a resident doctor.

218
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:12,916
Dr. Choi Dae-hyun.

219
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,354
Doctor, do you have
a baptismal name?

220
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:19,022
Oh, he's not a believer.

221
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:21,191
Then what's your specialty?

222
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:24,261
Emergency medicine or internal medicine would be better for us.

223
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,664
Plastic surgery.

224
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:33,203
And I... I currently don't have a license.

225
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:37,841
If you're unlicensed,
it's a bit much to call you a resident doctor.

226
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:41,178
Won't that become a problem later?

227
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:43,347
No, no, it won't be a problem.

228
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:47,284
He's not a resident doctor,
but a resident 'teacher'.

229
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:52,089
Yes, he'll reside at the hospital and
look after the patients here and there.

230
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,493
So, he's a resident volunteer
who was a former doctor.

231
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,128
There. No problem, right?

232
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:03,233
I may not have a license,
but I'm excellent with patients.

233
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,837
Still, for him to be wearing
a lab coat like that,

234
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:09,206
it's a bit much to just call him
a volunteer.

235
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,376
Oh, that's a good point.

236
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,411
Let's take off the coat. Yes, take it off.

237
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:17,547
I was just wearing this briefly
because I was chilly.

238
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:21,151
Anyway, let's give another
round of applause to welcome him.

239
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,087
From now on, it'll be hard
for us to contact each other.

240
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,856
If there's any news we need to share,

241
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:28,425
let's do it while volunteering
at the priest's hospital.

242
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,934
There, all done.

243
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:40,437
Is there anything else bothering you?

244
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:42,939
My goodness...
my shoulders, my arms, everything hurts.

245
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,341
Shoulders, yes.

246
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,943
Is this side a bit stiff?

247
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:50,847
It hurts, you punk!

248
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,749
It hurts me too.

249
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:53,684
It hurts.

250
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:55,085
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

251
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:57,554
And you'll see one more person
at the hospital.

252
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:00,490
The nurse who connected us
with patients, Choi Ye-na.

253
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:04,161
If any evidence of drug transactions comes up,

254
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,397
we say we violated the narcotics control act
for the sake of the patients.

255
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,032
We have to deny the euthanasia.

256
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,235
Hmph.

257
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:22,145
Yu-jeong just fell asleep.

258
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,749
- Honey.
- Yes?

259
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:30,087
No matter what others say,

260
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:32,355
I really like you because you're cute.

261
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,292
Right.

262
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,527
They say there's no escape from cuteness.

263
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:40,597
But your cuteness should be for my eyes only.

264
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,333
Okay.

265
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:48,438
Who are you so busy meeting these days?

266
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,977
Who else would it be?

267
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:57,180
They're all my friends.

268
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:04,454
Try to see my brother more often.

269
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,991
It's a family business, after all,
and he's struggling so much on his own.

270
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:10,661
You have to do your part, don't you think?

271
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:11,895
You're right.

272
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,064
But...

273
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,235
when he's assembling a gun,
he points it at me and stuff,

274
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:20,037
so it's a little hard for me to approach him.

275
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:23,373
He may point it, but he doesn't shoot, does he?

276
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:25,542
That's never happened.

277
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:28,378
Think of it as a sign of affection.

278
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:31,448
If he shoots, well...

279
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:32,782
it's a gun.

280
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:40,090
Stop playing with your friends
and hang out with my brother more often.

281
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:42,125
You'll do that, won't you?

282
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,628
Yes.

But the patient is refusing

290
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,862
I already got the insulin shot.

291
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:15,759
I'll pay for that.

292
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:19,095
Don't waste time with other things
and let me go.

293
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,700
Ma'am,

294
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:26,036
you came in with a decreased level of consciousness.

295
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,904
The cause might not be your diabetes.

296
00:19:27,904 --> 00:19:29,472
You need to get more tests.

297
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:31,141
I don't have money.

298
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:34,344
You're not going to
do the tests for free, are you?

299
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:37,581
In your current state, it wouldn't be strange if you
collapsed again as soon as you leave the hospital.

300
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:38,615
I...

301
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,884
I have terminal stomach cancer.

302
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:43,920
Even with treatment, I'm going to die anyway.

303
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,522
I know it, and you know it.

304
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:50,126
So why should I have to
waste my money?

305
00:19:58,835 --> 00:20:01,505
I already got the insulin,

306
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:04,241
so I'll pay for that.

307
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:11,014
The tests don't cost as much as you think.

308
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:13,416
The money you have now
is more than enough.

309
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:15,919
This money...

310
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,588
is all I have.

311
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,261
I want to least leave this money
to my child.

312
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:29,633
I'm dying anyway, and there's no cure.

313
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:33,803

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,215

Ms. Lee Eun-hee.

Next time you're not feeling well,
try going here.

It's a hospital run by a priest, so it's free.

320

They can't provide extensive treatment,

321
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:42,405
but it will be helpful in an emergency.

322
00:21:46,576 --> 00:21:48,445

for your child to see that too.

Just enduring it isn't the only answer.

325

For your child's sake,

326
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:59,523
at least go here before you
collapse from shock.

327
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,426

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,708
does it lessen your guilt?

It doesn't matter, does it?

334
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,749
Since you already think of me as someone
who doesn't even feel guilt.

Okay.

336
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:24,107
Did the Benpo for Dr. Choi come in?

337
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:27,878
You've made him suffer enough.

338
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:30,313
It's not much, just give it back to him.

339
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,618
He said he'd pay whatever I ask.

Isn't the idiot the one who won't sell?

341
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,091
Just give it to him.

was that he had no opinions of his own.

I called again and told him
not to take the police's merchandise,

346

and also not to give Benpo to Dr. Choi.

348
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:03,280
Has he been possessed by me?

349
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,682
Or is he doing some method acting?

350
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,653
Or is he really under the delusion
that this business is his?

351
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:11,621
What should I do?

352
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,064
Thanks for your hard work.

353
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:23,833
Understood.

354
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:35,912
The investigation results for the
Kim Si-hyun impersonator are out.

355
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,386
They investigated all the places
where the drugs were purchased,

356
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:44,421
and they said they've arrested
everyone involved.

357
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:45,455
The drugs?

358
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,457
Did they confirm where he got the Benponarbital?

359
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:49,459
They've confirmed almost everything,

360
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:52,762
but there's no connection
with the real Kim Si-hyun.

361
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,499
It seems all he did was impersonate
him to gather a large amount of drugs.

362
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:00,837
Besides the officially confirmed information,

363
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,873
are there any places that were disregarded from testimonies?

364
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,442
Like a place that was excluded because
the evidence wasn't solid?

365
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:08,311
- There is one thing.
- What is it?

366
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:12,816
This one dropper testified
that the drugs came from there,

367
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:14,751
but there's a place we couldn't look into.

368
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:17,521
The most expensive penthouse in Gangnam.

369
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:23,694
There was reliable testimony from
a long-time dropper,

370
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:25,595
but they said no because of residents' privacy.

371
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:28,098
They told us to bring a warrant
if we wanted to search.

372
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,534
So we couldn't even secure the
security cameras.

373
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:33,537
It would be a headache if nothing
turned up, so we just let it go.

374
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:35,372
We already had the suspect, after all.

375
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:42,179
You put in some effort.

376
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,780
You look pretty.

377
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,940
Thank you.

378
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,285
Thank you.

379
00:25:48,785 --> 00:25:50,654
I know you're busy, how did you find time to come?

380
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:52,656
I came during my lunch break.

381
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,925
One more person will be coming.

382
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,793
- Okay, I understand.
- Yes.

383
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:59,763
- One more is coming?
- Yes.

384
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,065
Oh, speak of the devil, there she is.

385
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:05,969
Over here.

386
00:26:06,236 --> 00:26:07,571
Hello.

387
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:09,339
I asked Jae-yeon's aunt to come too.

388
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:10,974
Jae-yeon is a school officer.

389
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:13,376
It would be strange if a parent didn't come
to the steering committee meeting.

390
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,588
Who ordered the Jajangmyeon?!

391
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:26,957
Police...

392
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:28,491
Hey!

393
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:34,231
Does being a cop mean you can do anything?

394
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:35,932
Why are you riding my motorcycle?

395
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:39,002
You should have let him ride with you, you little punk.

396
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,804
Hey.

397
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:42,606
Why did you quit being a dropper?

398
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:45,842
I told you, I quit because I was burned out.

399
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:47,344
Burned out, my ass.

400
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:49,679
You little bastard.
Make it make sense, will you?

401
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:52,015
You make a hundred grand a month
delivering drugs as a dropper

402
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:54,217
and suddenly you sling on a case and deliver Chinese food?

403
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:55,786
Why'd you get kicked out?

404
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:57,821
Kicked out? Who got kicked out?

405
00:26:57,821 --> 00:26:59,028
Hands out of your pocket.

406
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,426
I left on my own.

407
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:06,229
They keep catching all the droppers.

408
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:07,898
How could I stick around, not knowing what would happen?

409
00:27:07,898 --> 00:27:09,032
Your assigned area...

410
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:11,968
it included that penthouse, right?

411
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,438
Something happened there, didn't it?

412
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,775
Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

413
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:21,244
It was just a rumor.
Now go away, go away.

414
00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:23,547
- I have a delivery...
- You little punk.

415
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,892
There was this dropper
who'd worked for a long time.

416
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:38,929
He just said one thing, that he'd gone to
that penthouse, and...

417
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:40,697
only he got arrested.

418
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:45,068
So who would want to get involved again?
They're just catching all the droppers.

419
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:46,102
So...

420
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,271
you have been there?

421
00:27:58,215 --> 00:28:00,317
Is U-mi doing a little better?

422
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:02,519
Seeing her collapse at the
performance venue that day,

423
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,021
I was so shocked.

424
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:07,924
She's been eating well and is better now.

425
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:10,994
Jae-yeon's aunt,

426
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:13,830
I heard you treated U-mi
in the emergency room.

427
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:16,700
What exactly was her condition?

428
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:20,837
You all know, right?
The problem was her extreme diet.

429
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:23,340
- Did you run all the tests?
- No.

430
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,811
There was no need for tests.

431
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:31,281
I think you're suspecting she might
have taken something she shouldn't have.

432
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:32,983
If someone takes drugs,

433
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:36,286
their pupils will always
dilate or constrict abnormally.

434
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:38,322
U-mi had no such symptoms,

435
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:40,790
and she recovered right after arriving at the ER.

436
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,927
Rather than wasting energy on tests,

437
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:47,197
I thought it would be better to feed her well quickly,
so I sent her home.

438
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:51,001
She was practically malnourished
from dieting.

439
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:54,771
My goodness, malnourished in this day and age.

440
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:56,439
I know.

441
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,909
I had no idea she was even skipping her school lunches.

442
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,127
If they're making a hundred grand,

443
00:29:17,127 --> 00:29:20,130
what kind of fulfillment are people like us supposed to feel?

444
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,832
We clean so diligently.

445
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:23,233
I don't think I even make 4,000 a month.

446
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:24,267
Excuse me.

447
00:29:25,302 --> 00:29:27,371
Hey, Ji-hoon, what's wrong?

448
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,505
What?

449
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:31,141
Which unit were you just at?

450
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:33,176
I said, which unit were you at?

451
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:35,378
Hey, hey, hey!

452
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:36,947
Hey, stop the car!

453
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:39,416
- Drag him out!
- Stop the car!

454
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,917
Stop the car, dammit!

455
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,761
What's wrong? Ji-hoon!

456
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:55,732
What is it?

457
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:57,601
Are you okay, man?

458
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:01,438
It seems like someone left here
in a hurry today.

459
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,176
Damn it.

460
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,292
The police are closing in,

461
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:24,361
so we've decided to change residences.

462
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:28,265
Aren't we moving too hastily?

463
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,503
How can there be a livable place around here?!

464
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:35,906
You'll see when you go inside.

465
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:02,199
Ah, yes.

466
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,601
My goodness, this is expensive.

467
00:31:05,235 --> 00:31:06,803
Yes, yes, thank you.

468
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:10,574
Thank you. Wow,
to think I'd get to drink such fine liquor.

469
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:14,411
Ever since I came, we've been so busy,
we haven't even had a team dinner.

470
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:17,814
I brought a mature friend with me.

471
00:31:17,814 --> 00:31:20,016
Oh, thank you.

472
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,586
I'm grateful enough for your volunteer work.

473
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,655
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes.

474
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:35,765
It is a blessing.

475
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,503
Yes, I will

476
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:41,905
treasure this and enjoy it for a long time.

477
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:44,107
Oh, Father, you don't have to treasure it.

478
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,810
- I'll supply you with it often.
- No, no.

479
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,413
Actually, I have to leave early tomorrow morning.

480
00:31:51,181 --> 00:31:53,517
How can you refuse such a blessing?

481
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:55,185
Where... where are you going?

482
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:57,587
I...

483
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:00,824
When I used to work at the orphanage,

484
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:02,659
there was a child I looked after.

485
00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:06,897
He was a young man who came here to
volunteer until just a little while ago.

486
00:32:07,464 --> 00:32:09,165
This young man suddenly...

487
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,234
passed away.

488
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,271
So tomorrow,

489
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:16,873
I'm going to go see him.

490
00:32:18,175 --> 00:32:20,410
Oh, could it be Mr. Cho Hyun-woo?

491
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:27,117
How do you know Hyun-woo, Dr. Choi?

492
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:29,853
Ah, So-jeong...
I mean, because of Dr. Woo.

493
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:31,388
I've seen him a few times.

494
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:33,423
Ah, yes.

495
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:36,726
What was that?

496
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:41,264
Mom.

497
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:44,334
Mom, Mom.

498
00:32:45,435 --> 00:32:48,372
Exuse me, hello. What's wrong?

499
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:50,240
- Sir.
- Yes.

500
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,609
Please save my mom.

501
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:55,245
- Is this your mom?
- Yes.

502
00:32:56,446 --> 00:32:58,081
She's a patient Dr. Woo sent.

503
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:01,385
Okay. Don't worry about your mom.
She'll be okay.

504
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:02,552
It's okay.

505
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,388
- I'll go get a nun.
- Okay.

506
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,925
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Are you okay?

507
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,000
- Hello.
- Doctor.

508
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,971
A patient named Kim Jae-hoon
came in a little while ago.

509
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:25,175
But I think we need to contact
the police first.

510
00:33:25,976 --> 00:33:27,978
- Why the police?
- He's a gunshot patient.

511
00:33:35,285 --> 00:33:37,988
It hurts.

512
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:40,657
It hurts.

513
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:43,393
It hurts.

514
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:46,430
My heart hurts.

515
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,299
- My heart hurts so much.
- I panicked watching the news.

516
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:52,068
I thought Mr. Kim, our drug supplier,
had been arrested.

517
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:54,171
Even with the mosaic, he looked so similar.

518
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,405
Even the Maria tattoo was the same.

519
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:58,141
What do I do? My heart hurts.

520
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,578
My heart hurts so much.

521
00:34:01,912 --> 00:34:04,948
My heart hurts.

522
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,457
There's nothing wrong with your heart.

523
00:34:14,925 --> 00:34:17,060
You're feeling that way because of
the shock from the accident.

524
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,228
Take deep breaths.

525
00:34:18,228 --> 00:34:20,263
We need to check for bone damage,
so call for a portable X-ray.

526
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:22,603
{\an8}[Portable X-ray: A mobile imaging unit used
for patients who are too ill to be moved.]

527
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:21,240
Yes, understood.

528
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:22,999
And administer 5mg of painkiller, and get labs.

529
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:27,639
{\an8}[Laboratory (Lab): Where medical tests are performed on patient samples to diagnose and monitor illness.]

530
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,634
Yes.

531
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:36,446
We're from the Bunsung Police Station.

532
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:56,629
Now that mom's had her shot,
she'll be okay.

533
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:01,071
- Is your name Song-yi?
- Yes.

534
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:05,542
- That's a very pretty name.
- Thank you.

535
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:41,945
We're here.

536
00:35:43,047 --> 00:35:45,349
Here.

537
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,284
There we go.

538
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:55,692
That's my mom's handcart.

539
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:57,828
This is your mom's?

540
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:59,329
Yes.

541
00:36:17,615 --> 00:36:19,650
Here, I'll help you.

542
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,684
Okay.

543
00:36:21,018 --> 00:36:23,487
Wow, what should we do first?

544
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:24,855
Okay.

545
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,102
Okay.

546
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,511
I'll push.

547
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:49,713
Where does this go?

548
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:52,416
We go to the building's parking lot.

549
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:56,420
If you pay 50,000 won a month,
the man there will look after it.

550
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,754
Oh, really?

551
00:36:58,555 --> 00:36:59,590
Let's go.

552
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,455
I know you're on duty, but please step aside.

553
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:32,856
That patient has a gunshot wound.

554
00:37:32,856 --> 00:37:35,326
He can't run away in that condition, so please back off.

555
00:37:35,326 --> 00:37:37,361
He needs to be questioned.
When can we take him?

556
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:38,829
I don't know yet.

557
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:40,631
I need to examine him, so please step out.

558
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,301
Come with me.

559
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:49,591
[Patient Name: Kim Jae-hoon]

560
00:37:47,703 --> 00:37:49,791
{\an8}[Patient underwent Open Reduction and Internal
Fixation (ORIF) surgery for an arm fracture.]

561
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,416
I'm asking you again.

562
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:01,418
What's your name?

563
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:06,123
I told you, it's Kim Jae-hoon.

564
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:09,760
The patient named Kim Jae-hoon had major
surgery for a right arm fracture from a car accident.

565
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,663
It's illegal to receive medical treatment
under someone else's identity.

566
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:14,298
The police will find out soon enough.

567
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:17,701
It's only a matter of time before
they find out who you are.

568
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:19,903
Who are you?

569
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:22,606
Hey.

570
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,876
- Just do more tests.
- We've already done them all.

571
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:29,146
There are no remaining bullet fragments
or bone damage.

572
00:38:30,414 --> 00:38:33,317
If I get taken by the police now, I'm dead.

573
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:35,953
I need to stay here longer.

574
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:40,003
It's a through-and-through wound in your side,

575
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:42,826
but you can be discharged tomorrow.

576
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,865
Sir, you're getting a shot.

577
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:49,433
Lie on your side.

578
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:50,334
Does that hurt?

579
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,303
Yes, but not as much as a bullet.

580
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:55,039
Don't be a baby.

581
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,840
Okay, lowering your pants.

582
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:03,447
This will prevent shock from the pain.

583
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:15,959
For a pro,

584
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:19,563
failure is bullshit.

585
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:22,132
Don't give me that bullshit!

586
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:27,571
- Stop your bullshit.
- Dammit.

587
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:29,506
And stop whining.

588
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:30,541
What are you doing?

589
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,628
- Dr. Woo.
- Yes?

590
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:52,729
Someone says they're your friend.
It's urgent.

591
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,465
- A friend?
- Yes.

592
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:57,067
- Hello?
- Woo So-jeong?

593
00:39:58,302 --> 00:40:00,237
- Who is this?
- Who do you think?

594
00:40:00,704 --> 00:40:02,106
Benponarbital.

595
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:05,909
Remember now?

596
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:11,415
How did you know to call here?

597
00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:13,550
You have Kim Si-hyun there, don't you?

598
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:18,255
That gunshot patient, he's Kim Si-hyun.

599
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,291
Did you do that to him?

600
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:23,260
On purpose, to send him to me?

601
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,595
Not on purpose,

602
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:26,830
but it happened at a place I introduced him to,

603
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,066
so I guess you could say it's my fault.

604
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:34,538
But the fact that he didn't die and
made it there has become a headache.

605
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:37,307
This is a hospital.

606
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:40,611
The police will soon figure out
he's Kim Si-hyun.

607
00:40:40,911 --> 00:40:41,945
Right.

608
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:45,582
The police have already
raided Kim Si-hyun's place.

609
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:48,719
What you two have been doing with
Kim Si-hyun's merchandise...

610
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:51,321
that weird stuff you've been up to...

611
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,657
they know all about it.

612
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:57,961
Anyway, treat him just enough
to buy some time.

613
00:40:58,128 --> 00:41:00,230
I need to do some thinking, too.

614
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:05,335
You need to get him out of there, somehow.

615
00:41:06,704 --> 00:41:09,907
If I get caught, I'll rat you out
to the police.

616
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:12,076
Wow, are you threatening me now?

617
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:14,311
You really don't seem to grasp the situation.

618
00:41:15,112 --> 00:41:16,513
If you don't grasp the situation,

619
00:41:16,513 --> 00:41:19,350
take another look at the state
Kim Si-hyun is in over there.

620
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,451
And...

621
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:23,387
don't mess with me, Woo So-jeong.

622
00:41:26,323 --> 00:41:27,858
Do as I say.

623
00:41:27,992 --> 00:41:29,026
I'll call you again.

624
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:44,875
Captain An got permission for this
through Assemblyman Baek.

625
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:48,378
The contractor name for the unit that
called the cleaning service today is Kim Jae-hoon.

626
00:41:48,512 --> 00:41:50,414
And what a coincidence,

627
00:41:50,414 --> 00:41:52,082
he's at the hospital now with a gunshot wound.

628
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,552
Next. Please zoom in here.

629
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,730
Kim Jae-hoon is a stolen name.

630
00:42:07,698 --> 00:42:08,732
It's Kim Si-hyun.

631
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:11,969
Hey, Ji-hoon.

632
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:19,543
You can't come in without permission.

633
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:21,278
This is an emergency room.
It's a crowded place.

634
00:42:21,278 --> 00:42:23,080
There's a criminal in here right now.

635
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:26,083
I'm on official business.

636
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:41,064
This man is Kim Si-hyun.

637
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:45,769
Kim Si-hyun.

638
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:48,906
The drug lord that the Special Investigation Unit
has been desperately looking for.

639
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:52,943
From now on, the regional investigation unit is taking over this case.

640
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:39,756
Just a little...

641
00:43:41,058 --> 00:43:42,893
Can't he be moved to a general ward?

642
00:43:42,893 --> 00:43:44,261
With the police and reporters,

643
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:46,297
there are too many people crowding around, making treatment difficult.

644
00:43:46,297 --> 00:43:49,700
And even I find it difficult
to look after a gunshot patient.

645
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:51,735
We don't know what kind of emergency might arise,

646
00:43:51,735 --> 00:43:53,470
so we can't put him in a general ward.

647
00:43:58,776 --> 00:44:00,544
From here on, unauthorized personnel cannot enter.

648
00:44:00,544 --> 00:44:02,279
Conduct your investigation during visiting hours.

649
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:23,334
How did you end up like this?

650
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:25,435
Is it okay to achieve your goal even if it means deceiving others?

651
00:44:25,736 --> 00:44:27,604
I'm going to catch you, no matter what.

652
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:29,773
You'll never catch me.

653
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:32,376
Because I'm not guilty.

654
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,622
You can't catch me, ever!

655
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:56,133
It's all over.

656
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:00,003
Please.

657
00:45:00,738 --> 00:45:01,772
Stop it.

658
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:03,640
What?

659
00:45:04,275 --> 00:45:07,377
Have you ever really
considered me family, even once?

660
00:45:08,445 --> 00:45:11,448
You must have been excited
at the thought of catching a criminal.

661
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:13,150
I've secured all the evidence.

662
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:15,252
There's nowhere to run.

663
00:45:15,252 --> 00:45:17,421
Right.

664
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:20,190
I trusted you and gave you everything,
so of course you secured it.

665
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:23,460
I'll be arrested and punished.

666
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:25,429
What about you?

667
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:27,397
You deceived someone. Are you not guilty?

668
00:45:36,607 --> 00:45:37,641
Watch closely.

669
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:39,943
This is the price for your sin.

670
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:43,280
Hey! Park Kyung-soo!

671
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,314
Wait.

672
00:45:46,483 --> 00:45:47,518
No!

673
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:39,737
The police have produced drugs abroad

674
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:42,406
and arrested the godfather of the drug world
who controlled the domestic distribution network,

675
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:44,942
Kim Si-hyun, in a surprise move.

676
00:46:44,942 --> 00:46:47,177
Mr. Kim suffered a gunshot wound during a drug deal

677
00:46:47,177 --> 00:46:49,480
and sought treatment at an ER under a false name.

678
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,248
However, a detective from the regional investigation unit,

679
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:53,450
Mr. B, who was at the scene for another investigation,

680
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:55,986
recognized him as the major drug lord
sought by the special unit

681
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:57,955
and arrested him.

682
00:46:58,455 --> 00:46:59,290
Yes?

683
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,092
Something unusual was discovered
in Kim Si-hyun's vehicle.

684
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,695
The drug evidence that we seized

685
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:07,331
and then lost at Incheon Port last month,

686
00:47:07,331 --> 00:47:08,732
a large quantity has been found.

687
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:10,834
How much was found?

688
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:14,872
Yes, meth, ketamine,
liquid marijuana cartridges, Tuk-Rak.

689
00:47:15,005 --> 00:47:16,840
Everything that was lost has been found.

690
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,343
So...

691
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:23,847
that means someone from inside our department
sold even the evidence to Kim Si-hyun.

692
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:24,748
That's right.

693
00:47:24,748 --> 00:47:27,551
The drug evidence we've lost
over the years,

694
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:30,154
it seems it was distributed to the outside
through Kim Si-hyun.

695
00:47:30,354 --> 00:47:32,656
There's definitely someone inside the police force

696
00:47:32,656 --> 00:47:33,991
connected to Kim Si-hyun.

697
00:47:37,027 --> 00:47:38,529
How much have you found out?

698
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:40,598
We're trying to crack Kim Si-hyun's
phone password,

699
00:47:40,598 --> 00:47:42,399
so we sent it for digital forensics.

700
00:47:42,399 --> 00:47:45,469
We'll have a better picture once
the results come back.

701
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:48,606
The accomplice is likely a current officer.

702
00:47:48,606 --> 00:47:50,841
Don't make any rash moves until you have solid evidence.

703
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:51,875
Got it?

704
00:47:51,976 --> 00:47:53,377
Yes, understood.

705
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:26,910
Who is it?

706
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:29,713
Who do you think? Your wife?

707
00:48:30,948 --> 00:48:32,716
This car...

708
00:48:33,517 --> 00:48:35,219
The person who bought it for you,

709
00:48:35,853 --> 00:48:37,922
in preparation for a day like today,

710
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:40,057
I had my fingerprint registered as well.

711
00:48:40,724 --> 00:48:44,028
You've probably already confirmed that the person
you were dealing with was Kim Si-hyun,

712
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:45,663
so I'll get straight to the point.

713
00:48:45,663 --> 00:48:47,865
We're breaking Kim Si-hyun out. Help me.

714
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:53,103
The hospital is crawling with police.

715
00:48:53,704 --> 00:48:56,106
He's scheduled to be moved to another hospital tomorrow,

716
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:57,308
so even more will come.

717
00:48:57,308 --> 00:48:59,343
Don't give me that ridiculous bullshit.

718
00:49:01,178 --> 00:49:04,281
Cover up the entire investigation related to Kim Si-hyun.

719
00:49:08,218 --> 00:49:09,419
Oh?

720
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,288
What, you can't do that?

721
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:13,690
The case has gotten too big to cover up.

722
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:15,960
Okay.

723
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,394
Then we'll just have to keep digging.

724
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:18,862
Keep digging.

725
00:49:18,862 --> 00:49:20,130
With a sense of duty,

726
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,433
just keep digging away happily.

727
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:25,169
But what a fucking shame.

728
00:49:25,169 --> 00:49:27,504
If you keep digging,
you'll be there at the bottom.

729
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,141
What? Scared?

730
00:49:31,976 --> 00:49:33,577
Don't be scared.

731
00:49:59,005 --> 00:50:00,039
You.

732
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,242
That brilliant friend of yours,

733
00:50:03,743 --> 00:50:06,546
when he said you buy Benpo often,
I thought it was strange.

734
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:10,583
What kind of psycho buys a
downer-type drug at a party?

735
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:13,786
And of all things, Benponarbital.

736
00:50:16,155 --> 00:50:17,757
It's not bad for use as a sleeping pill.

737
00:50:17,757 --> 00:50:19,592
Don't give me that bullshit.

738
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,028
Euthanasia.

739
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,398
It is euthanasia, isn't it?

740
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:29,001
I'm a sensitive businessman.

741
00:50:30,103 --> 00:50:31,571
In my business,

742
00:50:32,004 --> 00:50:34,674
uncontrollable screw-ups like you two,

743
00:50:34,674 --> 00:50:37,376
I absolutely will not tolerate it. Absolutely no.

744
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:41,380
What do you want?

745
00:50:42,515 --> 00:50:44,050
Do you want to raise the price of the drug?

746
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:47,787
If you've done something wrong,

747
00:50:47,787 --> 00:50:50,356
just ask for forgiveness cleanly.

748
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:51,857
Huh?

749
00:50:56,162 --> 00:51:01,200
Using my merchandise however you want
without my permission,

750
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,869
how you'll pay the price for that,

751
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:05,037
we'll talk again after you get Kim Si-hyun out.

752
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:08,341
The police are positioned
all over the hospital.

753
00:51:09,475 --> 00:51:12,712
Getting Kim Si-hyun out is
physically impossible.

754
00:51:12,712 --> 00:51:15,281
And tomorrow, when people from the military hospital arrive,

755
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,250
he could be moved to another hospital.

756
00:51:17,684 --> 00:51:18,718
Hey.

757
00:51:19,752 --> 00:51:20,753
Woo So-jeong, you.

758
00:51:20,753 --> 00:51:22,588
Don't you ever say 'impossible'
in front of me again.

759
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:25,892
And you have to get Kim Si-hyun out, no matter what.

760
00:51:26,926 --> 00:51:28,928
And...

761
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,734
- aren't you worried about your nieces?
- Don't touch the children.

762
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:37,870
If the children get hurt,
I won't just stand by.

763
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,405
I have nothing more to be afraid of.

764
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:43,776
Are you threatening me right now?

765
00:51:45,611 --> 00:51:47,780
If I get caught, do you think you'll be safe?

766
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,582
You don't want me to go crazy

767
00:51:49,582 --> 00:51:50,683
and tell the police everything,

768
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:53,152
and have the situation spiral
out of your control, do you?

769
00:51:53,786 --> 00:51:55,755
You get Kim Si-hyun out yourself.

770
00:51:55,755 --> 00:51:57,990
And stop bothering me and the people around me.

771
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:00,993
Well, well.

772
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:04,297
Hey, Woo So-jeong.

773
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:06,532
You won't regret this, will you?

774
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,816
She's a complete psycho.

775
00:52:47,907 --> 00:52:51,277
These shishito peppers are so good.

776
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,981
I lost 2kg from stress last month,

777
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:56,716
but it looks like I'm going to gain it all back.

778
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:02,088
Anyone would think you're eating
something different from me.

779
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,456
Does it not taste good?

780
00:53:04,424 --> 00:53:07,026
I don't know why everything
tastes so good to me.

781
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:08,794
I'm not a growing child.

782
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:10,897
When I went to retreats as a kid,

783
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:14,533
even the food everyone else said was bad,
I thought was delicious.

784
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,939
You should try this. It's really good.

785
00:53:45,465 --> 00:53:46,532
Go get a gurney.

786
00:53:46,532 --> 00:53:48,301
- And get more people.
- Uh, gurney.

787
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,585
This way!

788
00:54:06,252 --> 00:54:07,954
He's bleeding heavily.

789
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,592
Bang!

790
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:15,194
Agh, agh!

791
00:54:16,262 --> 00:54:17,463
It hurts, it hurts.

792
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,498
Doctor.

793
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,235
Pretend you don't know and just walk by.

794
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:23,736
Don't be a hero.

795
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:26,873
The restaurant fire,

796
00:54:26,873 --> 00:54:29,041
the repairmen in the hospital...
is this all your doing?

797
00:54:30,243 --> 00:54:33,179
You told me to handle it.
This is my style.

798
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:34,180
What are you trying to do?

799
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,648
There are too many cops.

800
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,283
And too many patients in the hospital.

801
00:54:37,283 --> 00:54:39,485
Aren't they all just flies?

802
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,687
What do you do to get rid of flies?

803
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:43,790
You need an accident to happen.

804
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,191
Are you crazy?

805
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:46,492
Stop it right now.

806
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:49,562
Girls go crazy for me,
calling me their crazy bad boy.

807
00:54:49,562 --> 00:54:52,064
What, you don't like me?

808
00:54:55,034 --> 00:54:57,169
There's going to be another one soon.

809
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,272
- Don't push it.
- I'll do it.

810
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:01,107
I'll do it, so
don't start anything.

811
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:03,543
What can you do? Now?

812
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,379
I'll take responsibility. I can do it.

813
00:55:12,118 --> 00:55:13,853
Deal. I'll give you five minutes.

814
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,656
I'll be waiting.

815
00:55:36,142 --> 00:55:38,444
Park a car by the funeral hall entrance
and wait.

816
00:55:38,444 --> 00:55:40,446
I'll bring Kim Si-hyun out myself.

817
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:01,067
You're here?

818
00:56:36,035 --> 00:56:38,104
I'll be the hostage, so get out.

819
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:10,469
Kim Si-hyun!

820
00:57:11,571 --> 00:57:13,339
Get out of the way, you bastard!

821
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:14,874
- Oh my!
- Get lost!

822
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:17,843
I'll fucking kill you!

823
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:27,653
What the hell?
Hey! Get in there, quick!

824
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,065
Excuse me, did something happen?

825
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:40,466
The criminal who was in the ICU

826
00:57:40,466 --> 00:57:42,435
took a medical staff member hostage and escaped.

827
00:57:55,148 --> 00:57:56,349
Hey, get lost!

828
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:58,284
- Let go!
- Get lost!

829
00:57:58,284 --> 00:58:00,553
- Kim Si-hyun, drop the knife!
- You drop yours!

830
00:58:00,553 --> 00:58:02,255
Back off!

831
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:04,824
Kim Si-hyun, drop the knife!

832
00:58:04,957 --> 00:58:07,126
Don't come any closer, she dies!

833
00:58:07,126 --> 00:58:09,696
- Get out, get out!
- She dies!

834
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:12,031
Don't come any closer, you bastards!

835
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:16,769
Get out, get out!

836
00:58:27,814 --> 00:58:29,081
Hey, hey, get him!

837
00:58:32,952 --> 00:58:34,654
Get in! Quick, quick!

838
00:58:34,654 --> 00:58:35,688
Murderer!

839
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,125
Oh no!

840
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:18,311
{\an8}Get your k-fix @ SinFlix!

841
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:18,311
QC by Linja

842
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:21,114
[Special thanks to actors Yang Jo-a
and Lee Yi-kyung for their special appearances.]

843
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:41,733
A kidnapping?

844
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:43,511
How badly was she hurt?

845
00:59:43,535 --> 00:59:45,436
Ms. Woo So-jeong, are you okay?

846
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:49,129
We are already investigating you
under the assumption that you're a criminal.

847
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:52,099
I'd be grateful if you could kill me.

848
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:53,200
Are you crazy?

849
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,035
In a situation where you're being
chased by the police,

850
00:59:55,035 --> 00:59:56,437
you're going to do that again?

851
00:59:56,437 --> 00:59:57,671
As time goes on,

852
00:59:57,671 --> 01:00:00,708
this could become a human right.

853
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:04,545
It's a perfectly sleek business item.

854
01:00:04,578 --> 01:00:05,613
Drink.

855
01:00:06,046 --> 01:00:07,247
Drink!
