1
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,978
This drama deals with the sensitive
subject of euthanasia

2
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:15,990
and may be disturbing
for some viewers.

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,560
It was a much more comfortable death
than I expected.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,740
Even I was tempted.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,140
Calm down, wait until later.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,680
Let's talk about this later,
Attorney Park.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,640
Not later.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,030
I want to make you a proposal now.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,460
This time, I can offer you more money
than CEO Jin.

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,930
What's the proposal?

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,190
The remaining pentobarbital,

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,630
he took it?

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,280
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,990
Damn it, that...

15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,190
That bastard seems to have taken
the pentobarbital.

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,420
What?

17
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,130
What are you saying?

18
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,690
Damn it.

19
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,270
MARY <font color="#ff0000">KILLS</font> PEOPLE

20
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,840
{\an8}EPISODE 9

21
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,160
{\an8}Yes, understood.

22
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,190
{\an8}This way.

23
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,460
{\an8}What did you do now?

24
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,490
{\an8}Is it my fault someone close to me
died?

25
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,060
{\an8}Who is it this time?

26
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,460
{\an8}Ye-na's brother, Geon-soo, died.

27
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,930
{\an8}He had been diagnosed
with a terminal illness.

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,690
{\an8}He collapsed during the concert.

29
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,530
{\an8}And this is another coincidence?

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,790
{\an8}I'm afraid they'll suspect me
again,

31
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,730
{\an8}so I called an ambulance.

32
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,590
{\an8}Does even the way I act
seem suspicious to you?

33
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,990
{\an8}That's also my fault, isn't it?

34
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,030
Safety comes first, right?

35
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,660
What is this?

36
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,660
Choi Dae-hyun,

37
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,990
you lied to me.

38
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,760
All this happened because you were playing around.

39
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,490
Sir, how do you want to handle this?

40
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,630
Let's stop here.

41
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,430
Right here.

42
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,660
It looks natural, like an accident.

43
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,660
If we do anything else,
we'll be exposed.

44
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,089
Just leave it like that.

45
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,290
Woo Sojeong and I will take care
of the rest together.

46
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,290
Looks good, huh.

47
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,630
Wow, you're here. I'm excited.

48
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,860
Are you going to ask me out?

49
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,790
You're the one who caused
Dae-hyun's accident, right?

50
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,290
Calm down.

51
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,530
Why are you hitting me?

52
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,330
Why is she doing this?

53
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,560
Dae-hyun almost died because of you.

54
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,790
Hey, Woo So-jeong.

55
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,880
Aren't you scared of me?

56
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,430
Kill me if you want.

57
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,660
Dae-hyun only did what you told him to do.

58
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,630
Do you think you're a big deal?

59
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,990
Why are you so confident?

60
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,630
Think about it.

61
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,730
I was the first victim.

62
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,860
You stole my things.

63
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,030
If you want to kill someone, just kill me.

64
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,630
It all started with me.

65
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,760
I can't do anything against our dear Woo Sojeong.

66
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,660
How could I kill you?

67
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,460
You're very skilled with pentobarbital.

68
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,060
Besides,

69
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,960
why do you care so much about those people?

70
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,430
Your useless friend Choi Dae-hyun

71
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,630
and that useless little nurse.

72
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,020
Get rid of them.

73
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,430
Just cooperate with me.

74
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,790
I'll take good care of you.

75
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,070
I don't want to work with someone like you.

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,430
Also,

77
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,020
if you touch the people around me again,

78
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll take you straight to the police station.

79
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,530
Oh, how cute.

80
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,860
If you ever show your face in front of me again,

81
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,190
you and I will die together.

82
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,890
You're putting on a good act. Oh, how scary.

83
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,620
Geom-soo suddenly collapsed.

84
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,360
I couldn't arrange anything after the performance.

85
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,760
so I'll do it later.

86
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,060
Why were Woo So-jeong and Choi Dae-hyun there?

87
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,940
The doctor who came to the show?

88
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,820
It seems Ye-na invited her.

89
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,930
She's been helping check on the patient's condition

90
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,430
and taking care of him.

91
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,830
Thanks to her, Geon-soo was able to continue
with the performance until then.

92
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,160
This house...

93
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,160
isn't it in a remote location?

94
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,610
They must have chosen this kind of place on purpose.

95
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,360
We need to check the surveillance video.

96
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,760
Please cooperate.

97
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,710
Okay, I understand.

98
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,690
What? They're all gathered together.

99
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,960
Choi Geon-soo didn't die of natural causes?

100
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,760
Even wedding banquets aren't this lively.

101
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,160
I heard that before going to Switzerland
for euthanasia,

102
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,130
some people also throw parties with friends.

103
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,980
Maybe that's it.

104
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,190
But if Choi Geon-soo
underwent euthanasia,

105
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,480
where did Woo So-jeong get
the pentobarbital from?

106
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,760
Isn't Kim Si-hyun dead?

107
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,430
She must've set aside many doses
before he died.

108
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,470
Impossible.

109
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,030
Every time something happens,
we check everything about Woo So-jeong.

110
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,390
We didn't find any pentobarbital.

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,960
With us watching her,

112
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,440
she couldn't have stored it.

113
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,530
Before each patient,
she has to order more.

114
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,190
If that's the case,

115
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,430
did you already find a new channel
for supplying pentobarbital?

116
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,430
Confirm the location of those two.

117
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,590
See where they went
before the presentation.

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,890
Understood.

119
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,390
He was very lively before he died.

120
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,159
How sad.

121
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,120
People die,

122
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,920
but this isn't murder.

123
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,980
You also said

124
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,810
that for those who suffer too much,
death can be a better option.

125
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,160
So, we...

126
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,810
let's do it right.

127
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,530
What is this?

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm in disguise, this is mine.

129
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,190
If I ask for permission to go on a
family trip to Gangwon Province,

130
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,430
I have to take something with me.

131
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,790
How embarrassing. Hurry up.

132
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,930
Seriously...

133
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,490
I suddenly felt like someone was following me.

134
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,590
Who's following you?

135
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,430
Is it CEO Gu?

136
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,160
No, it was just my imagination.

137
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,730
I'll do it.

138
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,680
It should work.

139
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,130
Woo So-jeong.

140
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,010
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,260
That was obviously the place where
you could get the medicine.

142
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,910
I only made things harder for you.

143
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,210
You needed the medicine.

144
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,420
But since the investigation
became too rigorous,

145
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,380
I couldn't find anyone else
who could get pentobarbital.

146
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,690
If you can't get the medicine,
then just say so.

147
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,660
There was no other way.

148
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,860
Ye-na and Geon-soo were waiting.

149
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,990
I didn't know you were going to do
something so dangerous.

150
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,040
Just do whatever is safe to do.

151
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,110
I'm so sorry for making you suffer like this.

152
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,960
It's really touching.

153
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,340
Even though we all agreed on it, I don't regret it.

154
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,960
But I think it's time to stop.

155
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,110
It's become too dangerous.

156
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,720
I know.

157
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,460
It's very dangerous now. We must be careful.

158
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,910
No, not for now.

159
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,660
I think we should stop completely, So-jeong.

160
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,990
This time it was me,

161
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,990
next time it could be you or Ye-na.

162
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,220
Don't think about anything else right now.

163
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,290
Focus on taking good care of your body.

164
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,130
I understand what you mean.

165
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,330
We've gone too far.

166
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,460
It's time to stop.

167
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,640
Let's stop here.

Why don't you let me know before you come?

178
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,570
Aren't you very busy?

179
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,030
I was waiting for you.

180
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,820
Wow.

181
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,110
You look good.

182
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,420
It seems like you've been doing well lately.

183
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,190
It doesn't hurt anymore, right?

184
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,860
Your brother doesn't feel any pain.

185
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,540
Your brother...

186
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,160
Thanks to you, he's doing very well now.

187
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,190
And I can still see Mom.

188
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,080
I'm happy.

189
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,990
Really?

190
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,790
You're happier now than when you were with me.
That makes me a little sad.

191
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,690
Oh, why are you sad?

192
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,890
Mom is fine too, don't worry.

193
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,810
Ye-na,

194
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,390
are you happy?

195
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,990
Of course.

196
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,580
I miss Mom too.

197
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,790
When the time comes, we'll meet again.

198
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,370
Wait, it's still a long way off.

199
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:25,980
Yes.

200
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,780
That's right.

201
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,970
I wrote a new song.

202
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,200
You have to hear it.

203
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,940
Okay.

204
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,630
You know my guitar skills, right?

205
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,350
They're bad.

206
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,050
That's true.

207
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,090
Play it for me.

208
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,060

220

Dr. Woo.

221
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,970
Let me take care of Dr. Choi.

222
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,880
I rushed over with my luggage as soon as I heard the news.

223
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,760
Thank you.

224
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,140
I heard it was a hit-and-run.

225
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,670
Is the cause of the accident still unknown?

226
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,730
I don't think the accident was an accident.

227
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,760
So...

228
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,210
Someone deliberately hit Dr. Choi?

229
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,210
I think it was because of problems
when buying the medicine.

230
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,910
Was he in danger

231
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
for buying the medicine for my brother?

232
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,850
Stay here with him for now.

233
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,110
You'll be safer that way.

234
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,080
I'll find a place for you to stay later.

235
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,110
Don't worry, Dr. Woo.

236
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,450
I'll take good care of him.

237
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,780
Thank you.

238
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,520
Emergency patient. Please make way.

239
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,250
What's going on?

240
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,400
Looks like she took sleeping pills.

241
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,890
I thought I'd already thrown them all away.

242
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,680
Was she taking them regularly?

243
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,610
Yes, because the medication
isn't working for her.

244
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,600
So it looks like she took a lot.

245
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,010
Don't worry.

246
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,260
She seems to have regained consciousness.

247
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,490
Good, thank you.

248
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,319
I need to run some more tests.

249
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,589
You don't have to worry about her anymore.

250
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,349
If you're uncomfortable, you can sit outside and wait.

251
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,319
Okay.

252
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,069
Let's start with a basic blood test.

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,280
(Serial murder by drugs)

254
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,340
On the day Choi Geon-soo died,

255
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,370
Choi Dae-hyun visited a building in Gangnam,

256
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,350
but there's nothing suspicious there.

257
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,350
The most suspicious person is the owner.

258
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,900
Does the owner have a drug record?

259
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,050
He's not the original owner of that building.

260
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,120
It belonged to a businessman named Jin Yeom-soo,

261
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,990
but it looks like everyone moved out a few days ago.

262
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,880
The building was used to pay off debts.

263
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,030
Do you know anything about Gwang Asset Operations?

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,110
Yes, they replied that they couldn't confirm it.

265
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,420
And the former owner, Jin Yeom-soo, is also dead.

266
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,780
So, he can't confirm it now either.

267
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,760
I heard he was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer.

268
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,950
He and Choi Geon-soo died on the same day.

269
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,410
Wait a minute.

270
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,070
So, two terminally ill patients...

271
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,780
died on the day Choi Dae-hyun was there.

272
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,750
Choi Dae-hyun didn't go to that building to buy medicine.

273
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,450
Probably to perform euthanasia.

274
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,400
That's right.

275
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,310
I received news that Choi Dae-hyun
was in a car accident and was hospitalized.

276
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,240
What?

277
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,730
If my wife is okay now,

278
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
please, help me.

279
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
Are you in any pain?

280
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,170
Please, let me die.

281
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,640
I don't understand what you're saying.

282
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,080
He's our client.

283
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,300
You told me to be careful, but I didn't tell you.

284
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,900
{\an8}Park Tae-hyung has been diagnosed
with a terminal illness

285
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,050
{\an8}due to malignant mesothelioma.

286
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,520
{\an8}(Malignant mesothelioma: Tumor that affects
the lining of the chest, abdomen, or heart)

287
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,990
He seems to have trouble breathing.

288
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,100
Turns out it was because of this disease.

289
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,930
Malignant mesothelioma.

290
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,990
This is the beginning.

291
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,980
This disease alone is making me miserable.

292
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,310
At first, I just thought there was a thief in the house.

293
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,530
Late at night, I saw a strange man...

294
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,510
standing in the hallway of our house.

295
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,610
I was very surprised and scared.

296
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,780
I just collapsed on the spot.

297
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,190
'Did I see a ghost?'

298
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,700
'Or am I crazy?'

299
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,610
Later I found out I had dementia.

300
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,770
The name of the disease isn't familiar to me either.

301
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,750
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

302
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,100
Dementia with Lewy bodies is different
from Alzheimer's disease.

303
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,900
Even if short-term memory isn't affected,

304
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,700
intense visual hallucinations
can cause patients great distress.

305
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,080
Yes, that's right.

306
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,230
The feeling of seeing strangers every day...

307
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,830
makes me feel as scared as a child.

308
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,190
It seems the hallucinations
scare him more than the pain.

309
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,580
Doctor, I heard that patients
who have no cure…

310
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,850
are offered
some different treatments.

311
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,070
Please.

312
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,830
Take this pain away from me.

313
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,760
Get rid of it.

314
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,600
Hey.

315
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,060
Hey.

316
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,770
Dr. Choi, are you okay?

317
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,670
Someone was here and just left.

318
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,230
Calm down first.

319
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,800
I came down this hallway

320
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,470
and I didn't see anyone running from here.

321
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,860
No, no, I'm getting out of here.

322
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,970
Dr. Choi, you can't move right now.

323
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,290
You still need to continue treatment.

324
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,620
Transfer me to Father Yang's hospital, okay?

325
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,010
I don't want to stay here anymore.

326
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,580
The tests are complete.

327
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,490
You can be discharged
tomorrow morning.

328
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,590
Did your husband leave?

329
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,460
He's in poor health.

330
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,260
My nephew took him home.

331
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,290
So, you'll be staying here alone today?

332
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,750
I know what you're worried about,

333
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,580
but if my husband is alive,

334
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,500
I won't seek death

335
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,270
because I know how much it would hurt him.

336
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,570
I'll recommend another doctor for you.

337
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,460
Once you find the right doctor,
things will get better.

338
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,520
I've seen almost every psychiatrist
for my husband's sake.

339
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,070
Life is truly unpredictable.

340
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,180
I have such a good husband,

341
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,340
but I can't be happy.

342
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,690
So, don't worry.

343
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,730
If my husband is alive,

344
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,680
I won't die.

345
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,510
Are you waiting for it?

346
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,010
After your husband dies,

347
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,090
then you'll be free to make your decision?

348
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,840
For terminally ill patients
whose pain cannot be relieved,

349
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,010
you can allow them to rest in peace.

350
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,980
No method has managed to relieve my pain
in my entire life.

351
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,750
Then, I also...

352
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,450
want to go with my husband.

353
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,990
After he's gone,

354
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,270
I don't want to keep living.

355
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,600
I won't let healthy people die.

356
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,920
Am I healthy?

357
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,910
My heart is already sick, so...

358
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,410
Am I still a healthy person?

359
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,000
Doctor, for patients like me,

360
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,080
have you ever considered it?

361
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,620
You said you live for your husband, right?

362
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,990
You don't want your husband to get hurt.

363
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,480
So, please hold on a little longer.

364
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,990
He's already suffering enough

365
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,550
and he doesn't have many days left.

366
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,830
We can't make a person like that 
feel the sadness of losing a family member.

367
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,130
I know this request is selfish and cruel.

368
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,280
I'm so sorry.

369
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,350
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,950
I shouldn't be saying these things.

371
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,250
Please don't take what I'm saying seriously.

372
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,970
Please, help my husband.

373
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,550
That person...

374
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,000
has the right to die with dignity.

375
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,300
Please...

376
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,470
How many times do I have to say it?

377
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,220
Ye-na's brother has been diagnosed
with a terminal illness.

378
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,200
We were just helping him,
making sure he finished the show.

379
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,550
If you all helped so much,

380
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,200
why did he die?

381
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,420
He obviously died of an illness.
Do we still have to explain this to you?

382
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,970
Ye-na just lost her brother a few days ago.

383
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,550
Then, I'll change the question.

384
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,800
If Choi Geon-soo had a performance,

385
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,370
why did he go all the way to Gangnam?

386
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,850
I went to meet a friend.

387
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,870
What friend?

388
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,450
Could you tell us so we can verify?

389
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,300
He's from a foreign country.

390
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,850
He should have already left the country.

391
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,450
What are you hesitating about?

392
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,550
We believe that you, Choi Dae-hyun,
went all the way to Gangnam

393
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,100
to get the pentobarbital.

394
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,800
Am I crazy?

395
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,600
I've been watched by all of you.

396
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,070
Why would I do something like that?

397
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,970
Someone died in that building.

398
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,070
Do you know Jin Yeom-soo?

399
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,470
I don't know him.

400
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,520
Such an intense investigation of a patient,

401
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,620
Isn't that too much?

402
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,920
Dr. Choi was involved in a hit-and-run.

403
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,650
Please, catch the criminals first.

404
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,300
No, but…

405
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,320
You're still under police suspicion, right?

406
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,220
Why do you keep acting like this?

407
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,820
That makes us even more suspicious.

408
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,320
We work together at Father Yang's hospital, and...

409
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,700
It's normal...

410
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,320
It's normal...

411
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,720
What's normal?

412
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,950
Because we started dating.

413
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,020
What?

414
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,550
Choi Dae-hyun.

415
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,970
Talk to me in private.

416
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,800
<i>You lied to me.</i>

417
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,070
<i>All this happened because you were playing around.</i>

418
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,720
Woo So-jeong and I
will be working together from now on.

419
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,570
Why did the police come to see you, Dr. Choi?

420
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,670
Did you really commit a crime?

421
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,550
I'm sorry.

422
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,700
Is this matter

423
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,050
related to Dr. Woo So-jeong?

424
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,370
I'll ask you again.

425
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,900
Dr. Choi, what are you doing?

426
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,000
Is it the same thing Dr. Woo does?

427
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,050
I thought you were a very honest person, Dr. Choi.

428
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm disappointed in you.

429
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,850
Last time, the case was closed by luck,

430
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,620
but that doesn't mean what you're doing is right.

431
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,750
You know that too.

432
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,570
Father, you're right.

433
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,070
I no longer believe...

434
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,120
that this situation...

435
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,670
is the right choice.

436
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,500
This is where patients who have nowhere else to go stay.

437
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,970
It's not a place to hide criminals.

438
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,020
Will God...

439
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,550
not forgive...

440
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,370
our sins, Father?

441
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,800
It will be forgiven,

442
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,900
as long as you truly repent.

443
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,300
That's why I hope you...

444
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,300
can stop Dr. Woo.

445
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,300
Commissioner An said
he was friends with Assemblyman Baek.

446
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,700
We're not allowed to enter the building operated
by Gwang Asset Operations.

447
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,100
Isn't Assemblyman Baek the one pressuring us?

448
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,150
How are we going to get any results from our search?

449
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,620
That's right.

450
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,970
It's strange.

451
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,670
Jin Yeom-soo, Gwang Asset Operations...

452
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,450
He gets angry when those things are mentioned.

453
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,870
Even if he's friends with Assemblyman Baek,

454
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,450
he's also connected to the incident.

455
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,750
No matter how you look at it,
them being friends is just an excuse.

456
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,950
Next time, if you find any important evidence,

457
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,420
don't talk to Commissioner An.

458
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,370
Report it directly to the assemblyman.

459
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,920
Okay.

460
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,020
But how do we investigate Gwang Asset Operations?

461
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,600
About the investigation...

462
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,720
I'll go alone.

463
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,600
What?

464
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,420
If Commissioner An finds out,

465
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,670
just say it was my decision.

466
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Forget it.

467
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,470
I'll take responsibility for that.

468
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,820
Have a cup of tea.

469
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,250
I heard you're particularly curious about this office.

470
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,420
This is my private space.

471
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,970
I don't let most people in here.

472
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,220
But if you look around, you'll see...

473
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,720
it's a very ordinary place.

474
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,850
I have a few questions for you.

475
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,020
When the building's former owner, Jin Yeom-soo, died...

476
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,870
where were you?

477
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,300
When was that?

478
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,320
November 23rd.

479
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,470
That day...

480
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,320
I met a model at a party.

481
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,950
We went for a drive and chatted.

482
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,750
And we kissed a couple of times.

483
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,250
Sure.

484
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,500
Have you heard of Choi Dae-hyun?

485
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,700
I don't know him.

486
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,800
When did he move in here?

487
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,620
It wasn't long ago.

488
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,450
Mr. Jin who used to live here...

489
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,450
I already answered that, didn't I?

490
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,900
Did you know that whoever lived...

491
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,970
in his former residence was Kim Si Hyeon?

492
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,700
Who's that?

493
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,650
Do you know Assemblyman Baek Hyun-seung?

494
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,700
I'm not an employee of a loan company.

495
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,350
Why are you coming to ask me
about this person and that person?

496
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,520
Yes, I know Baek Hyun-seung.

497
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,470
He and I went to the same church,
so we know each other.

498
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,770
One last question.

499
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,250
Have you heard of An Tae-seong?

500
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,800
An Tae-seong?

501
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,600
- I don't know him.
- Commissioner An.

502
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,470
You don't know him?

503
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,850
Commissioner An.

504
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,920
Assemblyman Baek said that in business,
you should know more people.

505
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,350
He introduced us.

506
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,320
That's how I met him.

507
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,000
Is there anything else you're curious about?

508
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,699
You must be busy.

509
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,900
Please, get back to work.

510
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,150
If you have any questions,
please contact me.

511
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,800
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

512
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,620
Do you want to drop this case?

513
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,870
I'm sorry.

514
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,620
Did he tell you to ignore my instructions?

515
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,420
No.

516
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,070
Ji-hoon's ambition sometimes...

517
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,170
No, I mean, Detective Ban...

518
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,250
We're not together...

519
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,050
Detective Ban acted on his own…

520
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,949
No, not that either.

521
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,350
I'm sorry.

522
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,750
When Ban Ji-hoon gets back,
send him to my office.

523
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,000
The police came yesterday, too.

524
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,719
Even though this may cause doubts,

525
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
you can't arrest him.

526
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,320
I messed up from the beginning.

527
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,120
I shouldn't have started this.

528
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,250
No matter what good reasons
you come up with.

529
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,800
This is killing people.

530
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,120
Seeing those patients suffering,

531
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,970
don't you agree with my idea?

532
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,550
Yeah, that's just a big excuse.

533
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,500
I just wanted to be like those scammers:

534
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,920
easy money, easy work.

535
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,000
That's why I accepted your request.

536
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,450
If I had known
the police would chase me like this,

537
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,800
making me a suspect,

538
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,900
I wouldn't have done it.

539
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,820
So, what do we do?

540
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,050
If you keep doing this,

541
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,550
you'll not only hurt yourself,

542
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,150
you'll end up killing Ye-na and me.

543
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,770
So, promise me...

544
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,620
that you won't get involved in this again.

545
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,250
I can be more careful,
but I can't promise that.

546
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:59,770
If you give up so easily,
I wouldn't have started in the first place.

547
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,200
Is your conviction more important
than Ye-na and me?

548
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,050
That's not what I meant.

549
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,450
If you want to continue,

550
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,770
don't come near me again.

551
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,020
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

552
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,470
I'm very serious.

553
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,870
Being with you, living in fear…

554
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,400
I don't want to live like this anymore.

555
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,070
So, if you insist on continuing,

556
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,950
let's never see each other again.

557
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,820
Please take care of that quickly.

558
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,220
If my uncle dies, I'll inherit the property.

559
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,950
I heard that three years ago.

560
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,400
But you should be aware

561
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,400
that the police are watching.

562
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,220
Why are you so eager to get rid

563
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,320
of your uncle?

564
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,550
That makes me very anxious.

565
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,500
I don't have that much patience.

566
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,700
That's why I have something to tell you.

567
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,050
Park Tae-hyung's nephew contacted me.

568
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,420
Park Tae-hyung is very ill.

569
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,050
He wants to meet with Dr. Woo personally.

570
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,670
Although I want to help, I still have doubts.

571
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,020
Do you have any concerns?

572
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,650
As long as you can promise to do it, I'll offer any help I can.

573
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,350
I can't do this procedure

574
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,950
on those who aren't mentally prepared.

575
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,100
What I mean is that

576
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,650
if he still has an appreciation for life,

577
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,900
this treatment will only end it.

578
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,920
Park Tae-hyung is very worried that after his death

579
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,800
his wife will be left alone.

580
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,100
I won't let my uncle worry. I'll take good care of my aunt.

581
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,780
So just trust me.

582
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,090
Please help my uncle. He's suffering a lot.

583
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,110
I beg you.

584
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,680
Park Tae-hyung's euthanasia

585
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,350
is best performed by Woo So-jeong,

586
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,360
but with our previous method, it was difficult to convince Woo So-jeong.

587
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,330
That's why this time we're going to use
a more common approach

588
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,210
and put the plan against Woo So-jeong into practice.

589
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,720
That's the only way it'll work.

590
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,040
So I have to deceive her like a normal client, right?

591
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,030
Would Woo So-jeong be willing to help my uncle

592
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,290
even while being watched by the police?

593
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,440
You say that because you don't know her.
You have nothing to worry about.

594
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:01,710
Woo So-jeong is a very kind doctor to her patients.

595
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,620
And Park Tae-hyung's illness is real.

596
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,390
His story is also very sad.

597
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,020
That's why Woo So-jeong will never refuse.

598
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,450
She'll help you. Just trust me.

599
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,630
Not only is he my uncle, but I won't let him worry either.

600
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,500
I'll prepare everything.

601
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,370
Who told you to go around causing trouble?

602
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,700
What instructions did they give you, huh?

603
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,200
Do you also know CEO Gu Gwang-chul?

604
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,470
What?

605
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,690
Gu Gwang-chul said you were introduced to him.

606
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,980
I thought you knew each other well.

607
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,000
Didn't you just say
I was only introduced to him?

608
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,190
How can it be so important
if I only greeted him?

609
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,770
From what I know,

610
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,610
there are many people in the financial sector

611
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,830
who entrust all their money
to CEO Gu Gwang-chul.

612
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,870
He often throws parties
with those who entrust him with their money.

613
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,320
But what's suspicious is...

614
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,562
that most people at those parties

615
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:09,590
have a history of drug use
or are suspected of using.

616
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,350
Are you talking about some kind of party
to do drugs?

617
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,190
It's just your assumption.

618
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,700
Are you going to ruin things
based on speculation?

619
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,960
If you agree,
I'll carry out a formal investigation.

620
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,270
Next time, inform me first
and then act.

621
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,360
Don't make people look stupid.

622
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,280
Understood.

623
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,590
Thank you.

624
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,510
You must be tired too.

625
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,790
I'm sorry for giving you so much work.

626
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,930
Don't worry about it.

627
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,870
You helped my brother too.

628
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,350
Are we a team?

629
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,380
Of course, we must be.

630
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,200
Thank you.

631
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,590
Dr. Choi...

632
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,380
The bag you gave me last time...

633
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,470
Dr. Woo took it.

634
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,610
Oops, sorry to interrupt your break.

635
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,430
But now a lot of medical supplies
have arrived at the hospital,

636
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,630
including meat and rice
that the patients eat.

637
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,720
Many donations have arrived.

638
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,740
Really? That's great.

639
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,600
Which group sent it?

640
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,360
It wasn't a group.
It was an individual donation.

641
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,230
But the donor asked

642
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,510
what medical requirements
the hospital needs now.

643
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,250
They said they'll buy them right away.

644
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,450
That's why I came to ask you.

645
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,540
So, that's all.

646
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,300
Is he a member of the church?

647
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:07,970
That's right.

648
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,740
CEO Gu Gwang-chul

649
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,500
is a member of our church,
as are all his family members.

650
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,130
But it's the first time
he's donated to our hospital.

651
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,400
He said an acquaintance recommended it.

652
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,370
Wait, is his name Gu Kwang-chul?

653
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,690
Yes, CEO Gu Gwang-chul.

654
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,770
- I'm from the seventh class.
- Oh, my.

655
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,630
I'm younger than you.

656
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,820
Wow, what a coincidence!

657
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,190
Wow, thank you.

658
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,340
What a coincidence!

659
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,590
I think fate exists. Put it there.

660
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
(Family Relationship Certificate)

661
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,750
(Malignant tumor diagnosed, no improvement,

662
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,620
with respiratory distress requiring oxygen ventilation)

663
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,800
Open your mouth, come on.

664
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,550
Open it.

665
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,220
Don't push it anymore.

666
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,550
You can't get out of this situation.

667
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,310
What?

668
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,800
Do you want me to hit you again?

669
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,300
Do you still want me to hit you
before you eat, you idiot?

670
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,290
Open your mouth! Open it!

671
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,560
Why do you want to die?

672
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,980
You could enjoy everything
and not want for anything.

673
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,440
You don't know how to appreciate
the blessings you have.

674
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,380
So you're a psychopath.

675
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,680
Honey.

676
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,560
Is this real?

677
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,840
It can't be.

678
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,490
It's okay.

679
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,180
I'm okay.

680
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,670
Today...

681
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,250
just get out of here.

682
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,250
Leave quietly...

683
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,690
There won't be any changes...

684
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,830
just keep your promise,

685
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,820
and I'll keep mine.

686
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,220
I won't change anything in the suicide note.

687
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,400
You just need to connect me with that doctor.

688
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,310
That's all.

689
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,330
So...

690
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,200
please...

691
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,640
leave.

692
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,300
Dude,

693
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,860
you have to meet with Dr. Woo with me.

694
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,600
I have to convince her of something.

695
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,940
Okay.

696
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,140
Just make an appointment.

697
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,190
Just tell me when.

698
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,020
How about tomorrow?

699
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,390
Spirit of donation.

700
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,230
I think that really exists.

701
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,460
I feel much better
after donating.

702
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,590
What brings you here?

703
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,340
The tall detective came to see me.

704
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,730
You told him, didn't you?

705
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,060
Why didn't you tell me?

706
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,370
He's very good for you.

707
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,680
Anyway, I don't think it matters.

708
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,970
Do you want to call the police?

709
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,480
Stop fighting.

710
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,000
When I'm not here,

711
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,300
I don't know what he'll do to you.

712
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,790
What if we leave...

713
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,280
together?

714
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,190
My husband's condition
has gotten much worse.

715
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,370
The hallucinations are severe now.

716
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,580
He keeps his eyes closed all day.

717
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,290
He can't even see my face.

718
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,970
Everything he sees scares him.

719
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,800
I already told him.

720
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,350
My husband is truly a great man.

721
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,230
He has the right to die with dignity.

722
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,920
If my husband doesn't die in peace,

723
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,870
that for me...

724
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,520
would be an indelible pain.

725
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,950
I understand your position,

726
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,380
but I can't decide now.

727
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,990
The main problem is

728
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:59,980
that I don't have any medicine.

729
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,640
Perhaps you're referring to pentobarbital?

730
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,280
I'll get it.

731
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,370
Actually, I...

732
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,990
I've defended criminals from the dark web.

733
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,740
At that time, I learned how to buy
medications of that kind.

734
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,000
Although I know it's illegal…

735
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,090
for my uncle, there's nothing I wouldn't do.

736
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,890
I assure you I'll get it.

737
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,330
Help us.

738
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,890
Help us.

739
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:28,460
The tutor is coming. Are you ready?

740
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,180
Your teacher said you're the girl
who's always near the doorknob.

741
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,890
She said you always want to leave
whenever you have the chance.

742
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,310
You really embarrass me.

743
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,240
Aren't you on a diet?

744
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,880
I practiced a lot and lost weight.

745
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,450
Really?

746
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,850
Do you want to be bigger?

747
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,240
If you dance ballet, it's better not to grow so much.

748
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,230
Hello.

749
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,430
Wow...

750
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,620
When I got your call,

751
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,430
I thought you were drinking.

752
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,300
After you gave me the address,
I realized I messed up.

753
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,100
I can...

754
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,230
wear a mic.

755
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,970
I'll do whatever you say.

756
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,660
Just let me see the police.

757
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,800
No matter what you do,
you can't protect Woo So-jeong.

758
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,680
The guy who gave me the drugs,

759
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,530
is now crazy and wants to kill me.

760
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,100
Though I'm ashamed to say it,

761
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,740
I don't have the energy to protect So-jeong.

762
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,310
I heard you got the bag back.

763
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,470
Even if you object, there's no way around it.

764
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,430
Park Tae-hyung is in critical condition,

765
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,470
more than anyone we've helped.

766
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,440
These are the people who need our help the most.

767
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,170
I didn't ask you to come see me just to object.

768
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,230
I know it's useless for me to object.

769
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,520
So, since that's the case...

770
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,230
I'll go too.

771
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,880
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

772
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,290
This isn't just your problem.

773
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,720
If you don't stop,

774
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,240
we could be in real danger.

775
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,060
If you're worried about that, it's okay.

776
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,860
You don't have to come. I can do it alone.

777
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,530
No, not you alone...

778
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:47,820
because I'm uneasy.

779
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:50,830
I'll go too.

780
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,770
Let's go together.

781
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,550
Choi Dae-hyun said he'd help with the investigation.

782
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,990
He'll wear mics and cameras.

783
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,310
Oh, why don't you clean it up?

784
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:11,850
Please, have a seat.

785
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,250
Choi Dae-hyun said

786
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,810
that he'll comply with all the police's requests.

787
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,450
Now it's your turn to talk to me.

788
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,190
Don't charge Woo So-jeong, the main culprit,

789
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,590
and Choi Dae-hyun's accomplice,

790
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,210
with drug trafficking.

791
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,440
Sure, I understand.

792
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,800
But why did he suddenly change his mind?

793
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,560
It seems he was threatened by the drug supplier.

794
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,770
Being threatened like that is exhausting,
both mentally and financially.

795
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,190
Or perhaps...

796
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,020
maybe he just wants to accept the punishment
and put an end to everything.

797
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,770
We can take this opportunity to catch the criminal,

798
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,230
and catch them all together.

799
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,290
The thing is, I don't know who that...

800
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,670
criminal is.

801
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,310
It'll take some time
to catch him.

802
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,680
If I help you catch Woo So-jeong,
won't that be enough?

803
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,290
We want this to be over
as soon as possible.

804
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,930
Yes, that's right.

805
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,690
Then let's catch Woo So-jeong first.

806
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,430
As for the rest, we'll just...

807
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,810
be cautious.

808
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,590
Okay.

809
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,050
Today...

810
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,620
Dr. Woo will be coming.

811
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,330
Good.

812
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:26,540
I gave the caregivers and staff
the week off.

813
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:30,310
Good.

814
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,060
Thank you.

815
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,220
About your aunt...

816
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,940
don't worry about her.

817
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,740
Uncle,

818
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,590
thank you so much

819
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,000
for everything up until now.

820
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,560
Did you want to wear
a bulletproof vest too?

821
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,810
Are you afraid she'll recognize you?
After betraying her, will she stab you?

822
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,530
So-jeong is scary when she's angry,
even more than an agitated patient.

823
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,110
Don't worry too much.

824
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:59,780
By the way,

825
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,990
you must keep your end of the deal.

826
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,880
The deal?

827
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,660
Don't worry about it.

828
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,050
If I break my promise,

829
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,920
your lawyer will kill me.

830
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:10,600
Get ready quickly.

831
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,410
No matter what...

832
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,810
I'll keep my end of the deal.

833
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,630
Are you mentally prepared?

834
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,120
Yes.

835
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,370
Thank you.

836
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:06,710
You're here.

837
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,000
We were waiting for you.

838
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:39,830
Let me do it.

839
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,630
Just stay by my side.

840
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,230
Do you have the medicine?

841
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:47,300
Oh, yes.

842
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:48,870
They'll bring it here shortly.

843
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,810
Why aren't you answering?

844
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:22,950
Who's calling?

845
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,990
It's nothing.

846
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,250
Hello.

847
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,360
What's wrong?

848
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,380
<i>Sorry.</i>

849
00:59:13,427 --> 00:59:16,076
{\an8}Thanks to Ha Sung-kwang and Woo Mi-hwa
for their special appearances.

850
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,450
MARY <font color='#ff0000'>KILLS</font> PEOPLE

851
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,290
{\an8}Didn't you say you'd help us?

852
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,350
{\an8}You deceived us.

853
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,130
{\an8}Doctor, we'll meet again.

854
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,530
{\an8}Honey.

855
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,220
{\an8}Why did you stop?

856
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,130
{\an8}Please, hurry.

857
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,190
{\an8}- You're Jae-yeon, right?
- Don't touch her.

858
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,210
{\an8}You better go right now.

859
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:54,560
{\an8}The situation is getting dangerous
and out of control.

860
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,030
{\an8}That drug dealer must be arrested.

861
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,200
{\an8}A client showed up
who wants to pay more money.

862
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,230
{\an8}If you screw up again, you'll die this time.

863
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,210
{\an8}Woo So-jeong is not untouchable.
