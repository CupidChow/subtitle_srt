(October 15, 2024)

3
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:19,582
I, Choi Kang-yoon,

4
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:21,342
am now about to end my life.

5
00:00:22,577 --> 00:00:24,946
This entire process
is my choice,

6
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:26,747
and at this moment,

7
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:29,784
I am very happy and satisfied.

8
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:37,043
(Benponarbital)

9
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,064
If you're not ready,

10
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:59,532
you don't have to do it today.

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,001
You can postpone it.

12
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,636
- You can stop here.
- No.

13
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:07,607
Before the pain comes again,

14
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:10,844
I want to go now.

15
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,852
It's champagne with Benponarbital.

16
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:25,725
It's so simple.

17
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,375
How long will it take?

18
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:45,311
Usually,

19
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,350
it's over in an instant.

20
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,836
Yes, he's gone.

21
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:16,910
Let's get out of here.

22
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:20,246
I know you insisted on coming,
but this place is too risky.

23
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:21,815
His family comes and goes often,

24
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,416
and the house has quite
a few security cameras.

25
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,319
Choi Kang-yoon said he felt
most at peace here.

26
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,821
It's euthanasia, isn't it?

27
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:29,989
One should be at peace, right?

28
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:33,393
Honey, I'm home.

29
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:37,464
They didn't have the melon
you said you wanted,

30
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:40,300
so I had to go a bit far.

31
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:47,173
Honey, are you asleep?

32
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,746
You said she'd be gone for
at least two hours.

33
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:55,148
I don't know what happened.
He said he sent her far away.

34
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:56,216
Hurry, pack up.

35
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,383
We can't leave anything behind.

36
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:58,685
Okay, just a second.

37
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,420
Hey, hey, where's the envelope?
The enve...

38
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:01,921
Here.

39
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:04,390
Thank you.

40
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,205
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:21,241
Something must have gone wrong.

42
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,650
- What are you doing?
- I have to save him.

43
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,656
It might take some time,

44
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:38,958
but since we used Benponarbital,
he'll eventually pass away.

45
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,514
Just do it.

46
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:06,886
I'm sorry.

{\an8}(Episode 1)

48
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:18,321
How can someone suddenly come back to life?

49
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:19,804
This has never happened before.

50
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,434
Was there a problem with the Benponarbital?

51
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,002
I got it from the same place.

52
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:26,005
The problem wasn't the Benponarbital,
it must have been the drug before it.

53
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,841
Did you mess up
the initial sedation?

54
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,444
No.

55
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,246
Until he drank the champagne
with the Benponarbital,

56
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:35,148
his condition was perfectly under control.

57
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:37,917
His body temperature dropped
enough. There was no problem.

58
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:39,919
I need to check the Benponarbital.

59
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:43,523
Right here.

60
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,592
He really had no pulse.

61
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:50,864
This is a pulse.

62
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,500
No matter how faint,
if this is moving, he's alive.

63
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,702
I may have lost my license,
but I still know that much.

64
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:57,670
He really didn't have a pulse earlier.

65
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,274
He's an athlete.

66
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:03,309
Maybe the dose was too small
for his large frame?

67
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:06,212
That's why I said
we should use an injection, right?

68
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,247
You know it too.

69
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,082
Injecting it right into the
vein is the surest way.

70
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:09,916
No.

71
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:11,651
You agreed to it too.

72
00:05:12,051 --> 00:05:13,920
The patient has to make the final choice.

73
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,222
And if there are needle marks,

74
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,490
we could also be in danger.

75
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:20,126
- The chance of an autopsy increases.
- I know, but...

76
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:22,095
I know that much.

77
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:24,464
Next time, pick a safer place.

78
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:27,033
You can't just agree to everything
the client wants.

79
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,368
Today was way too risky.

80
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:33,706
It's cold.
I think I'm going to catch a cold.

81
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:36,342
Geez, where are we going? Oh, here?

82
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:44,250
Jae-yeon, if you haven't eaten,
want to have dinner together?

83
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,188
Did you go to my aunt's seminar
with her?

84
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:53,093
No, I just gave her a ride
because I figured she'd be tired.

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,794
Even if you try that hard,

86
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,897
it won't make my aunt
suddenly develop feelings for you.

87
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:02,936
Wow.

88
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:05,004
Jae-yeon, you're a pretty cruel one.

89
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:08,842
Jae-yeon, in my whole life,

90
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:11,344
I've confessed to girls
and never once been rejected.

91
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,012
You know what the secret is?

92
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,650
I only asked out girls
who I thought would say yes. See?

93
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,254
So don't worry.

94
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:23,890
I just came because I really
didn't want to eat alone.

95
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:29,329
What's that?

96
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,331
Hey, Kim Jae-yun!

97
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:33,600
Eat it later. We'll boil them for you.

98
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:42,375
It's fine. Kids eat a little
dirt while growing up.

99
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:45,019
I'll drain your ascites. (Ascites:
buildup of fluid in the abdomen)

100
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,413
But sir,

101
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,648
you can't just leave when
you feel better like last time.

102
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:52,752
It's incurable.
I don't want to spend any more money.

103
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,155
Just take this out for me.

104
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:57,557
I need to check your blood pressure
and albumin levels.

105
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,601
It could be dangerous if you just leave it.

106
00:06:56,178 --> 00:07:01,922
{\an8}(Albumin: A type of protein found in the blood. Low
levels can be a sign of liver or kidney problems.)

107
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:01,436
Okay.

108
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,797
This nurse will do it for you.
You saw her last time, right?

109
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,165
- Oh.
- Doc...

110
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:07,233
You said he was in pain
because of me last time.

111
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,301
I'll do it.

112
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:11,171
And Doctor, there's a patient
with a high fever over there.

113
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,038
Okay.

114
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:15,508
Doctor.

115
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:20,213
Even if you're busy, you should
go to the hairdresser. Okay?

116
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:21,748
Goodness.

Woohoo!

121
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:33,999
She kind of has it, right?

122
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,868
You're hilarious.

123
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:36,936
Hello!

124
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:39,638
Looking for me?

125
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,042
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

126
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,946
Go wait over there.

127
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:52,484
Give it a rest, will you?

128
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,787
- Just take it easy.
- I know, right?

129
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:57,690
It's not for my health, but
I should cut back because of the money.

130
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,059
If money's the problem, you
could invest with my company.

131
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,795
With my stocks, I can make you
enough to buy your stuff.

132
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,264
Man, your drug prices are so high.

133
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,700
But is your company
doing okay these days?

134
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,767
All the stocks looked bad.

135
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,503
I just do it because I'm bored.

136
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:11,904
You think I do it for the money?

137
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:16,242
The problem is those kids who
lose money and whine about it.

138
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:17,476
But as for them...

139
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:22,348
I can just appease them with this.

140
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,149
Like this.

141
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:25,317
I see.

142
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:26,886
Great!

143
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,560
- Do you have any today?
- What?

144
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:37,163
Do you have any today?

145
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:39,832
You've got a nose like a dog.

146
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,601
You came because you knew I had some?

147
00:10:53,913 --> 00:10:54,813
Yes.

148
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,954
Hello.

149
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:06,392
You've gotten prettier.

150
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,094
What's gotten prettier about me?

151
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,334
I need more Benponarbital.

152
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:24,043
Got a new lover?

153
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:26,946
Didn't you say you were taking
all the Benponarbital yourself?

154
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,382
For someone doing that,
you look way too healthy.

155
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,118
That's because...

156
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,990
it's because you diluted
the drug with water.

157
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:41,427
I made a deal with you because
you said you wouldn't pull any tricks.

158
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,430
You sold me this cheap fake,
and now you're blaming me?

159
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,598
I diluted it.

160
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:48,467
I wanted to confirm
you weren't reselling the drug.

161
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,371
Is Dr. Choi really the one using that drug?

162
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,876
You gave me that diluted drug
because you were suspicious?

163
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,410
You know I hate that kind of thing, right?

164
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,278
I know.

165
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,114
I know all too well, so listen, I have
no intention of becoming a drug dealer.

166
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,718
I won't infringe on your business,
so give me the real stuff.

167
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,458
What now? Alright.

168
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:19,565
Fine.

169
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,702
I'll have them put it in your trunk.

170
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,871
I'll give you the real stuff.

171
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,072
I won't even charge you.

172
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,108
Want to try some?

173
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,509
Don't you want to be
absolutely sure?

174
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:33,746
I'll trust you.

175
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:39,685
Give me the real stuff, okay?

176
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:45,624
You're a bastard who just
performs illegal procedures.

177
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,933
I feel like the head nurse
is watching me.

178
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,769
Do you think someone tipped her off?

179
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:32,771
She watches everyone.

180
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:35,841
She's the kind of person who thinks
reporting the staff's private secrets

181
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,676
to the higher-ups is her special talent.

182
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,646
The police haven't started
an investigation, have they?

183
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:42,381
They were all very sick,

184
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:45,017
but if someone dies outside a hospital,
they usually call the police first.

185
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,453
Even so,
there's nothing for you to worry about.

186
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,722
If there's an investigation,
they'll start with me.

187
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:51,690
I'll be more careful.

188
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:53,993
Who is it this time?

189
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:55,995
Cho Hyun-woo, 30 years old.

190
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,188
He has a brain tumor,
and surgery is impossible.

191
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,666
He tried chemo and
radio, but neither worked,

192
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,153
{\an8}(Chemo: Chemotherapy, Radio: Radiotherapy)

193
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,182
so he has four months at most.

194
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:05,304
I put Mr. Cho Hyun-woo's medical records
in your locker.

195
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:08,474
He's so young.
Has he talked to his family?

196
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:09,508
He has no family.

197
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:11,877
He grew up in an orphanage,

198
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:14,580
and because he was so focused on
working hard to get on his feet quickly,

199
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,448
he doesn't really have anyone he knows.

200
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:17,783
It's a shame,

201
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:20,486
but I don't think anyone will show up
in the middle of it to object.

202
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:28,627
What is it?

203
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,230
Are you bothered that he has no family?

204
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:35,768
I'm just wondering if he's giving up
too easily because he has no one.

205
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:38,337
Look at his medical records.

206
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,105
Once you see how severe his pain is,

207
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,407
I think you'll change your mind.

208
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,976
Okay, I'll look them over and let you know.

209
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:49,648
- This is your share.
- Thank you.

210
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:54,186
Thanks to this, I think I can pay off
my debts a little faster.

211
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,088
Though I still have my student loans.

212
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:59,058
Oh, and I heard
from Lee Eun-young.

213
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:00,893
Do you remember counseling her?

214
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:04,451
The 80-year-old with kidney failure
who wanted to stop her dialysis.

215
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:06,107
{\an8}(Renal Failure: The buildup of toxins in the
blood when the kidneys stop working properly.)

216
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:05,931
Yes.

217
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,099
She lost her husband a few years ago

218
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:09,335
and said she didn't
want to suffer any longer.

219
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:12,571
It's already been two months since she was
diagnosed with terminal cancer

220
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:14,473
and given three months to live.

221
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:18,611
She contacted me to say
she's perfectly ready now.

222
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:20,546
This is the last of the plum juice.

223
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,616
I was too sick to make any this year.

224
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,251
My goodness, this is so precious.

225
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:28,621
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

226
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:31,090
I kept it to serve to guests,

227
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,959
but I don't have any guests
coming to my house anymore.

228
00:15:34,793 --> 00:15:35,794
Ah.

229
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:38,264
Yes.

230
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,635
Yes.

231
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:50,242
Do you really feel
most comfortable at home

232
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,011
as your final place?

233
00:15:58,384 --> 00:15:59,952
My husband's hobby

234
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:03,422
was taking pictures of our family.

235
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:11,263
It seems your family
loved the beach.

236
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,498
Almost all the backgrounds are the sea.

237
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:15,401
It's the same sea.

238
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:19,104
There was a beach
not too far from our house.

239
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:23,709
The kids would beg to go play,
but our pockets were light.

240
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:28,247
At times like that, my husband
would take us to that beach.

241
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,916
The sea in those photos

242
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:35,487
holds all of my happiest
memories.

243
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:38,057
That's why I loved the sea so much.

244
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:41,827
If you love that sea so much,

245
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:43,896
you should depart from there.

246
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:49,535
That's true, but there might
be prying eyes there...

247
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:51,470
No, no, don't worry.

248
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,305
Don't worry about things like that.

249
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:57,843
Please, tell me what you really,
truly, truly want.

250
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:00,179
Sincerely, anything at all.

251
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,917
In my heart,

252
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,353
I want to go while living my daily life.

253
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:12,157
To live just as I always have,
and pass naturally.

254
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,293
Naturally. Then,

255
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,995
that's what you should do.

256
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:20,299
You always go for
a swim in the morning, right?

257
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:21,901
You should go there too.

258
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:23,669
And then,

259
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,704
you can go over there

260
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:27,706
and depart.

261
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,048
The preparations...

262
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:38,350
I'll take care of everything.

263
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:42,588
Would that be alright?

264
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:44,590
Of course.

265
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:57,636
The beach? It's too risky.

266
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:58,904
No.

267
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:00,906
There are no security
cameras facing the beach.

268
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:04,109
As for the ones by the shops,
I think I can find a blind spot.

269
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:07,880
It'll be early when she gets back from her
morning swim, so there'll be no one around.

270
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:31,036
My,

271
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,172
you're looking better today.

272
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,341
Are your legs feeling better?

273
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,142
Yes, much better.

274
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,411
Oh, that's good to hear.

275
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:43,349
My grandson is coming,
so I'll be leaving for today.

276
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:44,483
Go on ahead.

277
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,418
See you next Friday.

278
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,322
Take care. Look after your health.

279
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:52,258
Alright, I will.

280
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:54,393
I'm off. Bye.

281
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,496
Did you have a good swim?

282
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,231
Yes.

283
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:08,901
I said my last goodbyes to my friends.

284
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:10,569
It was nice.

285
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:23,349
I'm a very fortunate person

286
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:28,287
to decide my own end like this.

287
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,322
How many people get to do that?

288
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:35,828
Thank you for coming here.

289
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:38,097
Don't mention it.

290
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:43,435
Dr. Woo is a truly excellent physician,
but her social skills are a bit lacking.

291
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:46,505
How should I put it...
her communication skills.

292
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,140
She's not very observant.

293
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,975
There was a slight hitch
in selecting the location.

294
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,145
We were late, but I'm so glad
we found this perfect place.

295
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:54,847
I'm overjoyed.

296
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,583
If my social skills are lacking,
does that mean I'm deaf?

297
00:20:58,551 --> 00:20:59,385
You heard me?

298
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,056
Are you mentally prepared?

299
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:09,695
When you get to my age,
death isn't so frightening.

300
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,598
Over there, compared to here,

301
00:21:12,932 --> 00:21:15,367
there are more people that I know.

302
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,304
I believe

303
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:21,407
that the place where the people
I love are living

304
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,642
is heaven.

305
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:34,113
She's definitely gone.

306
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,449
I didn't lose my medical license

307
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,685
because I can't check a pulse, okay?

308
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,292
She must have met her husband by now.

309
00:22:47,193 --> 00:22:50,029
Let's get going.
People will be here soon.

310
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:51,430
Don't worry.

311
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,566
They'll think she came to the beach
and had a heart attack.

312
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:15,588
Oh, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

313
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:16,422
Whoa.

314
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,226
Wow, Daegu Jiri (clear broth soup).

315
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:21,694
If it's jiri,

316
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:25,464
I bet it's a killer (jiranda) soup, huh?

317
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:31,103
Jiri is a clear soup.

318
00:23:31,103 --> 00:23:32,338
But if you just call it "clear soup,"

319
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:34,507
doesn't it sound kind of
tasteless?

320
00:23:34,507 --> 00:23:36,442
Should we go have a bowl each
to confirm?

321
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:38,477
Did you check the Benponarbital
we used on Mr. Kang-yoon?

322
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:40,746
Oh, that.

323
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,849
I checked it, and
there was something a bit off.

324
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,051
The seal was slightly broken too.

325
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:48,954
But it won't happen again.
I took care of it.

326
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,492
Are you sure? Who's the seller?

327
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:57,196
You don't need to know.
It's more dangerous if you do.

328
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,400
I made sure this won't
happen again.

329
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,735
He won't be able to pull any tricks.

330
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:04,470
We just confirmed it a moment ago.

331
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,371
That there's nothing wrong with the drug.

332
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:08,707
Let's switch seats.
I'll drive from here.

333
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:09,775
I just told you.

334
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:12,778
In case something happens, we
need to have eaten to establish an alibi.

335
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:15,114
In case something happens,
we'll say our plans changed.

336
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:16,182
That can happen.

337
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,584
Get out, quickly.
I have to meet someone right now.

338
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:26,692
I guess that could happen.

339
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:03,529
Chief.

340
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:06,165
Assemblyman Baek is here.

341
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:07,933
He came to hear about the
progress of the investigation.

342
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:10,302
He was famous for being a mad
dog when he was a prosecutor.

343
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:13,239
Now that his own kid is dead,
he must have lost his mind.

344
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:26,652
You're here, sir.

345
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,821
We have a suspect, so why the delay?

346
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:31,423
We need concrete evidence, sir.

347
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:54,113
My Hyun-seung...

348
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,682
he could have lived for another year.

349
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,451
The clinical trials

350
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:02,521
and other treatments,
we were looking into them.

351
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,290
I know this is difficult to bear, sir,

352
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:07,026
but catching them in
the act is the best way.

353
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,896
My son...

354
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:15,901
he just left so suddenly,
without a goodbye.

355
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:18,237
This...

356
00:26:20,306 --> 00:26:21,574
is murder.

357
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:24,610
I promise you, sir.

358
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,580
We will catch the culprit
and ensure they are punished.

359
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,691
They give patients
Benponarbital and help them die?

360
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:42,895
This is a psychopath.
Damn, crazy bastards.

361
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,100
If you just wait a little longer,

362
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,903
we'll get definitive evidence
at the scene of an euthanasia

363
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,638
and we will,

364
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,207
we will definitely arrest them.

365
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:56,909
Finish the investigation within the month.

366
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,645
Or you're taking off your uniform.

367
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,881
Got it?

368
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,249
Yes, sir.

369
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:10,537
Victim, Baek Hyeon-seung

370
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:25,404
Are you alright?

371
00:27:33,646 --> 00:27:36,348
So you had him deliver
to this bench?

372
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:37,950
Yes.

373
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,951
He said he was working,

374
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:40,886
so I told him I'd have it
delivered and to come here.

375
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:46,692
What's this?

376
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:48,794
He has no family.

377
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:50,796
So that's why you were more concerned?

378
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,168
If you have no family,
it's easier to give up.

379
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,312
But it doesn't look like
he's giving up easily.

380
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:08,881
He fits all your criteria.

381
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,884
Incurable, according
to three or more doctors.

382
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:14,486
An unbearable physical disability.

383
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,422
Pain that cannot be controlled with drugs.

384
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:28,834
Wow, a man who might die soon

385
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,170
is making deliveries. Jeez.

386
00:28:50,723 --> 00:28:52,591
- Are you Cho Hyun-woo?
- Yes.

387
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:54,393
Dr. Woo?

388
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,664
- Here's your order.
- Thank you.

389
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:04,103
I saw your medical records.

390
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:06,138
It must be very difficult for you.

391
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:09,808
Excuse me,

392
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:12,478
what did Ye-na tell you about us?

393
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,047
She said you provide counseling.

394
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:18,784
That you give different advice
than ordinary people.

395
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:22,588
Through meetings like this,

396
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:25,324
we try to find out
what the patients truly want,

397
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:28,260
and we look for ways
to help them together.

398
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:31,997
I heard you provide the kind of
help one can get in Switzerland.

399
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:36,302
Well, it's not exactly "help."
We do charge a fee.

400
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:38,737
Of course, it's much more
affordable than Switzerland.

401
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:40,739
It's cheaper.

402
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:43,876
Yes. Ye-na mentioned the fee to me.

403
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:45,044
I can afford it.

404
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,046
That's why I'm working.

405
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,583
If it's about the money, it would
be better for you to quit your job.

406
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,017
I saw your brain MRI.

407
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:54,887
Soon, no painkiller will be able
to handle the pain.

408
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:56,188
It's dangerous for you to be working.

409
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:02,895
I have to pass this interview today
for you to help me, don't I?

410
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:07,399
I heard you don't help
everyone unconditionally.

411
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:11,403
I need to examine your
medical records more closely.

412
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:14,840
Don't worry about passing.

413
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,908
Yes, I've seen your file.

414
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:18,477
Your condition already more than
meets the criteria...

415
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,749
Yes, I will review it
as carefully as possible.

416
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:28,854
Whatever the result, please let me know.

417
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,624
I'm used to rejection.

418
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:38,864
I'll be going now.

419
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:52,578
I wanted to buy that for you earlier,

420
00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:53,812
but you had already paid.

421
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:55,080
So please take this instead.

422
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,415
No, it's alright.

423
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,550
It's nothing.

424
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,352
I was supposed to deliver it, but
it got damaged because I was in a hurry.

425
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,589
It should still taste the same.

426
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:07,493
This is to thank you for meeting me today.

427
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:11,730
Thank you.

428
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:29,849
Wow. A man who came saying he wants to die

429
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:31,550
gives a 'Thank you for being born' cake.

430
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,686
How ironic.

431
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:37,809
(Thank you for being born.)

432
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:46,088
Soccer Player Choi Kang-yoon.

433
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:48,391
Have you seen the news of his death?

434
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:51,427
A terminally ill patient
dying sooner than expected,

435
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:53,996
and if there's a case of death
outside a hospital,

436
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,197
I told them to contact me.

437
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:58,334
A report on this player came up.

438
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:23,259
"Serenity"

439
00:32:49,182 --> 00:32:51,994
(Cost of Euthanasia in Switzerland.)

440
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:07,637
What are you looking for?

441
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,310
Why are you at my house?

442
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,012
To go to school together.

443
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,148
And I have something I want to talk about.

444
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:24,820
That thing.

445
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:27,690
Thanks for saying it was yours.

446
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:29,458
Ah.

447
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:33,429
I said I'd hold onto it for you.

448
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:36,699
But you...

449
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,536
why did you agree to my request back then?

450
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,139
We're not even that close, really.

451
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:48,044
What about you?

452
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:52,481
Why did you ask me?

453
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:54,183
Since we're not close.

454
00:33:56,152 --> 00:33:56,986
That's because...

455
00:33:59,255 --> 00:34:01,624
I just had a feeling
you would grant my request.

456
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:03,659
It was just a feeling.

457
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:09,165
Want to come to my house after school?

458
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:11,600
If you're busy today, tomorrow's fine too.

459
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:14,670
Instead, how about we have a sleepover?

460
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,738
You've never had one?

461
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,407
I've invited friends over a few times.

462
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:20,276
It was fun just staying up
all night doing our makeup.

463
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:21,777
What do you think?

464
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:23,546
With me.

465
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:25,581
Why?

466
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:32,388
I just thought it would be fun
to stay up all night together.

467
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,065
I'll... I'll think about it.

468
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:46,068
Okay.

469
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:49,305
But what are you looking for?

470
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:51,273
Want me to help you find it?

471
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:54,110
My little sister has
a swim class with flippers.

472
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:38,254
Why do you keep drugs here?

473
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,589
Is your aunt on drugs or something?

474
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:44,427
No. My aunt doesn't do things like that.

475
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:46,562
She's a doctor.

476
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:50,066
My mom said that there are some
doctors who get hooked on drugs.

477
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,168
She's even defended
people like that.

478
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:56,038
She said they have more opportunities
since they handle drugs.

479
00:35:58,374 --> 00:36:00,609
Benponarbital.

480
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,780
Let's just put it back and find
the flippers.

481
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,349
We're going to be late.

482
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:08,117
Okay, I'll put it back.

483
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:12,321
But I'm really curious about
what kind of person your aunt is.

484
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:37,613
Found them. Your little sister's flippers.

485
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,770
I will now announce our school's
college admission results for this year.

486
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,072
We will begin with early admissions.

487
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:04,540
Please display the screen.

488
00:37:05,174 --> 00:37:07,510
Student A, with a GPA of 1.2...

489
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,445
Take a picture even if you don't need to.

490
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,947
The other mothers say Jae-yeon
is arrogant because she's a good student.

491
00:37:11,947 --> 00:37:14,250
Ah, okay.

492
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,584
I'm Woo-mi's mother.

493
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:17,553
We're next-door neighbors.
You didn't know, did you?

494
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:20,189
Oh, hello. I'm Jae-yeon's aunt.

495
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,391
It's understandable you wouldn't know.

496
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:24,627
Woo-mi is in dance and Jae-yeon is in art.

497
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:27,163
Besides, they weren't
that close before.

498
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,131
It seems they've gotten
much closer these past few days.

499
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,476
That dad must be
very curious about you.

500
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,545
Who is he?

501
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,915
His daughter is Jae-yeon's rival.

502
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:48,684
Jae-yeon is solidly
number one, with a 1.1 GPA.

503
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,319
His daughter is a 1.3.

504
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:53,189
So you can imagine how curious that dad
must be about you.

505
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:56,492
He's also the head of the
school's anti-bullying committee.

506
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:58,728
He's extremely interested
in his child's education.

507
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:00,485
I heard he's a police officer.

508
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:02,565
Guess he's not busy, since
he comes to every school event.

509
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:14,677
This is a condom
found in Jae-yeon's locker.

510
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:19,015
- That's mine.
- Pardon?

511
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:21,450
Ah.

512
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:24,453
Jae-yeon and I share
clothes sometimes, so...

513
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:26,689
Ma'am.

514
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:30,259
This was found in Jae-yeon's
school gym uniform.

515
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:35,998
But...

516
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:38,901
do you still do personal
belonging inspections these days?

517
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:39,835
No.

518
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,772
We were replacing the
lockers and it just happened.

519
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:47,343
But a condom was just found on your child,

520
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:48,544
and that's what you're curious about?

521
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,647
Well,

522
00:38:52,848 --> 00:38:56,385
if she has a boyfriend and
there's a chance of pregnancy,

523
00:38:57,987 --> 00:39:01,390
I think being prepared in advance
is the more sensible choice.

524
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:03,793
Yes.

525
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,729
Even if what you say is correct, ma'am,

526
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,365
there's no possibility of
that happening at school,

527
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:11,434
so isn't it right
that she shouldn't bring it?

528
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:12,735
Surely Jae-yeon

529
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,272
wasn't planning on doing that at school.

530
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:21,510
Yes.

531
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,913
Please explain it to her properly

532
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:26,315
so she doesn't bring it to school again.

533
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,471
- That was delicious.
- Jae-yun.

534
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:49,772
Did you have your meeting?

535
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:55,224
Yes.

536
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,313
The thing the homeroom
teacher showed you...

537
00:39:58,114 --> 00:39:58,948
That...

538
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:02,818
It isn't mine.

539
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,788
It's okay if it is yours.

540
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:08,457
I think it's better
to be prepared just in case.

541
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:11,227
- I'm serious.
- I really...

542
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:16,966
I don't need anything like that.

543
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:22,638
Liking someone is not a bad thing.

544
00:40:30,913 --> 00:40:32,048
I'm done eating.

545
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,441
Wow, he wore these
during the World Cup. Wow.

546
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,709
Yes.

547
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:21,931
Excuse me.

548
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:23,566
Good afternoon.

549
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:26,369
We're from the Bunseong Police
Agency's Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

550
00:41:28,337 --> 00:41:29,905
You're player Choi
Kang-yoon's wife, correct?

551
00:41:34,143 --> 00:41:37,013
Your husband received treatment here at
Bunseong General Hospital, didn't he?

552
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:40,249
But at the end, he was discharged
and stayed at a villa.

553
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:42,918
Was there, by any chance,
a problem with the hospital?

554
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:44,420
No.

555
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,556
Everything was fine with
the people at the hospital.

556
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,125
They were kind.

557
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,028
They were very considerate,
saying they were fans.

558
00:41:53,496 --> 00:41:54,897
He went home

559
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,600
after his illness progressed

560
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,202
and it was confirmed that treatment
was no longer possible.

561
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:03,773
My husband said he wanted to
spend his remaining time with his family,

562
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:04,807
so that's what he did.

563
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:07,243
But the hospital expected
him to live for a year,

564
00:42:07,243 --> 00:42:09,478
or at least another six months.

565
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:11,981
Didn't you find it a bit strange
that he passed away so suddenly?

566
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:17,553
If you knew how much he suffered,

567
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,625
I don't think you would
say something like that.

568
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:26,562
His funeral procession is today, isn't it?

569
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,933
Please postpone the interment
at the family burial plot for a while.

570
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,707
Your husband put in a lot of effort
to obtain euthanasia.

571
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:40,076
He used social media and email
to try and acquire the drug.

572
00:42:40,076 --> 00:42:41,577
We've confirmed all the evidence.

573
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:45,948
Especially Benponarbital.

574
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,785
This drug, famous for providing
a painless death,

575
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:51,454
he persistently tried to acquire it.

576
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:52,355
Were you aware of this?

577
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:59,161
Yes, I happened to find out
by seeing my husband's emails.

578
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:01,263
He tried,

579
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:04,333
but as far as I know, he failed.

580
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:06,302
If we were to perform an autopsy,

581
00:43:06,302 --> 00:43:09,372
we expect the results to show traces
of Benponarbital.

582
00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:11,140
Then a full-scale
investigation will begin,

583
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,575
and if the media finds out about this,

584
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:14,858
the wife, who stands to
receive a large insurance payout,

585
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:16,345
could be the first to be suspected.

586
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:19,915
I know.

587
00:43:19,915 --> 00:43:21,851
I know it wasn't you. You
have nothing to hide, right?

588
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:24,153
Let's just do an autopsy.

589
00:43:25,288 --> 00:43:27,490
Before the media starts talking about this,

590
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,893
we need to confirm where your husband
got the Benponarbital.

591
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:31,727
That...

592
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:35,264
almost sounds like a threat,
telling me to do as you say.

593
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:36,098
Jeez.

594
00:43:36,832 --> 00:43:37,767
A threat?

595
00:43:38,301 --> 00:43:39,702
I'm requesting your cooperation.

596
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,006
You know who it is, don't you?

597
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,581
She consented to the autopsy.

598
00:43:52,948 --> 00:43:54,951
They just turned the car around
on the way to the procession.

599
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:06,595
Over here!

600
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,532
The kids are all over here.

601
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:11,300
Come on.

602
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,712
- Auntie, you're here?
- Yes.

603
00:44:23,646 --> 00:44:25,081
Jae-yun, do you want to eat first?

604
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,584
What should I give you?

605
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:32,822
Here.

606
00:44:32,822 --> 00:44:34,824
Thank you for looking after the kids.

607
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:36,359
It was just a delivery.

608
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,061
If you haven't eaten, please join us.
I ordered a lot.

609
00:44:39,462 --> 00:44:40,463
Oh, okay.

610
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:50,473
Woo-mi and Jae-yeon wanted
to have a sleepover at our house today.

611
00:44:50,473 --> 00:44:51,641
You haven't given permission yet, have you?

612
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:54,410
Oh.

613
00:44:55,044 --> 00:44:56,278
Hello.

614
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,514
Can we have a sleepover tonight?

615
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,586
Please.

616
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:05,554
I've been preparing for
a performance at school,

617
00:45:05,554 --> 00:45:07,223
and I've been really stressed.

618
00:45:07,857 --> 00:45:10,860
I want to stay up all night with Jae-yeon
and gossip to let off some steam.

619
00:45:19,402 --> 00:45:21,070
Please take good care of my Jae-yeon.

620
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,838
Don't worry.

621
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:31,947
Did you hear
what my mom said earlier?

622
00:45:32,181 --> 00:45:33,549
Isn't it hilarious?

623
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,186
She thinks it's not dangerous
because there are no adult men.

624
00:45:38,721 --> 00:45:41,390
She must think just women being
together is not dangerous at all.

625
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:42,959
Right?

626
00:45:46,295 --> 00:45:47,396
So simple-minded.

627
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:50,566
She acts like she knows everything,

628
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,835
but she actually knows nothing.

629
00:45:53,636 --> 00:45:54,470
Right?

630
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:58,007
I know.

631
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:07,683
You have really beautiful eyes.

632
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:28,738
(Test Result Report)

633
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:41,784
Whatever the result,
please let me know.

634
00:46:42,251 --> 00:46:44,253
I'm used to rejection.

635
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,578
Motorcycle accident patient.

636
00:47:42,578 --> 00:47:45,281
The external trauma isn't severe, but
he's complaining of extreme pain.

637
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:47,149
He keeps saying he wants to go home
and is refusing treatment,

638
00:47:47,149 --> 00:47:48,551
so we haven't even been
able to check his vitals.

639
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,386
You're in big trouble!

640
00:47:53,656 --> 00:47:54,857
Calm down.

641
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:56,359
Cho Hyun-woo?

642
00:47:57,639 --> 00:47:59,203
Oxygen mask.

643
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,739

{\an8}(Brain Tumor: A mass of
abnormal cells growing in the brain.)

645
00:47:59,228 --> 00:48:01,030
Terminal cancer with a brain tumor.

646
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,931
Do you know this patient?

647
00:48:01,956 --> 00:48:04,466
He's a patient I saw at
the volunteer priest's clinic.

648
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:06,435
I think he used the
wrong narcotic painkiller.

649
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:09,005
I'll take over here, you can go.

650
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,219
When was the last time
you took a painkiller?

651
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:24,787
It's no use.

652
00:48:24,787 --> 00:48:26,322
No drug works on me.

653
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:28,658
Morphine? Targin? Oxycodone? What was it?

654
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:30,526
I can only help if you tell me
the type and time of dosage.

655
00:48:30,526 --> 00:48:32,128
You know my condition.

656
00:48:32,895 --> 00:48:34,997
I just took whatever I could, whenever.

657
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:40,636
We need to sedate him. Order some Ativan.

658
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,695
{\an8}(Ativan: An anti-anxiety drug.)

659
00:48:40,636 --> 00:48:41,537
Yes, I will.

660
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:50,713
I told you not to ride a motorcycle.

661
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:55,785
Has the pain gotten worse?

662
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:58,154
I think the disease has
been progressing faster lately.

663
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:01,803
Glioblastoma progresses quickly.

of cancerous tumor that begins in the brain.)

Even a single new tumor can be dangerous.

666
00:49:05,094 --> 00:49:06,495
Please just let me go.

667
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:08,764
The painkillers don't work anyway.

668
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:16,772
If you leave like this,
you'll collapse again.

669
00:49:16,772 --> 00:49:18,074
I'll prescribe you a different painkiller.

670
00:49:18,908 --> 00:49:20,276
I don't need any more painkillers.

671
00:49:20,276 --> 00:49:22,178
I have a crazy amount of them at home.

672
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:23,646
Tell me now.

673
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,848
What drug did you take?

674
00:49:48,037 --> 00:49:49,405
Contact Wanju General Hospital

675
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:52,174
and check what painkillers they prescribed

676
00:49:52,174 --> 00:49:53,142
for patient Cho Hyun-woo.

677
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:54,710
I think he was a patient there before.

678
00:49:55,044 --> 00:49:55,878
Okay.

679
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:14,330
- Where did patient Cho Hyun-woo go?
- What?

680
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:18,267
Nurse Yoo, where did
patient Cho Hyun-woo go?

681
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:22,638
What? He was sleeping
after getting a morphine shot.

682
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:19,161
Cho Hyun-woo.

683
00:51:19,562 --> 00:51:21,030
Are you alright?

684
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:22,698
Please help me.

685
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,835
I want to stop.

686
00:51:27,036 --> 00:51:28,170
Stop.

687
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:45,821
Are you alright?

688
00:51:50,117 --> 00:51:52,586
You really have to quit your job now.
It's too dangerous.

689
00:51:56,991 --> 00:52:00,361
Because of hospital bills,
I've spent all the money I've saved.

690
00:52:02,062 --> 00:52:05,165
As long as I'm alive,
I'll need money somehow.

691
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,667
That's why I'm telling you to stop.

692
00:52:10,037 --> 00:52:11,338
I'll proceed with the consultation.

693
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:15,409
Thank you.

694
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:19,346
The man you met before
will contact you.

695
00:52:20,047 --> 00:52:25,052
You can just tell him
where and how you want to depart.

696
00:52:25,886 --> 00:52:27,187
So until then,

697
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:30,791
what you truly want to do...

698
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:32,993
try doing it. Sincerely.

It's okay.

706
00:54:40,504 --> 00:54:41,941
Choi Dae-hyeon

707
00:54:58,138 --> 00:54:59,707
It's okay.

708
00:54:59,707 --> 00:55:01,108
Oh my, you did so well.
Goodness, you're so pretty.

709
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:12,421
Woo So-jeong

710
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,154
Oh my, it's okay.

711
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:16,490
It's okay.

712
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:43,520
The Drug-Related Serial Murder Case

713
00:55:47,793 --> 00:55:51,809
Woo So-jeong

714
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,570
2 Years Ago

715
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:57,931
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

716
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:00,601
God shines a light
upon our hearts.

717
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:02,670
Trust firmly in God's mercy

718
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:05,339
and truthfully confess
the sins you have committed.

719
00:56:08,142 --> 00:56:09,576
Because of me,

720
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:13,447
a patient who was receiving treatment
in pain for a long time has died.

721
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:17,484
Because of my own guilt,

722
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:21,989
I forced treatment on the patient

723
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,025
and I forced them to suffer.

724
00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:28,429
There must be a reason
for all that suffering.

725
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:30,297
Only God would know that reason.

726
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,635
And enduring that suffering
is also the fate of human beings.

727
00:56:36,704 --> 00:56:38,772
You did your best to
treat them, didn't you?

728
00:56:40,074 --> 00:56:43,344
To only increase the suffering of a
patient for whom treatment is impossible...

729
00:56:45,813 --> 00:56:47,281
can that be called treatment?

730
00:56:48,082 --> 00:56:50,017
For whom is that suffering?

731
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:53,387
I can no longer tell patients

732
00:56:54,588 --> 00:56:56,623
to endure.

733
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,393
I see.

734
00:57:00,861 --> 00:57:02,896
You believe that is your sin.

735
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:08,102
But while sins may disappear
with God's forgiveness,

736
00:57:08,102 --> 00:57:10,637
before that, you must repent.

737
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:14,008
It is important to have a heart
that will not sin again.

738
00:57:14,608 --> 00:57:16,744
Confession is the place
to make that resolution.

739
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:21,448
I didn't come here to confess.

740
00:57:24,885 --> 00:57:25,953
From now on,

741
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:31,625
I don't want to be someone who
turns away from a patient's suffering.

742
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,762
What does that mean?

743
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,098
You don't want to be
someone who turns away?

744
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:42,302
Then what choice will you make?

745
00:57:46,674 --> 00:57:48,509
I am going to leave my faith.

746
00:57:50,844 --> 00:57:51,712
Maria.

747
00:57:52,212 --> 00:57:53,814
I am not Maria anymore.

748
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:12,175
{\an8}(Special thanks to actors Son Sook, Lee Sang-yoon, Oh
Yeon-ah, and Oh Eui-sik for their special appearances.)

749
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:34,267
{\an8}If he knew his drug was being
used for such a dangerous purpose,

750
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:35,592
{\an8}he wouldn't stand for it.

751
00:58:35,592 --> 00:58:37,560
{\an8}Who is he going around
giving this to?

752
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,362
{\an8}Why are you doing this?

753
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,231
{\an8}I believe that people

754
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:43,133
{\an8}should be able to choose
between life and death.

755
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,802
{\an8}We help people spend their final moments

756
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:48,238
{\an8}in the place they want most.

757
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:49,706
{\an8}Why are you suddenly

758
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:51,274
{\an8}trying to give up
on everything so easily?

759
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:52,742
{\an8}I wanted to live.

760
00:58:52,742 --> 00:58:53,576
{\an8}But not anymore.

761
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:56,713
{\an8}It's a traffic accident patient.
Another delivery motorcycle.

762
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:57,847
{\an8}He's DOA.
