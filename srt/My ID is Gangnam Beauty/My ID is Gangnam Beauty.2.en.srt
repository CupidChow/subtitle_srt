1
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,835
Kang Mi Rae.

2
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,466
By any chance,

3
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,368
did you go to Jaryong Middle School?

4
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,606
What?

5
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,616
What should I do?

6
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,286
What should I do?

7
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,116
Forget it.

8
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:45,135
You have the same name as a girl
I used to know.

9
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:57,668
I knew it.

10
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,735
He is that Do Kyung Seok.

11
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,235
There are those blessed ones who turn any
streets into their runway.

12
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,768
The most handsome guy at
Jaryong Middle School,

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
Do Kyung Seok.

14
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,934
Even when he was just walking...

15
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,668
...or participating in
an earthquake drill,

16
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:28,968
...and even when he broke his arm.

17
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,768
The world practically revolved around him.

18
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,400
And the most legendary one of all was...

19
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,767
...Do Kyung Seok walking in the rain.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,667
Then one day, he suddenly transferred
to a different school,

21
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,634
but everyone at my school knew him.

22
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,001
But I don't know you.

23
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,001
I'll pretend I don't know you.

24
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,835
Oh, my goodness. He's grown up
into a fine, good-looking guy.

25
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,016
Do you still see my old face from
how I look now?

26
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,400
I can tell at a glance that
this girl is Soo A.

27
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,634
She must be much prettier in person.

28
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,202
He won't ask me again, right?

29
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,234
Shall I say I went to a different school?

30
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:10,767
I'll end up making a fool of myself if
someone else went to our school.

31
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,435
I must say, you're on par with her.

32
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,101
You're pretty too.

33
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,583
Hey, are you listening?

34
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,283
I'm asking you what I should do.

35
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,183
Hey, he won't recognize you.

36
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,116
Even your dad couldn't.

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,168
How on earth will Do Kyung Seok
recognize you?

38
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,334
He probably just wanted to
strike up a conversation.

39
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,701
Hey, wait.

40
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,350
What if he's interested in you?

41
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:38,168
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- By the way,

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,567
did something happen between
you and him back then?

43
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,435
How does he remember you?

44
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,101
Oh, well.

45
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,867
He was the same as everyone else.

46
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,767
Attention, please.

47
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,934
Patient Lee Hyun Joo,

48
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,417
please come to the ICU.

49
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,750
Can you tell me where Seo Yoo Jin is?

50
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,468
Okay, let me check.

51
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,667
My goodness.

52
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,717
What did he throw at you?

53
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,834
Why did he do this?

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,417
Does it hurt a lot?
Should I help you heal faster?

55
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:41,735
Yes.

56
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,301
- Here?
- No, it's here.

57
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:49,550
Yoo Jin, does it feel better now?

58
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,784
Of course.

59
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,235
Gosh, I'm so upset.

60
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,135
Hey, Kyung Seok, you're here.

61
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:59,335
Hey, can you take her home? It's too late.

62
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,734
Did you get kicked out?

63
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,701
He got kicked out?

64
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,401
Why?

65
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,268
What's he saying?

66
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:10,168
I told my dad that I'm going
to start my own business.

67
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:11,949
Do you have money to start the business?

68
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,534
What? What business?

69
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,301
A pub.

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,934
You're going to start a pub?

71
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,068
My goodness.

72
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,216
Then what about your dad's inheritance?

73
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,700
I won't be getting anything.

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,767
I'll let you drink free beer every day.

75
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,049
Yoo Jin, I wasn't just fooling
around with you.

76
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,166
I was planning on getting married to you.

77
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,550
I can't believe you're
proposing to me right now.

78
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:42,502
Stop right there. The guy should be
the one to propose.

79
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,750
But this was not what I was expecting.

80
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,517
We can't see each other anymore.

81
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,835
Ah Reum.

82
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,467
Ah Reum.

83
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:55,267
Ah Reum, wait. Please hear me out.

84
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:57,600
- Taxi.
- Ah Reum.

85
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,483
Let me go.

86
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,901
Were you dating me because
of my family's money?

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,600
You lost my trust.

88
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,784
I didn't know you were this reckless.

89
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:10,135
It's not because I'm materialistic.
It's because you're irresponsible.

90
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,801
Hey, Ah Reum.

91
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,233
You're completely fine.
Why were you lying in bed?

92
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,067
You lost...

93
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,035
...my trust.

94
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,134
How can you make a joke when
I just had my heart broken?

95
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,667
Then,

96
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,817
do you want me to help you heal faster?

97
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,602
My gosh.

98
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,201
Let's go.

99
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:49,702
Hey, Kyung Seok. Kyung Seok!

100
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,467
Wait for me.

101
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,301
She'd always tell me that she
doesn't want to go home.

102
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,735
And every morning, she'd say,

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,701
"Yoo Jin, I dreamt of you last night."

104
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,401
I can't believe I'm still so bad
with women.

105
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,901
How many more women do I need to date?

106
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:11,834
I guess I should date a bit more.

107
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,601
Isn't it too early to be thinking
about dating other women?

108
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,850
Where are we going?

109
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:19,368
To your school.

110
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:21,701
Let's go.

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,567
When did you buy this place?

112
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,433
The remodelling will begin
starting from tomorrow.

113
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,134
Hey.

114
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,333
Drink up.

115
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,667
Congratulations on entering university.

116
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:42,235
Gosh, that's bitter.

117
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,368
Are things okay with your dad?

118
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,201
Isn't he upset that you chose
to major in chemistry?

119
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:50,383
Of course, he's upset.

120
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,301
Then why did you become a chemistry major?

121
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,501
I don't know.

122
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:58,367
I chose this major because
he kept telling me not to.

123
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:04,168
Are you curious about your mom?

124
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,102
Let's not talk about the dead.

125
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:13,001
She's dead to me.

126
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:30,934
My goodness gracious.

127
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:32,901
Are you Mi Rae?

128
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,868
Gosh, stop it.

129
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,367
Hello. Have you been doing well?

130
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,517
Yes, we've been doing well.

131
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,850
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

132
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:46,916
I think Hyun Jung should get
something done as well.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,467
Stop talking nonsense.

134
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:52,683
I'll be off now. I'll see you guys later.

135
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,183
- Okay.
- See you later.

136
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,916
- Bye.
- See you.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,033
- Bye.
- Bye.

138
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:01,567
My gosh, she looks pretty
from the back as well.

139
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,368
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

140
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:09,768
She has some guts.

141
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,901
How could she get plastic surgery
done without telling her dad?

142
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:16,767
You better not do anything behind my back.

143
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:25,502
It's too loud.

144
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,901
Who attends entrance
ceremonies these days?

145
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,483
If I take photos with Kyung Seok,

146
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,401
people will comment on
how different we look.

147
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,068
My gosh, what was that? My goodness.

148
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,435
I'd like to report an accident.

149
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,884
No, I'm fine.

150
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,936
But I'm not sure about the
people inside the car.

151
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,617
Please make it quick.

152
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,602
I can't afford to be
late to my deliveries.

153
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,869
There's no need for that.
You must've been surprised.

154
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,266
- Pardon?
- You can just go.

155
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,268
But still...

156
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,034
- It's okay.
- "Tell people how nice I am."

157
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,717
- You're working this hard.
- "Take a good look at my face."

158
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:17,101
- I don't want to get paid for this.
- "I'm Congressman Do Sang Won."

159
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,500
Thank you.

160
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,467
Keep working hard.

161
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,934
- Thank you.
- No problem.

162
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:29,201
Nice shot.

163
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:31,901
Let's go.

164
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,735
I'm near your school. I'm almost there.

165
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,702
Mom, when did Dad receive
his medical checkup?

166
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,517
How's his blood pressure? Is it normal?

167
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:01,701
Don't worry. Where are you?

168
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,267
What are you talking about?

169
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,635
What do you mean you can't find Dad?

170
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:18,535
Excuse me, are you a student here?

171
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:20,668
Pardon?

172
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,233
I'm here for my daughter's
entrance ceremony.

173
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:27,150
Is there a nice restaurant nearby?

174
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:28,801
A place where girls like to go.

175
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,401
Wait a minute.

176
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:40,134
You're the girl I talked to last time.

177
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,968
Right?

178
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,850
I'm Mi Rae's dad. She majors in chemistry.

179
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:49,301
We talked on the phone because
you answered Mi Rae's phone.

180
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,734
Yes.

181
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:54,850
That was me.

182
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:58,134
See? I knew it. Yes, I
remember your voice now.

183
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:02,468
I was so surprised because you
sound just like my daughter.

184
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:05,935
What a coincidence.

185
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:20,400
Dad.

186
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,934
Dad, I'm Mi Rae.

187
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:27,835
What?

188
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,601
Dad, I'm... I'm Mi Rae.

189
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,500
It's me, Mi Rae.

190
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,702
I'm your daughter, Mi Rae.

191
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:49,035
What... What...

192
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,734
Dad.

193
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,734
Mi... Mi Rae...

194
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:01,568
I'm sorry Dad.

195
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,200
I had to keep it a secret
because you were so against it.

196
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,967
Honey. Sweetheart.

197
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,116
Dad.

198
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,434
Honey. Honey.

199
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,668
Honey.

200
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,333
Dad.

201
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,934
Dad.

202
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,601
Dad.

203
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,102
Dad.

204
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,101
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,701
I don't know you, miss.

206
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,283
Nice. That looks great, Mr. Congressman.

207
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,517
I'll take a picture now, then. 1, 2, 3.

208
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,083
Great. Kyung Hee, stand a little closer.

209
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,901
All right, 1 more shot. 1, 2, 3!

210
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,683
Oh, my. You look dashing, sir.
I really mean it.

211
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:45,167
Yes. Kyung Hee, stand in the middle.

212
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,367
Here we go. 1, 2...

213
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,001
Hello?

214
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,402
Yes, hold on.

215
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,233
She's been appointed as
the CEO of Kelun Korea.

216
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,401
Let's talk about it another time.

217
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,134
Can you at least gain some weight?

218
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,417
My dear son, we have to
take a photo together.

219
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:17,302
- Look at the camera.
- I love you.

220
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
All right, I'll take another photo.

221
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,383
My, I can't get over how dashing
you look, sir. I really mean it.

222
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,101
All right. Oh, it was my face. There.

223
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,801
Don't worry.

224
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,569
I'll have a talk with
your dad when I get home.

225
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,233
Okay?

226
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:58,268
Hurry up!

227
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:00,701
- Hurry. Come on!
- My goodness.

228
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:03,300
Why? What is going on?

229
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,601
Mi Rae, you're here too.

230
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,116
Ta-da.

231
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,049
Whose camera is it? Did you buy it?

232
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,734
No, I borrowed it.

233
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,233
I thought we should take some photos
together now that I own this taxi.

234
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,500
I no longer have to share
it with other drivers,

235
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:21,101
so I want to hang a photo
of Mi Rae inside my taxi.

236
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,668
Mi Rae, come stand here.

237
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,902
I'll take a pretty photo of you.

238
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,601
Dad.

239
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,201
Can you not take a photo of me?

240
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,550
I want to hang your photo inside my taxi.

241
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:39,568
Seeing your face will keep me
energized throughout the day.

242
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,334
It's my wish.

243
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:48,034
All right, then.

244
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,049
- Come on.
- Come stand here.

245
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,233
Not there. You should stand right here.

246
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
- We're ready!
- Here we go.

247
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,701
Honey, get out of the frame. Come on.

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,367
I'll take a photo of Mi Rae first.

249
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,784
All right. Mi Rae, smile.

250
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:07,316
- Give me a pretty smile.
- Smile.

251
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,901
1, 2, 3.

252
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,901
All right. One more time.

253
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:17,401
Okay, here we go. 1, 2, 3.

254
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,983
I have a craving for it.

255
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:43,467
What about you?

256
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,168
Isn't that Mi Rae?

257
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:49,134
- Hello.
- Hi.

258
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,350
Are you two in this class too?

259
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:52,583
- You too?
- Yes.

260
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,535
That's great. Let's sit together.

261
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,617
We studied so hard to get into university,

262
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,035
and we now have to study more.

263
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:02,016
Are we writing up reports now?

264
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,001
I didn't know when I was
registering for my courses,

265
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,634
but it really hit me on the
day of my first class.

266
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,668
Mi Rae! Hi.

267
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:14,949
- Mi Rae is here.
- Mi Rae.

268
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:18,001
- Hi, Mi Rae.
- Hi.

269
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:21,717
- Hi.
- New face, new, new, new face

270
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,502
- Soo A!
- Soo A!

271
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:24,817
- Hyun Soo A is here.
- Hi.

272
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,368
- Hi.
- Hi.

273
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:27,550
Hello.

274
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,435
Hi. Hi, Mi Rae.

275
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:32,001
- Hi, Soo A.
- How have you been?

276
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,401
- Good.
- I'll see you later.

277
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:37,701
- Jung Hyun.
- Hey, you.

278
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,168
She's already like a celebrity
within our department.

279
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,216
I know, right?

280
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,183
Soo A is making my life difficult.

281
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,983
Why do guys keep asking me
to set them up with her?

282
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:47,301
Mi Rae.

283
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:51,268
Hello.

284
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:54,350
Sit here. I saved this seat for you.

285
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,668
Pardon me?

286
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,150
Are you taking General Chemistry too?

287
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,634
No, I got an A in this
class in my first year.

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,634
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

289
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,383
Then what are you doing here?

290
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,934
What do you think? I came to see you.

291
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,034
What on earth is he doing here?

292
00:19:32,434 --> 00:19:33,650
Does he have to retake this class?

293
00:19:33,734 --> 00:19:36,517
It looks like he's
trying to hit on Mi Rae.

294
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:38,316
Right, when Mi Rae walked in earlier,

295
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,767
I could see how much she stands out.

296
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,534
Really?

297
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:45,834
But as soon as Soo A walked in...

298
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,501
What? Did you call me?

299
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,901
No, no. I didn't call you.

300
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:54,068
I'm such an idiot.

301
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,283
I wanted to call you after the
orientation, but I realized...

302
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,034
...that I never even asked your number.

303
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:00,868
I see.

304
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,868
Has everything been well with you?
Did the entrance ceremony go well?

305
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:06,283
- Yes.
- If there's anything...

306
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,667
...you don't understand during
class, feel free to ask me.

307
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,167
I got an A in General
Chemistry in my first year.

308
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,734
Also, I have all the exam
notes for this class.

309
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:18,101
The questions on this professor's
exam are the same every year.

310
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,850
Do you know what I mean by "exam notes"?

311
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:22,049
It seems like you can only see Mi Rae.

312
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,617
We'll need the exam notes too.

313
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,450
Figure it our yourself.

314
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:28,001
Mi Rae and I have a special relationship.

315
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,150
- Me?
- We drank with our arms crossed.

316
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:31,468
didn't we?

317
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,700
Oh, shall we have lunch
together at the cafeteria?

318
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:40,283
- Sorry?
- Today's menu looks amazing.

319
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:42,134
Girls, you'd better not follow us.

320
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,268
Mi Rae, let's sit over there.

321
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:08,335
This is on me, so eat everything you want.

322
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,034
Thank you.

323
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:17,201
How is it? The food at our
cafeteria is quite good.

324
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:19,534
- Yes, it's good.
- Good.

325
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,102
By the way, about that question...

326
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,469
I asked you if I can like you.

327
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,768
I think you've had enough time to ponder.

328
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,535
Should we not talk about it at school?

329
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,435
Shall we go to a nice bar
in the evening, then?

330
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,150
Do you want some water?

331
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,916
No, it's okay. I'll use
the restroom quickly.

332
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
All right.

333
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:57,802
Gosh, why is she acting all naive?

334
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:04,936
Hello, Chan Woo.

335
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:06,434
Soo A.

336
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,801
You're in the same General
Chemistry class with us, right?

337
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:16,602
Oh, I'm not actually in the class.
I just stopped by to see you guys.

338
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:21,401
I was wondering why you were
retaking a first-year course.

339
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:23,068
Oh, were you curious?

340
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,901
- Have a seat. We can chat.
- Sure.

341
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,750
Isn't somebody else sitting here?

342
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,417
It's Mi Rae, but she went to the restroom.

343
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:37,701
I see.

344
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,683
Chan Woo, you like Mi Rae, don't you?

345
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,867
Well, I think all of
you guys are adorable.

346
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:47,750
That includes you.

347
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:51,201
Just talk casually to me. You
don't need to be so polite.

348
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:56,602
I think you and Mi Rae
will make a cute couple.

349
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:00,601
Well, we're not there yet.

350
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:03,602
I'll be cheering for you.

351
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,468
Although I'm a little sad.

352
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,068
What do you mean?

353
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:13,517
Nothing. Never mind. I
should get going now.

354
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,968
Hey, wait.

355
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,717
What did you mean by that?
Why are you sad?

356
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,016
Well...

357
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,367
Oh, sorry.

358
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:26,967
I can sit here, right?

359
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:31,368
Hey, how could you ignore all
of my messages for three days?

360
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,750
- I guess you've been busy.
- I don't check my phone often.

361
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,802
Goodness, that's why you
don't have a girlfriend.

362
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,601
What did you mean by that?

363
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,834
To tell you the truth,

364
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,901
I was quite smitten by you
at the freshmen orientation.

365
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,067
What? Me?

366
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,417
Don't take it too seriously though.

367
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:53,983
I'm over you now,

368
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,467
so you don't need to care too much. Okay?

369
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,001
No, wait.

370
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:06,634
Gosh.

371
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:08,668
I can't believe...

372
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,500
I'm sorry.

373
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:18,434
I just want to think of you as my senior.

374
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,434
Yes.

375
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:25,368
I just want to think of you as my senior.

376
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:27,635
I just want to think of you...

377
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,669
I just want to think
of you as my senior...

378
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:35,250
Chan Woo.

379
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:38,916
Hey, Mi Rae. Let's just be friends.

380
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,601
- Okay?
- Pardon?

381
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:44,768
What I said to you was a mistake.

382
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,916
I think I was confused. I
actually like someone else.

383
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,784
I'm sorry for making things complicated.

384
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:53,817
I'm sorry. You understand
what I'm saying, right?

385
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:57,550
I'm sorry if you took it seriously.
Is everything okay?

386
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,034
You can finish your meal.

387
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,968
What's he doing?

388
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:17,368
Sorry, my mistake.

389
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,868
Is it you again, you jerk?

390
00:25:22,734 --> 00:25:24,201
What did you just say?

391
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,001
"Mistake"?

392
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,234
Do you want to die?

393
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,835
My gosh.

394
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:34,868
This is a mistake as well.

395
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:41,035
You must want to die.

396
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,750
I'm done eating.

397
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,601
You must be crazy for a beating. Hey!

398
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:52,216
- What's wrong with him?
- My gosh.

399
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,083
- My goodness.
- What's going on?

400
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,901
You little jerk.

401
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,734
I'm going to kill you.

402
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,550
Chan Woo.

403
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:03,817
What are you doing? Move!
Are you taking his side?

404
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:05,168
Move!

405
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:35,450
Chan Woo, what are you doing?

406
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:36,784
Let go of me!

407
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:38,316
Everyone's staring.

408
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,067
- What's his problem?
- My gosh.

409
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,750
- Why is he causing a mess?
- Let's go.

410
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,768
- Why is he always causing trouble?
- Let me go.

411
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:46,916
You better consider yourself lucky.

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,567
I'm going to kill you the
next time I see you. Okay?

413
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,283
Why is he always causing trouble?

414
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,583
- My gosh.
- What's his problem?

415
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,134
What a joke.

416
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:56,168
Isn't he the jerk from the
chemistry department?

417
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,517
- What was that?
- Oh, gosh.

418
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,517
Why did they fight?

419
00:26:58,601 --> 00:26:59,801
Are you okay?

420
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:03,801
What was that all about?

421
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:05,467
My gosh.

422
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,701
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

423
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,467
They were fighting like crazy.

424
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,934
Do you know what Chan Woo's nickname is?

425
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,934
It's SOJ. It stands for son of a jerk.

426
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,800
You need to be careful of guys like him.

427
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:49,001
Soo A, you better watch out as well.

428
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,034
Okay.

429
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:55,268
What? Oh, okay.

430
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:57,567
Oh, well...

431
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,350
What do you think about having
chicken and beer after class?

432
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:02,701
Are you up for it?

433
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:08,084
Well, I'm up for it...

434
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:09,805
if Soo A is.

435
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,010
My gosh.

436
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,871
Sorry, my mistake.

437
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:24,937
How cute.

438
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,304
What?

439
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,659
She thinks you're cute.

440
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:38,447
Soo A, there you are.

441
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:40,932
- Hello.
- Hi.

442
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,297
Can we talk outside in private?

443
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:47,453
Sure.

444
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:49,104
I'll wait for you outside.

445
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:03,553
What I'm about to tell you comes
from the bottom of my heart.

446
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:05,071
So please hear me out.

447
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,792
- Okay.
- Right.

448
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,705
Guys always have their own
ideal type of girl in mind.

449
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,004
The same goes for me.

450
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:16,604
When I first saw you,

451
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:19,205
my heart almost dropped to the ground.

452
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:21,390
I'll be straightforward with you.

453
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:23,171
You're my ideal type of girl.

454
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,586
To be honest, you're the only person...

455
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:28,269
...I was interested in ever since
the freshmen welcoming party.

456
00:29:28,604 --> 00:29:30,338
You might not believe me,

457
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:35,382
but I tend to get really shy
around the person I like.

458
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,689
But now that I know you
feel the same way about me,

459
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,984
I was wondering if you'd like
to start going out with me.

460
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:45,972
Then, what about Mi Rae?

461
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,211
I was only nice to her
because she was in my team,

462
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:51,504
and she participated
actively in the talent show.

463
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,091
You were the only girl I liked.

464
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:56,695
Soo A.

465
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,669
I'm really grateful that
you think of me that way.

466
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:04,569
Okay.

467
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,873
But can you give me some
time to think about it?

468
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:11,071
Yes, of course. You should think about it.

469
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,179
Although it won't be a problem
since we both like each other.

470
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,804
Anyway, well...

471
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:21,004
I'll wait for your call.

472
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,789
Bye.

473
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:29,795
Soo A.

474
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,804
Did anything happen?

475
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,390
What? What do you mean?

476
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:40,705
Is Chan Woo showing interest in you?

477
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:43,104
No.

478
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,271
He just said what all the
other seniors said to me.

479
00:30:46,473 --> 00:30:49,381
He told me to let him
know if I need any help.

480
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:51,472
Who else said that to you?

481
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,219
Jung Hwan? Jin Wook?

482
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,404
I can't believe he made a fool out of me.

483
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,405
Do I still seem like a joke to everyone?

484
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:07,899
Remember when I asked you...

485
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:10,386
if it'd be okay for me to like you?

486
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,386
Chan Woo.

487
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,687
Hey, Mi Rae.

488
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:16,538
What I said to you was a mistake.

489
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:20,738
I think I was confused. I
actually like someone else.

490
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:49,771
Are you okay?

491
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,670
Are you okay?

492
00:32:01,984 --> 00:32:03,718
I was looking for you
because I was worried.

493
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,404
I heard Chan Woo and Kyung Seok
had a fight at the cafeteria.

494
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,971
I heard Chan Woo even pushed you.

495
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:14,987
Did you get hurt?

496
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:17,271
No.

497
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,347
What happened?

498
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:24,249
I thought things were going
well between you and Chan Woo.

499
00:32:28,353 --> 00:32:29,969
What's going on?

500
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:32,437
I don't know.

501
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:35,548
He asked me if he could like me,
but then he said it was a mistake.

502
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:40,425
Is that why Kyung Seok got
mad and fought with him?

503
00:32:40,646 --> 00:32:44,547
No, they fought because Kyung
Seok made Chan Woo trip.

504
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,731
I see.

505
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,035
Do you...

506
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:54,239
...have a crush on Chan Woo?

507
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,340
No.

508
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:58,610
Not at all.

509
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,613
I'm so relieved that he doesn't
actually have feelings for me.

510
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,979
Yes, don't let it bother you.

511
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:06,284
Have you heard?

512
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,913
Chan Woo's nickname is SOJ.

513
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,480
Son of Jerk.

514
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,491
He really should behave
himself as our senior.

515
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:14,481
Why does he have to bother freshmen?

516
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:16,080
He's so annoying.

517
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,300
Just forget about it.
Don't take it to heart.

518
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,935
You have me, you know.

519
00:33:24,412 --> 00:33:27,205
I have you?

520
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:29,813
We'll be late for our class. Let's go.

521
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:32,646
Okay.

522
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:37,190
If he bothers my friend again,
I'll teach him a serious lesson.

523
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:38,984
"My friend"?

524
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,386
Friends must help each other.
Aren't I right?

525
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,589
Yes, thanks.

526
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,380
You just smiled. Do you feel better now?

527
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,980
She's an angel.

528
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,881
Yes, I'm totally fine now.

529
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:04,113
Hello, I'm Yeon Woo Young. I'll be
helping you with your experiments.

530
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:12,013
First, I'll explain how the
experiments will work.

531
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,021
After that, you'll split up into teams.

532
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:18,247
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

533
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:22,046
You'll do all experiments in teams.

534
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:25,046
Each team will consist of 5 to 6 students.

535
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:28,113
You'll be graded as teams, so
please help each other out.

536
00:34:28,646 --> 00:34:30,061
Now, let's split you guys into teams.

537
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:31,662
Come on out. We'll do a random draw.

538
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:32,746
It's going to be hard.

539
00:34:32,852 --> 00:34:34,962
I can't believe we have to do
team experiments in this class.

540
00:34:35,046 --> 00:34:37,179
Gosh, I really hope I can
team up with someone I know.

541
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:38,929
Somebody I know. My goodness.

542
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,262
- I heard this class is hard.
- Somebody I know.

543
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:44,147
Someone I know, please.

544
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:47,513
(Team 3)

545
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:51,914
Mi Rae, are you in Team One?

546
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:53,980
No, Team Three.

547
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:55,612
Won Ho, are you in Team Three?

548
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,996
I was so worried. Thank goodness
one teammate is someone I know.

549
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,347
Gosh, you idiot.

550
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:05,046
I hope there's a pretty girl in our team.

551
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,347
Hey, Won Ho. Are both of you in this team?

552
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:11,713
- What are you doing here?
- What?

553
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,513
I was hoping a pretty girl
would join us. Why you?

554
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,695
- Are you dumb?
- Whatever, Ji Hyo.

555
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:19,480
You're the type to go off the grid
when we have a group assignment.

556
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,128
Gosh, you little... Shall
I teach you a lesson?

557
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:23,879
Please don't. I want to live.

558
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:29,013
I bet Won Ho will enlist in the army
after getting dumped by a girl.

559
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,188
You'll be a total outcast when you
join the military, you idiot.

560
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:35,188
- Totally.
- Okay.

561
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:39,079
- Are you in Team Three too?
- Yes.

562
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:40,579
Me too.

563
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,390
We're in the same team, then.

564
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,090
- Really?
- Yes.

565
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:48,795
Is Soo A the last one to join our team?

566
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:50,079
Is this Team Three?

567
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:55,962
This is amazing.

568
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:58,446
All the celebrities of the
first year are in our team.

569
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,017
- "Celebrities"?
- Yes.

570
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:02,533
You and Do Kyung Seok are
very famous, you know.

571
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,713
So is Mi Rae.

572
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:12,157
It'll be each team leader's duty
to guide the team members...

573
00:36:12,242 --> 00:36:14,375
and make sure to submit
the reports on time.

574
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:17,646
What should we do? Are
there any volunteers?

575
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:22,479
How about Mi Rae?

576
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,180
Me?

577
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:27,613
She seems very mature, so I think
she'll be a great team leader.

578
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:31,146
I'm not sure.

579
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:32,913
I'll just do it.

580
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,846
Then I'll be our note taker.

581
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:44,280
Do we need a manager?

582
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,913
It's that girl, the celebrity
of Hankook University.

583
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:54,713
She's really pretty.

584
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,447
She's already so famous.

585
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,779
Even guys at other schools are
asking me about Hyun Soo A.

586
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:01,113
- Hyun Soo A?
- Yes.

587
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:04,813
I see.

588
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:21,279
I like soda too.

589
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,597
What are you good-looking
people doing here?

590
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:27,008
Are you two dating already?

591
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,595
Please stop. Kyung Seok hates
hearing things like that.

592
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,190
Soo A, what guy wouldn't want to date you?

593
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,654
Can you give me that?

594
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,579
Buy one with your money.

595
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:49,079
I was just kidding.

596
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:54,272
They're just standing, and yet it
looks like a scene from a movie.

597
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:56,474
They're making our school
look like a film set.

598
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:59,946
It'll be crazy if they
actually date, right?

599
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:01,880
Yes, totally.

600
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:06,879
- Thanks for this.
- Mi Rae.

601
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:14,880
Let's have a quick talk.

602
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:21,980
What's going on? A secret chat
between just the two of you?

603
00:38:22,446 --> 00:38:24,380
We don't have any secrets.

604
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:26,046
Go on.

605
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:28,612
Okay.

606
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:34,580
What's going on? What could it be about?

607
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,113
I'm not sure.

608
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:41,613
- This is yours, right?
- Yes.

609
00:38:42,746 --> 00:38:45,714
- It was on the cafeteria floor.
- I see.

610
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:51,046
- What?
- Are you really not Kang Mi Rae...

611
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:52,345
...from Jaryong Middle School?

612
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,201
The bus stop.

613
00:38:57,813 --> 00:38:59,113
Pomelo.

614
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,546
Don't tell anyone.

615
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:14,213
- About what?
- What I used to look like.

616
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:18,247
Keep it to yourself.

617
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:25,523
Kyung Seok.

618
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:27,746
Do Kyung Seok.

619
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:30,746
See you.

620
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,890
Hey.

621
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:53,895
Are you wearing perfume?

622
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,214
(Kang Mi Rae)

623
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,500
Yes. Am I not even
allowed to wear perfume?

624
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:34,975
Will my undergraduate years end
up turning into another disaster?

625
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:39,247
Pomelo.

626
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:44,676
By the way, how does he
remember my perfume?

627
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,981
There will be a fresh week party here.

628
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,913
For your department.

629
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,879
I have so much to do.

630
00:41:08,714 --> 00:41:09,914
Help me put this up.

631
00:41:10,906 --> 00:41:13,618
Come on. I haven't found a part-timer yet.

632
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:18,001
Kyung Seok, please?

633
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:23,040
Kyung Seok, help me with this.

634
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,713
I must say, you're such a nice guy.

635
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:32,123
Shut it.

636
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:34,625
Although you're very rude to me.

637
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:37,528
I mean, you're nice. So nice.

638
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:43,401
By the way, who's that girl?

639
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:47,105
No way. Are you interested in girls now?

640
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,342
Or was she hitting on you? Tell me.

641
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,546
Don't tell anyone.

642
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:57,946
What I used to look like.

643
00:42:00,446 --> 00:42:02,020
Keep it to yourself.

644
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:07,512
- Are you an idiot or what?
- Hey.

645
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:09,823
That totally startled me. How could you...

646
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:11,823
You're not nice at all.

647
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:13,931
I take back what I said earlier.

648
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,804
Shall I...

649
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,041
...just not go to the fresh week party?

650
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:27,712
Don't you worry. He doesn't
even care about you.

651
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,281
I mean, don't you know him?

652
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,218
But still, I'll be so uncomfortable.

653
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:37,021
Hey.

654
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,524
It's not like you spent...

655
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:42,114
...all that money and risked your
life to get the plastic surgery...

656
00:42:42,412 --> 00:42:44,429
...just so that you can
keep avoiding people.

657
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:49,934
Right.

658
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:51,512
Or...

659
00:42:52,046 --> 00:42:54,313
should I go ask him for
a favour in person?

660
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:56,641
How about you get close with him...

661
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:58,509
...and make him on our side?

662
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,515
It'll be more of a hassle
if things go worse.

663
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,746
Let's wait and see for now.

664
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,655
It's because you're anxious.

665
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,958
Still,

666
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,861
I have a friend in my department...

667
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:20,079
...who'll take my side if
something happens to me.

668
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,980
Who is that?

669
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:24,969
Hyun Soo A.

670
00:43:28,212 --> 00:43:30,046
Have you become close with her?

671
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:32,047
Yes.

672
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:51,361
I'm telling you, he's interested in you.

673
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,462
No way.

674
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:54,567
This is really frustrating.

675
00:43:54,672 --> 00:43:57,542
I know. He should've returned the
perfume to you when we were there.

676
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,140
Why did he call you outside?

677
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:01,739
That's really not it.

678
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:15,253
I think this place is so
nice, don't you agree?

679
00:44:20,051 --> 00:44:21,259
Mi Rae.

680
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:23,561
- Hi.
- Hi, Mi Rae.

681
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,163
- Hello.
- Why are you late?

682
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:26,464
Hi.

683
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:29,262
What is Kyung Seok doing over there?

684
00:44:29,346 --> 00:44:32,080
The owner here is his close friend.

685
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,372
- Is that right?
- Hello.

686
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:35,979
- Hello.
- Hello.

687
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:37,844
This is on the house.

688
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:41,213
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

689
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:45,562
Welcome to the start of
the fresh week party!

690
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:47,480
- Hello.
- Welcome.

691
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:50,746
- Hi.
- Hello.

692
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:52,680
- What's up?
- Hey.

693
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:57,996
I care more about face than body figure.

694
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:01,226
It's a no for me if she's ugly no
matter how nice her figure is.

695
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:03,652
Face can be fixed.

696
00:45:03,746 --> 00:45:05,171
Whatever. Soo A.

697
00:45:05,256 --> 00:45:08,266
What do you care the most
when it comes to men?

698
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,779
Well...

699
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:14,579
I think personality matters the most.

700
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:20,590
- Great.
- What are you doing? Sit down.

701
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:22,795
- What's that?
- All right.

702
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:25,480
All the seniors are gathered around Soo A.

703
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:30,299
How about we play the image game?

704
00:45:30,384 --> 00:45:31,300
Sure, that sounds fun.

705
00:45:31,385 --> 00:45:33,301
Let's play the image game.

706
00:45:33,386 --> 00:45:34,987
- I'll go first. Let's go this way.
- Okay.

707
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:38,846
I'll start with a weak question.

708
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:43,413
Who do you think was most
delinquent in high school?

709
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:45,446
1, 2, 3.

710
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,747
Mi Rae has got all the votes.

711
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,313
It's not true though.

712
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:51,579
Bottoms up!

713
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,061
- Good.
- It's my turn.

714
00:45:55,145 --> 00:45:58,095
Who do you think dated the most among us?

715
00:45:58,179 --> 00:45:59,746
1, 2, 3.

716
00:46:01,932 --> 00:46:03,047
It's me again?

717
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:05,638
- I've never dated anyone.
- Alcohol is drinking me

718
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:07,440
- I am drinking alcohol
- I am drinking alcohol

719
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:08,845
- Kang!
- Kang!

720
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,164
- Mi!
- Mi!

721
00:46:10,356 --> 00:46:11,656
- Rae!
- Rae!

722
00:46:11,744 --> 00:46:13,245
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

723
00:46:14,835 --> 00:46:18,513
She's so cool. Mi Rae's good at drinking.

724
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:20,262
It's your turn.

725
00:46:20,346 --> 00:46:21,780
Oh, right.

726
00:46:22,956 --> 00:46:24,471
- What should I do?
- Gosh.

727
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:25,856
Hold on.

728
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:29,046
Are you okay?

729
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:30,559
Yes.

730
00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:34,025
Well, I don't know.

731
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,127
Oh, okay.

732
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:39,530
Who do you think kissed
the earliest among us?

733
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,161
You mean, kiss? Not a peck?

734
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:44,046
Kiss. 1, 2, 3.

735
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:47,362
Kyung Seok, it's you.

736
00:46:47,446 --> 00:46:49,947
Wait, hold on. Raise your
hands if you voted for him.

737
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,543
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

738
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,644
Raise your hands if you voted for Mi Rae.

739
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,161
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

740
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,962
It's half and half. Why don't
we do a couple drinking?

741
00:46:57,046 --> 00:46:58,549
- Will do.
- Will do.

742
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:02,153
- Couple drinking.
- Couple drinking.

743
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:04,546
- Couple drinking.
- We'll just drink separately.

744
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:07,613
Right, Mi Rae is drinking
three times in a row already.

745
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,627
I'll drink two shots then.

746
00:47:13,823 --> 00:47:16,206
He's really good at drinking.

747
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,325
Oh, Do Kyung Seok.

748
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:18,402
Give me that.

749
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,503
What?

750
00:47:23,013 --> 00:47:24,028
Thank you.

751
00:47:24,112 --> 00:47:26,779
Shouldn't he make a wish for this favour?

752
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:31,328
I think they really have something.

753
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:32,646
I guess so.

754
00:47:35,913 --> 00:47:37,247
He's cool.

755
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:40,645
It's my turn now, right?

756
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:42,228
All right.

757
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:45,979
Who do you think got the most
professions from the opposite sex?

758
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:49,345
1, 2, 3.

759
00:47:51,312 --> 00:47:52,862
Me?

760
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:55,395
No, that never happened for me.

761
00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:57,729
Come on. It's the image
game, not truth or dare.

762
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:59,013
Drink it.

763
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,529
- Drink!
- Drink it.

764
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:05,680
I drank a lot already though.

765
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:10,879
- Drink.
- Drink it.

766
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:13,762
Goodness.

767
00:48:13,846 --> 00:48:16,146
Is he out of his mind?

768
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:18,780
Are you really going to do it?

769
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:24,713
Soo A, can you stand up for a second?

770
00:48:26,746 --> 00:48:27,980
Why?

771
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,213
(Frosh Week Party for
Chemistry Department)

772
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,780
Actually,

773
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:41,080
I wasn't thinking of expressing
my feelings for you this soon.

774
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,314
But there were just too
many guys going for you,

775
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:46,880
so I thought I should
make you mine quickly.

776
00:48:48,379 --> 00:48:49,695
It's crazy.

777
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:52,313
- Goodness.
- It's too corny.

778
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:55,779
I like you.

779
00:48:56,412 --> 00:48:57,812
Let's go out, Soo A.

780
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:03,913
What a man.

781
00:49:06,913 --> 00:49:08,147
Great.

782
00:49:12,245 --> 00:49:13,445
I...

783
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,070
I never imagined you'd
think of me this way.

784
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:21,985
But I don't think I'm ready...

785
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:24,570
...to go out with someone yet.

786
00:49:26,203 --> 00:49:27,403
I'm sorry.

787
00:49:30,603 --> 00:49:31,903
Still,

788
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,586
we're good friends to each other.

789
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,904
We'll stay the same,

790
00:49:37,736 --> 00:49:39,036
right?

791
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:43,737
Of course, we're all friends.

792
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:46,236
Right?

793
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:47,586
Let's go take some fresh air.

794
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:51,486
Gosh, that idiot doesn't
know whom she likes.

795
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,037
- Hope you become closer.
- Be friends.

796
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:55,704
Goodness.

797
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:04,836
Are you having fun?

798
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,402
- Hello.
- Hello.

799
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:21,570
Face the reality.

800
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,704
I told you not to do it.

801
00:50:24,102 --> 00:50:26,719
You think it makes sense
to profess to a girl...

802
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:29,404
...without giving her any
gift in such a generation?

803
00:50:29,636 --> 00:50:32,652
Or prepare some balloons and flowers...

804
00:50:32,736 --> 00:50:34,085
...and try again.

805
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:36,202
I'll help you out.

806
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:41,586
Do you remember my name?

807
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,052
Of course, I remember it...

808
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:46,070
because your voice sounded nice
when you introduced yourself.

809
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:48,018
How about we have fried chicken
with beer after class?

810
00:50:48,102 --> 00:50:49,336
What do you say?

811
00:50:50,136 --> 00:50:53,004
If Soo A goes,

812
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:54,803
I'll go too.

813
00:50:57,002 --> 00:50:58,269
He's cute.

814
00:51:00,536 --> 00:51:01,736
What?

815
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:04,269
You cute boy.

816
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:08,503
Okay?

817
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:14,204
Okay.

818
00:51:15,002 --> 00:51:16,503
"Okay."

819
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,052
It'll be awesome if they
become a campus couple.

820
00:51:22,136 --> 00:51:23,370
Right?

821
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:24,870
I guess so.

822
00:51:26,703 --> 00:51:28,703
It was a joke.

823
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:34,070
Thanks for the drink.

824
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,603
Kyung Seok, that...

825
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:49,786
Soo A, you must be surprised a lot.

826
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:52,604
There are those strong-headed punks.

827
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:55,336
If it's uncomfortable, you may go first.
I'll take you home.

828
00:51:55,803 --> 00:51:58,103
No, I'm all right.

829
00:51:58,436 --> 00:51:59,636
Really?

830
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:04,203
How dare he try to hit on you, seriously?

831
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:06,536
I can't believe it.

832
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:10,386
Then again, being pretty
is a headache indeed.

833
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:11,704
I know.

834
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:15,219
Soo A's face looks like
it has been sculpted.

835
00:52:15,303 --> 00:52:18,436
What? I didn't do any
plastic surgery though.

836
00:52:21,736 --> 00:52:24,003
Mi Rae is pretty like a doll.

837
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:26,636
Her face and body figure.

838
00:52:31,002 --> 00:52:31,918
Right.

839
00:52:32,002 --> 00:52:34,169
- Mi Rae's pretty.
- That's right.

840
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,438
Mi Rae didn't do any
plastic surgery either.

841
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,070
Hey.

842
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,204
You think it's funny?

843
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:56,037
What do you mean?

844
00:52:57,736 --> 00:52:58,936
Is it fun?

845
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:02,103
You mean, the fresh week party?

846
00:53:02,837 --> 00:53:04,386
Of course, it's fun.

847
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,737
The fresh week party?

848
00:53:06,336 --> 00:53:08,103
I'm talking about your ridiculous act.

849
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:16,519
I don't understand what you're saying.

850
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:18,237
Or you're just pretending
like you don't know.

851
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,519
Soo A, are you crying?

852
00:53:30,603 --> 00:53:32,937
- Why this punk...
- Don't cry.

853
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,885
- Why are you crying?
- What's wrong with you, Kyung Seok?

854
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:38,002
- Apologize right now.
- Apologize.

855
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:39,971
Kyung Seok!

856
00:53:45,436 --> 00:53:46,636
I'm sorry.

857
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:49,770
I guess I did something wrong.

858
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,552
You did nothing wrong.

859
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:54,437
- Apologize to her, punk!
- Don't cry, Soo A.

860
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,937
I guess he's mistaken.

861
00:54:01,603 --> 00:54:02,870
Soo A.

862
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,537
What's wrong with you?

863
00:54:11,169 --> 00:54:13,970
Are you a fool or an idiot?

864
00:54:18,236 --> 00:54:21,519
Why does that jerk behave
so rudely like that?

865
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:23,086
Let's not swear.

866
00:54:23,173 --> 00:54:24,985
Can't you see the situation?

867
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:26,486
Are you taking his side
because he's handsome?

868
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,271
Stop adding to it!

869
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,219
The girls aren't saying anything
about his terrible manner.

870
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:33,038
They're crazy about handsome looks.

871
00:54:33,554 --> 00:54:35,436
You're crazy about pretty girls too.

872
00:54:35,536 --> 00:54:37,937
You guys got so hyper
when Soo A came here.

873
00:54:38,022 --> 00:54:38,952
What is it?

874
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:40,846
Are you mad that you're
not a match to Soo A?

875
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,242
- What?
- Hey, don't bother them.

876
00:54:43,327 --> 00:54:44,561
Did you talk about me just now?

877
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,466
Girls have got to serve military
and fix their attitudes.

878
00:54:47,646 --> 00:54:49,462
Why are you bringing up military here?

879
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,152
You haven't even served your duty yet!

880
00:54:51,236 --> 00:54:53,085
- I'm going to!
- Why don't you go right now?

881
00:54:53,169 --> 00:54:55,285
Did I enter an elementary school or what?

882
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:56,419
Stop it.

883
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,437
What's wrong? What happened?

884
00:54:59,002 --> 00:55:01,936
Some girl was putting up a show. See you.

885
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,904
Hey, Kyung Seok!

886
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,804
I need to talk to you for a second.

887
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,837
What's wrong with him?

888
00:55:26,937 --> 00:55:28,237
Soo A.

889
00:55:35,734 --> 00:55:38,068
I really didn't know. I'm sorry.

890
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:40,965
No, it's okay.

891
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:44,003
I should've told you first.

892
00:55:45,171 --> 00:55:47,605
I know it's hard to tell
that kind of story first.

893
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,003
Why am I so slow-witted?

894
00:55:53,837 --> 00:55:56,438
Soo A. Are you okay?

895
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:08,369
Don't think about running
away like a coward.

896
00:56:11,257 --> 00:56:14,671
The loser will give up
on Soo A like a man.

897
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:16,173
Understand?

898
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:22,571
Do you feel better now?

899
00:56:25,012 --> 00:56:26,646
Yes, thank you.

900
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:30,050
Don't mention it. I'm
glad you feel better.

901
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:35,135
By the way, have you thought about it?

902
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:39,323
About our relationship.

903
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:45,037
Yes, I've given it some thought,

904
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:47,671
but I don't think...

905
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:50,370
...you and I can be together.

906
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,686
Why?

907
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,638
I think it'll be better for
us to stay as friends.

908
00:56:55,736 --> 00:56:57,514
Why do we have to?

909
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,983
Is it uncomfortable to go out
with your direct senior?

910
00:57:00,102 --> 00:57:01,885
Let's make it a secret then.

911
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:05,289
That's not the reason.

912
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:07,269
Then what is it?

913
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:08,959
What's the reason?

914
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:10,903
You said you liked me too.

915
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:12,769
Did I misunderstand?

916
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:15,504
That's not it.

917
00:57:17,403 --> 00:57:19,371
I'm friends with Mi Rae.

918
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:20,786
What?

919
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,571
How can I go out with my friend's crush?

920
00:57:25,636 --> 00:57:27,337
Soo A, that's...

921
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:29,119
I told you. That's not it.

922
00:57:29,203 --> 00:57:31,570
I'm sorry. I'll go first.

923
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:33,404
Soo A, hold on.

924
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:36,137
Soo A. Soo A.

925
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:38,897
That's...

926
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:52,437
Hey, calm down.

927
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:01,037
It's your turn. Drink it.

928
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,937
Are you giving up because you might lose?

929
00:58:06,169 --> 00:58:07,903
Then give up on Soo A.

930
00:58:08,203 --> 00:58:09,637
Don't change words later.

931
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,303
Give up on what?

932
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,121
- Is she an object or what?
- What did you say?

933
00:58:14,404 --> 00:58:17,305
You got rejected simply because
you were not good enough.

934
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:20,171
- What, you punk?
- Calm down.

935
00:58:21,111 --> 00:58:23,278
What do you know about Soo A?

936
00:58:24,536 --> 00:58:28,003
If you play with Soo A, depending
on that handsome face or yours,

937
00:58:29,263 --> 00:58:31,231
I won't let it slide.

938
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,236
Understand?

939
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:47,337
You're too drunk. Let's hurry and go.

940
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,686
- Can I really go?
- Yes.

941
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,337
It's really fine.

942
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,732
It seems like the party
will end soon though.

943
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,135
No, it might last for
a long time this way.

944
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:01,403
- You must be tired, so go.
- Right, go home.

945
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:03,040
- Still...
- Hurry and go.

946
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,703
It's okay, so go.

947
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,763
Then I'll go first.

948
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:13,105
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

949
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:14,484
Bye.

950
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,612
Do you like me?

951
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:35,821
What?

952
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,707
Do you like me? Do you
want to go out with me?

953
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,843
No.

954
00:59:42,236 --> 00:59:46,037
Then did you babble on to Soo
A to hit me in the back?

955
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:47,854
- What?
- She says...

956
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,026
she can't go out with
me because you like me.

957
00:59:51,069 --> 00:59:54,236
Who said that? Because I've
never said such a thing.

958
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:56,218
Then go tell her directly yourself...

959
00:59:56,506 --> 00:59:58,840
...that you don't care even
if she goes out with me.

960
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,631
Why should I do that?

961
01:00:02,403 --> 01:00:04,534
Hey, stop right there.

962
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,537
What are you doing?

963
01:00:08,536 --> 01:00:09,836
Are you crazy?

964
01:00:10,628 --> 01:00:13,162
- What did I do?
- What did you do?

965
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:15,863
Hey, you flirted with me first.

966
01:00:15,954 --> 01:00:18,053
How dare you act like
you don't know, wench?

967
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:20,486
Did you think things would work out
for real because I was nice to you?

968
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:23,337
Don't make me laugh. People like
you are everywhere in Gangnam.

969
01:00:25,157 --> 01:00:27,391
Gosh, you plastic monster.

970
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,565
How dare you swear at me?

971
01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:39,989
What did I do so wrong?

972
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:42,215
What did I do?

973
01:00:43,436 --> 01:00:45,437
Why that crazy... Do you want to die?

974
01:00:45,538 --> 01:00:46,938
That crazy witch. Hey!

975
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:53,250
Don't make me laugh. People like
you are everywhere in Gangnam.

976
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,737
Gosh, you plastic monster.

977
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,046
Hey, gosh.

978
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:38,018
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

979
01:01:38,102 --> 01:01:40,819
Aren't you curious what Mi
Rae looked like in the past?

980
01:01:40,903 --> 01:01:42,952
Mi Rae and Kyung Seok went
to the same middle school.

981
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:45,853
It's nothing to hide, so
why didn't they tell us?

982
01:01:45,937 --> 01:01:47,586
Maybe he liked her.

983
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:48,885
If I didn't know she did plastic surgery,

984
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:50,686
is there a reason why I should ask
her about it when she didn't?

985
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,371
You don't look that thoughtless.

986
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:54,252
He gathered all the
freshmen in the department.

987
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,152
Tell Kyung Seok and Kyung Hee...

988
01:01:56,236 --> 01:01:57,586
...that their mom wants to see them.

989
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,604
All the female freshmen may
leave except for Kang Mi Rae.

990
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,570
Mi Rae. Let's go.

991
01:02:04,269 --> 01:02:05,603
What are you doing right now?
