1
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:06,506
Are you done?

2
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:09,810
No, I'm not done.
I haven't even taken off...

3
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:16,815
Tell me when you're done.

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,084
What is this situation?

5
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:29,945
This is like...

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,933
going to an island together...

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,335
...and missing the last ferry back.

8
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:47,371
But there's only one room.
Isn't that what this situation is like?

9
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,769
I must be going crazy.
Why do I have such a dirty mind?

10
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,196
Turn around in 20 minutes.

11
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,400
- What?
- Stay like that for 20 minutes.

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,884
- Hey!
- Is this a punishment or what?

13
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,638
- Why should I?
- Okay, fine. Just 10 minutes, then.

14
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,642
I don't want you to know
exactly when I got changed.

15
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,846
Turn around and stare at the wall.

16
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,748
- I'll give you 20 seconds.
- What?

17
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,135
- Hey.
- Start.

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,962
By the way, how will you
know when 20 seconds are up?

19
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,363
12.

20
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:38,365
13.

21
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,968
14.

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,670
15.

23
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,373
16.

24
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,150
17.

25
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,717
18.

26
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:54,848
19.

27
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,754
20.

28
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,776
I'm done.

29
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:46,967
I think you're wearing it backwards.

30
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:47,868
What?

31
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,243
I'll give you 30 seconds.

32
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,714
Hey, don't do that.

33
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:04,084
Just don't turn around until
I tell you that I'm done.

34
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,418
Will you leave without watching it?

35
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,517
You can stay and watch it.

36
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,417
Why are you suddenly in a bad mood?

37
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,706
I'm not in a bad mood. I'm just tired.

38
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,208
Soo A.

39
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:33,013
Why did you only call Soo A?
Ji Hyo is here too.

40
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:34,614
Hi, Ji Hyo.

41
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,416
I do not need you to call my name.

42
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,718
Are you not going to
watch the performance?

43
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,821
No, I want to leave because I'm tired.

44
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,724
Already? You should stay
for a little longer.

45
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:48,762
Hey, he's been looking
for you all day long.

46
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,036
At least take a photo with
him before you leave.

47
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,683
- Hey.
- Just be quiet, okay?

48
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,469
Let's take a photo together.

49
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,640
Oh, my goodness.
It's your lucky day, man.

50
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,744
Then... Do you guys want
to go stand over there?

51
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,817
A little further back.

52
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,753
Oh, my. What a nice scenery.

53
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,317
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

54
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,756
- Get out.
- Me?

55
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:16,957
Yes, get out of the frame.

56
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,529
Soo A, you look so pretty. This is great.

57
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,664
Hey, Won Ho. Smile a little.

58
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,318
All right, I'm going to take it now.
1, 2...

59
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,351
- Hey!
- Hold on! Just a second.

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,151
Let's take it together.
All of us together.

61
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:34,464
Hey, what is this about? Gosh, seriously.

62
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,265
Why? Can't we be in this photo?

63
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,278
All right. You can eat this. Here.

64
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,450
- Let's take it together.
- See? She wants us in the photo.

65
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,051
Sung Woon, send the photo to us too.

66
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,884
Sure, no problem.

67
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,451
All right, here we go.

68
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,355
1, 2, 3.

69
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:51,291
- Shall I take another one?
- Yes.

70
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:52,784
Okay, sure.

71
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:55,362
All right. Here we go!

72
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,650
- Perfect.
- Is it perfect?

73
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,984
It's perfect.

74
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,901
Why are you always so serious?

75
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,417
- Have fun, guys.
- Okay.

76
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:05,705
- Did you finish it?
- Was it not good?

77
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,582
You were...

78
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,651
...cool yesterday.

79
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:21,087
What you did to that jerk.

80
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,483
What's cool about it?

81
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,795
Because of it, everyone
knows that nickname now.

82
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,181
It probably wasn't a surprise
to you since you already knew.

83
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,484
I didn't know.

84
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,803
What?

85
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,208
That nickname of yours.
I didn't know.

86
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,179
You didn't know what everyone
else in our school knew?

87
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,350
Was I an outcast?

88
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:56,532
Nobody made you an outcast.
You probably wanted to be alone.

89
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,750
I know that everyone wanted
to be friends with you.

90
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,131
With me? Why?

91
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,362
Because I'm handsome?

92
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,218
If you...

93
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,017
...hadn't gotten the wrong idea,

94
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:11,771
could we have been friends?

95
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,184
You'd never have wanted...

96
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:26,887
...to be friends with me.

97
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,858
There were many pretty
girls in our school.

98
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:37,517
Looks aren't everything.

99
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,067
I don't like...

100
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,484
...pretty girls.

101
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,385
So are you saying...

102
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,085
...I'm ugly?

103
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,356
Well, you're funny.

104
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:07,394
What... Do you think
I'm funny because I'm ugly?

105
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,396
No.

106
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,900
I just thought your dance
on the chair was funny.

107
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:18,384
I liked that you were funny.

108
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,116
Let's head inside.

109
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,483
What? Were you guys in here together?

110
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,202
Yes.

111
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,784
What are you guys doing here?

112
00:07:53,283 --> 00:07:54,808
I came here to get changed.

113
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,775
What?

114
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,104
Thank you.

115
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,483
Thanks.

116
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:07,881
She came to get changed?

117
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:13,084
I guess I'm no longer a loner...

118
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,079
...since I have a friend now.

119
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,163
What?

120
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,517
I have you.

121
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:26,239
I never had a guy friend before.

122
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,043
I can't believe I'm friends
with Do Kyung Seok.

123
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,550
That's so pretty.

124
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:48,251
In 1, 2, 3.

125
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,236
You should go now.
You don't need to walk me home.

126
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,536
It's not like I'm not allowed to.

127
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:10,950
My bus is here.

128
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,913
I'll go now. See you.

129
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:37,767
I have a friend now.

130
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:38,638
What?

131
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,174
I have you.

132
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,752
(First stop: Youngrang Park,
Last stop: Sanggu Public Garage)

133
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,424
Sir.

134
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:09,917
Soo A.

135
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,784
Look at this.

136
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,017
He's Kyung Seok's dad.

137
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,217
(I should meet the merchants in
order to know how they feel.)

138
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,017
(Candidate Do Sang Won Goes
Campaigning for Votes)

139
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,251
(Meanwhile, Do Sang Won's ex-wife
is Na Hye Sung, the CEO of Kelun,)

140
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,218
(and the two got divorced 10 years ago.)

141
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:52,145
What are you doing?

142
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,749
Kyung Hee came in 23rd
out of 26 students.

143
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,458
The other three apparently
didn't take the test,

144
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:01,788
and they don't even come to school.

145
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:27,513
I know I did something wrong,

146
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,450
but this is just way too much.

147
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,352
You didn't do anything wrong.

148
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,756
Getting bad grades isn't a bad thing.

149
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,726
Right?

150
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:57,165
Kyung Seok, stop crying right now.

151
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,045
A man shouldn't cry over
something so petty.

152
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,248
What's wrong with you?

153
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,550
The least you could do
is try to console him.

154
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,784
Guys need to be raised
with a strong mindset.

155
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,755
You're not a girl.
Why do you cry so easily?

156
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,456
What does gender have
anything to do with crying?

157
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,751
He can cry if he feels upset.

158
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:16,062
I gave him everything he wanted,
and now he's just weak.

159
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,368
Don't even think about coming inside.

160
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,338
He's so mean.

161
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:28,341
- Dad's so mean.
- Why did you cry?

162
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,543
Did something upset you?

163
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:31,744
Yes.

164
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,845
It's okay.

165
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,521
Guys can cry if they want to.

166
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,923
That doesn't mean you're weak.

167
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,326
That's not what Dad says.

168
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,328
A true strong person...

169
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:50,530
...is someone who makes sure...

170
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,633
...they don't hurt the people
who are weaker than them.

171
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,251
Kyung Seok, you're healthy...

172
00:13:57,437 --> 00:14:00,540
...and very handsome.

173
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,542
So you'll have to be extra careful.

174
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,430
- According to the freshmen,
- Yes?

175
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,917
Kyung Seok's dad used to be a congressman.

176
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,218
- Really?
- Yes.

177
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:30,837
Who?

178
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,606
His name was Do something.

179
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,917
Well, of course, his last name is Do.

180
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,112
- Gosh.
- Do...

181
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,513
What was his name?

182
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,615
I heard his mom's the CEO of Kelun.

183
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:44,016
- The CEO of Kelun?
- Yes.

184
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,120
Gosh, if my mom was the CEO of Kelun,

185
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,221
I would've beat Chan Woo up as well.

186
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,684
Chan Woo must've known.

187
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,117
Otherwise, he wouldn't have let
him get away with what he did.

188
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,784
But I haven't seen him around
for a really long time.

189
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,685
You're right. You're the
one who should know.

190
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,932
- What are you talking about?
- He's your best friend.

191
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,535
- What are you saying?
- You didn't have to hit me.

192
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,771
Don't skip your meals.

193
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,950
I'll visit you on Saturday.

194
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,538
- His dad used to be a congressman.
- Really?

195
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:40,840
The perfume company.

196
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,042
- I use their perfume.
- I love their products.

197
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,150
They're probably talking about me.

198
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,397
His mom's the CEO of Kelun.

199
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,716
He's apparently really rich.

200
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,134
- My gosh.
- He comes from a great family.

201
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,316
I heard his parents got divorced.

202
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,005
- Really?
- No wonder he's so cold.

203
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,207
Hey, Soo A.

204
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,408
- Hi.
- Hey.

205
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,518
He's so good-looking.

206
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,713
- He really is.
- He's so handsome.

207
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:24,217
Hey, Mi Rae.

208
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,818
Hey.

209
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,788
Kyung Seok's dad is a congressman.

210
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,690
And his mom's the CEO of Kelun.

211
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,584
- Really? Who?
- Yes.

212
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,093
He's from a rich family.

213
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,895
No wonder he's so rude.

214
00:16:35,983 --> 00:16:37,050
- I get it now.
- Yes.

215
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:39,398
He lacks nothing.

216
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,301
Did you tell everyone?

217
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,085
Well...

218
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:50,910
Hey.

219
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:03,884
Give me Kyung Seok's cell phone.

220
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,584
You dropped this yesterday.

221
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,144
You're coming to the
after-party later, right?

222
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,948
You really are the worst.

223
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,449
What?

224
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:41,810
Hello.

225
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,135
- Hello.
- Hello.

226
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:50,536
Let's talk about the assignment you
must submit before the final exam.

227
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,711
Watch one of the movies that are
currently playing at theaters...

228
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,211
...and submit your report on that movie.

229
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,348
There isn't any format or guideline, okay?

230
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:04,340
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

231
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,822
Hey, let's go watching a movie together.

232
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,427
Did you get shot in the head?

233
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,610
Bang, bang.

234
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,944
Kyung Seok.

235
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:25,244
Are you going to the after-party?

236
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,873
- What about you?
- I think I'm going.

237
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:30,643
I'll think about it.

238
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,644
Okay.

239
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,249
You took the wrong bus
yesterday, didn't you?

240
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:38,351
No.

241
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:42,154
I had to go somewhere yesterday.

242
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,164
Hello, Woo Young.

243
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:25,798
You're here.

244
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,400
Hello.

245
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,411
- Come sit here.
- Okay.

246
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:38,571
Why did you want to see me?

247
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,670
I have to visit the office of Kelun
regarding our partnership with them.

248
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:44,044
The chief director wants you to
come together if you have time.

249
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:45,476
Me?

250
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,888
She wants to know how you
made the handmade candles.

251
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:50,589
It seems like you did a great job.

252
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,194
How about today? What are
you doing after school?

253
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,197
We're having the festival
after-party today.

254
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,810
I think I can go there late after
visiting the office with you.

255
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:05,404
- Really?
- Yes.

256
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:07,873
- Then I'll see you later.
- Okay.

257
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,108
Mi Rae.

258
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,244
How do you do this?

259
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:16,482
Wait, that's...

260
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:21,043
I can follow the choreography
except for this part.

261
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,089
Can you teach me how to do it later?

262
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:25,891
- Well...
- Well, later.

263
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:27,776
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, bye.

264
00:20:31,376 --> 00:20:32,376
Why are you here already?

265
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,877
I have no part-time work today, so I
came in case you'd struggle alone.

266
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,603
Thank you.

267
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:53,052
By the way, aren't you
hiring any part-timers?

268
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:57,356
What is it?

269
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,459
- None of them are pretty enough?
- That's not it.

270
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,995
I have no money.

271
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:03,195
What?

272
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:05,965
I think my business is going bankrupt.

273
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,077
I might have to take out my house
deposit to pay for the rent.

274
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,178
Let me take a look at the ledger.

275
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,404
Ledger?

276
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:17,376
Even elementary school students
would do a better job than this.

277
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,777
You have to organize this
kind of stuff with Excel.

278
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,177
Excel?

279
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,410
You're pretty smart.

280
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:26,118
You don't even know such a thing?

281
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,810
If you lack experience, you should
hire an experienced part-timer.

282
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,624
Business isn't a joke.

283
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,229
Pass.

284
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,032
You're hired.

285
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:47,345
Did you think I'd be excited?

286
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,509
This isn't time to play around.

287
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,544
1, 2.

288
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,518
Who taught you that dance?

289
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,844
I just watched video clips...

290
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,844
You managed to learn this
only by watching videos?

291
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,928
- Stop it.
- Why? It's cool.

292
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,260
I respect those who are good at dancing.

293
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:10,663
How did you...

294
00:22:13,743 --> 00:22:15,167
Amber Five?

295
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,270
But it smells a bit different.

296
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:19,843
You're right, it's Amber Five.

297
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,643
I knew you were interested in perfume too.

298
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,546
Well, I'm the teaching assistant
of the chemistry department.

299
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:33,519
But it smelled a bit different from
the familiar scent of Amber Five.

300
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,144
People all have their own body scent.

301
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,623
The scent of perfume changes
when it touches their skin.

302
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:42,110
Just like how you dance this move
is different from how I do it.

303
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,598
That's not how you do it.

304
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,010
This.

305
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:51,670
All right, look. Stand still like this.

306
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,773
Put your arms like this.

307
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:58,210
- Like this.
- Like this?

308
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,512
I respect that, seriously.

309
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,021
I plan to hold a housewarming party
this Saturday. What do you think?

310
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:16,574
I'm going to see my parents this Saturday.

311
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:19,588
Then how about Sunday?

312
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,271
I'm fine with that,
but I'm not sure about Hyun Jung.

313
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:24,637
Really?

314
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,606
How about we create a group
chat to talk together about it?

315
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:30,210
Sure, I'll make it.

316
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,244
Let's not make it grand like
a real housewarming party.

317
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,220
Let's just gather up and
eat delicious food.

318
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:35,931
Okay.

319
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,643
Oh, right. Kyung Seok said he'd come too.

320
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,518
- What?
- Why?

321
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,477
It's nothing.

322
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,311
We're friends. Friends.

323
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:01,507
Kyung Seok.

324
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:03,909
Well...

325
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,176
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

326
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,384
I didn't mean to look at
your phone on purpose.

327
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,578
It's just that a message
popped up on the screen.

328
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,990
I told only a few of my friends,

329
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:21,593
but words got out in the entire department.

330
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,297
Sorry.

331
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:33,543
I heard it from Ji Hyo.

332
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,177
I'm sorry that I was mistaken about you.

333
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:37,977
It's nothing new.

334
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,044
I'm fine.

335
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,211
I was shocked more by...

336
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:46,871
...how you sounded like you
expected this from me.

337
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,357
I realized how you thought of me.

338
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:56,411
You must've kept misunderstanding
if it hadn't been for Ji Hyo.

339
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,977
You think all my behaviors
are intentional.

340
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,877
How you think about me is up to you.

341
00:25:14,276 --> 00:25:16,309
But it was a little
upsetting for me this time.

342
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,477
I...

343
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,211
don't have a mom either.

344
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:38,270
That's why I know how it feels
to have my hurtful experience...

345
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:40,943
...revealed to others.

346
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,444
No one knows about it.

347
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,610
You're the first.

348
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,951
You know what it means, right?

349
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:07,766
(What about you, Kyung Seok?)

350
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,601
Okay.

351
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,343
Okay.

352
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,743
The CEO got taken to the
emergency room just a while ago.

353
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,844
The chief director went with her.

354
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,677
- What?
- Why was she taken to the hospital?

355
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:24,344
I'm not sure.

356
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:26,576
- Let's go.
- Okay.

357
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:28,110
Thank you. Goodbye.

358
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:31,879
All right, guys.

359
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,874
These two have something to tell you.

360
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,310
What are you waiting for?

361
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:45,788
I think I made mistakes to you
during the preparation period.

362
00:26:46,076 --> 00:26:49,010
I didn't know you guys were
that sensitive. I'm sorry.

363
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:52,315
- Me too.
- What are you sorry about?

364
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,977
Well, for criticizing
you about your looks.

365
00:26:56,043 --> 00:26:57,343
I can't hear you.

366
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:03,476
I'm sorry that I criticized you
about your looks...

367
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,127
and forced only the
female students to wait tables.

368
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,110
What about making them
wear those uniforms?

369
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,478
I'm sorry.

370
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,511
I'm really sorry too.

371
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,677
We'll never do that again. We're sorry.

372
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:22,911
Stop being mad at us.
I scolded these two harshly.

373
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,778
We have to see each other around.
Will you keep being this awkward?

374
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,480
They can sound mean and rude,

375
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,883
but you know that they're not bad guys.
Aren't I right?

376
00:27:30,976 --> 00:27:32,484
- Yes.
- Yes.

377
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,777
Since you're saying sorry,
we will accept your apology.

378
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:39,177
But how you behave from
now on matters more.

379
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:40,610
Thanks, Yoon Byul.

380
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,761
Then let's raise our glasses, everyone.

381
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:44,511
Good work with the festival.

382
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,877
And we're sorry again.

383
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:47,778
My, what a beautiful sight!

384
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:50,192
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers!

385
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:52,611
Good work, everyone.

386
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:01,558
Have the two of you been
hanging out often lately?

387
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:04,810
Seeing the two of you
together is a bit weird.

388
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,711
What's weird about it? We're close.

389
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,621
Aren't I right, Kyung Seok?

390
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,524
Yes.

391
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:17,029
- Does it mean we have a new couple?
- Does it mean we have a new couple?

392
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,034
What did she eat?

393
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:24,343
She must've eaten spoiled food
without knowing it's gone bad.

394
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,211
Thankfully, she's okay this time.

395
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,006
The doctor said she can
be discharged tomorrow.

396
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,210
Has something like this happened before?

397
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,979
She has been in the ER
after eating spoiled food.

398
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:37,316
Whatever she ate must've smelled very bad.

399
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:40,111
She probably hasn't told either of you,

400
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:44,523
but she can barely smell
anything at the moment.

401
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,024
- Sorry?
- Pardon?

402
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,027
She was in a big accident,

403
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,896
and her olfactory nerve
was severely damaged.

404
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,331
My goodness.

405
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:55,543
That's why she ends up eating
spoiled food at times.

406
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,537
Then Kelun... What about perfumes?

407
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,344
She's very impressive.

408
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:02,544
It's like a singer losing her voice...

409
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,143
...and a painter losing her sight.

410
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,216
Excuse me for a moment.

411
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,510
Yes, sir.

412
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,822
Something urgent came up.
Yes, I apologize.

413
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,643
I'll call you in a bit.

414
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,376
Okay.

415
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:25,210
You can go if you have to
take care of something.

416
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,376
I'll stay here.

417
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,311
Would you really do that for me?

418
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,702
I can be back in 2 to 3 hours.

419
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,644
Yes, I'll stay right by her side.

420
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,543
You can get going too.

421
00:29:35,844 --> 00:29:37,042
Gosh, how could I...

422
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,110
It's okay. You can go.

423
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,746
Then please look after her while I'm gone.

424
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:56,490
Oh, does Ms. Na have no family?

425
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:59,677
Didn't Professor Park tell you?

426
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,877
About what?

427
00:30:00,992 --> 00:30:02,779
It was in the newspapers too.

428
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:05,971
She got divorced years ago.
She lives alone now.

429
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:08,310
I see.

430
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,611
I actually wanted to get in
touch with her son earlier,

431
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:16,143
but I didn't because she'd probably
get mad at me if she found out.

432
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:19,010
He's in the chemistry department
at Hankook University.

433
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,602
He's in our department? What's his name?

434
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,195
His name is Do Kyung Seok.

435
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:25,109
Please pretend you know nothing.

436
00:30:25,194 --> 00:30:27,192
Ms. Na hasn't seen him in years.

437
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,828
Oh, okay.

438
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:32,397
This has to stay between us.
You know that, right?

439
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,598
Yes.

440
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,571
Thanks.

441
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:17,976
I didn't want to tell anyone about it.

442
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:22,176
But I do feel much better now
that I've told someone.

443
00:31:27,838 --> 00:31:29,372
Do Kyung Seok and Hyun Soo A.

444
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:31,657
They're both good-looking
and from rich families.

445
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,344
Is it like the parallel lives theory?

446
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:36,639
Parallel lines never meet.

447
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,631
Look at you. You sound so confident.

448
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:40,232
Just go and grab the microphone.

449
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,199
The microphone?

450
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,442
(Kang Mi Rae)

451
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:11,746
Ladies and gentlemen.

452
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:13,919
Next up is the star of Hankook University.

453
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:15,954
The most beautiful angel,

454
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:19,310
Hyun Soo A, will sing for us!

455
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,810
Please give her a big hand!

456
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,944
- Hyun Soo A, Hyun Soo A!
- Hyun Soo A, Hyun Soo A!

457
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,114
Where are you?

458
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,318
You're at a hospital?

459
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,720
Ms. Na is hospitalized...

460
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:37,422
...because of food poisoning.

461
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,525
She ate food that had gone bad.

462
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,744
I heard she can't smell things
anymore due to an accident.

463
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,336
Did you know about it?

464
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:56,641
I'm staying with her now
because she has no one else.

465
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:00,645
Will you come?

466
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:05,917
No.

467
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,525
Well, there's something
I have to tell you.

468
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:18,530
I actually saw her back in middle school.

469
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,302
I'm saying I saw your mom
in our neighborhood.

470
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,611
She must've come to see you.

471
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,843
I have to go.

472
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:53,888
Room 1013 at Hankook University Hospital.

473
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:57,310
I'm sorry. I won't meddle
in your business anymore.

474
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:10,903
- Are you okay, Ms. Na?
- Are you okay, Hye Sung?

475
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:14,276
Yes. I'm so sorry that
you had to stay here.

476
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,355
Soo Hyun, please drive Mi Rae home.

477
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,858
No, that's not necessary.
I can take the bus home.

478
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,159
I'll call a cab for you.

479
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,763
Director Lee, I want you
to go home as well.

480
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:26,965
I can't leave you alone.

481
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:29,844
Don't worry. I'm not a kid.

482
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:31,937
You're more stubborn than a kid.

483
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:34,973
I'll be off now.

484
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,277
- Bye.
- Mi Rae.

485
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:41,379
Thank you.

486
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:44,783
No problem.

487
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:49,087
Goodbye. Take good care of yourself.

488
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:08,548
Hey, Woo Young.

489
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:12,843
Ms. Na woke up. Don't worry.

490
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:15,653
Bye.

491
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:18,550
- Woo Young came as well?
- Yes.

492
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,620
What am I going to do?

493
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,243
I caused everyone so much trouble.

494
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,123
That's why you should hire an assistant.

495
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,593
What kind of a CEO doesn't have
an assistant and drives herself?

496
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,896
I really hate it when someone keeps...

497
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,699
...following me around.

498
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,203
Gosh, what if you get into an accident?

499
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:40,311
I never got into a car accident.

500
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,264
Then at least date someone.

501
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,868
Isn't it sad that I'm the only one
who's here to take care of you?

502
00:36:09,976 --> 00:36:11,469
You're not really caring for me right now.

503
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,071
Gosh, stop nagging and leave.

504
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,639
Are you going to miss your
kids all your life...

505
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,142
...and grow old all by yourself
without dating anyone?

506
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,244
You're the one who should stop
dating and start settling down.

507
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,846
If I meet a few more of your
girlfriends, it'll add up to 100.

508
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:23,648
What are you talking about?

509
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:24,949
You should leave now.

510
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,652
I'll get discharged on my own,
so you don't need to come.

511
00:36:36,543 --> 00:36:37,662
Kyung Seok.

512
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:45,570
- Do Sang Won!
- Do Sang Won!

513
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,972
- I'm a fan.
- Do Sang Won!

514
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,676
- Have some.
- Do Sang Won!

515
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:51,476
- Here.
- Do Sang Won!

516
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,478
- Do Sang Won!
- Do Sang Won!

517
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,880
Goodness, have a drink.

518
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:58,276
- You should take a drink.
- Okay, thank you.

519
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,651
Drink up.

520
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:00,743
- Do Sang Won!
- Do Sang Won!

521
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,454
Gosh, that's nice.

522
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:04,144
- Sir.
- Yes?

523
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,758
Kyung Seok and your ex-wife
are together right now.

524
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:08,444
- Do Sang Won!
- Do Sang Won!

525
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:10,577
I'm sorry. I'll report to you later.

526
00:37:10,643 --> 00:37:13,364
- Do Sang Won!
- Do Sang Won!

527
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,266
-Thank you.

528
00:37:16,243 --> 00:37:19,437
I never even imagined that you might come.

529
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:24,943
I'm so grateful toward Mi Rae.

530
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,245
You too.

531
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,151
I missed you so much.

532
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:38,256
But now that you're here,
I don't know what to say.

533
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,361
I can't even bring myself to apologize.

534
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,163
If you're sorry,

535
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:48,344
you should apologize.

536
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,571
What are you sorry about?

537
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,576
For leaving you and your sister.

538
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,977
I regretted it a lot.

539
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,444
I figured I should've tried
to think things differently.

540
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,563
You should quit work.
You don't need to earn money.

541
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:21,166
Money isn't the problem.

542
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:24,769
It's my life-long dream
to become a perfumer.

543
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,477
I told you that
I'm working overtime today.

544
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,280
Why do you always have trouble
putting the kids to bed?

545
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:39,284
I looked after the kids every
time you had a gathering...

546
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:40,985
...or went to play golf
during the weekdays.

547
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:44,677
But I still managed to become
the youngest head researcher.

548
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,991
I can't quit now.

549
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:50,094
What are you trying to
become by working so hard?

550
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,997
Everyone else dreams of
becoming a stay-at-home mom.

551
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:57,168
You know the typical question
that everyone asks actresses?

552
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:01,172
"What's more important?
Your work or your family?"

553
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:06,477
I never thought there'd come a day
when I had to answer that question.

554
00:39:09,076 --> 00:39:10,481
Is that all?

555
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:20,544
I also went through a lot after
I got into an accident...

556
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,077
...and lost my ability to smell...

557
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:27,376
...because I could no longer
work as a perfumer.

558
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:41,757
(Dad)

559
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:47,852
Kyung Seok isn't picking up.

560
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,844
But is there a reason why
Kyung Seok shouldn't meet his mom?

561
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,977
Is there something he
shouldn't know about...

562
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:02,277
...that might make him leave you and
run off to live with his mother?

563
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:07,972
Never mind. I'm sorry.

564
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,875
Cut the nonsense, and just
focus on giving me reports.

565
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:11,876
Yes, sir.

566
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:27,910
It's late. You should go home.

567
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:32,077
You should sleep.

568
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,677
I'll go a little later.

569
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,427
Stay healthy.

570
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,225
Kyung Seok.

571
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:43,428
Did you sleep outside?

572
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,329
Yes.

573
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,433
Kyung Seok, come inside.

574
00:42:58,113 --> 00:42:59,210
Sit down.

575
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,713
Where were you?

576
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:05,917
I met Ms. Na.

577
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,614
Okay. I'm sure you missed her.
I understand.

578
00:43:14,213 --> 00:43:15,714
But it's hard to understand her.

579
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:17,914
She never reached out to you for 10 years,

580
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,464
and now she brazenly shows up.

581
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,066
She once came when I was in middle school.

582
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,248
But of course, I didn't get to meet her.

583
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,472
Did she tell you...

584
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:29,407
...that I didn't let her meet you?

585
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,782
Okay, fine. I didn't let her meet you.

586
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,014
How dare she show up when she
left after having an affair?

587
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,623
- That's not true.
- What?

588
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:47,792
She didn't have an affair.

589
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,997
Why did you lie?

590
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,313
Why did you do that?

591
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:02,406
I can't believe she made up
an excuse to meet you.

592
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:06,847
Did you even...

593
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:08,613
...have me followed?

594
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,348
Or did you do that to her?

595
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:15,714
That wasn't an excuse.

596
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,213
You must know it was food poisoning...

597
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,826
...and that she hurt her olfactory
nerves due to an accident.

598
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:22,727
What?

599
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,914
That was a mistake.

600
00:44:32,865 --> 00:44:34,199
Just once.

601
00:44:35,477 --> 00:44:37,445
I hit her just one time by mistake.

602
00:44:46,844 --> 00:44:48,411
Putting this matter aside,

603
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,576
it was natural for a woman to
be responsible for her family.

604
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,693
What kind of man would like his
wife to keep staying outside?

605
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,530
Every time, work came first
before family for her.

606
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:08,573
I told you to stay home comfortably,
so why wouldn't you listen?

607
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,641
What's comfortable for me?

608
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,744
I have no intention of
living the way you want.

609
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:15,947
I'm doing my best here.

610
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:17,949
There you go talking back again...

611
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:20,851
...to your husband.
You think you're that great?

612
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,477
How pathetic.

613
00:45:22,777 --> 00:45:23,654
What?

614
00:45:24,677 --> 00:45:27,458
It's pathetic how you're trying
to have control over me this way.

615
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,877
Did you really just say that?

616
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:36,367
Why you...

617
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,578
Hye Sung.

618
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,677
When I found out that her
olfactory sense was paralyzed,

619
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,681
I begged as hard as I could.

620
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,644
I promised her thousands of times
that I'd make her happy...

621
00:45:54,777 --> 00:45:56,687
...even after she resigned
from being a perfumer.

622
00:45:57,644 --> 00:46:00,458
But she cared only for her job.

623
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,543
That was why she went out of
control like a crazy woman.

624
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:05,730
You ruined someone else's life,

625
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,533
and you said you'd make her happy?

626
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,103
What?

627
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,206
You even ruined our lives
with your lies until now.

628
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,610
And you cared about your family?

629
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,613
Watch what you say.

630
00:46:22,943 --> 00:46:24,544
I'm the one who raised you until now.

631
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,018
I wouldn't have let you raise
me if I had known sooner.

632
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,377
Kyung Seok.

633
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:30,054
I would've chosen to
grow up alone instead.

634
00:46:31,777 --> 00:46:33,190
Then get out.

635
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:41,781
You must've kicked my mom out...

636
00:46:42,976 --> 00:46:44,368
...this way, right?

637
00:46:45,076 --> 00:46:46,070
What?

638
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,376
Kyung Seok. Stop right there.

639
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:13,453
Does anyone not like pork?

640
00:47:13,546 --> 00:47:14,546
I love it.

641
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,440
I can't eat it because there isn't any.

642
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:17,935
Is pork belly okay then?

643
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,270
Good.

644
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,372
Me too.

645
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:25,543
(Group chat room)

646
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,015
(Dad)

647
00:47:32,277 --> 00:47:33,484
Hey, Dad.

648
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,888
I'm almost there. I'm getting
off at the next stop.

649
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,094
Okay.

650
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,503
Dad.

651
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,211
You didn't have to come all the way here.

652
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,800
I could've walked there.

653
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,279
Get in.

654
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,821
It's amazing.

655
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,535
You're pretty...

656
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,872
...however I take pictures of you.

657
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,175
Let her have her meal.

658
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:33,677
I know you're still
awkward with her looks.

659
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:34,678
What do you mean?

660
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:37,782
You worried about her every day, but
now, you can't even see her face.

661
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,183
What do you mean, I can't?

662
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:52,930
It's still awkward, isn't it?

663
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,265
No, no.

664
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,637
It's pretty and nice.

665
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:02,615
Are you not angry anymore?

666
00:49:02,695 --> 00:49:05,798
He blew off his anger a long time ago.
He's just awkward.

667
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,813
Stop it already. I'm not awkward.

668
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,781
How about we go to a karaoke then?

669
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,483
- Karaoke?
- Yes.

670
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:14,785
How about we go for a round?

671
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:16,887
That sounds great.

672
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,390
- Hurry and eat up.
- Okay.

673
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,091
Mom, you should hurry up too.

674
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,159
Okay.

675
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,195
Dad.

676
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,377
I think Kyung Seok ran away from home.

677
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,504
I'll call you. Take care.

678
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:46,812
Who are you?

679
00:49:46,911 --> 00:49:48,319
Is Ms. Seo Yoo Jin there?

680
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,520
Mom.

681
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:52,122
Who is it?

682
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:55,326
Isn't it Seo Yoo Jin's house?

683
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:58,829
No, it's not. We just moved in here.

684
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:18,345
Why did you fight with your father?

685
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:20,618
You think it makes sense to
bring a bed in this room?

686
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:22,419
But it costs money to throw it away.

687
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:25,556
And I can't sleep on the floor.
My back will hurt otherwise.

688
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,759
You're just as pathetic.

689
00:50:28,877 --> 00:50:30,961
How could you move out of the
house without any plans?

690
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:33,998
Do you have money?

691
00:50:37,778 --> 00:50:39,978
Gosh, the summer season is coming up soon.

692
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,273
I'm not sure if I'll be able to
turn on the air conditioner.

693
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,778
I'm not that sensitive to heat.

694
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,979
Don't act up and move back in.

695
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,781
Living alone isn't easy.

696
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:53,684
You'll be just like me
if you miss the timing.

697
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,233
Soo A.

698
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,504
Hey, Yoo Eun.

699
00:51:14,144 --> 00:51:15,806
What brings you here?

700
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,311
Do you live in this neighborhood?

701
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:19,076
Yes.

702
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,878
Didn't you say you live in Dogok-dong?

703
00:51:22,977 --> 00:51:25,177
I moved out recently.

704
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,377
Oh, really?

705
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:27,818
It hasn't been a few days.

706
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,811
I'll leave you then. See you at school.

707
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,290
Okay, bye.

708
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:49,143
Goodness, I'm tired.

709
00:51:49,442 --> 00:51:50,742
Mi Rae.

710
00:51:50,948 --> 00:51:52,282
Let's...

711
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:55,913
...add some more time now.

712
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:57,881
Give us...

713
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,218
- 1 more hour!
- 1 more hour.

714
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,153
Let's go!

715
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:07,324
Mom, wait up.

716
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,511
I need to go home and lie down.

717
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:11,328
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

718
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:15,399
We did all the singing.
Why is she exhausted?

719
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,202
Dad, you sang twice more than I did.

720
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,072
I hadn't been to a karaoke lounge in
so long. There were many new songs.

721
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,010
Dad, you still got it.

722
00:52:45,977 --> 00:52:47,878
I'm sorry about everything.

723
00:52:50,644 --> 00:52:51,911
No, don't be.

724
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:54,611
Just because I adore you,

725
00:52:55,111 --> 00:52:56,845
it doesn't mean you can be happy.

726
00:52:58,444 --> 00:53:00,444
I was too self-centered.

727
00:53:13,845 --> 00:53:15,346
You're still pretty,

728
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,277
my dear daughter.

729
00:53:20,778 --> 00:53:23,145
It must've been very hard for you, Dad.

730
00:53:24,611 --> 00:53:26,112
I'm sorry.

731
00:53:37,144 --> 00:53:38,478
It's okay.

732
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:43,111
You'll look ugly if you cry.

733
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:49,611
Let's go.

734
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:54,577
Oh, right. I forgot about BTS.

735
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,677
Where did he go?

736
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,678
Honey.

737
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,812
Where on earth did he go?

738
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,712
What are you doing out here so late?

739
00:56:32,444 --> 00:56:34,760
I wish I had a chance to say goodbye...

740
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:37,961
...to Mi Rae's old face.

741
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,268
I'm sorry.

742
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,095
Let's go back inside.

743
00:57:15,211 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm really sorry.

744
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,905
Let's go back in.

745
00:58:21,862 --> 00:58:23,162
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

746
00:58:23,344 --> 00:58:25,669
Your place is so nice.

747
00:58:26,077 --> 00:58:27,477
It looks really nice.

748
00:58:28,544 --> 00:58:31,375
My gosh, you have such a nice place.

749
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,579
Woo Young, take this. It's my
housewarming gift for you.

750
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,881
Mi Rae made it.

751
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:43,629
Oh, it's a Chypre cologne.

752
00:58:44,196 --> 00:58:45,589
Thanks, I'll use it often.

753
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,987
I thought the scent would suit you.
That's why I chose it.

754
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,297
Ms. Na was right.
You really have the talent.

755
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,590
The view from here is incredible.

756
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,344
What do you think? Isn't it pretty
good for the rent I'm paying?

757
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:08,878
Your place is amazing.

758
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,883
It's like a penthouse.

759
00:59:13,578 --> 00:59:15,178
Woo Young, can we come over often?

760
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,787
Yes, of course.

761
00:59:18,977 --> 00:59:20,791
This is the first time
I'm having girls over.

762
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,745
- Seriously?
- Yes.

763
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:24,344
Are you quite conservative?

764
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:26,463
No, not really.

765
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,245
There were times that I couldn't
because I was living in a dorm.

766
00:59:29,344 --> 00:59:32,369
When I had a basement apartment,
I thought they'd be uncomfortable.

767
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,038
You're very honest.

768
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,874
By the way, isn't Kyung Seok coming?

769
00:59:39,277 --> 00:59:42,746
I'm not sure. I haven't heard from him.

770
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,450
(Group Chat)

771
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:50,387
(Then is everyone okay with pork belly?)

772
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,278
It's not brand new,

773
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:10,474
but I bought it very recently.

774
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:36,199
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

775
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:39,578
Could Do Kyung Seok have a crush on you?

776
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,378
Mi Rae, we should watch a movie too.

777
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:43,807
She'll watch a movie with a guy
for the first time in her life.

778
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,609
With a super handsome guy.

779
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:47,611
No, it's just an assignment.

780
01:00:47,696 --> 01:00:49,079
Why do I miss him?

781
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,580
Do you want to go to the movies with me?

782
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:51,915
I'm going with someone else.

783
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,311
You want to be...

784
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,512
- my roommate?
- Yes.

785
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:55,919
What on earth is this about?

786
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:58,021
Are you trying to get back at me or what?

787
01:00:58,211 --> 01:01:00,223
Is it possible?

788
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:03,827
To just think of a guy
like that as a friend.
