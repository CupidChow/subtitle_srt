1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:01,179
Do you...

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,394
...have a crush on him too?

3
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:09,468
No way. Do you?

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,450
What's the problem? Am I not
allowed to like him or what?

5
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:19,533
You won't need my help.

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,707
You're bright,

7
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,530
active, and pretty.

8
00:00:23,634 --> 00:00:25,039
You're pretty too.

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:26,922
What?

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,053
Are you guys going out?

11
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:30,929
Why do you think so?

12
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,637
You're popular among guys as well...

13
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:35,692
...because you're pretty.

14
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:40,517
I think...

15
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,191
...it's a blessing to be
pretty, don't you think?

16
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,927
People naturally like you.

17
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,728
That must be why those
who aren't blessed...

18
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:53,640
...get plastic surgery to enjoy
that kind of benefit,

19
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:58,249
harming the ones who were born pretty.

20
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:00,868
Harm?

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,809
I mean, pretty faces become less rare...

22
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:07,099
...because of plastic surgery.

23
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:18,523
I thought I was mistaken...

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,743
...and that I was at fault for
judging you in a bad way.

25
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,217
But I wasn't mistaken.

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,134
You've hated me...

27
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:34,263
...from the beginning.

28
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,534
No, don't get me wrong.

29
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,342
There are just so many pretty
girls these days, you know.

30
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:53,329
That was my point.

31
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,624
I'm sorry if I offended you.

32
00:01:58,014 --> 00:01:59,534
I'm well aware of the fact...

33
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:02,632
...that you had to get plastic
surgery out of despair.

34
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:06,934
I really wasn't talking about you.

35
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,033
That's a lie.

36
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:14,471
In any case, what you're saying is...

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,071
...that you don't like girls
who got plastic surgery.

38
00:02:22,262 --> 00:02:23,753
That's ridiculous.

39
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,631
She said she wasn't talking about you?

40
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,049
I get that she hates me,

41
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,234
but what bothers me more is
how she thinks that I'm dumb.

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,461
I told you that girl is weird.

43
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,973
Park Yong Chul too.

44
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,689
She definitely has it out for you.

45
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:39,779
Hey, I hope you're not...

46
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,550
...thinking that you should help her
so that she can date Kyung Seok.

47
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,731
No, I'm not. I told her I won't help her.

48
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,830
What should I do?

49
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,224
Kim Chan Woo found out
that we're going out.

50
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:53,239
What?

51
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,012
How did that happen?

52
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:57,429
What? Are you seeing someone?

53
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,649
Actually...

54
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,163
- Hello.
- Hi, Mi Rae.

55
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,648
So who's the guy you're seeing?

56
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,435
Hey, why are you so slow-witted?

57
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:13,350
What's wrong?

58
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:19,195
Why Kim Chan Woo of all people?

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,110
Love is in the air.

60
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:23,902
I think Tae Young's girlfriend
is somewhere in this room.

61
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:25,757
It's not funny.

62
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,963
Tae Hee, is it true?

63
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:31,068
Were you really doing this with Tae Young?

64
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:35,114
Hey, come on. It's not like you two
are in an improper relationship.

65
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:37,835
Why hide it? Everyone will
congratulate you guys.

66
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:38,919
Look at us now.

67
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,826
Is that your way of congratulating her?

68
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:45,150
I guess that's Tae Young's type.

69
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:48,033
Because he's so skinny, he must've
wanted a girlfriend who's...

70
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,734
Hey, stop it.

71
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,674
- What did you just say?
- What did I say?

72
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,667
Didn't you hear about what
happened at the festival?

73
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:59,357
We said we won't let it slide if you
mock someone's looks ever again.

74
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,320
I didn't even say anything offensive.
What did I say?

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,043
- Well, I'm not sure.
- We heard it.

76
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,118
I could hear it from here.

77
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:09,348
Your hearing is too good.

78
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:11,742
I'll keep my voice down from now on.

79
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:12,965
Let's talk quietly.

80
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,367
That scumbag deserves no respect.

81
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:17,444
What?

82
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,195
- Hey.
- What?

83
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:21,600
How dare you talk so rudely to a senior?

84
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,534
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

85
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,144
Apologize to her.

86
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,601
Hey, come on.

87
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:40,267
What did you say?

88
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,683
I said, you should apologize...

89
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,517
...for offending your juniors instead
of being obscure about it.

90
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,973
If I tell people that I like someone,

91
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,785
and if that someone was Kyung Seok...

92
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:09,984
No.

93
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:12,567
They'll definitely make fun of me.

94
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:20,142
You must've been hungry.

95
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:22,230
I'll give you more next time.

96
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,523
(Jang Won Ho)

97
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:43,798
Soo A.

98
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm sorry for reacting that way...

99
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:49,835
...regarding the report and taking
your photo without permission.

100
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,138
No, it's okay.

101
00:05:51,238 --> 00:05:53,457
I felt bad about having reacted...

102
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:55,468
...so sensitively toward you.

103
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,703
I'm sorry too.

104
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,981
You're so nice.

105
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:02,104
You're even nicer for apologizing
to me about something so small.

106
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:03,700
The weather's nice today.

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,374
I brought my camera.

108
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:06,785
Do you want me to take a photo of you?

109
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:07,895
Sure.

110
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:11,977
If you see her, call me right away.

111
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,200
Please do me a favor.

112
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,664
Okay, sir.

113
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:16,360
Have a good day.

114
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:24,832
(Jung Young Mo)

115
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:29,392
You look just like Kyung Seok
from the neck down.

116
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:34,018
Hey, don't you feel sad about
wearing the exact same outfit?

117
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:37,001
This is too expensive for
me to feel that way.

118
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,617
Plus, why is that important?

119
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,889
What matters is that
Soo A is no longer mad at me.

120
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:52,846
Hey, Won Ho.

121
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,466
Yes?

122
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,948
Where did you get that shirt?

123
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,700
Where do you think? I bought it.

124
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,644
Is that a fake?

125
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,868
It's the real deal.

126
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,848
It's from the 2018 spring
and summer collection.

127
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:27,546
I'll send it to you as soon
as you wire me the money.

128
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:28,854
Okay.

129
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,863
(Kyung Seok)

130
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,299
Hello?

131
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,501
Did you sell my clothes?

132
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,787
Yes, I needed some money.

133
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,198
But how did you find out?

134
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,809
You need money? Is there
something going on?

135
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,794
That was quite impressive.

136
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,592
Why didn't you behave that way before?

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,621
Thanks for standing up for me earlier.

138
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,934
I know I'm always mean to you.

139
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,207
No, it's because Chan Woo
crossed the line.

140
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,259
I mistreated you a lot, didn't I?

141
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,934
- No.
- Don't lie.

142
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,047
You never mistreated me.

143
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,953
I always criticize and look down on you.

144
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,136
I can already think of so many things.

145
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:37,774
Just eat your food.

146
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:53,299
Ye Na.

147
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:54,419
Yes?

148
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:58,425
You know I like you, right?

149
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,734
It would've been nice if I confessed
my feelings a bit earlier.

150
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,228
I'm leaving for the military.

151
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:15,526
What?

152
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:19,835
When?

153
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,459
As soon as we're done with the finals.

154
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:24,952
Hey.

155
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,368
I wanted to tell you how I felt...

156
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:33,298
...before I actually left.

157
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:36,310
I...

158
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,373
...liked you...

159
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:41,856
...a lot.

160
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,588
Hey.

161
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:49,607
What?

162
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:53,385
Why are you telling me that now?

163
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:57,159
Why are you reacting this way?

164
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:58,865
My gosh.

165
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,775
- This is so annoying.
- Hey.

166
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:07,976
Ye Na, what... What's wrong?

167
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,471
That's what I should be asking you.
What's wrong with you?

168
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,770
I can't believe she's crying
because of a guy like him.

169
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,940
He must be really rich.

170
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,121
Okay, don't cry.

171
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,131
What's wrong?

172
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,249
When people refer to a beautiful couple,

173
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,721
that means the guy is handsome
and the girl is pretty.

174
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,822
Kyung Seok is handsome.

175
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,607
But I'm not pretty.

176
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,488
We don't look good together.

177
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,775
Did you eat?

178
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:47,178
Yes.

179
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,917
Soo A looks much better
with Kyung Seok than me.

180
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,635
Kyung Seok takes this class.
Why isn't he coming?

181
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:43,513
Kyung Seok, is that you?

182
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:45,695
Yes.

183
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:48,955
How could you move out like this?

184
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,822
What?

185
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,437
Pack your things.

186
00:11:57,522 --> 00:11:59,222
Why? You moved out as well.

187
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,414
I said, pack your things.

188
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,855
It'll take some time to see if
we can do a joint program...

189
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:10,359
...with your school and
provide internships.

190
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:12,772
Meanwhile, we suggested Professor Park...

191
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,722
...that we could pick a few students
who are interested in this field...

192
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:18,621
...and let them take a tour
around our laboratory.

193
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:20,122
That'd be great.

194
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:22,800
It's always good for students
to experience new things.

195
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:26,397
I know they won't be able to learn
much in such a short period of time,

196
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:29,020
but it's always better
to see things in person.

197
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,852
- I'm not going to go home.
- Go home.

198
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:37,933
- No.
- I said, go home.

199
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:40,440
No, I'm never going to go home.

200
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,022
Are you going to live in
that tiny room forever?

201
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:43,422
Of course not. Are you dumb?

202
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:45,401
Then why did you move out?

203
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,922
You're so mean and selfish.

204
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:52,371
You left home as soon as you
found out, so why can't I?

205
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:54,862
Do I need to stay home because
I'm just a little kid?

206
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:57,658
Why didn't you tell me anything?

207
00:12:57,855 --> 00:12:59,089
I hate all of you.

208
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,343
I hate Dad, I hate you,

209
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,727
I hate that woman,

210
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,731
and I also hate myself.

211
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:08,669
I hate everyone.

212
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,777
What am I supposed to do now?

213
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:20,536
I'm the only one who didn't know anything.

214
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:24,213
I said so many mean things to her.

215
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:27,621
Let's go.

216
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,822
I said, I'm not going to go.
I don't want to see Dad.

217
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,415
I'm not taking you there.

218
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,768
Then where?

219
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,556
She'll probably cry out of happiness...

220
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:41,957
...if I tell her that you're coming.

221
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:49,905
I'm sorry that we can't
accept that many students.

222
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:50,988
No, it's okay.

223
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:53,054
Some students already applied
for other activities,

224
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:55,456
and some already are going
abroad, so there won't be a lot.

225
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:58,247
Ms. Na, wait. Ms. Na.

226
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,382
I guess it's nothing bad.

227
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:04,988
How do you know that?

228
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,588
No one runs like that if it's bad news.

229
00:14:07,683 --> 00:14:08,884
People normally run
because they're excited.

230
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,555
- Let's go.
- Okay.

231
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:16,389
You have a dinner meeting with
Ms. Yoon of Korea Cosmetics.

232
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:17,486
Cancel it.

233
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,089
- Then what about Director Shin...
- Cancel it.

234
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,605
- Then...
- Just cancel everything.

235
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,377
No, that's not what I was going to ask.

236
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:25,981
Where should I drive you?

237
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,286
To my house.

238
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:29,214
To your house?

239
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:53,604
I'll just go.

240
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:55,489
Why are you so stubborn?

241
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:57,604
This isn't right. It's too late to...

242
00:14:57,704 --> 00:14:59,516
It's not late at all.

243
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:03,233
We can make things work from now on.

244
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,808
- She might hate me.
- Why would she?

245
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:11,723
I don't know. She might hate me.

246
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,412
Do you know what I said to her?

247
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,386
- I...
- Why would I hate you?

248
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:46,889
Thank you for coming.

249
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:15,707
Excuse me.

250
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:19,424
Do you know a freshman named Do Kyung Hee?

251
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:24,293
What's wrong?

252
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:27,184
Help, there's a pervert here.

253
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:28,992
- Help.
- What, me?

254
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:34,354
Stop right there.

255
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:45,855
Where did he go?

256
00:16:58,622 --> 00:16:59,641
Hello?

257
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,450
Oh, yes.

258
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,428
Thank you so much.

259
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:15,412
Here.

260
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,377
You can stay here.

261
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,689
Tell me if you need anything.

262
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:31,876
You must be tired.

263
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,291
Do you want to wash up?

264
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,160
Yes.

265
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:01,657
Actually, I like Kyung Seok.

266
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,801
Can you help me out?

267
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,123
You look dazed.

268
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:23,142
I'm not.

269
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:31,904
What are you guys doing?

270
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:35,089
Nothing much.

271
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:38,101
How about we gather up today?

272
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:40,388
I'm in.

273
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,916
How about Mi Rae and Kyung Seok?

274
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:59,393
From its interior design
to every single prop,

275
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:00,788
(How about Mi Rae and Kyung Seok?)

276
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,466
I feel so heartbroken.

277
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,970
Kyung Seok, are you listening?

278
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:10,733
- No.
- Coldhearted punk.

279
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:13,629
Right, you wouldn't know how I feel.

280
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,930
I decorated each and every
thing at my precious bar,

281
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,893
and I have to say goodbye to it, but
you wouldn't know how that feels.

282
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:22,083
So why did you call me out instead
of someone who'd understand?

283
00:19:23,992 --> 00:19:25,489
Try to feel pity on me...

284
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,574
...for having no one else but
you to have a drink with.

285
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:38,978
What are you going to do?

286
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,787
I don't know.

287
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,283
If we hang out, should we eat fried
chicken and beer, watch a movie,

288
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,422
go to a karaoke room, or
play indoor baseball?

289
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,706
Indoor baseball?

290
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,536
That sounds good. I'll be
able to blow off steam.

291
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,403
- How about we do it then?
- Deal.

292
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:56,039
We'll go near your house right now.

293
00:19:58,255 --> 00:19:59,763
Let's go, Mi Rae.

294
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,438
What are you doing? Get ready.

295
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:20,542
Even my mom can't go
against my dad's will.

296
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,157
He says he'll get divorced
if she gives me money.

297
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,265
Then work part-time.

298
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,569
Should I ask if I can work part-time here?

299
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:33,001
You should move in to
your mother's house too.

300
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,522
Or get some financial help from her.

301
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:37,120
You can't earn your living
expenses and tuition...

302
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,007
...only by working part-time.

303
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,214
If I can't, I should take
a break or something.

304
00:20:42,414 --> 00:20:45,322
It's good to be realistic,

305
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:48,423
but you should give her a
chance to be your mother.

306
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:57,113
And be good to Mi Rae.

307
00:20:58,096 --> 00:20:59,494
Why are you bringing her up here?

308
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:01,414
If it hadn't been for her, you'd
neither have been able to...

309
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:03,410
...meet her nor make up with her.

310
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:11,374
Hold on.

311
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:16,596
What was that smile just now?

312
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:17,897
What do you mean?

313
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:20,684
I'm sure there's something.

314
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:24,036
You know, I'm quick-witted.

315
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,556
In that sense, let me go to the toilet.

316
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:31,151
Gosh.

317
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,813
Hello.

318
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,415
Hello.

319
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,788
Indoor baseball?

320
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:54,922
Let's see. This is for Hyun Jung.

321
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,249
This is for Mi Rae.

322
00:21:57,355 --> 00:22:00,114
Isn't this for elementary school students?

323
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:06,416
You don't have to hold the end.
Just hold wherever feels comfortable.

324
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:08,589
Instead of trying to swing it hard,

325
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:11,678
just try to hit the ball
when it approaches.

326
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:13,692
Stand in position.

327
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:17,622
Hold the bat.

328
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:19,456
Then swing.

329
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:22,821
(Do Kyung Seok)

330
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:23,811
You're good.

331
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:33,522
Finish it up. Let's go out.

332
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,144
Why?

333
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,089
I have somewhere to be.

334
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:41,789
You want to go home when your
friend is lost in grief?

335
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:42,670
Yes.

336
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:46,595
You'll abandon me here and leave?

337
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:49,289
- Finish your drink.
- Goodness.

338
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,902
It's Jung Boon.

339
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,446
What are you doing here?

340
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:01,327
It's making me feel bad.

341
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:04,347
There are a lot of people who care for me.

342
00:23:05,855 --> 00:23:07,456
Were you consoling him?

343
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:08,753
I'll leave him to you.

344
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,551
I only have this amount of money. Bye.

345
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:13,348
No, we have to clear the table
for other customers. Kyung Seok.

346
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:15,561
Kyung Seok.

347
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:19,668
Were you smooching off
of your younger friend?

348
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,936
- Jung Boon.
- Wait a second.

349
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,037
Who's that?

350
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,648
- It's my boyfriend.
- What?

351
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:30,579
I mean, my male friend.

352
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,304
Oh, okay.

353
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:35,599
Why? Who are you to get surprised by that?

354
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:37,855
When did I do that?

355
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:49,866
- Oh, my!
- It's been hit! Great.

356
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:53,086
Woo Young is very good at this.

357
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,774
I'm no match for him.

358
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:56,477
Totally.

359
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,756
Hey, isn't it nice to be out?

360
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,371
Isn't it? Aren't you happy?

361
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:04,155
Yes, it is nice. It's your turn now.
Go and do a good job.

362
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:05,867
Okay.

363
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:07,889
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

364
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:16,594
What do you think? Aren't I pretty good?

365
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:19,288
I didn't know you could be a show-off.

366
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,789
Gosh, is this fair?

367
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,988
Shall I only use one arm?

368
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,991
You never know though.
Don't speak so soon.

369
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:27,818
You can do it!

370
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,724
- Go for it!
- Go!

371
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:47,270
Hello.

372
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:10,077
Excuse me. Are you a
celebrity by any chance?

373
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:11,688
No, I'm not.

374
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,628
And you're this handsome?

375
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:15,946
My goodness.

376
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:18,623
Wait. Just a second, please.

377
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:22,533
I'm the owner of Charbain Beaute, Jeno.

378
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:23,923
Please visit my salon.

379
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:25,111
If you model for us,

380
00:25:25,255 --> 00:25:27,930
I'll give you a free haircut
and pay you 200 dollars.

381
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,656
Here.

382
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:32,974
Here's how you can get to my salon.
It has my number too.

383
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,689
Could I get your number by any chance?

384
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,385
No.

385
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:40,483
Oh, wait! I'll pay you 250 dollars, then.

386
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:43,688
How about 300 dollars?

387
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:45,897
Hey!

388
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:02,711
My gosh, Mi Rae has a great posture.

389
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:07,989
This is too fast.

390
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:11,089
You can do it, Mi Rae. Go for it!
You got this.

391
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:12,789
Go for it.

392
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,548
What just happened?

393
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:27,647
- Did you see that?
- What happened?

394
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,463
What's going on here?
I might win at this rate.

395
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:40,615
(Indoor Batting Cage)

396
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:45,037
- Great. Nicely done.
- What is happening?

397
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:47,937
I've caught up with you. It's a tie!

398
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:49,471
Are you sure she's never done this before?

399
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:52,531
I told you that she's very athletic.

400
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,090
- My gosh, how can she be so good?
- Oh, my.

401
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:08,089
Amazing.

402
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:10,189
My goodness.

403
00:27:10,273 --> 00:27:13,464
- I'm so impressed.
- I won!

404
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:26,086
Hey, where were you?
We couldn't get a hold of you.

405
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,408
What are you doing here?

406
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:28,913
You said you were going to a batting cage.

407
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:30,489
Oh, I'm glad you came.

408
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:32,655
How about we split up into two teams
for the next round?

409
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,156
The team that loses has to pay for this.

410
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:35,275
Sure.

411
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:37,071
Are you good at baseball?

412
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,867
I wouldn't be here if I weren't good.

413
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,715
Why didn't you answer my call?

414
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,077
I didn't know you called.

415
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:03,363
Good luck!

416
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:15,123
- Oh, my!
- Nice.

417
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:46,821
(One point gained.)

418
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,991
He's good.

419
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:17,398
Oh, my!

420
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,204
Gosh, how can he hit two home runs
right off the bat?

421
00:29:22,288 --> 00:29:23,726
He's really good.

422
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,522
Let's play one more time.

423
00:29:25,622 --> 00:29:27,122
Shall we do it together?

424
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:33,504
What's our total?

425
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,016
- It's 56 dollars.
- Okay.

426
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,412
- We'll pay.
- No, it's okay.

427
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:39,131
I was going to pay for this anyway.
I asked you to meet up with me.

428
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:40,922
But still... Then let's split it in half.

429
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,735
No, it's really okay.

430
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,008
I'll pay with this.

431
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:49,400
You're frugal, but you can
be generous when you spend.

432
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,182
Thank you. We had a great time.

433
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:52,556
You're welcome.

434
00:29:55,954 --> 00:29:57,166
- You can discard the receipt.
- Okay.

435
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:58,740
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

436
00:29:58,855 --> 00:29:59,965
Goodbye.

437
00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:01,768
- Bye.
- Bye.

438
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:09,163
Kyung Seok, is there
anything you can't do?

439
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:12,284
Being so perfect makes it hard
for people to approach you.

440
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:13,284
Aren't I right?

441
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,381
Yes, that's right.

442
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:20,978
I'm sure he has at least one shortcoming.

443
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,658
Hey, are you good at soccer too?

444
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,765
He obviously is, judging
from how he's not answering.

445
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:28,060
No, not really.

446
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:35,159
Mi Rae, why are you all quiet?

447
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:36,958
Did all the batting tire you out?

448
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,850
Oh, she's actually quite competitive.

449
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,556
She's probably upset
because she lost the game.

450
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:46,462
Is that really why you're upset?

451
00:30:50,822 --> 00:30:52,237
Couldn't you have played
it half-heartedly?

452
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:54,343
Mi Rae was so stoked earlier.

453
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:57,961
Mi Rae.

454
00:30:58,654 --> 00:30:59,949
Are you...

455
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,456
...really upset because I beat you?

456
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:07,855
Yes, I was having so much fun.
What is this now?

457
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,755
Mi Rae, Mi Rae...

458
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,722
Gosh, she's just fooling you guys.

459
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,848
You probably couldn't tell
because she's a good actress.

460
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:20,722
Woo Young, I'll be off, then.

461
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:21,893
Hey, I'll see you again soon.

462
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:23,400
Mi Rae, wait up.

463
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,790
I think she's really upset.

464
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:32,766
Did you do something to upset her?

465
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,785
It's important to
experience being broke...

466
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:40,334
...and getting dumped by a girl.

467
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:41,654
Everyone goes through that.

468
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:43,157
That's how you really grow up.

469
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:45,956
You're a full-fledged adult now.
You're all grown up.

470
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,653
You can really live on your own now.

471
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,934
You said Kyung Seok isn't your type.

472
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:07,921
Yes, what about it?

473
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,689
I should wash these.

474
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:14,321
Then why are you being
like that to Kyung Seok?

475
00:32:14,722 --> 00:32:16,197
What did I do?

476
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:20,146
Like you said, I'm just
annoyed because he beat me.

477
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,675
I'm not an idiot.

478
00:32:25,147 --> 00:32:28,245
You have feelings for
Kyung Seok, don't you?

479
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:34,466
Hey.

480
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:39,111
Be honest, will you?

481
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:51,289
You see,

482
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:53,855
I hate being talked about.

483
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:55,682
I hate it so much.

484
00:32:55,968 --> 00:32:59,590
I say that because it's never
been about anything good.

485
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:03,644
People will say that a
plastic surgery monster...

486
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,721
...has a crush on that handsome guy.

487
00:33:06,722 --> 00:33:09,318
I can't put up with all the
bad-mouthing and gossiping.

488
00:33:10,784 --> 00:33:12,683
I just want to live a quiet life.

489
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:30,307
Kyung Hee has moved into my mom's place.

490
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:32,428
I see.

491
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:34,329
Hey.

492
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:38,981
Why are you angry?

493
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:41,493
What? I'm not angry.

494
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:42,595
Then why are you acting this way?

495
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,988
How was I supposed to react?
Was I supposed to...

496
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:48,865
...get all excited and comment on
how happy your mom must be?

497
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:54,788
Hey, guys.

498
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:04,234
I did an interview
yesterday, and I passed.

499
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:06,122
I heard you introduced her to this job.

500
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:10,629
Look at these two beautiful ladies.

501
00:34:10,722 --> 00:34:12,778
We won't need to decorate the
interior thanks to you two.

502
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:16,105
They're not materials.

503
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:20,081
What are you saying?

504
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:21,983
Soo A, let's go.

505
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,580
I'll see you later.

506
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,594
Did something happen
between you and Soo A?

507
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,779
No.

508
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,990
Did she say something
about us being friends?

509
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,107
No.

510
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:51,323
I guess she did say something.

511
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:56,738
Why is he so quick-witted?

512
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:03,349
Can you let me eat with
Kyung Seok in private later?

513
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:31,822
(Ballot Box)

514
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:40,922
Hello. Thank you.

515
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:45,022
Hello. Hi.

516
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:46,774
Hello.

517
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,026
Hi.

518
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:52,689
I didn't tell you this yesterday
because I was afraid...

519
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:55,431
...that you might get angry
and not be able to sleep.

520
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:57,830
But Kyung Hee moved into Ms. Na's place.

521
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,332
Why are you telling me that now?

522
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:02,438
I would've slept better if
you told me that last night.

523
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:03,321
Pardon?

524
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:07,492
It's safer for her to be there.

525
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:14,523
Yes, you're right. It is safer there.

526
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,516
Did you sleep well?

527
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,340
Come sit down.

528
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:22,993
Okay.

529
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:31,296
I haven't cooked in a while,
but I made what I could.

530
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:33,976
Did I cook too many stuff?

531
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:36,198
No.

532
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:41,044
Thank you for the meal.

533
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:55,645
It doesn't taste good, does it?

534
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:58,758
It tastes okay.

535
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:02,979
You don't have to lie.
It's obvious that I can't cook.

536
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,189
I can't really taste food,

537
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:08,704
so I rarely cook for myself.

538
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:12,504
But I tried my best by
searching the recipes online.

539
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:20,222
It's okay. You don't need
to force feed yourself.

540
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:23,389
It doesn't taste so bad.

541
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:28,902
And this tastes better.

542
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:42,190
What should we eat?

543
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:44,276
There's a nice pork cutlet place nearby,

544
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:46,183
and a restaurant that sells
cold noodles and dumplings.

545
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,988
Soo A, what do you prefer?

546
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:49,788
I want...

547
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:51,296
Hey, Hae Sung.

548
00:37:52,978 --> 00:37:54,488
Can you work during lunchtime?

549
00:37:54,598 --> 00:37:56,602
We have more customers than usual today.

550
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:57,903
Sure.

551
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:00,963
I'd like one more volunteer.

552
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:12,868
I can eat lunch a little later.

553
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:15,856
Okay. Thank you. Let's go.

554
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:29,738
I'm going to order pork cutlet.
What about you?

555
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:31,868
Me too.

556
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:34,855
- Two pork cutlets, please.
- Okay.

557
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:40,385
I really like the working
environment here.

558
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,089
The people are nice as well.

559
00:38:42,293 --> 00:38:43,698
Why did you come here?

560
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,623
I heard you guys are working together,

561
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,723
so I figured it'd be nice to join.

562
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:52,018
Why are you so interested in us?

563
00:38:54,021 --> 00:38:54,986
What do you mean?

564
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:57,294
I know you're not that slow-witted.

565
00:38:58,288 --> 00:38:59,091
What?

566
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:01,399
As for this product,

567
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:04,990
the sink is facing the
living room, not the wall.

568
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,480
So it enables you to talk to your kids...

569
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,189
or watch TV as you do the dishes.

570
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,948
And on both sides...

571
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,964
I know you didn't really like me at first.

572
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:18,660
But we resolved our misunderstanding,

573
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,438
so I thought we were slowly
becoming close friends.

574
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:23,020
Was that not the case for you?

575
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:24,838
That's enough.

576
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,731
I want to be good friends with you.

577
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:30,391
I know you don't like me.

578
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:35,987
What do you gain from doing this?

579
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,288
I don't understand.

580
00:39:41,192 --> 00:39:42,981
Are you going to act like you
don't know anything again?

581
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:44,288
Kyung Seok.

582
00:39:45,473 --> 00:39:47,907
Why do you always think
of me so negatively?

583
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:49,605
Because that's how I perceive you.

584
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,297
That's sad.

585
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,582
I only behaved the way I did because
I really wanted to be your friend.

586
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:02,165
But I guess you think I'm
pretentious and a liar.

587
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:06,320
If you're annoyed because
it feels as if...

588
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:08,422
...I'm clinging onto you,

589
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:10,422
I get it.

590
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:14,218
I won't come to work
starting from tomorrow.

591
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:22,591
Enjoy your meal.

592
00:40:37,564 --> 00:40:38,478
Mi Rae.

593
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:41,068
What's your relationship with Kyung Seok?

594
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,858
- Pardon?
- I mean,

595
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,569
you guys look really close.

596
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:47,257
We're just friends.

597
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:49,840
Then is Soo A his girlfriend?

598
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:51,224
No.

599
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:53,648
Are you dating anyone?

600
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:55,428
No.

601
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,730
Eat up.

602
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:05,144
The seventh local election will soon...

603
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:07,037
come to an end at 6pm.

604
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,622
- Did you vote?
- Yes.

605
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:13,110
Many young people participate
actively in voting these days.

606
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:14,212
It's a good thing.

607
00:41:14,312 --> 00:41:15,520
The current status.

608
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:17,489
I wonder who'll win for Gangnam-gu.

609
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,705
Let's first look into the
overall voting rate.

610
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:21,897
Everyone's so crazy about Gangnam.

611
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:24,989
Gangnam should always set
a good example for everything.

612
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:27,955
People call my daughter "Gangnam Beauty".

613
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:30,555
And that makes me more
interested in Gangnam.

614
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:33,355
Now, let's move onto the
local voting rates.

615
00:41:33,448 --> 00:41:35,237
She's my daughter.

616
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:37,222
Let's check out the district
with the highest voting rate.

617
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:39,037
Daejeon City has a voting
rate of 64 percent.

618
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,216
It exceeded 60 percent.

619
00:41:42,138 --> 00:41:44,550
That's the estimated amount
of votes for that area.

620
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:48,456
Now, let's move onto the traffic.

621
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,382
In the morning, it will...

622
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:58,617
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

623
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,215
Excuse me.

624
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:06,108
Yes.

625
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:09,900
I want a Gangnam-style haircut.

626
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:12,855
What are you talking about?

627
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:14,343
What kind of style is that?

628
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,623
You're the hairdresser,
so you should know.

629
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:20,367
But why do you want that all of a sudden?

630
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:22,690
Has something gotten into you?

631
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:25,875
Well, to be honest, yes.

632
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:30,855
People call Mi Rae "Gangnam Beauty".

633
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,355
And I kind of want people to
think she takes after me.

634
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:36,855
She's tall and slim just like you.

635
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:39,717
Bring her here sometime.
Let's see how much she's changed.

636
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:43,599
Okay, I'll bring her over next time.

637
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:52,888
It must be tiring to be so good-looking.

638
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:56,920
It seems like Soo A has a thing for you.

639
00:42:57,188 --> 00:43:00,019
But do you prefer girls
like Mi Rae than Soo A?

640
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:04,122
I'd definitely choose Soo A over Mi Rae.

641
00:43:07,722 --> 00:43:11,317
But then again, some people
care more about the physique.

642
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,851
If a girl had Soo A's face and
Mi Rae's body, she'd be perfect.

643
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,280
I didn't get to eat with Kyung Seok.

644
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:31,843
What?

645
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,972
He must've felt uncomfortable
to eat with me without you.

646
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:49,922
By the way,

647
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,622
I'm curious about something.

648
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:57,328
Mi Rae seems like she's done plastic
surgeries on every part of her face.

649
00:43:57,455 --> 00:43:59,137
Is her chest fake too?

650
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:02,031
I can't tell just by looking at it.

651
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:08,156
Hey.

652
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,179
Are you crazy?

653
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:14,151
Have you gone insane?

654
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:21,688
Scumbag.

655
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:23,885
What's wrong with what I asked?

656
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:26,471
What's wrong with talking
about her plastic surgeries?

657
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:28,647
Let me go.

658
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:37,822
Be quiet.

659
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:43,484
Kyung Seok, don't.

660
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:47,487
And I'm not interested in
someone who looks so cheap.

661
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:51,774
- Kyung Seok.
- Gosh.

662
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,579
Goodness.

663
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,282
Kyung Seok.

664
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:58,881
- Kyung Seok.
- Kyung Seok.

665
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,601
- You punk.
- Kyung Seok.

666
00:45:00,688 --> 00:45:03,047
- Kyung Seok.
- What's wrong with you?

667
00:45:03,757 --> 00:45:05,456
This punk hit me first.

668
00:45:05,557 --> 00:45:07,555
I got beaten up by him.

669
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:09,338
If you have hit back at least once,

670
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:11,661
it's both to blame though you may
have a different degree of charges.

671
00:45:12,155 --> 00:45:13,970
You all seem like students,

672
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,875
so talk it out and make up.

673
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,988
I said I wouldn't...

674
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:22,887
...unless he bows his head and apologizes.

675
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:26,389
Unless he bows and apologizes sincerely,

676
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:27,904
I'll sue him.

677
00:45:27,988 --> 00:45:31,173
It seems like you've hit him a lot more,

678
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:33,455
so why don't you apologize
and settle it out?

679
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:41,127
I'm sorry.

680
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:46,543
I should've killed him so that
he couldn't even run his mouth.

681
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:51,137
Has he gone crazy or what?

682
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:52,843
- Sit down.
- Hey.

683
00:45:52,943 --> 00:45:55,488
Do you want to be an ex-convict?

684
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:01,400
You jerk.

685
00:46:01,904 --> 00:46:04,528
Shouldn't you be apologizing to me?

686
00:46:04,837 --> 00:46:06,915
If you have at least the
slightest sense of guilt,

687
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:09,227
let him go.

688
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:13,458
I don't want to.

689
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:14,858
What?

690
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:18,740
I was going to tell you,

691
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,750
but he tried to hit on me too.

692
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:25,730
Don't worry. The company will
take care of this matter.

693
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:27,126
Go back to work.

694
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:28,441
Okay.

695
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:32,332
I should've fired him sooner.

696
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:40,056
Yes, I thought the room could
use a bit more decoration.

697
00:46:40,822 --> 00:46:43,042
Tell me if there's a
specific design in mind.

698
00:46:44,255 --> 00:46:46,655
Okay, bye.

699
00:46:57,321 --> 00:47:02,989
("Na Hye Sung Appointed
as the CEO of Kelun")

700
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:06,506
Are you looking for something?

701
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:08,617
I'm just looking around.

702
00:47:08,717 --> 00:47:12,123
Take a look around and tell
me if you have any questions.

703
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:19,883
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

704
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:22,996
Doesn't a guy named
Do Kyung Seok work here?

705
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:24,894
Kyung Seok?

706
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:29,880
Yes, but he's not here right now.
What's the matter?

707
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:33,285
I'm his mom. Did he go somewhere?

708
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:35,589
Oh, hello.

709
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:39,189
I'm Hyun Soo A, his friend in college.

710
00:47:40,288 --> 00:47:41,399
Is that right?

711
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:45,292
But he's...

712
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:49,599
Why? Did something happen?

713
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,107
Yes.

714
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:55,616
He was taken to a police station
because he got into a fight.

715
00:47:55,716 --> 00:47:56,425
What?

716
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:59,013
Why would he?

717
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:00,846
Whom did he fight with?

718
00:48:01,832 --> 00:48:03,915
With another part-timer here,

719
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:08,333
he got into a fight because
of a girl named Kang Mi Rae.

720
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:09,709
Mi Rae?

721
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:11,734
Do you know her?

722
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,402
Yes.

723
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:16,428
She lives in Kyung Seok's neighborhood.

724
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,191
I see.

725
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,384
How impressive, Mi Rae.

726
00:48:23,488 --> 00:48:26,504
Do you know which police station it is?

727
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:28,700
Please give me a minute.

728
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:35,414
Good.

729
00:48:35,808 --> 00:48:38,389
I've hurt you with words,
so I'll apologize the same way.

730
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:41,489
Mi Rae, I'm sorry, satisfied?

731
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:43,886
That's not an attitude of
someone who's apologizing.

732
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,683
This punk hit me, so he should kneel down.

733
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:49,257
Or let me punch him 10 times.

734
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:52,060
All right. Do as you want
because I'll go by the law too.

735
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,874
What?

736
00:48:56,388 --> 00:48:59,199
Hello, sir. This is Mi Rae.

737
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:03,986
I'm still at the police station,
but I have a favor to ask you.

738
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:06,388
What?

739
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:11,301
I see.

740
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:14,238
Okay, thank you.

741
00:49:17,707 --> 00:49:19,229
He said you're fired.

742
00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:22,652
The manager says he'll testify...

743
00:49:22,736 --> 00:49:25,857
...how you sexually
harassed me if he has to.

744
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:28,755
Should I file a lawsuit?

745
00:49:28,855 --> 00:49:30,232
No.

746
00:49:30,355 --> 00:49:31,879
Hold on.

747
00:49:31,963 --> 00:49:34,467
What are you going to do?

748
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,081
Kyung Seok.

749
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:45,932
Do you hit people?

750
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:49,655
Ms. Na.

751
00:49:50,964 --> 00:49:52,749
I went to the store and heard about it.

752
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:57,053
How could you not even call me
in this kind of situation?

753
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:06,555
Next is the exit poll in Daejin.

754
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,356
66.7 percent for Candidate
Number One Do Sang Won.

755
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:13,555
- Yes!
- 23.2 percent for...

756
00:50:13,658 --> 00:50:16,589
- Do Sang Won.
- Do Sang Won.

757
00:50:16,688 --> 00:50:19,879
- Do Sang Won.
- Thank you.

758
00:50:19,988 --> 00:50:21,496
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
- Thank you.

759
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:23,755
Now, take some rest in your house
while they count all the votes.

760
00:50:23,873 --> 00:50:25,278
All right.

761
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:28,555
I was worried your children might
cause trouble before the election,

762
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:29,771
but I'm glad they didn't.

763
00:50:29,855 --> 00:50:31,766
I didn't raise them like that.

764
00:50:31,889 --> 00:50:33,760
They wouldn't cause trouble.

765
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,954
- Sure thing.
- Mayor of Daejin,

766
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:36,555
- See you.
- Do Sang Won.

767
00:50:36,655 --> 00:50:42,538
- Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang Won.
- Mayor of Daejin, Do Sang Won.

768
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,722
- Mayor of Daejin...
- Mayor of Daejin...

769
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,617
He did deserve a beating.

770
00:50:48,722 --> 00:50:52,480
Still, you shouldn't punish him...

771
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:54,204
...in a way which could harm you as well.

772
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:57,496
Mi Rae must've gotten hurt a lot.

773
00:50:57,983 --> 00:50:59,380
Are you okay?

774
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:00,789
Yes?

775
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:02,687
Yes.

776
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:04,696
You must've been really startled.

777
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:13,482
I thought I'd be okay...

778
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:16,399
...if I thought I was.

779
00:51:20,048 --> 00:51:22,488
I guess I wasn't okay.

780
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:31,653
Mi Rae.

781
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,685
You haven't done anything wrong today.

782
00:51:34,866 --> 00:51:37,365
People like him are wrong
for having such thoughts.

783
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:42,680
Right.

784
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:50,223
Please excuse me now.

785
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:54,356
I'm okay.

786
00:51:58,755 --> 00:52:00,489
Don't go alone.

787
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:03,756
Let's eat and go together.

788
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,133
Right, Mi Rae.

789
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:07,956
Go home together.

790
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:13,756
Let's go.

791
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:24,904
Hey, Kyung Hee.

792
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:28,214
It looks like you'll have to
have dinner alone. I'm sorry.

793
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:31,254
There's some fried rice in the fridge.

794
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:33,861
I'm sorry.

795
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,075
Ta-da.

796
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:44,771
Yes, that's right.

797
00:52:44,855 --> 00:52:47,389
I had no choice but to do this
because I don't have my mask today.

798
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:50,953
And I won't be eating in my room today.

799
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:52,450
As you can see, I'm outside now.

800
00:52:52,555 --> 00:52:55,362
I'll host my show while
enjoying this night view here.

801
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:57,504
What's for dinner today?

802
00:52:58,688 --> 00:53:00,025
I'll have fried rice.

803
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,103
This fried rice is special.

804
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:07,141
My mom made it.

805
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:11,026
Then I'll dig in now.

806
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:13,633
I'll take a big spoonful and...

807
00:53:18,979 --> 00:53:21,372
This is my first time tasting
my mom's fried rice.

808
00:53:22,355 --> 00:53:23,638
I'd rate this...

809
00:53:26,145 --> 00:53:27,748
100 out of 100.

810
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:33,989
There's a lot of meat in it.

811
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,289
There are raisins too.

812
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,289
Thank you for the dinner.

813
00:55:11,077 --> 00:55:13,669
Mi Rae, could you wait for us in the car?

814
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:16,629
I have to talk to Kyung Seok
about something.

815
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,035
Sure.

816
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:27,581
You got yourself in trouble,

817
00:55:28,002 --> 00:55:30,802
but I could act as your guardian for
the first time because of that.

818
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:33,288
I must say, it doesn't feel that bad.

819
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:37,423
From now on, make sure you
call me if anything happens.

820
00:55:37,522 --> 00:55:39,909
- Okay.
- And...

821
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,227
about your tuition...

822
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:45,822
Could I take care of it for you?

823
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,723
It's not like I'm a stranger to you.

824
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,019
I'm...

825
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:52,833
...your mom after all.

826
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:55,426
I hope you let me pay it.

827
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:02,274
Okay.

828
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:04,357
Seriously?

829
00:56:05,622 --> 00:56:08,447
I was so anxious, thinking
you'd say no right way.

830
00:56:14,054 --> 00:56:16,321
- Thanks.
- For what?

831
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:18,501
I'll...

832
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:21,507
...make sure I pay you back.

833
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:33,722
Thanks for today.

834
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:37,932
But from now on, don't punch
people because of me.

835
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:40,950
Don't worry.

836
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:45,844
I'm not mad at you.

837
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,761
I'm just frustrated that all
I can do is punch people.

838
00:56:53,889 --> 00:56:56,583
I don't understand why those
jerks have to gossip about you.

839
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:02,166
You must still be all shaken up.

840
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,648
You should go in.

841
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,355
Okay, thanks.

842
00:57:10,355 --> 00:57:12,651
You should get going. I'll head in, then.

843
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:19,068
Mi Rae.

844
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:35,448
If...

845
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,488
...something like that
happens to you again,

846
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:46,155
I'll get involved without
punching someone.

847
00:57:49,355 --> 00:57:50,665
That will be okay, right?

848
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:58,822
If you keep saying things like that,

849
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:02,700
I'll get the wrong idea.

850
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:05,609
About what?

851
00:58:07,506 --> 00:58:09,389
Just like how I'm feeling, you might...

852
00:58:16,755 --> 00:58:17,960
Never mind.

853
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:21,156
Get going. I'm going to head in.

854
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:34,260
Do you have...

855
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:40,730
...any feelings for me?

856
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:42,643
What?

857
00:59:07,388 --> 00:59:11,575
(My ID is Gangnam Beauty)

858
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:13,289
Mi Rae, are you free on Wednesday?

859
00:59:13,393 --> 00:59:15,011
Just the two of us. I have
something to tell you.

860
00:59:15,121 --> 00:59:17,588
If you think that we can go
back to how we were before...

861
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:18,900
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

862
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,087
Is something bothering you?

863
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:22,222
I think I'm just scared.

864
00:59:22,332 --> 00:59:24,789
He's way too good for me.

865
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:25,961
He's too perfect.

866
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:28,589
Hey, I told you that enough is enough.

867
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:30,876
Why must you mess everything
up for no reason?

868
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,638
You still don't feel anything?

869
00:59:32,722 --> 00:59:35,229
If you're having a hard
time because of me,

870
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:36,924
I shouldn't do it.

871
00:59:37,024 --> 00:59:39,239
But I'll wait for you.
